[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.620]
and i got to meet vanity

[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.400]
and i got to touch her and talk to her

[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.500]
and you're like

[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.860]
what is this toucher?

[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.620]
what is that mean?

[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.760]
i got to put my hands on her

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.780]
under arms and her shoulders

[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.880]
and so i was cool

[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.980]
i was cool

[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.000]
i was cool i didn't lose it

[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.380]
i get accused of all of this

[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.980]
trolling and all of this crap

[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.960]
which is a bunch of psychotic garbage

[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.900]
and every time some young twinkie comes in here

[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.520]
or you meet them in a hallway somewhere

[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.940]
you're all over them

[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.360]
like stink on them

[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.360]
well but this was vanity

[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.920]
i mean this was vanity

[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.680]
and it was humble

[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.860]
it doesn't make any difference

[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.620]
whether it's vanity

[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.180]
how about that bathing suit girl

[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.080]
whose boyfriend was standing in a control room

[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]
while you were fondling her?

[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.880]
very similar

[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.300]
yeah

[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.380]
i wonder if you guys are going to play this

[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.000]
from our wren

[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.220]
and talk to her

[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.360]
you want to find out?

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.360]

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.360]

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.360]

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:02.360]

[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.020]
ha ha ha

[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.520]
what is this?

[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.000]
hmmm

[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.080]
trust me

[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.620]
you want to find out?

[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.900]
what is this?

[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.480]
I can't get any.

[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.820]
Oh, and guess what's starting tomorrow?

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.320]
Tomorrow's the party.

[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.640]
No, for once, for as little as I know about movies, and I'm always forgetting the names

[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.880]
of movies and the people.

[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.920]
And I just don't have a mind for it, okay?

[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.220]
I know what you're talking about.

[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.400]
Yeah, and I predicted this after the first one was out and everybody laughed at me.

[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.340]
I said, there's going to be a sequel to this movie.

[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.200]
And everybody thought I was nuts.

[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.240]
Eddie and the cruisers, part two.

[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.180]
Eddie lives.

[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:43.940]
Yeah.

[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.580]
Yeah, subtitled.

[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.920]
Eddie lives.

[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.000]

[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.260]
With Michael Paray.

[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:47.500]
Yes.

[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.620]
Who if he would keep his mouth shut, looks great.

[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.260]
But once he starts talking, he's like, he's like a goofball, isn't he?

[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.600]
If he would just shut up, man, he looks great.

[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.160]
But just don't speak.

[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.180]
And don't sing, because he doesn't really sing in there anyway.

[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.200]
It's that, it's that real ugly slime ball.

[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.580]
I'd say, what's that group that sings all the music in that movie?

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.260]
Oh, you know who I'm talking about.

[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:08.820]
Yeah, of course.

[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.580]
Oh, I can't think of his name.

[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.160]
He's a real thin and ugly and, yeah, beaver cleaver is something.

[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.120]
Beaver Brown.

[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.560]
Yeah, beaver Brown.

[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.120]
Beaver Brown.

[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.580]
Bands or trowel.

[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:22.600]
Beaver.

[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.500]
What is it?

[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.580]
What is it?

[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:24.880]

[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.780]
You look at that.

[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.720]
Brown, beaver Brown, band.

[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.220]
Yeah, but what's the lead singer?

[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.100]
What is his name?

[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.220]
Oh, he is so mea, man.

[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.300]
Come on.

[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.000]
You can do it.

[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.720]
Isn't there an ad in there?

[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.360]
It's right there.

[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:37.940]
No, you did.

[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.700]
It's a big ad.

[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.840]
How could you miss it with Michael Paray standing there?

[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.320]
John Cafferty in the paper.

[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.120]
John Cafferty in the beaver Brown band.

[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.560]
That's it.

[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.880]
He is so, I mean, he gives no meaning to the word ugly, okay?

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.420]
And Michael Paray is lip-syncing all the music in that first movie and you think that he's

[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:54.660]
singing.

[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.600]
Of course, you know he's not, because he couldn't sing as well as a paper sack probably,

[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:57.860]
right?

[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.880]
And then you see the video and it's John Cafferty singing and you think, jeez, come on

[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.320]
already.

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.620]
Cut me a break, as Stan would say.

[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.000]
Wouldn't they?

[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.680]
Yeah.

[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.420]
You remember Stan.

[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.100]
He's down here.

[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.900]
Okay, here's a call from a Coral Gable, hello.

[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.420]
Oh, jeez.

[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.700]
They got Batman fever out there in this audience.

[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.580]
They're probably putting a Batman logo on their driver's license as we speak.

[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.700]
Nobody would do that.

[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.400]
Well, nobody.

[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.160]
Miami, hello.

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:30.920]
Are you good?

[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:31.640]
Okay.

[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.640]
This town needs to get a ball.

[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.520]
Yeah, okay.

[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.140]
And I think you would be a good start.

[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.940]
It sounded like it's a fact that sounded like he was giving himself one with a receiver,

[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.920]
didn't it?

[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.600]
Why?

[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.300]
I'd get it out of there, pal.

[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.200]
You never know what kind of nasty diseases you can get on that receiver.

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.700]
Palm Beach is gone.

[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.180]
Boy, what happened all of a sudden?

[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.460]
I played like five notes of the beat.

[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.220]
Well, I'm going to play the whole thing then, screw them.

[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.680]
Okay, it's one of my favorite records.

[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.380]
I'm scared.

[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.460]
I'm scared, but we worked at Zeta for a year.

[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.680]
So we learned that it doesn't have to be recognizable to be great.

[00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.100]
Okay.

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.460]
All the obscure cuts all the time with Tom Robinson on Zeta for.

[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.940]
How you doing, Tom?

[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.200]
I don't want to play that.

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:15.980]
Okay, 22.

[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.060]
Well, I'm going to take it home and listen to it in the car.

[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.160]
I do like that album.

[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.140]
It's a great, if you like to beat boys, a spirit of America's the name of the album.

[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.180]
It's got all these great dance dance and breakaway and hush-a-bye and little Honda.

[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.600]
And 409.

[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.020]
And of course, one that I would have just died for.

[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.080]
Do you want to go?

[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]
Oh, why?

[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.040]
Oh, why?

[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.000]
I should be there right now.

[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.880]
Right, either now?

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.420]
Lastly, I guess.

[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.400]
I would have been there last week.

[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.460]
What a bunch of crap.

[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.540]
And then of course, our favorite for Boy Gary.

[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.980]
What I'd go for.

[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.620]
Okay.

[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.760]
He is such a jerk.

[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.080]
It's pathetic.

[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.880]
I've had a lot of idiotic conversations with a lot of so-called management people in

[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.320]
his business.

[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.880]
But I go in there yesterday.

[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.320]
Would legitimate beefs and problems that need to be attended to that you think he would

[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.020]
be concerned about?

[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:11.920]
Oh, I can't do it.

[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.720]
I just can't do anybody.

[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.580]
I can't wait to do it.

[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.640]
Just to go away, leave me alone.

[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.200]
Let me sit here.

[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.880]
It looked like an idiot.

[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.140]
Which is what he does best, man.

[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:19.660]
He really.

[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.340]
God, he is helpless and hopeless.

[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.980]
And when he brings his clone in from Louisville, man, is that going to be, talk about the blind

[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:27.700]
leading the blind?

[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.680]
That will be great.

[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.260]
Miami, hello.

[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.140]
It's a sex-stomach lady, homely blind death.

[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.060]
And that invitation you give off to Ruth Eve?

[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.460]
Yeah, okay.

[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.240]
Miami, hello.

[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:42.960]
Hi.

[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.240]
She's the same one I called before.

[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:44.560]
Yes.

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.940]
I'm here.

[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.500]
How are you?

[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.180]
Okay.

[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.720]
I wanted to tell you where the green stuff comes from.

[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.460]
Oh, gee.

[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.860]
Now we're getting into the heavy-girded.

[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.600]
Where it comes from?

[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.700]
Yeah, it's produced by the mucus glands.

[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.860]
Oh, what are the other ones they got up?

[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.320]
That would be a very good thing.

[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.620]
Wouldn't that be a great thing for a rock group, the mucus glands, right up?

[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:06.780]

[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.460]
Mucocity.

[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.020]
Yeah.

[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.000]
The mucus glands, and they could be like the California raisins.

[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.640]
They could be like these little globs of green mucus with little legs dancing.

[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.620]
Can you see that animated rock group?

[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.480]
Oh, I can see it.

[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.540]
The music glands.

[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.020]
Okay, go ahead.

[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.540]
Okay.

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:28.960]
I wonder why we would be discussing ucocity and Steve on the same show.

[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.280]
Well, there are a lot of people between two and six who have that heavy green stuff come

[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.380]
just automatically flowing out of their system.

[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.340]
Mm-hmm.

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.060]
I have one asked.

[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.660]
When you see him again.

[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.580]
You haven't been hanging out with Henry today, have you?

[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.820]
Because you sound like you and Henry have been having a little party today with grandma

[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.500]
Boone maybe.

[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.440]
No, I've been having a party here alone.

[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.040]
Okay.

[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.120]
Well, yeah, that's obvious.

[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.260]
I'm just listening to you.

[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:51.500]
Yeah.

[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.240]
Okay.

[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.880]
The next time you see Steve, look real close.

[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.940]
No, I don't want to look real close.

[00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.820]
Oh, give it a try.

[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.520]
No thanks.

[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.660]
Not for me.

[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.200]
Okay, bottoms up.

[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.140]
143 at W.I.D.

[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.380]
A little note here from Nick.

[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.860]
This could be something really exciting.

[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.180]
It says, please have Dave Caprita call me.

[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.000]
I don't have Caprita.

[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.380]
I don't know how to get a hold of Caprita.

[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:17.780]
What?

[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]
Caprita is going to call me.

[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:20.720]
Okay.

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.160]
Well, isn't this great?

[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.360]
Just call me Mr. Message.

[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:23.860]
Okay.

[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.800]
I should start charging by the love of that going on.

[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.180]
I have Caprita call his guy.

[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.180]
Okay, I'll keep the thing nailed to my knees.

[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.180]
So in case he calls at the house, I'll have it handy.

[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.260]
Miami.

[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.660]
Hello.

[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.260]
Yep.

[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.240]
Waiting to talk to Neil.

[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.200]
Okay.

[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.300]
Hello.

[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.100]
Hello.

[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:40.660]
Yeah.

[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.180]
Yeah.

[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.180]
Waiting to talk to Neil.

[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:42.640]
Okay.

[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:43.980]
Hello.

[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.500]
Okay.

[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.260]
Neil, how you do?

[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.940]
So you hadn't realized that?

[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.700]
Hey, I'd have kept going right till 2 o'clock.

[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.720]
Hey, let me tell you something.

[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.000]
Yeah.

[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.040]
I can't believe this is like 13 seconds.

[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.460]
Well, he put you right on.

[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.240]
Well, I think we had the number one from the last time up there.

[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.220]
It was probably a mistake.

[00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.760]
You want to go back on hold?

[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.420]
No, no, no.

[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.720]
In fact, let me tell you what I call.

[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:06.080]
I'm the call who called in yesterday about maybe we don't want this to go on the air.

[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.840]
About people off.

[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.120]
What do you mean by that?

[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.500]
Okay.

[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.120]
When I asked about the pack.

[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.420]
Well, I don't want to go through that again.

[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.060]
Okay, 144 at WID.

[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.340]
There's a guy just won't give up.

[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:17.680]
You know what?

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:17.940]
Yeah.

[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.420]
I'm not going to go through all that again.

[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.160]
Port Lauderdale.

[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:21.440]
Hello.

[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.360]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.780]
About all this flam.

[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.320]
You know what's green and shoots a gun?

[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.340]
Okay.

[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.360]
Let's go to Miami.

[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:28.860]
Hello.

[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:29.460]
Hi.

[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.200]
Neil.

[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.680]
Yeah.

[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.980]
Did you see your Steve Kane show last night?

[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.400]
No, I don't listen to Steve show.

[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.560]
It's a little bit too racy for me.

[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.020]
Did you hear Steve Kane show last night?

[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.920]
Let me say it again.

[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:42.260]
No.

[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.140]
It had the publisher of screw magazine on what a douchebag.

[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.560]
Yeah.

[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.080]
Who the publisher or Steve?

[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:50.880]
No.

[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.040]
How old are you?

[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.360]
12.

[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:53.820]
12.

[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.280]
Would you probably subscribe to it, right?

[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.200]
Right?

[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.000]
No.

[00:15:59.320 --> 00:15:59.700]
Okay.

[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.500]
Well, listen, have a wonderful life now.

[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.420]
Hold on.

[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.500]
You want to make it to 13?

[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.320]
Well, you call my dog's last, be a douchebag.

[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.500]
Your dog is called Flash.

[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.320]
Get out of here, pal.

[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.620]
Now we got a young purple runner.

[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.280]
Get out.

[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.280]
145 at W.I.D.

[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.760]
Boy, Steve is just, oh man, he is psychotic.

[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:19.280]
Look at that.

[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.520]
His hair is like all rumpel, like rumpel still skinned.

[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.420]
And he's just going to let his hair down today.

[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.240]
Phil says, let it ride starts tomorrow.

[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.840]
The movie filmed at Haya Leah.

[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.560]
Yeah.

[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.740]
Let it ride.

[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:37.600]
Yes.

[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.080]
I'll tell Phil, we don't care.

[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.480]
Okay?

[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.320]
No, it's just a joke, Phil.

[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.260]
Is it start to my Richard Dreyfus movie?

[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:43.580]
Yes.

[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:43.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.920]
I know which one that is.

[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.840]
Well, anyway, the big story is Eddie and the Cruises.

[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.440]
What is it called?

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.160]
Eddie lives.

[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.220]
Eddie and the Cruises 2.

[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.000]
Eddie lives.

[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:52.820]
Yeah.

[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.140]
And I predicted that.

[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.600]
That's about the only thing I've had right in the last five years.

[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.200]
But as soon as I saw that movie the first time, I said, this begs for a sequel because at the

[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.500]
end there where he looked in the, he was watching the movie screen, you know?

[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.700]
You know, this is the one.

[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.160]
And Capri isn't the so in Capri took a few days.

[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.120]
Yeah, Capri isn't it.

[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:10.680]
Let it ride.

[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.100]
And Terry Gars and.

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.420]
Yeah.

[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.460]
And maybe that's why this guy wants to talk to Capri to Mr. Message there.

[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.020]
Mm-hmm.

[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.280]
Okay, 146 at WIOD.

[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.420]
A final reminder that these are the final days and weeks.

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.260]
I guess I went into the 90s.

[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:24.600]
Come out.

[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.240]
Does anybody know?

[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.480]
They keep coming out earlier.

[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:26.920]
Huh?

[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:27.580]
Real soon.

[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.340]
Earlier every year.

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.100]
In fact, I'd like to know.

[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.640]
This has nothing to do with Toyota Hollywood.

[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.320]
But I'd like to know when the 90 vets are coming out because I'm going to trade my 88 in

[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.200]
for the new 1990.

[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.680]
Yeah.

[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.320]
Good.

[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.300]
I don't need to trade my super in because my super is like almost brand new.

[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:45.400]
But anyway, speaking of super, you can get a brand new 89 super with leather interior power

[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.700]
seats.

[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.120]
A spiffy out just an outstanding automobile.

[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.220]
19,800 right now at Toyota of Hollywood and take it from me.

[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.980]
The super gives you the best of both worlds.

[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.720]
It's got a sports car look and a limousine ride.

[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.300]
I mean, it is sensational.

[00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.800]
It rides as smooth as glass.

[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.820]
It handles fantastic.

[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.760]
And it looks to do.

[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.780]
I have to tell you a sharp as a rocket.

[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.160]
Okay.

[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.960]
And 89 Corolla Ford or 89 90 and 89 Toyota to sell 6790.

[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.220]
The bottom line is those 90s are going to be out any day and to make room for the 90s,

[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.680]
they have to get rid of all those.

[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.780]
And they got a lot of men over 1500 brand new 89s that are still hanging around on the

[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:20.020]
lot.

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.960]
So you're going to get a spectacular deal the best of the year on the 89 Toyota.

[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.400]
So if you're a smart shopper and get in there right away at Toyota of Hollywood number

[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.560]
one in volume, number one in service and number one in customer satisfaction.

[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.620]
Toyota of Hollywood is located on 441 between Taft and Sheridan streets in Hollywood.

[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.640]
But aside from that, Joe, Joe has got mixed Williams on sports talk tonight for all you

[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.200]
cup fans.

[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.260]
And I was just talking to Joe during the break and it made me remember, you know,

[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.080]
not only is Andre Dawson hitting again now, but last night he made a catch in right

[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:55.420]
field.

[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.880]
It was one of those where, you know, the guy goes back to the fence, leaps up, reaches

[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.380]
with his glove over the top of the fence and takes a home run away from Luis Kenyones.

[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.680]
And it was just incredible.

[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.640]
So Andre, the hawk is back.

[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.080]
OK, don't want to get the meds fans nervous.

[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.860]
And Joe tells me that the pod race scored four runs in the first inning against the meds

[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.840]
today, which is a bad break for the meds fans.

[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:15.020]

[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.980]
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.740]
I guess David Cohn must be pitching today.

[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.000]
Huh?

[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.020]
Just it's just a guess.

[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.940]
Should I look in a paper?

[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.560]
Have you done it?

[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.880]
We're not going to throw it up.

[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.680]
Yeah, I got it.

[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:24.020]
Right?

[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.900]
You must have it.

[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.680]
You're always on top of the things, aren't you?

[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.480]
Oh, yeah, I'm always.

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.300]
You keep a very close track.

[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.600]
I'm always hoarding the sports.

[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.780]
You know, let it out.

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.380]
But I know you're keeping very close tabs on those meds.

[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.960]
Let's see.

[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:34.900]
Let's see.

[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.820]
Oh, Viola.

[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.820]
Oh, my God.

[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.200]
What a bad break to pod race scored four against Viola in the first inning.

[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.000]
What a bad break for those meds, huh?

[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.540]
Geez.

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.420]
I guess, I'm clear.

[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.740]
We'll have to pitch a good game tonight.

[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.980]
OK, it's 151 at WIOD.

[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:49.640]
Davey.

[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:49.880]
Hello.

[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.080]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.600]
I got a little report from the beach last night.

[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.060]
OK.

[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.920]
We've boarded last night when I was five.

[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.680]
Look at the eclipse grid and see it.

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.600]
Side to drive out to the beach where may you get a better view.

[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.700]
And just see what's going on.

[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.140]
And I guess it wasn't anyone who had that idea.

[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.760]
Boy, it was kind of crowded.

[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.800]
Families were there and couples were there.

[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.960]
Do you mean they weren't arresting them?

[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:10.860]
Wait a minute.

[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.180]
Oh.

[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.660]
People were in beach from the Frisbee.

[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.700]
Hey, this is great.

[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.340]
I guess somebody called for our go-kouncils.

[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.440]
And today we can't have that.

[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.380]
We don't want any fun out there on the beach.

[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:19.680]

[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.760]
OK, let's cut that crap on.

[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.220]
Cars and a little meter maze with the lights going.

[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.900]
You know, because you can't park at the beach at the time of the front.

[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.720]
Don't people move the cars?

[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.640]
Give them not tickets?

[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.760]
It was unbelievable.

[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.680]
Great.

[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:31.960]
Absolutely unbelievable.

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.140]
Well, listen, you know, we're going to have to make room for the walkers

[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.220]
and the wheelchairs out there.

[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.360]
We don't have room for all this other stuff.

[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.920]
We have to make, you know, clear it out.

[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.660]
I just can't believe that the people who live in Fort Rutter do

[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.620]
should have some control over the cow.

[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.440]
They don't care.

[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.280]
No, they don't care.

[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.100]
See, you have basically, you've got all these little segmented groups.

[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.800]
The only people that make any noise are the old farts, you know,

[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.540]
with the condos and a lot of money and they still have the first dime they ever made.

[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.460]
And they're the ones that make all the noise and manipulate the politicians.

[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.080]
And the rest of the people are oblivious.

[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.900]
They don't give a crap about anything and they don't vote and they don't get involved.

[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.460]
They don't care.

[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.720]
So like, basically, you've got this one group of old farts that are running the whole town.

[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.660]
You know, it's basically like the whole area down here.

[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.040]
It's free for Miami North.

[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:12.660]
That's correct.

[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.740]
It's like a disease that's spreading up the East Coast.

[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.300]
It started on South Beach and before you know it,

[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.920]
it'll be all the way to Punta Gorda.

[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.840]
Okay, just had that little bit of a good trick.

[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.340]
Okay, have a good life.

[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.960]
Punta Gorda is not even on this coast, it's on the west coast.

[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.960]
Well, listen, it kind of like spread across.

[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.860]
Right across the Everglades and right through Lake Lucerne and the Mickey Mouse World Man.

[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:35.520]
Look out.

[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.320]
Pretty soon Mickey's going to be walking around with a beard and a cane.

[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.040]
Wouldn't that be something?

[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.600]
Hey, listen, I just got it.

[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.440]
The hell with Walt Disney, okay?

[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.560]
We can have geriatric Disney Land here.

[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.340]
Can't you see it?

[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.520]
And instead of like ice cream and sodas, they can sell prune juice at the concession stands

[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.060]
and metamusel and polydent.

[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.700]
And they can have like geriatric cartoon characters.

[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.900]
Like Donald Duck can have a beard down to his tail feather and he can be walking around with a walker.

[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.820]
And it wouldn't have to be great.

[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.340]
Watson Island.

[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:08.820]
Yeah.

[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.280]
And instead of these big dangerous roller coasters and space,

[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.680]
they can have like little buses that say win more village on the side and go over a couple of speed bumps.

[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.240]
Oh my god, this could be fantastic and they could pick all the old farts up at the condo

[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.920]
and as they come onto the bus, they can give them like hand them a little soft pack.

[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.060]
We ought to talk to Jeff about this, okay?

[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.920]
But instead of a sandwich inside, there could be a little container of polydent with a glass.

[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.120]
Huh?

[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.340]
And some metamusel and maybe some fiber one.

[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.680]
We ought to talk to a dentist Collins and see if they can't run a big promotion on this.

[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.140]
Matt, it could bring them back to life.

[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.100]
Coral Springs, hello.

[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:51.840]
Hi.

[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.540]
How you doing?

[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.280]
Is this Neil?

[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.060]
I think so.

[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:55.720]
Oh, good.

[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.360]
Are you ready for geriatric, geriatric Disney World, sir?

[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.800]
A little over my age group.

[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.780]
Yeah, we're even the old people can't have fun.

[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.960]
That would be perfect for this time.

[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.060]
And you're in Coral Springs, which is the epitome of not having fun, right?

[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.240]
I don't like that.

[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.940]
Even caught, in fact, this call could be illegal in Coral Springs.

[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.320]
Just might be.

[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:20.380]
You were talking about who should be on with the bird when he's got to do the show without you.

[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.480]
Yeah, and I'd like to make a sympathy vote for Eric Estrada.

[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.460]
He needs the work.

[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.300]
Eric Estrada.

[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:28.260]

[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.380]
Chips.

[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.780]
Oh, man.

[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:31.920]
From chips.

[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.260]
Yeah, it's the weirdest, huh?

[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.520]
He needs the work, yeah.

[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.940]
I'm sure he does, boy.

[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.420]
Did you ever, you didn't hear about the book that his ex-wife wrote about him, did you?

[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:41.740]
No.

[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.220]
Good.

[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.540]
But the way they married for about 10 minutes, he said it was a marriage of convenience or something

[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.000]
like that.

[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.380]
Oh, it was pretty nasty stuff.

[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.380]
Now, we don't want Eric Estrada on the show.

[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.300]
Why, you like some kind of an Eric Estrada freak?

[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.620]
No, it's just a little sympathy vote.

[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.060]
Now, come on.

[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.040]
You can admit it to us.

[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.160]
You sit up there with like a blow-up doll of Eric Estrada and kind of like on your lap.

[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:01.980]
Huh?

[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:02.940]
No.

[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.100]
Pictures on a wall, maybe?

[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.580]
No.

[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.720]
I just watched chips the case, boy.

[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.700]
He just watched chips like over and over again, right?

[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.740]
Okay, well, Steve has got a guy on next week who maybe can help you, okay?

[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.040]
Have a great day.

[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:15.680]
You do.

[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.020]
Okay, boy.

[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.060]
I think we got a real problem developing there in oral springs.

[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.400]
We better get Batman on the case for that one, okay?

[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.080]
Ships.

[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.540]
Yeah.

[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.920]
Batman better write a letter to that young man and tell him he's on the road to hell in a hand basket.

[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.240]
Boy, even I couldn't handle that Eric Estrada.

[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.040]
No kidding.

[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.820]
Anyway, let's go to a beautiful Palm Beach.

[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:39.180]
Hello.

[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:39.820]
Hey, guys.

[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.500]
How you doing?

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.520]
I didn't think I was going to get on.

[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.580]
Well, we wanted to make sure that you got on before we ran out of here.

[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.300]
I think you will.

[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.260]
I've got a WPBR aspiring for it.

[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.660]
Now we're talking heavy duty.

[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.000]
You haven't talked about it, but you may not know about it.

[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.340]
Have you heard about our latest weekend talk show host?

[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:53.980]
No.

[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.760]
Jim Skyler.

[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.180]
Really?

[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:57.660]
Yeah.

[00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.180]
Well, listen to that amazing boy.

[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.280]
He talked about desperate and needing work.

[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.360]
Five to seven on Sunday.

[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.240]
Really?

[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:03.640]
Yeah.

[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.040]
PM, I assume.

[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.640]
You know what he does?

[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.840]
No.

[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280]
Basically what you do.

[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.420]
Oh, he's doing his ripping off this show.

[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:11.680]
Yeah.

[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.580]
Well, that's okay.

[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.420]
He did a lot of clever reading stuff so he can probably play it himself, you know?

[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.160]
I heard him.

[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.140]
I think it was his second show.

[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.980]
And he does a little intro.

[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.440]
And then he says, let's go to the phone.

[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.160]
Yeah.

[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:23.860]
Go, Cara.

[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.060]
First caller is Lee from Boca.

[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:26.940]
Hello, Lee.

[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.120]
Absolutely.

[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.260]
No.

[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.020]
Are you serious?

[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:31.740]
I didn't want to get that one.

[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.420]
That's good.

[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.040]
Well, this is a great report.

[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.020]
I'm sure glad you got on before the end of the show.

[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.140]
I think that might identify somebody.

[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.940]
Might open up some ears and eyes for this.

[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.320]
I just want to know what you guys know about.

[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.320]
I know you can't hear him, but he's not half bad.

[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.780]
No, he's a great guy, really.

[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.120]
Even if he is on a make-believe radio station, you know, we all need the work.
