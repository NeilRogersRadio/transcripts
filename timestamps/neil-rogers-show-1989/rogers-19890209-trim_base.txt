[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.260]
want to make about what we've been discussing last couple of days but then we'll

[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.320]
get back to doing a radio show which is about time. Anyway we're really hot at

[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.140]
do and we did this yesterday and Steve had a magnificent job of doing it all

[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.320]
afternoon is have you folks in light of the virulent hate campaign against

[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.220]
Steve and myself in this station have those of you who enjoy the programming

[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.740]

our general manager just sent him along to a Mike Disney WYOD Miami 33141 and

[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.440]
because we have that great facts machine in there. Oh yeah you know if you're a

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.660]
business person or somebody else it's got a facts machine who wants to send

[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.520]
a similar kind of a note rather than waste the postage and take that much time.

[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:33.100]
Here's a WYOD. WYOD 757 7516 and you can just send your message of support on

[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.020]
the facts machine 757 7516. Boy there's there's enough sevens in that number

[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.480]
that we could have Larry can't come in special to give the number on here

[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.460]
right? 757 7516 our first call out of town again it collect from Washington

now Glenn how you doing this morning. Is this the grease man? No I have no grease.

[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.560]
Uh huh. Well I do have this some information that was printed in Washington

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.300]
Times. Really well if it's in a Washington Times you know it must be true. How's

[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.180]
Reverend Mondoan by the way? Listen this is good for talk radio though. Okay

[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.740]
the header is this is put the new news analysis the header is furious public

[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.040]
rallied on cries from talk radio really? Uh floating quickly from the article

[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.380]
the Rev. Well this must be about the congressional pay raise yes it is.

[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.520]
Okay the revolutionary heroes of this rebellion were radio talk show host and

[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.200]
this jockey's around the country. Uh it does mention unfortunately uh Lee Fowler.

[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.720]
Pardon? Lee Fowler. No Sandy Payton. Oh wow. Oh my god.

[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.320]
This is uh W.S. News. Sandy Payton said she had been a Miami talk show host

[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.280]
twenty years and of any issue we've discussed I've never seen someone's outrage.

[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.460]
Yeah. Then it goes. I was saying that I think it's a lot of these people.

[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.400]
Yeah sure cookies but you know the article basically can't find out.

[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.740]
I want to tell you something pal first the congressional pay raise next the outrageous

[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.960]
prices on the early bird okay that's coming next and if there's anybody who

[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.920]
could do it it's Sandy. Well Sandy is top boy it does mention the whole

[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.960]
history here but what it does say is that while the newspapers stirred up little

[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.660]
or no controversy about it uh according right from the article radio host talk to

[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.880]
real people watching and journalists talk to each other. Right well we're like

[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.480]
the folks of a W.P.B.R. in Palm Beach we're here to make a difference okay.

[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.560]
Well I know that's not you know the way that you do the show down there but it's

[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.220]
just basically it's something good about talk radio. That is correct. Well on

[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.120]
occasion we've been knowing to make a difference you know. That is true.

[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.100]
Not like Sandy but well I'm sorry that it didn't mention you. No that's all right.

[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.640]
No news. I got enough I got enough paper coverage here as it is. Yeah I've been

[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.100]
even made the hellendale digest today. She is. Good that's great I'm coming back to my

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.560]
Emmy today so I'll be interested in seeing that my girlfriend was supposed to

[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.380]
record some of your show for me while I was up here. I've got to go I just wanted

[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.600]
to leave you with just one thing I want to say good morning to Frankie and Sean

[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.480]
your douchebag and Neil here's the greatest. Okay thanks a lot and say hi to

[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.660]
president Bush league for us. I was going to mention you to him before I leave.

[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.620]
Okay Tom would hope he's feeling better. He has been under the weather but then I

[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.920]
get with a faulty tower issue. Yeah well tell him we like John. Okay. All right thank you.

[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.360]
Thanks a lot. Good morning. Great call from Washington DC. I got news for you man.

[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.000]
Very few local talk shows anywhere in the country start out with calls from our

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.880]
nation's capital right and probably most of them pretty happy about it. Anyway we

[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.820]
made the hellendale digest today which is more about the freedom of speech becomes an

[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.000]
issue for Rogers and Kane hellendale in the middle of legal battle and all the

[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.360]
stuff we've been talking about the last couple of days. I think the most

[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.820]
interesting and the person who wrote it Karen Conway is going to call me because

[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.740]
she didn't have a chance to talk to me before writing this so all of the

[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.700]
quotes of course come from our dear attorney friend from a sunny Rosenberg

[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.380]
and from Mr. Intendola the city manager in hellendale now his comments I think are the most

[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.960]
interesting and I think it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that this whole hellendale segment

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.440]
of the witch hunt campaign is a sunny Rosenberg orchestrated chapter okay. Mr. Intendola said

[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.760]
increased controversy only increases shock radio's ratings when the city of hellendale went head

[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.340]
to head with Rogers about two years ago Rogers had the third rated show in Tendola said which is

[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.700]
not true we were number one but he says we gave him his number one ratings the city's crusade

[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.060]
against Rogers show eventually died a natural death because of a lack of support in Tendola said

[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:42.360]
even some of those people who say it's nasty think it's funny and advertisers told us to go for a walk

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.760]
yeah yeah how do you like that you go walk the dog and also our attorney friend said that he's

[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.440]
contacted station advertisers which include Gulfstream Park and Hellendale and describe the content

[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.060]
of Rogers show and they have continued to advertise well no kidding no kidding no kidding

[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.760]
attempts to garner the support of the Broward County school system but a breath and other

[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.100]
local religious ethnic and youth groups have also failed he said nobody has the guts to do anything

[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.780]
about this type of programming he said well the bottom line is most people have a sense of humor

[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.120]
and they understand it and even if they don't like it they just turn it off and don't listen in

[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.580]
that case which most rational people do and the idea that we're harming anybody with this kind of

[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.780]
programming of course is just a desperate attempt to create havoc and chaos and problems for me

[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.100]
and any station that I work on you know first it was w-i-n-z and then it was zeta and now just by

[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.380]
coincidence it's w-i-o-k just a coincidence huh although I thought you once said there are no

[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.380]
coincidences how about that all right let me do a little break here then we'll come back up

[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.320]
a few more comments I want to make about that and then we'll get into and we may have a big

[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.100]
celebrity guest coming by today hopefully this is exciting that let me give you a little sneak preview

[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.440]
okay that's as much as all that's all that's a problem it's after 10 Toyota

[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.560]
I mean don't fight over the paper here let's just try to relax we've got a lot of copies of the

[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:07.160]
paper what is that who is that that's uh el McPherson in sports illustrated which I've been

[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.260]
looking for a copy this around here but the sports department gets that magazine for some weird

[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.100]
reason you know oh I get it I subscribe to SI do you like I want of those great little phones

[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.060]
you know the ones that don't work now we also have that tape

[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.620]
the greatest blue volume two which is really not all that great yeah anyway getting back to some of

[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.220]
the information that we're passing along since this is now a public news story and since the

[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.700]
published news stories mentioned that these harassment campaign have been going on for the last

[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.100]
19 months obviously the chronology of same is a legitimate news story that we can discuss

[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.900]
when we were at Zeta there was a period of time when with great regularity we'd be getting either

[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.840]
phone calls or messages or something would pop up in the newspaper remember the one Greg

[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.620]
Buldell was going to sue me you remember that oh vividly and we kept wondering what the hell is this

[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.540]
all about there was even a thing with Bill Tanner's who called us yesterday on here as a good friend

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:05.080]
of ours uh his attorney calling the radio station and threatening this and at and the bottom line

[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.800]
comes to find out that the same attorney individual had been making phone calls or writing letters to

[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.280]
these individuals in fact Greg and I discussed this when I had that phone call with him about a

[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.980]
month ago or two months and you know taking things out of context and twisting and manipulating and

[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:25.180]
so I'm so I mean I'm urging people again soliciting business and urging people to sue me and you

[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.200]
know so for those who are regular listeners and go back with his soap opera that's been ongoing for

[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.960]
19 months now and you wondered what all of that stuff was about including Denise White our next

[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.300]
tour neighbor here at channel seven you'll recall when they did that piece she and the Steve whatever

[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:45.060]
his name is Dawson tea huh you know when they did that piece on morning shows and they defamed me

[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.760]
into that awful stuff and I made some you know jokes about that uh the same thing again you know

[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.160]
received phone calls from the same individual so those of you who think that this is some kind of

[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.700]
an isolated campaign or that you know there's some real merit here all it's been has been a

[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.140]
scatter buckshot attempt to contact everybody and anybody possible to make as much problem for

[00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.710]
any of Rogers and basically get him off the air you know get me fired get me out of the market

[00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.250]
just through my career my life harass my friends like fat rich who's sitting here who's got a

[00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:17.310]
whole series of things that have been sent to him plastered on his car a phone calls at seven o'clock

[00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:23.010]
in the morning etc and it's been one of the ugliest and nastiest harassment campaigns Steve had a

[00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.550]
guy called in yesterday whose name and number we've got by the way who is a sponsor on this station

[00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.830]
who related to kind of harassment that he's had from this individual and even when he was

[00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.810]
advertising not on this show but on the rest of the station yeah that wasn't okay according to

[00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.770]
this individual if he didn't stop advertising he was going to let everybody know what he was doing

[00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.870]
and bapapah and this and that and again this goes so far beyond the bounds of any individuals free

[00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:51.430]
speech to interfere with other people's business uh that it really is just shocking I think is the

[00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:56.750]
word that somebody we know might say shocking that's really yeah and I heard you know Steve had a

[00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.570]
lot of great calls yesterday he also had some of the blue hairs calling again and uh you know

[00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.470]
taking issue with what I say well that's fine if you don't like what I say you don't have to listen

[00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.390]
to the show nobody out there is going to be injured or harmed because of this program you can go

[00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.890]
to the bank on that all right and uh you know if you're thin skin and the fact is that every one of

[00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:20.410]
these people called in listened to the show even though they denied it in many cases they were

[00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.530]
quoting chapter in verse Rodgers got a note on here he said he talked to one of Mike sponsors

[00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:29.930]
this morning that was harassed during this as well one of her neary sponsors how do you like that

[00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.570]
no Mike is about his non-controversial and one of the nicest guys you'd ever want to know and

[00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.510]
certainly not involved in any of this other business that allegedly is going on and even his

[00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.450]
sponsors could have been hurried what does that tell you no I think you folks out there it's about

[00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:50.450]
time that you knew just how widespread and how disgusting this thing was and again we really hope

[00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.250]
that you'll take the time because we know that we're reaching Steve said tens of thousands it's

[00:11:54.250 --> 00:12:00.310]
hundreds of thousands of people yeah uh every week on these programs and uh you know all of us

[00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.030]
here at W.I.M.D. have got invested interest including the station management and seeing that uh

[00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.430]
we are protected and that we have a lot of support from you folks out there who enjoy what we do if

[00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.010]
you don't enjoy it good luck to you as we said yesterday lots of other places you can go go

[00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.510]
listen to Sandy she's even made it in Washington now in the Washington time so she's probably doing

[00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:24.050]
one hell of a job over there at WOLD so you have plenty of alternatives okay but those of you who

[00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:30.770]
do enjoy it drop us a letter Mike Disney W.I.O.D Miami 33141 or if you have a fax machine you can send

[00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:39.750]
it along a note letter whatever you want on the fax machine 757 751 says okay also want to

[00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:43.650]
mention if you're looking for those great new uh unbelievable neo-ronders bumper stickers you can

[00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:49.130]
get them this Sunday a trade winds park in coconut creek a classic and antique car show to benefit

[00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.530]

[00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:59.210]

from 10 to 1 this Sunday 9 to 5 sample road on the Florida turnpike for the trade winds park thing

[00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:13.370]
the classic and antique car show okay yeah first thing all right I guess that the gets us caught up

[00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.490]
will do another little piece of business then we'll take some calls from our good friends out

[00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:22.850]
there in radio land we have so many of them obviously don't we yeah a little note from Joe at

[00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:28.750]
taft street who's doing just great little thing here from Gulfstream Park yeah it's interesting yeah

[00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.310]
see one thing I'd like to explain is people don't advertise on these radio programs or any other

[00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.070]
ones just because they like us they advertise because they get tremendous results that's what

[00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:43.090]
advertising is all about that's and even if you disagree see what I used to do topical talk and

[00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:47.590]
had a lot of very strong opinions about organized religion and lots of other topics the one thing

[00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:51.550]
that was consistent is that even people who disagree with my philosophy found that they got

[00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.050]
tremendous results because you're not selling your philosophy you're selling the fact that you're

[00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.530]
reaching a tremendous number of people you've got great credibility and the people will patronize

[00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:05.530]
your sponsors and they do so for our attorney friend who just can't understand how they continue

[00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:11.290]
to advertise in spite of his harassment campaign and bombardment of of eight against these shows the

[00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.790]
fact of the matter is that these people know they're getting banged for the book okay they're

[00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.850]
getting response all they care about and that's what it's all about okay 751 WIOD and

[00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:27.470]
day 524 WIOD in Broward 278 9463 in Boka and I got a kick out of the one caller called him yesterday

[00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:33.530]
that said I had defamed Boka even as as of yesterday which I did and I'll say it again you watch

[00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:38.830]
how long it takes that Boka line of matter like they sleep the walking dead in Boka and in Palm Beach

[00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:47.130]
which is a stage beyond that 655 WIOD a Valentine's Day is coming down WIOD 1025 at happiness radio

[00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:57.870]
and our only open line is in Palm Beach 655 WIOD we love so much for somebody to call on the Palm Beach

[00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:03.350]
line especially preferably somebody who doesn't live in Palm Beach okay chicken collage collect

[00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.030]
if you're calling from any place else and can't get through on the board if you're that desperate

[00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:13.330]
on the Palm Beach line 655 WIOD we'll start in Miami this morning hello hi Neil hi how are you

[00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.650]
just great listen I've been trying to call you for a couple of days regarding just silly guy

[00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.710]
remember when you had an appearance when you was with beta and you was at the South

[00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:30.610]
State shopping oh I sure do and he showed up for harassment purposes yeah right my husband I

[00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:37.550]
brought you a tape the Dave County Commission me oh yeah and I still have it and I appreciated

[00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:43.750]
that very much I still have that now that tape is only part of the meeting we saw a repeat of that

[00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:49.630]
same meeting later and we taped the first part of it and they met more or less told the guy he's not

[00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.210]
well you know this is the amazing part of it he continues just going around contacting anybody

[00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.450]
and everybody and of course the reason he made the contact with sunny Rosenberg in halandale was

[00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.770]
because he realized here's a guy who already hates my guts and has a personal axe to grind so he's

[00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.890]
going to find a sympathetic ear but the thing that frustrates him is that whether it's advertisers

[00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.470]
whether it's the people at the University of Miami whether it's the Metro Commission I mean the

[00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:17.290]
guy has shown his true colors he's shown what this is all about and his credibility on a scale of

[00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:22.390]
zero is minus infinity right and you know I've been thinking there's something that keeps sticking

[00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:31.010]
in the back of my mind you know Jim and Tammy Baker and in the swagger they were damning everyone out

[00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:36.510]
yeah they were doing the same thing yeah well I'm not going to make any accusations I don't I don't

[00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.350]
know anything about the man's personal life nor do I care because that's his business but I will

[00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.990]
I will say on a general level and I've said this before people who protest as such a hysterical

[00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:51.910]
degree very often have got something that there's something there something there you know it

[00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:59.530]
makes you wonder yeah but if you would like that tape the complete oh I'd love it yeah okay I'll

[00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:05.330]
get my husband there make you a copy excellent thank you appreciate it very much okay bye bye 1028 at

[00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:06.310]
and everything well let me let me put it this way in a general level anybody who would take the

[00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:10.870]
satirical or comedy things that we say on this on this show they're obviously meant as comedy

[00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:16.450]
and try to twist them and manipulate them and make them intended to be serious has got to anyone

[00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.210]
who would do that would have to have sinister motives for doing you know what I'm saying yeah really

[00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.830]
I just it's incredible but you guys just keep doing what you're doing and birds you keep

[00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:41.390]
there well they're really ready plantation hello good morning yes sir when is this well I'm

[00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:47.430]
still a way out now anyway meal I have a question didn't this individual start this mess

[00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:53.650]
way back about oh maybe two years ago when he was doing harassing phone calls to you at

[00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.170]
not just I and Z yeah it started I and Z in the summer of 87 the harassing calls were not only to

[00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.870]
me but they were to the switchboard the newsroom I mean just a just a succession of wild

[00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:09.050]
a threatening screaming hysterical phone calls and it's just never stopped I mean that was just

[00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.350]
the beginning of it and it's never stopped and again that all started taking something out of

[00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.710]
context I was talking about my trip to Hawaii and I was trolling according to him on the air what I

[00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:23.550]
was doing was looking for a traveling companion my best friend had just died the short time before

[00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.150]
and I was looking to find somebody to go on a trip with me and I said probably you know

[00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.310]
be good idea say first of all a person that have to be over 18 and secondly be nice to have

[00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.550]
somebody who was gay because we'd have common interest and God only knows what might develop

[00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.890]
and immediately he twisted that into something about trolling for sex from my boys on the air which

[00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:44.430]
of course anybody over the age of 18 is an adult but don't confuse this person with that okay well

[00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.890]
yeah I remember him calling this I can calling you on the air yeah I remember the call like it was

[00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:54.930]
yesterday yeah I'm I've been listening to since I came down here about five years now and I'll

[00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:01.290]
tell you this I sent my letter this morning to mr. Disney great everybody I've talked to

[00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:07.450]
supports you and Steve and IOD up down sideways and any other way you want to support

[00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:17.270]
we feel that this is an abysment of our rights we have we decide what we want to listen to not

[00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.770]
anybody else exactly well Steve put it very well when he said it's not just a campaign against us

[00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:26.470]
individually or against one radio station or now a three station but it's a campaign against the

[00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.210]
public's right to make their own free choices as to what they find entertaining and what they want

[00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:35.290]
to listen to yeah well if I find that you're not entertaining I do my own censorship and turn you off

[00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:41.390]
wow yeah I'm pretty revolutionary yeah yeah you never heard of the same thing with Steve I mean I

[00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:47.190]
won't go to the WOLD because that just you know they put me to sleep yeah that's also turn on

[00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:53.290]
on elevator music or something sure but that's what we do and that's my right to do it and that

[00:21:53.290 --> 00:22:00.750]
works huh yeah you know I just want to interrupt you for a second when you talked about the harassing

[00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.710]
phone calls year and a half ago do you remember the time he put his personal call on fat oh yeah

[00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.590]
we're reporting to our business to our which we're going to say violation of the law

[00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.570]
yeah I remember he's in a row also came to my house and stuck a letter an unstanped letter in my

[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.850]
mailbox which is a violation of federal postal law and you know it constantly accusing me of

[00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.870]
criminal activity and solicitation on the air and being breaking the law but in the meantime he

[00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.730]
goes ahead and does these illegal things consistently all throughout this campaign and we're supposed

[00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:36.190]
to look the other way I also remember that he said he started getting all sorts of phone calls

[00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:41.430]
that his business office concerning you know from people who were outraged at him for doing things

[00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:46.450]
to you well let me say that we've never we have never encouraged anyone to do that I know that

[00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:51.770]
you know we in fact quite the contrary we discourage all our listeners to refrain from contacting

[00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.030]
this individual anyway because first it's inappropriate and secondly it would be of no effect

[00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:00.410]
anyway and thirdly if they do want to do something positive then they you know ought to write the

[00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.130]
letters to our management and you know and patronize our sponsors and do the things that help well

[00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.950]
I tell you this I've written written the letters and any restarts you ever recommend I've gone to

[00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:14.850]
so I have no problem with you guys and like I said I'll exercise my own form of sense is here

[00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:29.590]
but I don't when I'm not entertained excellent thanks a lot thanks a lot bye 1034 WIOD we have an

[00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:19.070]
I'm pretty outrageous 1041 at WIOD 19 to 11 and let's we got a mobile and brownered hello

[00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:26.610]
good morning yes sir you know I just wanted to let you know that I can understand your frustration

[00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:33.210]
and the abuse that you must feel however I don't know when you're giving some thought to the fact

[00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.250]
that you should or hopefully you will get some comfort out of the service you're giving to your

[00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:44.990]
community let me explain my wife she she doesn't think much of your program I've met her side

[00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:50.690]
that they she'd like to see you off the air under any condition any way that she can't she doesn't

[00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:58.530]
she has you belong there really really nevertheless as a result of this going on he's going on she

[00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:03.010]
now realizes that she really she may have her feeling about you but she's really in position

[00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:09.670]
itself upon the community of individuals yeah and now she feels very strongly that they can't do

[00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.030]
this do you have a right to be there and I thought it would be you know there's been a complete

[00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:17.810]
I don't know how part let's agree maybe occurring to other people no well that is excellent I

[00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:22.430]
made that point two days ago that even the people who hate this show or hate me personally yeah can

[00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.570]
you hear me yeah I got you now my mobile okay I was I was saying a couple of days ago I made the

[00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:31.050]
point that even those people who hate this show I think will come to the realization that when you

[00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:36.630]
start allowing individuals or groups of individuals in a community to censor and to try to get on

[00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.130]
the air only what they approve of but then you know that's that's the first road to fascism you can

[00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:46.870]
allow I think you're right Neil I think that this now is this awareness now is good for our community

[00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:51.730]
I really do I think it's good it would be just a word and we need this we need to jump in the back

[00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:56.270]
once in a while yeah I appreciate a good point thank you thanks a lot now in fact that we probably

[00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:01.190]
owe a little thanks to sunny Rosenberg again over there in halemdale because unwittingly what he's

[00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:05.670]
done by making this a news story and now there've been like five newspaper articles about the entire

[00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:11.450]
story or least most of it yeah in the last couple of days and now it's fair game for comment here

[00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:16.290]
prior to this because of certain legal machinations that went on we were you know there were

[00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:21.510]
some dubious circumstances and we were restrained from talking about it on the air but now because it is

[00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:26.510]
a legitimate news story you know we can really go into it and let the public know what's been going on

[00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.610]
that's the thing that frustrated me the most over the past 19 months is that the group of people who

[00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.950]
are the greatest supporters which are your listeners you couldn't talk to we couldn't discuss it

[00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.330]
on a year and that's you know that was part of the game plan of this individual was to keep

[00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.790]
muscling us and then to be able to go out you know without the spotlight shining on him and do all

[00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:48.390]
of these things in in the dark so to speak and making all of these phone calls and harassing and

[00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:53.690]
threatening sponsors and threatening friends of mine and making you know nuisance phone calls and now

[00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.430]
it's you know it's going to stop it may not stop today or tomorrow but it's going to stop

[00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:03.590]
because a lot of this activity is blatantly illegal it is certainly unethical as far as

[00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:10.610]
illegal conduct is concerned and it's going to stop the party is over okay 1044 at WIOD Tamarack hello

hi good morning you know hi good morning bird hi how are you doing good good first of all I want to

[00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:21.170]
say how funny it is yesterday when I the calls did you hear on Steve's show yeah I heard the whole show

[00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:27.290]
uh-huh it's very funny how these people who find that the songs and the bits are disgusting how they

[00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.850]
you know they call Steve and tell him but they you know they won't call your show yeah now we

[00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.310]
didn't have a single negative call and we certainly didn't screen them out we just took him as

[00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.990]
they came in yesterday we did not have a single negative call about this show or this radio station

[00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.530]
on a program yesterday right and did you hear the particular call when the woman called in and

[00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:49.570]
says that you know her daughter heard the song walk with an erection and she finds that that's very

[00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:54.650]
harmful oh yeah and it was her daughter was 13 years old and when Steve asked her if she heard

[00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.510]
anything that well now she didn't say harmful because Steve said was there any harm to her daughter

[00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.830]
because she heard it she said well not really right and he said did she hear anything that she

[00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.350]
wouldn't hear in school and she said well no not really and you know that was the end of the phone

[00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:09.450]
call right that's what's funny these two boxes like they've never heard these things in their whole life

[00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.070]
well it's really sad i feel sorry for people who are so miserable or have such minimal sense of

[00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:20.550]
humor that are so uptight about words or about comedy or you know pretend not to understand it and

[00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.690]
i do say pretend because that's what they're doing they're pretending they don't understand that it's

[00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:30.590]
satire and comedy they know better right well i wish we both you and Steve the best of luck and i

[00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.930]
a lot more said and and

[00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.530]
before it and all-rated movies and

[00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:01.110]
your show even barely even touches on and i think that's ridiculous and i bet she left her

[00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:05.690]
daughter go to all-rated movies well not only that but i'm sure her daughter probably was you know

[00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:09.810]

[00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:15.090]
where the use all kinds of sexual material and play um... all kinds of racy thing which is fine you

[00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.250]
know that goes on all over the country and it's for its humor it's entertainment okay and the

[00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:23.630]
people are so uptight about that you really have to wonder well and plus two the i think the violence

[00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:28.930]
that that is in the movies is much more damaging than any uh... words or any humor that you have

[00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:35.850]
on the show absolutely ridiculous amen so hang in there and you got a lot of people that like it so

[00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:40.590]
we're hanging thanks a lot okay see you ten fifty three a w i'd be speaking of that the steve has

[00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:45.770]
a really interesting topic today and it's about time uh... did pornography really turn bundy into a

[00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.870]
mass murderer and of course that's the thing that uh... the born again the right wingers and i

[00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:55.470]
attempting to do is use that ridiculous interview that contrived interview with bundy and say well here

[00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.850]
we go this is an excuse for us to start censoring and you got to take playboy out of the convenience store again

[00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:07.910]
uh...

[00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:14.130]
red shots who needs no introduction and attorney Norman Kent so that's gonna be one barn burner of a show okay

[00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.910]
and it ties in with a lot of stuff we've been talking about the last three days because it has to do

[00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:19.890]
with freedom of speech and expression the first amendment

[00:34:19.890 --> 00:34:23.690]
et cetera and so on north mind me be chill out

[00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:24.450]
i mean on the

[00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:25.610]
uh...

[00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.330]
i've been a long time with her but the first time i've ever called

[00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:32.250]
good but i thought maybe you should know that

[00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.970]
i think it might be the same guy

[00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:40.970]
that's been harassing you that i heard call a couple weeks back when we're back up all was on one of the

[00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:41.670]
other stations

[00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.170]
and

[00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.190]
volunteer

[00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.670]
some more tapes to send her

[00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.570]
this and uh...

[00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.970]
oh no question about it no question about anybody

[00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:57.110]
seat no matter what i talk about no matter who i mentioned even the alpo dog food thing i did in the fm

[00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.850]
which i was exonerating absolutely

[00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:04.750]
uh... backed up in by all the veterinarians in the area but no matter what it is i say a letter immediately goes out

[00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:09.330]
and uh... these comments were made by the oragers and their inflammatory out of sua man sua man

[00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:14.370]
just to try to create a barrage of lawsuits none of which by the way have ever developed because there's nothing there

[00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:18.830]
and just to try to create problem between me and management make make so much of a

[00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:18.990]
a

[00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:23.770]
chaotic situation that i would lose my job that's that's the game plan behind all of us

[00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:26.290]
i agree with you but uh...

[00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.690]
she uh...

[00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:30.610]
it was on fandie show by the way and fandie

[00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:31.330]
ask

[00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:35.750]
rebeck you know what what's this all about and uh... she says that uh...

[00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.130]
she was getting all this information and

[00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.030]
you know and setting it

[00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:42.610]
to her lawyer to see about a libel

[00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.630]
all you know

[00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.790]
so i just thought you know we haven't heard a word about that now is not

[00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.430]
that we have a word and we want to be a three week back

[00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.910]
obviously this is what happens in the beginning the letters in a phone calls are so

[00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.570]
inflammatory just like the thing that happened with Greg but you know if you take

[00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.530]
anything out of context and twisted and it person doesn't know what really happened

[00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.770]
anybody could say to you well i'm going to sue somebody that's outrageous and then when they find out what

[00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:08.850]
really was said like you know the humorous stuff that we've done with rebeck a

[00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:09.970]
paul and that's all it's been

[00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:13.610]
then you know it all fritters away because there's nothing there's

[00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:16.710]
well i just thought you should know me because i don't think this is right

[00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:21.090]
i think this man has gone over the edge and it's more than just harassment you know

[00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:25.350]

[00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:18.150]

[00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.830]
is everybody around here heard about this guy Neil Rogers and what he's saying and doing

[00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:28.830]

[00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:43.450]
of them and i turned around to them and i said sir you understand that this is nothing but a radio

[00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:50.910]

[00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.930]
yeah i said oh really yeah and uh

[00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:59.670]
this guy just kept on and on well you know it's interesting that tom jicke at the mime news is a good

[00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:04.270]
friend and who's been married for many many years and as a family and as straight as an arrow when

[00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:09.270]
tom was involved in getting abuse from this individual also had one of a series of harassing calls

[00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:13.590]
and when tom didn't agree with what the caller was saying uh the comment to tom as well you

[00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:18.630]
must be a homosexual too because you agree with him so you see if you agree then somehow you're

[00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:23.690]
painted by the same brush and you know subject to the same kind of attack right so i said to him

[00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:30.690]
i said well if you feel this way why don't you call him and you know why don't you call Neil

[00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:38.190]
no guts oh i wouldn't do that yeah but every day though he keeps up the same thing and the

[00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:44.150]
same thing i says oh you listen to him oh you can't turn it off can you that's right you just can't

[00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:48.850]
every day we keep up this isn't that fascinating just like a few of those caller Steve had yesterday

[00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:53.530]
and there were really that many of them but the few who did call uh is you listen to the call and

[00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:58.390]
Steve draw drew them out you discover they can quote chapter inverse of anything and everything we

[00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:04.590]
say on the show because like you say they can't shut it off well my letters in the mail and

individual were discussing this attorney one of the letters he sent i don't remember whether it

[00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:23.230]
was to our corporate attorney or you know there's so many and there's so many different people

[00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:27.930]
one of the letters went through these bitter complaints about the fact that this outrageous

[00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:33.970]
behavior is going on with Henry Barrow drinking on the air and sexual harassment on the job of April

[00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:39.350]
him referring to my you know i mean you talk about somebody with no sense of humor or

[00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:44.070]
or pretending to have no sense of humor unbelievable little stretch yeah just a little

[00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:49.190]

[00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:21.410]
that the name oh that's something else what is it oh it is for me share all is so confused because

[00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:30.510]
a little little groggy from the after effect but anyway speaking of eating uh you know lindens

[00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:34.110]
who's not guess will be pleased that i didn't gain any way back and i must confess a couple of times

[00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:39.490]
during the past two weeks i've we've sneaked over to char hot and uh had a great Italian sauce oh

[00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:48.570]
d we're here at fort ladder days place ditches and award winning man to invest in burnt and walls

[00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:54.110]

[00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.030]

[00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:10.710]

[00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:35.590]
couple of lines dropped off we have an open line in bulka 278 9463 278 w i o d as we continue to

[00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:39.750]
shocking the listening audience right especially those who are listening who hate every moment of it

[00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:46.530]
oh god there was one woman yesterday it was one of the classic calls she said she's too she

[00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:51.510]
sets her radio if you ever heard that expression before she sets her radio she listens to mike

[00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:57.490]
in a morning she sets it on six ten hates me and once in a while by accident picks up steed because

[00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:01.530]
she has her radio set i think that was the same one with a daughter the thirteen year old daughter

[00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:07.670]
so they must have all the radios in the house and in the car set on six ten and they can't move

[00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:11.910]
them so i'm sure we have people in the audience would be more happy to volunteer if she wants to

[00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:16.330]
call back off the air and nick will take her name and address and we can send somebody over there to

[00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:21.050]
unsat her dialed an engineer yeah well said what i've sent a michael over there because he's an

[00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:26.330]
expert and he will uh... move the infact we probably arrange every day at certain times we can

[00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:30.530]
send somebody over there a career to change the dial so she doesn't have to be subjected to a lot

[00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:35.110]
of stuff that she just can't stand north mime beach hello i just want to let that woman know by

[00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:38.790]
the way i get one of these revolutionary stereo it's got a vfo on it you can actually change the

[00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:44.590]
stations no no come on they got something like that now yes knowledge he's just burning them up

[00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:48.830]
incredible and it's an innocent would be shocked when they i'm telling you good to talk to you by the way

[00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:52.810]
great show is always wanted to make a couple of points that by may first of all i'd like to know

[00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:57.090]
what makes uh... may or sunny and the city manager i a total of think that they can't accomplish what

[00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:01.810]
the fcc tried to accomplish on you when you're on the i and v a m a couple of years ago well first

[00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:06.590]
all the fcc didn't try to accomplish anything they were sent a just tons of the same kind of stuff

[00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:11.190]
that they've been getting now and uh... they even monitored the show if i can use that word and

[00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:15.090]
sent somebody down here to the local fcc office for several days they monitored and their

[00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:19.410]
comment was they didn't find a damn thing wrong with it there is absolutely nothing in those files

[00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:23.670]
i thought i thought it was kind of the same thing because if i remember correctly i may be wrong

[00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.110]
but if i remember correctly a lot of this is pretty much the same thing they were getting

[00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:30.550]
complaints and they came down and if the fifth can't do it what makes you think a couple of pion

[00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:34.930]
from a local city can accomplish exactly well it just don't understand what's sunny it's an ego

[00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:40.350]
thing and here's a chance in his own foolish eagle maniacal way to strut his stuff again and show all

[00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:45.670]
a case over there what a hot shot he is he's gonna get that nil rod you said all he does you know

[00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:48.930]
this the second time they've done it in two years they just make fools out of the cell

[00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:53.350]
where i got news for sunny i it make them as a shot to him but i can still go into my video store

[00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.910]
and uh... rent or purchase things that i wouldn't want to show to my two-year-old son

[00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:03.050]
i can still go and turn on even during at daytime prime time television fine topics that i wouldn't

[00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:07.470]
want to show to my two-year-old son i don't notice any personal vendetta is going out against that

[00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:10.590]
sort of thing as a matter of fact if you walk the street to howl and they'll at the right time you

[00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.270]
might find some things you don't want to find their

[00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:17.010]
really that doesn't seem to be a problem and i'd really love to know why

[00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:21.270]
just a quick point i'd like to make also i'm a manager of a small service business in the city of

[00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:25.010]
howl and dill and just just for your reference and just for uh... i'm not going to play the name because

[00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.630]
it's not a plug but anybody walks in today that is under the age of sixty five and doesn't live in

[00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:35.550]
howl and they'll ten percent discount okay good idea good for you guys appreciate it thanks a lot

[00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:39.870]
but i can be the start of a revolution now the under sixty five this dot good lord

[00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:46.230]
would that be great hmm hmm and then we can have like late bird specials for people who eat after six p.m.

[00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:51.930]
who are under the age of two hundred and don't have blue hair and are wearing a cap okay that would be great

[00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.690]
okay both of Palm Beach lines went on i think mentioning joy probably put us in great

[00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:01.330]
jeopardy here even art Fleming would be embarrassed by this uh two seven eight nine four six three

[00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:06.210]
and bokeh six five five w i o d and beautiful prestigious Palm Beach which you can call collect

[00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:12.650]
from anywhere else because it's always open for lotterdale hello hello hi hi nil you find

[00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:17.810]
out who your friends are when you're in trouble right i yes incidentally last week i'm an

[00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:24.450]
informe the last week i put a i always have larry keen on and i'm one of those people that leave

[00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:31.330]
w i o t on constantly so where somebody called in and reported your bio

[00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:38.930]
language and poor larry knew from nothing and this fellow said why are you connected with say

[00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:45.090]
a station that permits a thing like that and he says sir i've no idea what you're talking about

[00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:51.270]
you went on to the next one hmm at any rate i wonder who that could have been three guesses

[00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:57.010]
at any rate we love you well you know it sounds like the fact that you listen to i o d constantly

[00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:01.730]
and every change radio it sounds like a conscious decision on your part not a word you doubt

[00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:06.210]
people you have one yeah in other words you doubt it's in stuck though or for it's not stuck

[00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:14.670]
yeah well good and incidentally i'm 68 and i just mailed my letter to mr. Disney i've recently moved

[00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:20.470]
down after my husband's demise and believe in me you perk up the day things are quite done

[00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:25.230]
after new year you can say that again there even doll after canadaigua

[00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:33.030]
i don't know but truthfully and this is the highlight of the day you and well a lot of people say

[00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:37.470]
that i think that's quite a commentary on what i found this is but it is true in fact there are a lot

[00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:40.750]
of people who are bedridden you'd be amazed some of the letters that i've gotten over the years

[00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:45.510]
people are bedridden and people who just can't get out of the house and this gives them a few laughs

[00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:51.330]
and chuckle and it's fallen fun i've made it that in my note it's fallen fun who takes these things

[00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:56.350]
serious well only people who want to for very sinister purposes and i think it's such a waste of

[00:52:56.350 --> 00:53:03.930]
you bet and i liked what Steve said about uh bob grand when he was painting i had painted

[00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:10.050]
here recently and they listened to your program and he said to me this is a very dull job and

[00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:15.670]
i hear something like that he says i can't go on with this yeah and he's been doing it for some 30

[00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:19.210]
years he's well like steve said sometimes living here's like watching paint dry you know

[00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:25.230]

exactly what i said as the other papers did not i said they asked me about this individual

[00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:02.630]
you may want to hold your hand by the button but they printed it in the myami review

you dumped it yes okay but certainly true 21 21 past 11 at wiod while it's subjective you know

[00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:17.490]

[00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:41.750]
of the word but just you know just for old time seconds sure but um it's been a long time

[00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:47.530]
and a guy he made a very after all the conversation back and forth then a guy wasn't screaming

[00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:53.110]
or anything he was i think too comatose to do that but he made a very profound point he said steve

[00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:58.210]
you know i'd much rather be called an idiot than an asshole and i you know i thought about that

[00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:04.830]
i thought gee that's really profound thinking you know i thought about it for hours after the

[00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:13.670]
guy said and i thought that those are words to live by and i was thinking you know i feel the same way

[00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:20.730]
so maybe i am getting old you know anyway look at this mike spindle a great broadcasting star of

[00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:26.510]
the past well yeah the past and hopefully the the way past i've given up the business

[00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:31.110]
well actually with the aggravation you guys have gone through well you can relate to it you

[00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:37.010]
still have a lot of fun on sunday well no it's not only that but uh you know it's for anybody who

[00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:42.570]
has been in the broadcast media uh the the chilling effect the reason i called his first of all

[00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:48.030]
to voice my support and to say that you know anything that i can do uh uh i've already written my

[00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:56.110]
letter and it's gone out along with a cassette no more forgetting no i could buy just by the way you

[00:55:56.110 --> 00:56:02.330]
did get your cassette didn't you oh thank god thank goodness okay after you had totally embarrassed

[00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:06.990]
and you milleted me on the air but that was the price of getting the cassette the reason that i

[00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:12.230]
called is first of all to voice the support but also a very that uh unusual thing you had it on the

[00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:17.750]
news yesterday and it was in the herald this morning about florida has one of our nation's highest

[00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:23.970]
instances of censorship in public school yeah i saw that and you know that was running on your

[00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:28.470]
news at the bottom of the hour at the top of the hour and you just listening to that in schools and

[00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:34.210]
you know that the atmosphere that uh permeates south florida and permeates the state is something that

[00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:39.910]
you and in your own way and in in the humorous way and a steve in his way is trying to basically combat

[00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:45.670]
well you know it is unfortunate that we live in a neanderthal state but keep in mind a lot of that

[00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:50.050]
stuff goes on up in the central and northern part of the state where they have these neanderthal

[00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:54.650]
backwater kind of redneck yahoo's who are running the school systems and of course there are those

[00:56:54.650 --> 00:57:00.630]
people here who try to do the same thing but um you know the amazing part of it is that over the last

[00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:05.790]
several months thanks to our good friend you know this program and yours truly we've been investigated

[00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:11.730]
by just about every agency except the cia and they find nothing wrong with a program nothing

[00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:15.270]
inappropriate about anything that we're doing and the only problem they have is with a person

[00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:21.430]
who's instigated the investigations yeah it it's bizarre you know i i look at it two different ways

[00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:28.010]
the way that i look at it is uh your frustration shows through and uh it was a time for you more

[00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:33.350]
or less to air what went on now that it becomes a legitimate news story but uh isn't it in a way

[00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:39.350]
something that uh this character has been kind of looking for also the the you know the the

[00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:44.890]
mention or the not mention of his name but the uh he's probably just getting off on the mention of

[00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:48.850]
you know i don't know i don't think so a lot of people believe that but i you know he's he's been

[00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:52.950]
reveling in the fact that he's been able to do all this without us being able to talk about it and

[00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:57.190]
do it in the dark without you know people exposing what's been going on and now that people are

[00:57:57.190 --> 00:58:01.570]
getting wind of it including the sponsors and they realize that they're not isolated or alone uh

[00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:05.490]
you know they're prepared to respond believe me it's the greatest thing that could have happened

[00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:10.030]
we thank sonny Rosenberg profusely absolutely i think the city of allen dale should hang its head

[00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:14.530]
because it was used in this situation yeah but the the only other thing i want to say is for

[00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:19.570]
anybody out there that wants the supporter continues to support your station yourself and Steve is

[00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:24.250]
just a patronize responses at the bottom line you bet listen best of luck to all of you thanks a lot

[00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:29.370]
Mike take care 25 past 11 that's Mike's been del and let me tell you about neutral system right now

[00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:37.530]
or two it's 29 past 11 at w i o d let's take the mobile and then we'll get into this other

[00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:43.710]
incredible story yes it is incredible mobile and broard hello yeah yeah man i've been out of town

[00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:48.730]
for about a week now and i just tune in today what's going on what's what's he trying to do now

[00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:52.250]
what's he trying to do now well the same thing he's been trying to do for 19 months and that is

[00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:57.410]
get me off the air and he's been you know harassing our sponsors and harassing anybody's you know

[00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:02.370]
i know and now he got the city of allen dale the other day to pass a resolution condemning the

[00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:06.550]
program and all of this other baloney all right so now that it's a legitimate new story and it's

[00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:10.510]
been written up in the newspapers we can talk about it and it's out of the closet so to speak

[00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:13.830]
oh yeah yeah i've been listening to you ever since uh

[00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:18.770]
uh cologne got in here and w i n z and uh i've been enjoying your show i've got nothing yet

[00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:23.870]
great and all right well i just want to see what that was about well i wouldn't lose any sleep i mean

[00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:27.430]
every we're going to be here but uh just one of those things in life you know there's always

[00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:36.530]
got to be one yeah in every crowd okay listen you have a good one i just want to tell them to

[00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:41.650]
oh that's going to be almost as big as ponderous that expression govern yourself accordingly

[00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:46.210]
every one of his threatening letters at the end it always says govern yourself accordingly

[00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:52.490]
which is just amusing itself anyway now wait a minute he can't go out of here you can't leave now

[00:59:52.490 --> 01:00:00.190]
where the hell are you going no no no no forget about the phone call you you started the problem now

[01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:05.150]
let's get into this this we're changing gears momentarily for just a bit but fat rich who tends to

[01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:10.850]
be a radio yanta anyway yes uh told someone in the room it's not me so there's only one other person

[01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:17.790]
in the room moments ago that captain Dave and this is like third hand somebody else told fat rich

[01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:23.670]
who is telling the bird that captain Dave over at zeta made a scurrilous attack against the bird

[01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:27.450]
on the air over their weaker soga which shocking that anybody would have heard it because nobody's

[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:32.370]
listening about that's what's amazing that is shocking but uh i find it very hard to believe because

[01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:37.990]
capita calls me frequently and uh i don't he certainly never indicated to me any man amosity there

[01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:44.710]
and davin i worked together years ago at love 94 and i thought we were friends and we worked together at

[01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:52.110]
zeta and i never ever had any run in with Dave ever and if he went on the air and said things

[01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:57.590]
about i'd like to hear from him yeah about allegedly he said he's the worst cackler the worst

[01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:02.590]
something and anyway i have his home phone number or is there everything in my hand maybe we'll

[01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:06.110]
call him on the air and get this straight now because i don't we shouldn't have any problems with

[01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:09.630]
captain Dave i mean there are plenty of other people in that building that were not too fond of

[01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:13.990]
sure i mean to someone else i could anybody in management over there but they're plenty of people

[01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:19.270]
who are just subhuman douchebags over there but he's not one of me at least at the moment i thought

[01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:24.290]
pretty good guy yeah it turns out that the story is true of course he will also be a that's right subhuman

[01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:30.970]
douchebag but he never i'm there you know the year we worked on zeta with Dave nothing ever ever

[01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:37.090]
how i never had the end you know for three people working together in a totally spontaneous thing

[01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:43.130]
not even coming every there was never even the slightest problem well he's not among us i mean

[01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:46.650]
there were other problems that i know on many of which were connected to what we're discussing

[01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:50.610]
these last couple of days and of course there were those occasional problems with the

[01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:54.950]
uh... moody program director who would come in the morning and then march into the control room while

[01:01:54.950 --> 01:02:01.310]
we were on the air and give us dirty frowning hostile looks that happened on two or three occasions

[01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:07.390]
which i found um... totally bushly and unacceptable and in fact he was in there constantly when i

[01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:13.630]
could never figure that out you he loved it i don't know i don't know and he would like talk out

[01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:18.710]
loud in the background while the show is going on i just i don't understand him at all at rose

[01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:23.730]
but of course when you know guy named rose that uh... you got to have some questions about that

[01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.770]
to begin with i don't know too many guys named rose you i know pete rose but not too many guys

[01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:34.410]

speaking yeah yeah oh oh oh he confused me shocking hey i listened to that show the one that uh

[01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:41.710]
somebody called and said something about this data show yeah uh but it wasn't uh camp day

[01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:50.010]
who was it it was uh brad no well he was contributed but it was uh the kernel the private

[01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:55.050]
whatever the kernel ah well here's a little explanation on the story now here's a gentleman who

[01:09:55.050 --> 01:10:01.410]
is a w i o d spy yeah who heard the aforementioned uh business over there so it was the kernel

[01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:07.610]
ripping the bird yeah because i guess the bird sits on about uh he mentions on about talent

[01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:14.250]
or lack of uh something like that yeah uh what i did was i i heard a new idea i didn't know

[01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:19.190]
you were there yeah i just came back all right i'm sorry uh what i did was i uh guess what he's

[01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:25.870]
eaten for lunch he's got a b l t i uh i said that the show was the closest thing to unlistable i

[01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:30.630]
had ever heard of my life which is correct which is correct and he really took offense to that

[01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:34.750]
well that's a good explanation yeah because i was looking around at dials and i you know

[01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:39.290]
dating never saw him but they're talking and he remember that sound effect the one i don't hear too

[01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:44.610]
much and you guys go to the park you know that one yeah yeah it was kind of like this one yeah

[01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:49.670]
well it's the bird you know they're the cat the cackel the one you guys use all the time and uh

[01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:54.630]
but did he name me by name oh yeah yeah i had to call you the the world's luckiest human

[01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:59.550]
really oh yeah it was pretty uh it was pretty intensive well when the when the next trend comes out

[01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:05.350]
on the 24th of February he may be the the kernel maybe one of the world's unlucky to be working on

[01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:09.190]
that particular radio station because they're going to have to get a magnifying glass to read the numbers

[01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:13.810]
really so what he was saying was i had to talent and stuff like that yeah you were the world's luckiest

[01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:19.350]
human and i would yeah that was basically it but they kept on on and on yeah well that's what it

[01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:24.550]
was that's what i said and he was sort of like you know i want to tell you a little story okay and

[01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:27.970]
i have never really gone through this before because i don't feel that we need to prove anything

[01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:34.030]
because you know the the track record speaks for itself but back during the summer of 87 when we

[01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:40.130]
were on i and z doing midday we we eventually got to see we had a nine cheer in the spring book

[01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:45.430]
and then we got to see the breakdown of some of the uh numbers day by day and on the day before

[01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:51.170]
i went on vacation on a friday we had average quarter hour listeners of 111,000 in the summer which

[01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:55.850]
i don't think any station in this market has ever had an average quarter hour like that thank you

[01:11:55.850 --> 01:12:01.230]
Sharon and uh the monday following that when i wasn't there Glenn was doing a show alone with

[01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:09.010]
nobody else he had 93 or 94,000 people listening on that day without me okay right so anybody wants

[01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:13.310]
to put him down and go into a song of dance is only doing it because of jealousy and because of

[01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:18.510]
their own lack of ability to generate an audience yeah and it is a fact sir it isn't black and white

[01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:24.730]
that the record ratings we got back then the nine and the seven five was when i was on the show

[01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:31.070]
i agree you know uh the big ratings were when i was there i thought i'd do a little pink one

[01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:34.850]
on you i appreciate it okay thanks a lot thanks for waiting in that uh you know of course i'm

[01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:39.450]

[01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:03.870]
wasn't kept in day if it was uh the kernel with some help from bread the buck kissing uh kernel or

[01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:08.450]
whatever it was for a little loop because it was ridiculous yeah i didn't make any sounds but you

[01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:42.610]
to pay why i would fact you something on the machine it's really easy to get through if anybody's

[01:27:42.610 --> 01:27:48.870]
wondering how hard it's going to be great 757 7516 um i know i'm still not anything to do with the

[01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:54.710]
uh how and they'll people but i like to know what happened to uh over jr he calls his once in a

[01:27:54.710 --> 01:28:00.250]
while once in a while he jm yeah well he's not in uh he's not in your support group or oh yeah

[01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:05.750]
yeah i'd like to hear from him if he's out there okay i'm sure he is man i bet you you ask for him

[01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:11.390]
it's like asking for fall harby junior to call it just a matter of moments i understand i know

[01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:16.490]
think it even okay thanks well 1215 and wild we have a request now we're getting requests for

[01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:22.010]
callers now do you like that we cut out requesting for songs now we're getting requests for callers

[01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:30.810]
if vegi and bokeh's calling in come on be careful now with it you gotta be careful with that air i can't

[01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:41.850]
stay mad at the vege can you he just he just wanted a bumper sticker that's all he just wanted us to

[01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:46.910]
arrange our lives uh for his convenience he's just a big fan you don't want to hurt his feelings do

[01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:53.810]
he's a nealy yeah yeah so to speak anyway joey is on his way i don't know whether joey's walking

[01:28:53.810 --> 01:29:00.450]
what do you have to sell his car come on joey get serious will you but uh oh you did send him a

[01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:08.230]
bumper sticker already so if the vege calls that that can't be the excuse anymore i got a great idea

[01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:13.290]
i think we just ought to do this spontaneously okay because it sounds like it makes sense to me

[01:29:14.010 --> 01:29:21.870]
if people will send letters of support to me oh we will send them one of those new

[01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:27.190]
unbelievable new Rogers wio debumper stickers how's that sound that's a good way to get a lot of

[01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:32.890]
people off there but because most people want something you know we won't send him any tapes

[01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:40.150]
a bumper sticker sure and we'll have rich mail them and in very tiny Hebrew letters in the back

[01:29:40.150 --> 01:29:47.910]
i'm gonna write some really racy stuff okay so that's a good idea just send your letters and

[01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:53.790]
request for the bumper stickers the near Rogers wio d mi m e three three one four one they read

[01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:57.330]
they don't look too bad it look good as a matter of fact it's great isn't that a good idea and

[01:29:57.330 --> 01:30:03.290]
sharing of course can fill all the requests and there's more stuff what is this oh this is uh oh

[01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:08.550]

[01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:31.090]
blin yes i am a long time listener and a first time caller well i hope this call isn't being traced by

[01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:37.190]
sunny no it's not anyway congratulations on your great three publicity in the haldale die

[01:33:37.190 --> 01:33:41.930]
jesse i normally pick it up at the weekend but i couldn't wait to get it today to see what they

[01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:48.430]
had written about you um anyway i just wanted to share a story with you i picked up my 10-year-old

[01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:52.570]
daughter yesterday from school and of course she always misses you but she likes listening to

[01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:58.150]
on sess day morning and she has Steve paint talking about you and she said mommy what's happened

[01:33:58.150 --> 01:34:04.870]
to nail rogers so i told her very very briefly and her answer was what all we have to do is turn the

[01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:12.230]
dial now this is from a 10-year-old kid and so it makes you wonder you know what the old people

[01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:18.430]
are all about i mean i've lived in halandell for seven years or i should say i have survived in

[01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:25.190]
halandell for seven years and uh it's pretty sad in a way you know i'm hoping to learn a very very

[01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:31.390]
dear lesson for the future anyway another thing i wanted to mention to you i would be interested

[01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:39.490]
to know whether mr. Thompson's law firm is behind him in all this uh or whether he he practices on

[01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:48.430]
his own on his own yeah oh he does well that's out and also it's amazing because um the florida bar

[01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:55.330]
has been receiving over the last few months a lot of adverse publicity um in their dealings with

[01:34:55.330 --> 01:35:03.090]
clients etc etc and i'm surprised that he wants to bring even more attention to um colleagues and

[01:35:03.090 --> 01:35:07.550]
whoever you know in the florida bar it doesn't say an awful lot for the dogs bringing a lot of

[01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:11.290]
attention to themself and he really ought to govern himself accordingly you know what i'm saying

[01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:16.110]
well i mean it's very very interesting because the law is very different from england where i come

[01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:21.130]
from and um it will be very interesting to see what happens but i'm totally on your side and says

[01:35:21.130 --> 01:35:27.830]
my ten-year-old daughter and i have just about ten minutes ago meld a pro-neil letter excellent

[01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:33.210]

you shouldn't be so hard on these people from hale and day all forgetting caught up by those

[01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:28.230]
guide pumps and i mean that kind of mentality caper in around sixty seven-year-old guy

[01:36:28.230 --> 01:36:32.670]
slipping in an outhouse in the middle of the night yeah that should tell you how you're something

[01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:40.410]
okay well said sir thank you very much okay you're welcome 26 past noon at wiod

[01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:46.550]
boy those grapes are delicious yeah i'm gonna old choked up we have an open line in day seven five

[01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:54.850]
one air goes uh bokeh hello uh good afternoon nail yes sir hey listen i got a solution to uh that

[01:36:54.850 --> 01:37:01.970]
fool and how and nails problem your problem and my own problem yeah uh a few uh maybe it's been a

[01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:06.350]
couple years back i think you made an offer that if somebody gave you like a million bucks you'd

[01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:11.030]
get out of the market yeah okay well you're worth much more than a million dollars by now i'm

[01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:16.110]
making a lot more now since up to two million him okay we're here's there's a big problem to this

[01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:21.730]
actually there's two problems why don't you make them that offer again maybe say uh buy out your

[01:37:21.730 --> 01:37:26.790]
contract and come up with a couple of million bucks yeah the problem is it's how's he gonna raise

[01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:32.050]
two million bucks and how and Dale well maybe we could sell a discount packs of sweet and low that

[01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:39.950]
might do it well i see i'm uh thinking you know whatever it takes to get the job done and uh you know

[01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:43.930]
when you move out of the market you have to tell me where you're going so i can move there myself

[01:37:43.930 --> 01:37:47.970]
yeah well i'd probably keep it a big secret because you never know who else might move along with me

[01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:52.610]
you know no no no no you got to tell everybody where you're moving to because so we can just follow

[01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:57.530]
you there okay well make a long story short i'm not going anywhere okay uh well for two million

[01:37:57.530 --> 01:38:04.950]
bucks no uh maybe well dark on cuz he doesn't have to see i'd have to see the cash first okay when

[01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:08.870]
you see it in the front of you then you know it adds a different dimension yeah the child the old

[01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:13.350]
saying talk is cheap right the chances are real slim that they could raise two million bucks in

[01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:19.430]
a ton like that yeah and then uh the second problem was i want to share or two okay and then now

[01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:23.950]
well good luck you sir it's been a great call but it's getting really ponderous 1228 at WIOD we

[01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:34.630]
have an open line in bokeh 278 9463 278 WIOD and let's go to Miami hello hello Neil yes

[01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:41.310]
hello Neil hello Glenn hi hey uh i hear you from time to time you keep telling people if they don't

[01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:45.150]
like your program that she's just simply trying it all that is correct they have other old

[01:38:45.150 --> 01:38:50.390]
alternatives but the real truth of the matter is this Neil that there are no other WIOD programs

[01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:56.490]
you are mr radio well if that's the case then uh you know that's the bottom line sir that's right

[01:38:56.490 --> 01:39:00.690]
your radio then they got nothing to complain about that's right nissidently you did mention

[01:39:00.690 --> 01:39:07.670]
yesterday you wanted to send a box of halva with some x-lacks up the sunny i don't

[01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:11.990]
mention you i remember you saying that well let me put it to you this way it couldn't hurt no but

[01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:16.590]
the idea is this if you really want to make his eyes stand out of his head save the halva

[01:39:17.130 --> 01:39:23.290]
send him the x-lacks cover with chocolate and mix with a little crazy glue i think that

[01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:27.430]
is really good to trick i was thinking of doing that with my dog but you know being a great

[01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:31.610]
humanitarian i had a second feelings about it you know incidentally i'm Friday night when i

Glenn and they don't understand what i mean yeah i'm kidding a queen yeah but we know no you're wrong

[01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:46.670]

[01:39:46.670 --> 01:39:51.390]

lifetime Miami hello oh no yeah yeah i got a blue hair observation for you yes sir yeah we're

[01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:29.130]
gonna grocery store and you'd be amazed at how many people are actually shopping for the first

[01:42:29.130 --> 01:42:34.490]
time in their life because to me they come in there they're lost i mean but so many people buy

[01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:38.290]
milk for the first time in their life to stand there for five minutes and just wonder what this

[01:42:38.690 --> 01:42:44.450]
well it's a very complex thing to do you know i don't end grocery shopping yeah i mean it's like the

[01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:47.930]
first time everybody in their life because every time asking where is it at where's the milk at

[01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:51.830]
where's the milk at every if you know it's the same thing over and over and over again yeah and then

[01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:55.790]
of course they go into the meat department and squeeze the meat which always just wine drags me nuts

[01:42:55.790 --> 01:43:00.130]
right and then when they get up there they have a hole in the package when they're nails through

[01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:04.390]
yeah but the the thumprin in the meat is little you know the where it's okay if they take it but

[01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:09.210]
then when they leave it you know but yeah then that that's the reason if you squeeze one the next

[01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:12.150]
one you get to be a good one and you just throw that there we're back because now that's an

[01:43:12.150 --> 01:43:15.710]
interesting philosophy life if you squeeze one the next one you get's gonna be a good one i

[01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:21.230]
just definitely words to live by and i got one other thing um sometimes i go to fiu and you know

[01:43:21.230 --> 01:43:24.750]
i listen to wolfie release when i'm down there because it's like a hero but they're not on that

[01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:42.810]
we do as a matter of a they put us on a leash so we can only get as far as the door

[01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:53.030]
let's go to Miami hello hello yes hello uh deal yes sir i just wanted to say that we supported you

[01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:59.150]
and we had a letter out Tuesday thank you to support you and uh one thing i want to remind you of

[01:46:59.150 --> 01:47:04.490]
that i you know i listen to you most every day some days when i have to go out i put you on a tape

[01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:10.610]
and one day about three weeks ago you had a real hilarious story about the

[01:47:10.610 --> 01:47:16.210]
balanday commission with a guy named freebie with his doc and all that yeah the doc that was

[01:47:16.210 --> 01:47:22.150]
uh six inches too long right oh yeah right yeah and i i had a leave right in the middle of that

[01:47:22.150 --> 01:47:26.810]
and i i stayed until the last minute and i taped it and i just happened to hear listen to that

[01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:31.710]
tape again this morning and i said yeah to remind you about that yeah but you hadn't mentioned it

[01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:38.010]
and it was a real funny story about something about his doc being a couple inches too big and he

[01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:43.930]
was in front of the commission and they first approved it and then they uh they rescinded the

[01:47:43.930 --> 01:47:49.150]
primate and all that and he was in all kinds of trouble they called each other names yeah do you

[01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:54.010]
remember that story as you're how can you forget it yeah and i were just wondering that uh you know

[01:47:54.890 --> 01:48:01.470]
if you contacted that guy or whoever he is uh uh i forgot what the names were but uh

[01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:07.910]
you contacted that guy for uh to go down with you he he has the same harassment problem as

[01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:12.670]
everybody else that goes down from that company yeah absolutely yeah well i guess they got no real

[01:48:12.670 --> 01:48:16.890]
problems over there in hell and there would you that's probably a great PR thing for them for the

[01:48:16.890 --> 01:48:20.310]
chamber of commerce over there because when you live in a city that only has time for stuff like

[01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:25.830]
this they must have everything under control yeah you said it you said it well okay i just want to

[01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:30.890]
remind you about that because i noticed it was so close to you know not exactly like your story but

[01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:36.290]
you know just another problem with that commission that everybody seems to be having it's unbelievable

[01:48:37.450 --> 01:48:43.270]
okay good luck to you have a good time thanks a lot it's 1242 at wio d we have an open line in

deal go to Miami hello uh nale yeah how you doing great i want to say something is my philosophy

[01:52:45.010 --> 01:52:48.670]
about people in howl and down the difference between the old people in my and my me beach yes

[01:52:48.670 --> 01:52:56.770]
people in my me beach are educated they know how to turn a dial you may be right people in howl

[01:52:57.330 --> 01:53:02.930]
has them brainwash that they can't turn it yeah so uh mason dual letter addressed to him

[01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:07.630]
well maybe sonny still has one of those old uh what do they call those radios with the crystal set

[01:53:07.630 --> 01:53:14.050]
yeah you know that only tunes in one station well i'm mason dual letter to send him and i hope

[01:53:14.050 --> 01:53:19.290]
there's no restriction on what we can say not as long as we got anything to do about it okay thanks

[01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:26.690]
a lot 1246 at wiod we have an open line in date 751 wiod 751 946

[01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:31.970]
by the way our attorney friend thinks that i called him a flaming fegalo or so he alleges and

[01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:36.990]
something i just saw uh haven't done that at any point my reference to that is always to sonny

[01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:40.990]
Rosenberg the mayor of howl and they'll know any reason i say that is to remind the audience that

[01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:46.770]
he used that line about me two years ago which is a totally bigoted and disgusting homophobic

[01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:52.670]
remark uh and for the mayor of a of a for a public official in any city to be making that comment

[01:53:52.670 --> 01:53:56.810]
is just reprehensible but that should give you an idea of his mentality where he's coming from

[01:53:56.810 --> 01:54:01.390]
so if they're god forbid any gay people who live in hallowed day or you might want to check around

[01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:06.110]
and move out okay because obviously the mayor of your city has got some serious problems with homophobia

[01:54:06.110 --> 01:54:13.710]
serious serious serious serious serious look at that these staff at my mean international airport

[01:54:14.770 --> 01:54:18.250]

[01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:16.710]
know the who are the stereotyp of the things we talk about here all of time yeah and because they

[01:56:16.710 --> 01:56:20.350]

[01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:46.630]
we sure did we tell we read parts of it on the air yeah i like i like the one that said the

[01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:51.890]
cities crusade against rogers eventually died a natural death because of a lack of support according

[01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:58.110]
to the ayatola in tindola what's this problem that guy well i think lack of common sense lack of any

[01:57:58.110 --> 01:58:01.930]
you know since they can't do anything positive about the real problems over there they have to make

[01:58:01.930 --> 01:58:06.390]
a lot of simmiss about this kind of stuff yeah tell me this uh also Thompson said that it's not

[01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:11.170]
a vendetta against you not a personal vendetta oh yeah how long has been going on with him only 19

and we've got some very nice elderly people and we get along just wonderfully

[01:58:28.630 --> 01:58:33.370]
mm-hmm well there's a lot there a lot of them out there i'd say i'd say even maybe 30 40 percent

[01:58:33.370 --> 01:58:38.430]
of our senior citizens are reasonable rational people who you know feel a lot younger than their

[01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:42.090]
real age and that's great yeah so then we have that other gigantic and i have to take

[01:58:42.090 --> 01:58:46.450]
exception with one thing steve yet said yesterday said it's just a small handful of these people it's

[01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:51.470]
not true at all they're a gigantic numbers of people out there who's behavior in restaurants and

[01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:57.150]
supermarkets on a highway everywhere they go is just absolutely socially unacceptable we we have a

[01:58:57.150 --> 01:59:01.410]
few that are just sourpuses but i think those people have been sourpuses all their life yeah yeah

[01:59:01.410 --> 01:59:05.630]
they were they were prunes when they were 15 and 20 you right neo you hang in there buddy we're

[01:59:47.690 --> 01:59:54.450]
talking loud enough for you in pombi? Miami hello hey meal yeah um one of the things i think the

[01:59:54.450 --> 01:59:58.910]
prop near the problem might be with these old forts the reason they don't turn their dial is

[01:59:58.910 --> 02:00:02.590]
they're afraid they're going to miss something hysterically funny yeah you know they can't

[02:00:02.590 --> 02:00:06.950]
turn it off which is true because yeah do you say something that's going to offend them but it's

[02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:10.690]
a serically funny anyway by the way just got this you're going to love this nick just gave me a note

[02:00:10.690 --> 02:00:15.970]
on the screen it says he's getting some calls from older people who hate me then they crank

[02:00:15.970 --> 02:00:19.590]
nick and they hang up they well they don't have the guts to stay on the line and make fools of

[02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:24.630]
themselves on a year no so they're harassing him on the phone now if they hate me now seriously

[02:00:24.630 --> 02:00:30.330]
if they hate me and are that obnoxious then how come they're still listening right now because

[02:00:30.330 --> 02:00:36.630]
they're obnoxious exactly great term for we're giving them fodder for their lives in other words

[02:00:36.630 --> 02:00:41.230]
this is what their whole lives are about our bitterness and hate and being nasty and rotten and try

[02:00:41.230 --> 02:00:45.530]
to spread it around and so we're obviously because they hate it so much we're doing a pubic service

[02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:49.670]
for them yeah i was listening well i was listening to Steve yesterday and listening to some people

[02:00:49.670 --> 02:00:55.290]

[02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:59.490]
anything that they were saying yeah well every time he kept answering asking a question they would

[02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:38.590]
in an amazing that we go through three hours everything was just like well this is the big one

[02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:44.910]
to tell that's true this is the big one to two out yeah everything was just great in all of

[02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:49.210]
a sense like we ran into a brick wall it is so typical in this town i'll tell you there's an

[02:06:49.210 --> 02:06:53.470]
open line in brown word five two four w i'll do lots of other ones are flashing don't

[02:06:53.470 --> 02:07:00.710]
to get too carried away my amry hello yes sir listen i'm not calling too much to talk on the topic

[02:07:00.710 --> 02:07:04.750]
because it's kind of like arguing for child abuse i mean for what this guy's doing is wrong and i

[02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:08.930]
think everyone see that i don't think you've gotten too many positive comments on his side

[02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:12.970]
okay we haven't gotten any on this show Steve got a couple but that's about it but i think

[02:07:13.050 --> 02:07:16.430]
that's listening to last couple days i've heard a lot of it been uh

[02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:23.030]
relayed on freedom of speech it seems more like persecution here than than uh trying to change

[02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:27.870]
the content of your show it doesn't seem like anyone's really trying to say kneel should take this

[02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:31.750]
out or this is or put this hand or something like that or you're saying get rid of kneel and they

[02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:36.590]
hadn't that been the case for the last two years no no he he objects to peace by being no matter

[02:07:36.590 --> 02:07:41.050]
what we do you know no matter whether it's music or anything and then of course if we take it out

[02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:44.930]
then he finds ten new things that he objects to show you know the bottom line as he wants to give me

[02:07:44.930 --> 02:07:49.730]
off and he continues denying that but i mean anybody who's got an IQ over two who looks at the

[02:07:49.730 --> 02:07:53.930]
pattern of the things that have been done and how malicious they are could come to no other conclusion

[02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:57.890]
believe me well i got to tell you you're lucky i got to tell you that i feel like you're lucky to

[02:07:57.890 --> 02:08:02.470]
have the support you've got at this station because recently i went to something along the same

[02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:08.570]
line not not to the extent you are and allegations were made now is removed from a position

[02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:14.490]
completely unfounded allegations and you know uh... inflammatory uh... slanderers

[02:08:14.490 --> 02:08:19.690]
oh my god and when i'm trying to find out is uh... where the allegations of you know i've heard

[02:08:19.690 --> 02:08:23.710]
you said they said you were trying to pick up boys and everything oh yeah but it was any of that

[02:08:23.710 --> 02:08:29.230]

any of those allegations ever published in the in the print magazine are are sure absolutely

[02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:39.430]
because they they one of the local papers called all of the my story and publish it and

[02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:43.350]
they're unfounded and they didn't even try to contact either the parties involved

[02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:48.390]
yeah i was wondering if there's any records or if you get yourself a good lawyer pal that's what

[02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:53.030]
you got to do yeah because the basically i i'm not going to be able to work in uh... they count

[02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:22.010]
teach you okay all right when i was a kid when i first started a radio i was a kid my reasons

[02:14:22.010 --> 02:14:25.970]
for getting into radio were because i was a poor kid and we were in a i was the last-wide family

[02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:29.710]
in all black neighborhood my family was we wanted to get out of there we had no money we had a

[02:14:29.710 --> 02:14:33.570]
why did you want to get out there we were in poverty that's i hated poverty you were racist that

[02:14:33.570 --> 02:14:37.090]
what you don't know i wanted to get out of the neighborhood we were in we had nothing we had a

[02:14:37.090 --> 02:14:41.490]
thirty dollar a month cold water flat so the best way that i could express myself was to go to the

[02:14:41.490 --> 02:14:46.430]
boys club play basketball to the boys yeah and they had up what is this like an announcement we

[02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:50.990]
have coming today i saw you hanging around the playground there i was on the pay system i know who

[02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:56.870]
you've been talking to listen to me all right when i first got into radio the reasons for radio were

[02:14:56.870 --> 02:15:02.710]
to serve the public and have fun with the public we were trying to entertain folks the next level

[02:15:02.710 --> 02:15:07.850]
came up we're trying to entertain the owners so that we get the good jobs now the next level

[02:15:07.850 --> 02:15:11.790]
that came up we're entertaining the sponsors so we would get some national business now we're

[02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:17.330]
entertaining banks and radio is really come from what i said when it was a mom a pop store do you

[02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:21.290]
understand what he's talking about that really no evolution of radio it's gotten it's gotten to be

[02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:25.350]
a scientific game it used to be an art now it's a science that's all i'm saying they got everything

[02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:30.430]

[02:22:50.330 --> 02:22:53.150]
like a town hall meeting you know these public appearances he does they were not

I mean you were mentioned from the stage you're great I am a star here and you

[02:23:01.250 --> 02:23:08.150]
answer my question when you get me on a show tonight it's on tonight you don't

[02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:12.730]
want to be positioned as trash radio like I was I don't introduce me as tonight

[02:23:12.730 --> 02:23:17.690]
he will open that microphone and he will say now here is the you ready for this

[02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:23.390]
the grandfather of schlock you want to be known as that hey listen if it gets me

[02:23:23.390 --> 02:23:28.890]
if he made 22 million last year okay 40 40 million while he reported 22

[02:23:28.890 --> 02:23:36.210]
huh okay more well it's been nice knowing you man you're gonna like those nice

[02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:40.150]
private rooms they give you anyway so you're gonna be on tonight and they

[02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:43.810]
talked about trash radio and he introduces me as the schlockmaster you know like

[02:23:43.810 --> 02:23:46.850]
he's the salt and a sleaze and here I get this yeah but this is all can try

[02:23:46.850 --> 02:23:49.490]
I mean his whole show is can try you guys set this up ahead of time and you

[02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:52.810]
love it no you did not tell me that you threw me a left-con by doing the

[02:23:52.810 --> 02:23:57.730]
expo tree a thing and I am the world's most shameless self promoter I really

[02:23:57.730 --> 02:24:01.870]
am but certainly not the king of sleaze no I mean I am the if anything I'm in the

[02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:04.670]
whole of shy why didn't he have Howard on that show Howard who

[02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:10.490]
hmm co-surn Howard Stern well Howard Stern doesn't do those gangbangs he

[02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:13.870]
refuses to be on a gangbang the first lesson in those shows because you only

[02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:17.710]
get your moment and if it's not a brilliant moment you die so therefore I

[02:24:17.710 --> 02:24:21.170]
don't recommend you do that by the way Howard is not good on TV anyways horrendous

[02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:24.950]
on TV he's tried more like he was gonna do that Fox Hill that never material

[02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:28.730]
100 times he promoted it and it never materialized then he did that videotape

[02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:32.590]
that he's made a fortune off of yes horrendive you seen it yeah it's not too long

[02:24:32.590 --> 02:24:36.430]
it's got a few you know it's got its moments but overall it's pathetic Howard

[02:24:36.430 --> 02:24:40.210]
does not a TV person as a half hour special it would have been fine I like

[02:24:40.210 --> 02:24:44.710]
don't you like trash absolutely me you know those are hysterical uncertain days

[02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:47.810]
you know you know trash and bad trash that is correct I heard you say that and of

[02:24:47.810 --> 02:24:51.310]
course we put all of our trash in the plantation bags of God for God doesn't get

[02:24:51.310 --> 02:24:56.390]
removed oh gee we have to talk about plantation I love how I'm down I love the

[02:24:56.390 --> 02:24:59.130]
sweet and lower routine that you do I brought that to New York and claimed it

[02:24:59.130 --> 02:25:03.010]
as my own material what was that routine you do about the early Bruce

[02:25:03.010 --> 02:25:09.170]
but well wait wait till I get a more downy man I'm gonna expose you anyway

[02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:12.450]

[02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:28.090]
most of this stuff comes from is listeners you'd like rats in my room yeah I mean

[02:25:28.090 --> 02:25:31.150]
you got it that's pretty obscure to be able to go back and find that thing you

[02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:33.990]
know who still is the most is Robin William so he'll go to watch young comics in
