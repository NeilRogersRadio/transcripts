[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]
the weekend and we said maybe you'd like to get an honest job and stop trying to buy a pick

[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.140]
of the poach as they say. And after he gave Boy Gary a poke in the eye he said,

[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.480]
that's pretty cute. Why don't you come in and do Steve show on Thursday and he said,

[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.700]
but I never did a radio show. The guy worked in Orlando I guess, huh?

[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.700]
Yeah. And he's going to be talking about two really exciting topics today. The

[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.900]
scuttling of the Eastern sale. Now what I don't, um, nobody knows who he is. There's a

[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.660]
no. I'm not joking about Nick wants to know we don't know. Either Boy Gary don't know who he is.

[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.900]
But he's breathing. Okay. See that in this market. If you're breathing that's about it. You

[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.120]
can be on the air. You can have your own show by probably by next Monday. You'll have like

[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.300]
replacing brush pink bag. And then from four to six he's going to have the ban on assault rifles

[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.420]
which this gun control we haven't heard about that in the least two or three days.

[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.200]
State Senator Howard Foreman and Bennett Greenberg of shooters in Poryham. How's the

[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.660]
skyline named Greenberg selling guns? He must be importing oozees from the Israelis or something.

[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.420]
What's that all about? Okay. Twenty past eleven we got a call in a mobile in Broward. Hello.

[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.780]
Neil, good morning. Yes, sir. Are you aware of who's in first place in a national

[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.620]
league this morning? Nationally east. How about the cups? Well, we're tired. Well, what do you mean?

[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.180]
Do you think I don't know? Five and a row, my friend. No. I would love to be though. That's

[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.000]
part of my vacation when I have just a week in July or August to this. I'm going to go up to

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.760]
Riggley Field. It is absolutely a fabulous place to see a ballgame. You know, being from New York

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.740]
and living near Episfield, we used to go there all the time and watch the boys of summer.

[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.620]
And as a result of all these football parks that they've opened up over the years when you get

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.580]
to a place like Riggley and watch a ballgame. It's an absolute delight. Yeah, these other places are

[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.000]
really sterile. Have you ever have you watched any games from Montreal from that old, is it

[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.480]
Olympia, Stadium, Olympic Stadium, whatever they call it? Not this year. It is the most sterile

[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.920]
looking place. It looks like it was made out of a cookie cutter or something. It has no personality

[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.360]
at all. I hear you. And they got and they got a retractable roof on that stadium and the great

[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.460]
part of it is once they got it built, they don't know how to get the roof back. They don't know

[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.140]
how to slide it back. Yeah, it's four days in July when it gets warm in Montreal. Incidentally,

[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.060]
the people over at La Tavina are really annoyed at you because the evidence you're on your

[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.060]
doochers systems diet. You don't go in there anymore to eat. Well, I don't go anywhere else to eat

[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.500]
either. I'd listen. Tell them if I'm, you know, if I have a stroke and I'm in the ground,

[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.760]
I won't be eating too many meals there either. So tell them just to relax. Everything will be just fine.

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.180]
In fact, they even told me they're going to take your picture off the wall.

[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.420]
No, they won't. I know better than that. Tell them to have a good day.

[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.340]
Okay, bye-bye.

[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.680]
21 past 11 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward at 524 WIOD.

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.620]
The cup's stuck.

[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.020]
And should we take one more before the break from Hollywood? Hello.

[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.800]
Hi, Neil.

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.860]
Hi. How are you doing?

[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.280]
Great.

[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.020]
Listen, I just want to know, does anybody know off there if they're going to be

[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.420]
televising Robbie Keneble's jump tomorrow night?

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.960]
Well, I know that I'm going to get it on the satellite, but I'd say pay-per-view thing.

[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.480]
Maybe I won't get it. Maybe it'll be one of those real scrambled. I don't know,

[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.120]
but it's pay-per-view, so you're not going to get it on your regular cable.

[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.780]
Okay, I guess you're in.

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.780]
Now, what do you think about that? I've been watching all the previews for it.

[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.640]
I'm a little nervous myself, you know.

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.700]
I am too. I don't have good feelings about that.

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.420]
Don't you think some of these people are a little nuts?

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.360]
I mean, I know there's a lot of money. How much is it?

[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.560]
I'm not sure. I don't even know the amount.

[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.580]
In the millions. I forget how many million, but even so.

[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.320]
I just followed it's father's jump.

[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.880]
Yeah.

[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.300]
Just interested in it.

[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.500]
Okay, well, I'll tell you what, maybe I'll tape it.

[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.500]
Okay.

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.080]
And then I can describe it to you.

[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.420]
And if it doesn't turn out good, then I'll just forget about it, you know.

[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.860]
I guess we'll all hear it then.

[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.820]
Yeah. Then you'll probably see it 400 times on the news.

[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.140]
You know, slow motion, freeze frame, you know.

[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.160]
Really? Oh, and another thing, oh gosh.

[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.100]
That place up there, how 41 by the Honda Place, where you eat?

[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.580]
Oh, God.

[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.980]
Char-hut.

[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.660]
Yeah, they don't have the onion rings up here.

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.100]
Are you serious?

[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.920]
Yeah, we went in there the other night to get some and they do not have them.

[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.700]
Well, you better tell them to get on the stick, because the onion rings at all the other

[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.160]
char-huts are the best in the world.

[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.420]
So tell them to get with it.

[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.820]
Okay.

[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.840]
We're going to work on it.

[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.240]
Okay.

[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.840]
Okay, thanks.

[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.260]
Thank you.

[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.520]
Bye-bye.

[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.760]
Yeah, have you seen the previews for that thing?

[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.220]
For the jump?

[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.980]
I've seen some a little bit on it.

[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.660]
A whole little bit on it.

[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.680]
See, if you want to do something unique, you can go like to Hylia

[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.140]
and take a few thousand and plunge his brains out, then Phil will

[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.060]
escort him up to the roof and he can jump from there.

[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.720]
And then if things don't work out, they can like bury him right on the finish line.

[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.860]
No, I don't like those things either.

[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.280]
They make me, they, you gotta be nuts.

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.020]
You gotta be crazy to do that stuff.

[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.800]
How much is he getting for it?

[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.280]
I don't know.

[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.740]
I really don't.

[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.720]
Something to think about.

[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.520]
What is that?

[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.980]
A caller wants my view on

[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.480]
Lama Darian?

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.540]
What is that?

[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.160]
Lama Darian.

[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.400]
What race is he in?

[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.320]
La

[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.300]
Madrian restaurant.

[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.460]
I never heard of it, did you?

[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.140]
Mandarin.

[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.200]
Not Mandarin.

[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.700]
The Mandarin restaurant?

[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.700]
Which one?

[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.780]
The one in the grove?

[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.300]
There's one of them now, not in a grove.

[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.380]
That's one in Miami that's supposed to be tremendous.

[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.080]
What's it called?

[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.200]
The Mandarin Garden?

[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.620]
Mandarin Garden?

[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.140]
So I know that in Giro.

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.200]
Now we're gonna get all kind of choose.

[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.680]
There's one called the Mandarin something, which is supposed to be one of the greatest Chinese.

[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.260]
Yeah, the one in the grove is one of the best Chinese

[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.380]
out of the best Chinese.

[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.060]
Outside of Pokipsi.

[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.060]
Yeah, best Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten.

[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.840]
Mandarin Garden.

[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.400]
Well, if that's the one they're talking about.

[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.420]
Yeah, we'll get that straightened out.

[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.120]
In the meantime, isn't it amazing the way we just fall into these, like fallen off a rock?

[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.960]
Amazing.

[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.120]
Falling off a couple.

[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.600]
The Andrias for tremendous gourmet Italian food down there in South

[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.200]
Dade at 8800 Miller Road just west of Galawaian.

[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.420]
Boy, it is better than words can describe it for you.

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.220]
A huge menu with just loads and loads of entrees.

[00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.260]
In fact, it'd probably take me a half an hour to go through all the entrees on this menu.

[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.900]
In fact, that'll be a good way to kill a half hour.

[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.880]
Great pasta dishes of every kind of pasta, including some you've never even heard of before.

[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.840]
And fish and all kinds of other seafood.

[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.700]
Delicious, veal dishes.

[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.420]
Boy, they got a whole column almost of baby cow and chicken dishes and lots, lots more delicious

[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.200]
homemade soups.

[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.960]
Everything is homemade.

[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.360]
Everything is as fresh as the fallen snow and it is delicious.

[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.820]
The atmosphere is great.

[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.580]
They've got that big beautiful banquet room.

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.000]
If you've got something special coming up.

[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.080]
So if you want a great lunch or dinner and I mean really the very, very finest in northern

[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.060]
and southern Italian cooking, this is the place to find it.

[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.080]
De Andrias, 8800 Miller Road.

[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.020]
They're open 11.30 in the morning till 11 at night during the week Monday through Friday.

[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.580]
And then for dinner only on the weekends, but they're open late Saturday and Sunday 6 pm to 1am.

[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.840]
You tell them Neil sent you by to De Andrias.

[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.160]
When the skies began to dim and the air became thick, thousands of South Floridians turned to

[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.380]
News Talk Radio 610 for the answer.

[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.800]
The plot of forestry.

[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.620]
I'd have probably needed help that the National Guard would be able to provide it.

[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.940]
Our new center went into action, covering the story and letting you know what

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.360]
to do.

[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.120]
We're advising people to keep their air conditioners on and their windows closed.

[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.140]
And 610 WIOD meteorologist Bob Soeper provided frequent weather and surface condition

[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.820]
updates until the smoke passed.

[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.240]
Northeast winds should keep that smoke back inland.

[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.560]
Today I'll have the complete way.

[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.480]
There's something happening in South Florida.

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.460]
Turn to the station that gives you the story first.

[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.640]
Depend on it.

[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.840]
News Talk Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.180]
Now, more with Neil Rogers.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.480]
On News Talk Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:10.180]
Is that the neighbors can I see up ahead in the wash of a corner street light?

[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.920]
I'm not aiming.

[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.520]
They just never see me coming.

[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:22.700]
And I guess that's why they say every car has a hole.

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.740]
And I wonder if possible.

[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.860]
Some ever more.

[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:38.080]
Just like every roadkill leaves us a little far more.

[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.860]
Every car has a hole.

[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.220]
And I wonder if possible.

[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.220]
Oh.

[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.600]
Oh, back already.

[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.400]
Well, anybody, somebody called and said that Robby Kneeville's jump will be carried

[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.800]
live by ESPN from Vegas.

[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.500]
I don't believe that because it's pay per view.

[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.680]
And nobody in their right mind would pay for it because almost everybody's got ESPN.

[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.540]
It's got cable, right?

[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.420]
Everyone.

[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.220]
But anyway, we'll get it straight now.

[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.200]
It's only Thursday, right?

[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.900]
That's tomorrow night.

[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.860]
We've got plenty of time.

[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.860]
Open line is in the Palm Beach, which shocks the hell.

[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.420]
By the way, I left one show out today.

[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.960]
In fact, it could be on what time is she on here, Sally?

[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:27.980]
I could have just ended.

[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.900]
Oh, I mean, Sally just drunk in drivers meet their victims.

[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.500]
That ought to be a good one.

[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.300]
Okay, here's a mobile in Broward.

[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.580]
Hello.

[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.600]
Okay, well, that's just town for you.

[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.600]
Nobody's anywhere.

[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.900]
That was kind of cute.

[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.080]
Now, that's one of the very few times that's ever worked.

[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:49.940]
Yeah, right?

[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.880]
And I like that.

[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.920]
Yeah, that captain Dave's got a good sense of humor.

[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.500]
And it's about time he had a chance to use it again.

[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.540]
We have an open line in Broward 524 WIOD.

[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.200]
And Palm Beach is still a little dormant because they're all getting ready.

[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.340]
You know what it's for, don't you?

[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:02.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.340]
The big 12 to three hours.

[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.600]
Apoplectic.

[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.260]
They're all out there trying to get their windows open.

[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.540]
Unbelievable.

[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.860]
You know how sometimes if you don't open your windows for many months,

[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.500]
they get stuck and it's hard to get them open.

[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.640]
Well, they're all trying to crank those windows open now.

[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.240]
Because it's free radio from noon to three in Palm Beach County.

[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.400]
The Lee Fowler Show.

[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.480]
You know what I mean?

[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.680]
What do you think?

[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.440]
Well, it's nice to be able to talk a little bit again.

[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.680]
You know, you're able to get them in a while.

[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.140]
And my dog's better take note of that too.

[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.240]
That means the Bop-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up.

[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.600]
It's just like the...

[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.860]
Yeah, Jennifer was in here this morning.

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.240]
So I was practicing my Bop-up-up on him this morning.

[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.880]
North Miami Beach. Hello.

[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.660]
Oh, boy. Now we're going to have water.

[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.020]
We're going to have a flurry of these now.

[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:46.440]
Oh, boy.

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.800]
There's somebody there.

[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.260]
And the phone is like dangling.

[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.700]
Let's put them on hold because that sounds pretty mysterious.

[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.040]
Del Ray, hello.

[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:57.640]
Hello?

[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.100]
Yeah.

[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.140]
Daniel Ivey, a radio type of question for you.

[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.580]
I was spending a couple days in West Coast.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.340]
And there's the station and Tampa call,

[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.340]
Emily M&F.

[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.480]
And it's surprised.

[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.220]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.060]
Called WMNF.

[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.840]
MNS.

[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.260]
MNS.

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.520]
It's 88.5.

[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.320]
88.5.

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.180]
That's down there with like those pubic stations.

[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.140]
It must be a pubic station.

[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.960]
No, it's surprising because

[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.360]
I mean, they say everything.

[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.020]
I mean, it's like at the night shows,

[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.800]
whatever, like after 10 o'clock.

[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.080]
They just cool.

[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.680]
They say everything.

[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.260]
Well, it must be, we gotta be.

[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.040]
It's gotta be a public station.

[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:43.380]
Yeah.

[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.880]
It's more.

[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.140]
It's a lot of a lot of public access station.

[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.440]
So yeah, somewhere it's like DNA.

[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.720]
Yeah, you didn't hear any commercials on it.

[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.060]
No, it's not a commercial station now.

[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.800]
But it's like a lot of rap and stuff like that.

[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.420]
Yeah, but they did go on and on.

[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.620]
But say, I mean, that's right there.

[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:01.120]
I want to make it.

[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.140]
I mean, they almost go in in detail.

[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.420]
Well, you see, that's the hypocrisy of the FCC.

[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.340]
Is that like if it's like on television,

[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.900]
if something's on PBS and they say it's a national

[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.120]
geographic special,

[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.280]
they can show all these naked people running around

[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.000]
and all these body parts and all these women

[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.060]
with these gigantic breasts,

[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.240]
then it's okay.

[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.300]
You know, if it's under the guise of PBS.

[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.400]
But if it's on the network and they did that,

[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.020]
then all of a sudden they have an nervous breakdown.

[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.740]
So it's all the crap.

[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.620]
It's a, they were, even the people call in.

[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.020]
I mean, the,

[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.980]
call on for requests of seven,

[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.300]
they just, they just allow them to say,

[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:32.860]
whatever they want.

[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.400]
Really?

[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.820]
Well, I think we'll try that for a day or two.

[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.060]
For an hour or two.

[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.140]
For like two or three minutes, okay?

[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.580]
It's 11.33 at WIOD.

[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.120]
We have an open line in Bokinau.

[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.580]
How come I hung up on him?

[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.460]
I don't know.

[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.940]
Well, he was finished, wasn't he?

[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.540]
Thank you.

[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.340]
I think so. He is now 278 WIOD.

[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.880]
278 9463.

[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.400]
That could be part of our whole new format.

[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.380]
Is just whenever the mood strikes me.

[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.640]
Like even if you're in the middle of the sentence,

[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.440]
I'll just reach over and disconnect you, okay?

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.640]
Not for any particular reason.

[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.440]
I'll make it a little more exciting.

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.780]
Anyway, so we're going to be playing music on the show.

[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.860]
Now some of the people, even on Zeta,

[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.560]
which was supposedly a music station,

[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.480]
although you could have fooled me.

[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.720]
But even on Zeta, there were people,

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.440]
ah, geez, wait, if we want to hear music,

[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.600]
we turn on her and her and her and her and her and we turn on this one.

[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.140]
I'm sorry, folks,

[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.000]
but I like playing music on ear.

[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.400]
I don't care what I like it.

[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.240]
Plus, it kills a lot of good time.

[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.420]
But I enjoy it.

[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.860]
It's part of a show like this.

[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.940]
It's like, you know, a pointless show,

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.240]
and we play some pointless music,

[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.240]
and it all fits in together.

[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.260]
Okay.

[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.740]
So I'm just warning them in advance that that's going to start.

[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.320]
And I'm going to like the Brian Wilson thing.

[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.060]
Do you remember the guy called a couple of days ago

[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.900]
and was saying, were you really serious when you pull?

[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.400]
Oh, now we're going to have a real problem.

[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.720]
Okay, just dawned on me.

[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.180]
Uh-oh.

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.460]
Uh-oh.

[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.220]
Yeah.

[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.700]
See, we didn't have, well, we did have a problem over there too.

[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.420]
It was Captain Dave.

[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.640]
He never liked the music that I played and always wanted to play that

[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.000]
crap that he liked.

[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.120]
And we're going to have the same thing with Nick here.

[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.100]
He's going to be giving us a critique.

[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.500]
Oh, this is going to be exciting.

[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.400]
Because he don't like anything.

[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.960]
Okay, and we're not going to be playing that crap that he likes

[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.880]
to purple ice puppy, whatever it is.

[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.420]
So we got some real, real heavy-duty days coming up soon.

[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:10.920]
This is going to be exciting.

[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:11.320]

[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.460]
So we'll probably play it real low.

[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.660]
Okay, so we can't hear it.

[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.420]
26th till noon at WIOD.

[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.480]
Boka is open and also one in date I noticed just now

[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.140]
out of the corner of my eye at 751 WIOD.

[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.840]
This week, Poppano Harness is hosting the greatest week of racing so far

[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.000]
during the 1989 Harness Racing season.

[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.560]
It's Floridian pace week at Poppano with great stakes racing right

[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.360]
through Saturday night.

[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.740]
Tonight, Poppano features the $50,000 Florida Breeder

[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.260]
stake for three-year-old Trotters.

[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.840]
Friday night, the world's best amateur Harness drivers take the track,

[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.300]
Gianna Yeager, who made history as the co-pilot of the nonstop

[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.820]
around the world flight of the Voyager.

[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.180]
Is that right, Gianna?

[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:49.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.220]
Gina?

[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.660]
I think it's Gianna.

[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:52.340]
Gina?

[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.000]
Gina.

[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.480]
Well, spell it right, Gina.

[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:54.960]
Okay.

[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.840]
We'll make her Poppano Harness debut driving in the Billings Amateur Trot

[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.620]
and then on Saturday night, it's the biggest race for three-year-old

[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.980]
Pacers of the year, so far, the $117,000 Floridian pace

[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.580]
and the field is led by World Champion Rocky Bullguard,

[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.580]
who last year became the fastest two-year-old Pacer in history.

[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.920]
And at Poppano Harness, you have even more ways to win because you could win

[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.900]
that brand-new Gary Fronrath Chevrolet-I-Rock Z Camaro

[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.960]
in the nightly Pick 7 contest.

[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.600]
I think somebody picked five or six last night.

[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.820]
I saw Gary Saibel on the cable, but they didn't win the car,

[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.940]
so it's still up for grabs.

[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.460]
And you could win a 25-inch remote color TV in the drawing every night.

[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.680]

More with Neil Rogers on New Start Radio 610, WI-O-D.

[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.040]
Whatever you say, 11.37 at WI-O-D.

[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.080]
Let me do this for you.

[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.640]
We got seven, a Robbie Caneval information of five.

[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:54.940]
Hello?

[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:55.580]
Neil!

[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.020]
Yeah.

[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.720]
Long time, listener, first time car.

[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.160]
Great.

[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:58.940]
How are you doing, buddy?

[00:15:59.100 --> 00:15:59.720]
OK, pal.

[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.980]
Listen, he, uh, Robbie's going to get, uh, he gets 250,000 cash,

[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.040]
plus he gets a lot of, uh, the, uh, television promotion,

[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.240]
you know, cash from the television people.

[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.460]
I thought it was in a millions.

[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.720]
No, uh, it's only 250,000.

[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.360]
Well, he's out of his mind and he's nuts.

[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.100]
Well, actually, he's going to make it.

[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.900]
He's, uh, I, I know him personally from another friend of mine,

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.640]
and I was talking with him last night,

[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.180]
and they're real confident that he's going to make it.

[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.840]
You know, his father used to jump to his Harley,

[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.560]
and that's what the problem was there.

[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.500]
All right, so he's jumping the, uh, fountains at Caesar's,

[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.040]
is that what it is?

[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.900]
Yeah, he's going to jump to, uh, found Caesar's on Friday,

[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.120]
and he is going to jump a dirt bike,

[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.780]
different than a Harley, which is father crash on.

[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.180]
Mm-hmm.

[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.140]
Oh, uh, just thought I let you guys know that,

[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.580]
he's got a million dollar life insurance policy

[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.020]
for Lloyd's London the other day.

[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.680]
And that's about it.

[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.520]
Incredible.

[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.480]
Now, it's not going to be on ESPN, is it?

[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.620]
No, it's a pay cable.

[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.440]
Yeah, it's a pay thing.

[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.820]
Whoever said that was, that was swishful thinking, I think.

[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.260]
Yeah.

[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.440]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:56.820]
I know.

[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.460]
Good luck.

[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.100]
Okay, because I think he's going to need it.

[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.120]
21 till noon at WIOD,

[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.220]
we have an open light in Broward at 524-9463,

[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.760]
and both the Palm Beach lines are open and ready and willing.

[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.220]
He's going to jump over mountains.

[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.680]
The mountains at Caesar's out in front.

[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:11.980]
They have the right, right, right, phones.

[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:12.340]

[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.040]
And see, this sounds terrible for me to say this,

[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.400]
but if God forbid, it doesn't work out,

[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.060]
then they're just kind of like, flush it down, you know.

[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.460]
That's terrible.

[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.980]
I shouldn't have said that, but it's true.

[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.020]
We wish him the best.

[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.440]
Yeah, but just in case,

[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.900]
I mean, see if there's a mess in the fountain,

[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.120]
you know, just flush it out.

[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.840]
Well, God.

[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.460]
He's nuts, you know, he's nuts.

[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.640]
Well, he is nuts for that.

[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.600]
I mean, I thought he was going for millions for 250,000

[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.040]
to put his stinkin' life on a line as he out of his mind.

[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.340]
Is he crazy?

[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.380]
That guy who just called, you should call him up now,

[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.320]
tell him, change his mind before it's too late.

[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.880]
Yeah, he's nuts.

[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.080]
He should talk to Bill Wise.

[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.680]
Maybe they have a job for him over at GTR next story.

[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.580]
What do you mean Rick Edwards on a hotline?

[00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:58.880]
What?

[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.260]
What?

[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.140]
What?

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:00.640]
What?

[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.280]
Is that a joke?

[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.140]
Big joke.

[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.120]
This has got to be a joke.

[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:06.500]
Hello.

[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.760]
Yeah, hey, I want you to hear something.

[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.900]
I just got in.

[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.180]
Listen to this.

[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.520]
Tell me something really new to add to my studio.

[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.260]
Your morning show.

[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.540]
Presenting crazy jingles.

[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.340]
101 in San,

[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.120]
works to mayhem created by highly trained

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.320]
skilled professional singers,

[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.860]
musicians and technicians.

[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.800]
Who couldn't find real jobs?

[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.760]
He was on just like drop-ins and you'll

[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.600]
sound like a million.

[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.080]
Fortunately, we're only charging $99.95.

[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.120]
That's cheap.

[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.620]
Hello, it's 602.

[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.860]
Why am I here?

[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.920]
Here's Michael Jackson.

[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.800]
So I got the engineer on the phone.

[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.180]
He's on the bro.

[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.780]
Danny Bradman.

[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.080]
Here's Michael Jackson.

[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.040]
Good morning, 613 down on a free $100 bill coming up

[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.880]
before 7 o'clock.

[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.600]
Let's go to the phones.

[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.100]
Good morning.

[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:56.600]
Good morning.

[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.640]
Good question for you.

[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.260]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.440]
The guy who works in a bar with a pig on his shoulder.

[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.300]
What does the bartender say?

[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.220]
Thank you.

[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:03.600]
Go on it.

[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.020]
Go on it.

[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:04.420]
Go on.

[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.000]
Thank you.

[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.280]
Okay.

[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.060]
I know there's stupid calls.

[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:10.440]
Yeah.

[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.480]
I like that a lot.

[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:11.960]
Those are cute.

[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:12.260]
Yeah.

[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.200]
And it's cute.

[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:13.860]
Thanks a lot, Rick.

[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.480]
Rick can work.

[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.720]
Oh, boy.

[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.540]
Now this fits in right.

[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.080]
It's amazing how these things often

[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.680]
and I haven't.

[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.760]
Oh, you got a cart there.

[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.140]
I haven't made a request while you were not feeling well.

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:30.800]
I never bugged.

[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.180]
By the way, we do have a disciple from the Rick Edward School

[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.300]
of Engineering in the building.

[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.520]
I just thought I'd mention it.

[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.060]
But this fits right in.

[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.280]
You have Ricky Tickley?

[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.440]
You have him?

[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.900]
Oh, by the way, I should mention.

[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:41.720]
You know what?

[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.120]
It's funny.

[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.540]
He should probably play this to them.

[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:43.660]
Yeah.

[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.620]
I don't know why, but you know, that's something

[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.620]
a psychic thing again.

[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.460]
Way to chief out.

[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.640]
Well, but, um,

[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.040]
what was it just because?

[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:53.800]
Oh, well, when we get the CD player going here tomorrow

[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.600]
or Monday,

[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.200]
Ricky Tickley will be able to talk up again.

[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:57.780]
That's right.

[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.140]
Because we got two separate pots.

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.480]
Holy toly.

[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.520]
Now, when we first came here,

[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.640]
we didn't have a pot to kiss him.

[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.780]
It's this big.

[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.480]
But now we got like separate pots

[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.180]
for the car machine and a CD player

[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.700]
so we can make a new talk up.

[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.080]
So all of it's Ricky.

[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.380]
We might do a show one day

[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.980]
where he talks up just hundreds of records, okay?

[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.080]
I'd like it.

[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]
God, that would be something.

[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.520]
Are you going to be playing some CDs

[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.640]
by the Beatles?

[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.240]

[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.320]
How about To-To-Oh?

[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.300]
Cool.

[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:23.980]
We'll waxing.

[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.100]
Try to control yourself.

[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.580]
Now just,

[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.100]
well, that sounds like you're losing it.

[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.380]
He's a piece of work.

[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.900]
And well, he's a piece of something.

[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.400]
Make no mistake about that.

[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.840]
Oh, I told you on the year.

[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.080]
I'll off the year yesterday,

[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.900]
but I'll mention on here,

[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.500]
they're running a promo on waxing now

[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.900]
where they, you know,

[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.740]
used to be they were like above it.

[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.380]
They would never talk about any other station

[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:45.860]
in the market.

[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.040]
They were above all of that.

[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.960]
And then I told you a couple of months ago,

[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:49.700]
he was playing,

[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.500]
do you believe in magic?

[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.140]
And he said, that's magic with the G.

[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.440]
It was like magic 102 spelsers with a J.

[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.640]
That was his feeble attempt to strike back

[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.280]
because they're kicking a crap out of waxy.

[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.360]
And the other day, they come up with a promo

[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.240]
and they played you believe in magic

[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.260]
and then they blow it up.

[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.020]
They have that exploding blow it up sound.

[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.380]
And he makes some kind of cost to comment about,

[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.640]
you know, magic sucks or whatever,

[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.320]
something like that.

[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.720]
Something subtle as only he could do it.

[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.640]
Oh, here's the call in Boca.

[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.320]
They want me to change my attitude.

[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.220]
This ought to be great.

[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:19.540]
Hello?

[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.920]
No, that's not it.

[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.240]
Oh, because what you said was so sincere.

[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.920]
If you would play it back, you said God's Forbidden.

[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.100]
You said it's very sincerely.

[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.280]
I'm not criticizing.

[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.620]
And just commenting.

[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.760]
I was surprised being able to say that.

[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.060]
No, wasn't it a matter of speech?

[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.260]
You know, all you people are believing fairy tales.

[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:35.880]
No, no, no, no.

[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.860]
You love the seas upon those opportunities.

[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.660]
No, I'm not criticizing them.

[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.320]
Not at all.

[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.340]
Well, what does that mean, though?

[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.340]
But if you would hear your voice,

[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.440]
you said it's so sincere.

[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.660]
Well, of course, we don't want to see anybody get hurt.

[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.020]
Do you?

[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:47.860]
No, no.

[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.420]
The way you said God's Forbidden,

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.660]
that's what I meant.

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.500]
What does it mean?

[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.560]
Well, God is God accepted by every,

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.800]
but not God is accepted.

[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.700]
Oh, lady, listen, listen,

[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.440]
it's almost time for your daily animal.

[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.340]
Okay, get out of here.

[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.860]
You believe that?

[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.600]
Why are we talking to old blue hairs today?

[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.340]
Well, she was good.

[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.140]
You had a point.

[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:06.880]
She was, I am.

[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.980]
That's our quota for this month.

[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.280]
Okay, I don't want to talk to anybody over the age of 10.

[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.060]
It's 1144 at WIO.

[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.360]
Do we have an opening in Boca?

[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.780]
Giant opening in Boca,

[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.520]
where she just stuck the tube.

[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.220]
278-946-3.

[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:22.800]
278-WIO.

[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.380]
Look at that.

[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.320]
Laura's eating in there.

[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.600]
Scott encased your listening.

[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.080]
That's so.

[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.160]
Well, she's a little frustrated.

[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.100]
Marvin hasn't been here for a couple of weeks now.

[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.680]
She's turning to food now.

[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.360]
She's going to blow up like the good year of blimp.

[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.340]
Now, Scott, that must indicate to me that Scott

[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.160]
just isn't taking proper care of our Laura, right?

[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.620]
See if you were taking care of all of her needs.

[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.520]
She wouldn't be frustrated and eating like a pig in the other room.

[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:46.980]
Now, look at that.

[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.020]
She's picking it up, eating off the table.

[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.700]
Am I exaggerating?

[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.060]
Well.

[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:53.600]

[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.700]
That is shocking.

[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.200]
So, Scott, you just don't have it, baby.

[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:57.580]
Okay?

[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.560]
There's only one way to sum up your personality.

[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.700]
Okay, let's go to Orlando.

[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.240]
Hello.

[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.180]
Neil.

[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:05.660]
Yeah.

[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.120]
Hey, this is Joe and Orlando.

[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.120]
How you doing, Joe?

[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.560]
Hi.

[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.100]
I've been driving.

[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.200]
How come you're screaming, Joe?

[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.240]
Oh, it's because the car's all right.

[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.320]
I'll talk quieter.

[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.740]
Okay.

[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.420]
We've been driving home from Arizona.

[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.580]
You're the first station from Miami.

[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.960]
We've picked up except for Lee Fowler and Texas.

[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.120]
But we didn't have the radio.

[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.740]
Yeah, he's everywhere, man.

[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.460]
He's like a disease.

[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.600]
He's all over the place.

[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.740]
Yeah, and that last call you had from Boko?

[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.340]
She's some damn blue hair.

[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.580]
Isn't that incredible?

[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.160]
It is.

[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.640]
You know, God forbid she should call back again.

[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.120]
Yeah.

[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.200]
I mean, you said it's how convincing, right?

[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.420]
It's like, Neil, you bastard.

[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.340]
What are you doing?

[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.180]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.040]
Well, listen, it sounds like you're having a great trip.

[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.440]
Hey, it's been a lot of fun.

[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.320]
But, you know, I missed.

[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.440]
I've been out at school for the last couple months.

[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.780]
I just missed talking here in the owner radio.

[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.860]
What do you mean you've been out of school?

[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.220]
Like, just you just took off?

[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.100]
Yeah, well, I got stuck and I had a drop out for the semester.

[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:01.820]
Oh, I see.

[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.920]
So you figured you just take off and screw around a little bit.

[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.660]
Yeah, lay out at the beach for the next few months.

[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.860]
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.020]
All right, Neil, thanks.

[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.480]
Okay, you have a safe trip now.

[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:10.940]
All right.

[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.260]
Bye.

[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:11.640]

[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.480]
Wow.

[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.300]
We're getting them from everywhere today.

[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.200]
Orlando.

[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.300]
What was that other one?

[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:18.860]
Moose jaw?

[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:19.740]
Mayo.

[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:20.260]
Mayo.

[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.040]
Yeah, we had to call from Mayo, Florida,

[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.220]
in the first hour from our, I don't want to say jail,

[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.180]
but that's a terrible thing.

[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.220]
Well, he is a jail, but he's a nice guy.

[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.600]
He ran over three nuns in a street over here in West Palm.

[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.300]
Now, I don't know what he did.

[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.020]
He never told us.

[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.120]
I didn't want to ask.

[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.120]
It couldn't have been anything too bad.

[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.300]
He's only in for a couple of years.

[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.320]
It's 14 till noon at WIOD.

[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.740]
And I want to tell you again about,

[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.200]
oh, we got a new piece of copy here.

[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.540]
We're going to.
