[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:07.040]
outside of the town to go away like can blow up steam and kind of regroup blow off steam yeah

[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:13.820]
yeah you really ought to try to get up into the mount Charleston resort area yeah and um and do what

[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.920]
uh just take a look around it's gorgeous this incredible country it is oh and uh the uh red rock

[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.460]
canyon that's probably the closest to town it's a really easy drive yeah well next time i go to

[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:30.500]
Vegas i'm certainly going to check out the red rock canyon and all those other great uh you know

[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.960]
how the hell wants to be in a casinos and gambling and losing your money and having a good time

[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.840]
and having all those great meals and checking out all the entertainment that any idiot can do that

[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.540]
well like i heard my fill of that uh but uh like i said there's you know there's more

[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.440]
to to solar Nevada than meets the i yeah basically when you drive up to reno and you see all those

[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.120]
missiles hidden underground instead there's more than meets the i we've got to go to Tucson

[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.760]
Arizona everywhere yeah can drive around and say what is this well it's a Miniman

[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:06.280]
Psello excuse me but well that's why they're turning it into a big retirement town okay

[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.360]
well we're starting to get worried there i think there's something symbolic about that

[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.860]
getting worried there because the town is starting to grow up around the silos

[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.560]
yeah we're going to have them in their backyard too pretty well as a matter of fact i noticed in

[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.540]
sunrise they're starting with some of those Miniman silos too maybe there's something to it
