[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180]
Shame, but there's no going back to that kind of thing. No, so the met suck. Yes. I'm really disappointed. Well, I'm glad

[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.260]
I'm gonna send you did you see the Sun Sentinel today? There's a little article about

[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.440]
jukeboxes. I'm gonna send you the thing on the facts. It's got the top 25 jukebox 45s all time. Well, that's great

[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.560]
That sounds like something you could kill a good 15 20 minutes with. Well, Roger's got it right here's matter of

[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.660]
You don't have to send it. Okay, Roger just pulled it out of the waist basket. It's pretty interesting. It's a roll out a lot of a

[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.000]
Real misschmass of different kind. Yeah, we can play them all here. Yeah, that's why I was gonna send it to you

[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.500]
No, what a good way to kill the next two hours and 44 minutes. Well, you play good music, though

[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.460]
I won't be disappointed. Well, you answer me a question. What's wrong with these people here? What is their story? Well, I don't know because

[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.860]
You know, I've been talking to some people are you ready for the hurricane? They're like what hurricane?

[00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.980]
You know, I like to go blue. No, they're talking about football season. Oh, well, I'm at Gabrielle

[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.180]
She's gonna win today. Yeah, she's playing

[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.360]
Well, now I just wanted to say I'm so glad you're back because last week was like total it was like a break and continuity

[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.300]
It was strange. Yeah, well, I'll tell you these people have made me feel so welcome back today

[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.420]
It's just there are no words to describe it. I'll tell you Steve. They deck eyes for lunch. Really? Oh, no wonder he's got

[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.600]
Indigestion. Okay, have a great day. Yeah. Okay, we're doing screenless today

[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.120]
We've got three open lines on a screenless which really should give you a real good indication

[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.900]
This is a tough fine remember what I said during the summer about after labor day. Oh, yeah, then everybody will be coming back

[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.780]
And we'll go back to rare more have these days when people you know have to be begged to call in and things are really get

[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.900]
Back to usual and they are

[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.480]
Oh the top 25 jukebox singles of all time number one

[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.780]
Well, wait a minute. Yeah, you know, where's um

[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.160]
Her friend when you need them. Where's super David?

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.100]
He's a great guy. He's his thing. What do they call it?

[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.220]
Rimsha, I don't like Sam

[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800]
Real nervous rum roll

[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.100]
We'll save it for later. Ah, ha ha ha ha ha

[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.100]
1118 at W. I do what we don't want to use all the good stuff here in the first hour

[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.640]
Let's save that for later when we do a

[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.820]
In fact, Reneerie left the birthdays for tomorrow. I think we're going to use those at the end of the show today

[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.760]
Why not? I mean anything that'll kill some time today

[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.520]
We're doing screenless and we got three lines not ringing on screenless

[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.140]
I'll tell you how bad it is in town today even the cranks don't want to call today

[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.860]
That's how bad it is after the Labor Day weekend brutal day

[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.260]
Boca

[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.220]
The bird and Alex Bennett made our aunt Helen Charlie Maddo seem talented

[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.980]
See what I mean good calls in Boca

[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.820]
Who's who's doing Alice is sure today? I forgot somehow I just didn't wander over there again

[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.460]
Oh, let's see it was Terry Maryman yesterday. We heard and I forgot about him to this point

[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.060]
I have some reason station doesn't come to my brain. Yeah

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.860]
This is a good CD

[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.820]
I'll stow it. Wow, it is a great

[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.540]
Okay, time to talk about Arnold's now. Let's do the break early while Nick is a loss somewhere in the building

[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.780]
Well, I tell you one thing he must have something going on on the side because he's last two days

[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.300]
He's been out of that room far more than he's been remember I remember yesterday. He got locked out of the building

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.320]
True story true story. What did he go outside for?

[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.140]
To see if Steve those guests were here. Oh, yeah, and he got locked out of the building and I'm sitting here

[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.840]
I'm saying weren't what he what happened. I mean he usually goes out for a minute and fat rich had to go let him back in the building

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.980]
It's true and I just want to mention that fat rich isn't here today. He's busy putting together his WIOD newsletters

[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.960]
I

[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.020]
Wanted pages that his the end the newsletter

[00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.200]
17 pages in full color in color and boy I'll tell you he's

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.580]
Become like a legend to own my head. He's just out of his gourd. By the way, where's the food?

[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.900]
Meek a lot's coming today, and I don't want to overdo it. I just want you

[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.800]
I just can't go nuts

[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.980]
You know I might have a little something because this audience is just a dragging on my nerves

[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.560]
Speaking of food Arnold was here yesterday in case he were busy like doing living and breathing things on a holiday like most real people do

[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.180]
And he didn't get a chance to hear the show yesterday Wayne Arnold blesses heart

[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.100]
He and his lovely wife came by with lunch from Arnold's royal castle the only

[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.100]
Royal castle in soft lords the only one left

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.380]
So if you year a year and for those great days of yesterday year

[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.460]
When you used to go in there and watch them slap those little

[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.820]
Things on the grill with the onions and all the good stuff

[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.260]
Then you can still get it right now just the way it was years ago at Arnold's Royal castle at

[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.620]
125th and northwest 7th Avenue North Miami just like a stone throw off I

[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.160]
95 so even if you're in Broward or way down in the Yenomsville town in South Bay

[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.520]
You can get up there and back in no time at all and while you're in the car

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.460]
You can just gourd yourself on those great little Arnold's Royal castle burgers or those Nelly

[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.660]
Nelly burgers those great little bacon cheeseburgers and don't forget they got a great breakfast too

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.160]
They serve breakfast 24 hours a day and that BLT is a great sandwich

[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.680]
What's that good?

[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.020]
It's not just an ordinary BLT. It is something really great like everything

[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.400]
They have an Arnold's Royal castle the one and only left in South Florida

[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.860]
Don't forget that great birch beer in the frosted mug waiting for you to and the great news is just like yesterday on Labor Day

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.040]
They never close every day of the year round the clock 24 hours a day

[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.700]
They're waiting to serve you those great Royal Castle burgers and all the other goodies to an Arnold's Royal castle

[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.780]
12490 northwest 7th Avenue right off I 95

[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.100]
We're in area here for Discovery one. We're gonna do Club Mike at sea now. We've cruised

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.460]
We've cruised on Discovery a bunch of times. We've done shows from there

[00:05:52.460 --> 00:06:00.680]
But this is the first official Club Mike at sea on Discovery one. We have a lavish breakfast buffet a full lunch buffet

[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.760]
They're gonna do ice carving they're gonna do vegetable carving

[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.880]
We may even carve up some of the patrons. We've got napkin folding

[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.340]
Then I have cooking classes during the cruise the Caribbean lounge will be in full swing

[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.480]
You can board at 7.45 in the morning

[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.960]
It promises to be a great time. We'll be shooting a little trap off the fan tail

[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.120]
Which is always fun hanging out at Mike's at sea which is one deck below the pool deck on Discovery one

[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.880]
Now the number to call if you want to join us

[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.140]
And I sure hope you can is 525 7800 in South Florida or 1 800 2 2 6

[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:43.060]
7800 anywhere in the state of Florida this momentous event Club Mike at sea is going to happen on September the 7th on Discovery one

[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.080]
You will have fun or else

[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.280]
22 past 11 at W.I.D. Look at that phone. We're doing screenless even that isn't helping today

[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.840]
Nothing there is nothing that we can do to turn this into we show. Well, don't say we didn't try

[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.880]
You know what this is no clue. It's a sound effect CD

[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.520]
There are 65 sound effects on each disc and I think we've got like 10 of them

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.420]
Now if this can't kill two hours and 37 minutes then nothing can okay?

[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.600]
Did you like that that was a woman coughing was that what that was not to be confused with cut number six which is a

[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.280]
man talking

[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.480]
No, a woman sneezes. Oh

[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.960]
Now this one they must have they must have recorded this off a Steve show a couple of weeks ago Friday

[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.120]
What's that called

[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.420]
woman sign she's watching the Joey Reynolds show no doubt

[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.120]
Wow that's good boy

[00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.390]
Oh

[00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:09.290]
Whoa

[00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:21.610]
Now this is off CD later and it says it has something to do with KO Pecta is not it's not what you think it is

[00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.490]
Oh, yeah, it's like the clarity

[00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.530]
Okay, so for everybody it isn't gonna get to see Geo's Alpha and Anders do the news today

[00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.870]
I think this is a CPR course

[00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.730]
And of course for those who have already seen the first half of the Joey Reynolds show today

[00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.290]
What is that called

[00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.490]
I

[00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.630]
There's a title of that

[00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.910]
Get it woman belching. Oh my oh

[00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.550]
Geez good

[00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.410]
Oh

[00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.670]
This is a good cut this will upset a lot of people in town. Oh, well in that last cut. Oh, yeah, they don't like that

[00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.490]
They don't like that and the best one this was recorded in boy Geary's office this morning

[00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.910]
Oh

[00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.670]
Wow giving new meaning to the expression. He didn't know whether to scream or eat a banana

[00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.370]
Aren't these good they're sure more entertaining than the call that's very much though

[00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.390]
And we got a lot more of them than we do calls I'll tell you that so

[00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:18.350]
Well, it's sure nice to be back in town. We're really oh here's a good one too. This is excellent. Just a second now

[00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:32.390]
Lord and in a course for Phil when he calls in next time we pick a horse it's or when he just calls in to bug us

[00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.090]
That to be his introduction

[00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.110]
This isn't that great

[00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.430]
So we'll continue with some more of these in just a second

[00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.670]
It's 26 past 11 at w.i.de look at that now they're all starting to light up on that phone

[00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.550]
We're gonna do screamless today, but even that doesn't seem to be working

[00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.810]
So we've tried it all we pulled all the tricks out of the bag

[00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.870]
And we've done everything that we know how to do and you just didn't want any part of it

[00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.350]
So call up Steve tell him he's got to come in early today to make up for yesterday

[00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.710]
Oh, okay, like at about 11 30

[00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.010]
See is there anything else good on here? There's a pig squeal

[00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.950]
Anybody go for that any green acres fans

[00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.150]
I know

[00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:29.230]
And then for the bill wise fans both of them who are left in south florida

[00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.810]
Oh

[00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.630]
That's not a girl of that's the point here. He's new us sibling in there. He's your lemon

[00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.190]
You're a lemon 27 past 11 at w.i.o.d

[00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.410]
Let's so should we punch some of these up or not? I don't really care. I whatever

[00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.890]
Makes everybody happy. I'm more than willing to go along with today

[00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.010]
I got my paycheck and I don't really give a damn about anything. Okay?

[00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.330]
And if that reaches busy making phone calls. Oh, we have a party prepared. Guess what rich

[00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.170]
It's just a joke

[00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.650]
Mark my words. He's gonna call on that bat line any second. Is that him?

[00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:13.390]
Is this bill? Oh, it's one of his personal. Oh, he's doing some business in there Nick. Uh, Boca. Hello

[00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.570]
Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Well two things number one

[00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:24.990]
Right. I have to say it chronic. No, no, no, no, chronic. I need. Oh, I haven't called you in six or eight

[00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:31.890]
months. Okay. Uh, that show yesterday was probably the most hideous show I've ever heard in my life with Steve

[00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:37.150]
Yesterday afternoon. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't be so bad, but he keeps doing that same show like every other day

[00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.830]
It seems to be between that. That's replaced the abortion shows now is let's kill all the homosexuals

[00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.550]
Well, maybe if he clicked doing those kind of shows, you wouldn't have to have therapy

[00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.250]
Now come on now. Don't start pick it on Steve. I mean, there's a lot of truth in what you say, but you know

[00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:55.470]
The other thing is I want to talk you I was listening to him. He's rise on therapy. Don't you understand?

[00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.610]
I guess his life would be empty without it. No question about it. But then that's sad in itself

[00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:06.150]
But uh, the other thing we're talking about you we were talking baseball about a week ago Monday, sorry bird

[00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:13.590]
Um, and you made a comment somebody talked to you about the royals and you made a comment that you didn't think the royals were a bunch of a baseball team

[00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.110]
I don't I know they're closing in there. I don't I don't like them. They just don't show me that much. Well, I mean

[00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.770]
Well, you said they had a bunch of nobody's on the team besides George Brent well, you've got

[00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:28.490]
You don't think you apparently don't like Bo Jackson and Bo Jackson is so overrated that I'm embarrassed

[00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.890]
Okay, well, they made such a to do about him in an all-star game. You think what what is he really done? Okay?

[00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:39.630]
What has he really got to make him a superstar? Well, and you know the only thing I can tell you is that in a in a recent

[00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.610]
Survey of all the man here we go

[00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.610]
Well, in a survey of all the managers in major league baseball

[00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:50.790]
Yeah, but he was either number one or number two on all their lessons who they would choose even Don Zimmer said

[00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.730]
That he was number one or number two on who he would choose to start up a franchise ball isn't that great and

[00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.650]
You know highly overrated

[00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.010]
Troutable was an outstanding. He's alright. He's an outstanding ball player. Tony. It's not that good of a ball club

[00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.950]
I'm not saying they're bad, but I don't consider them to be a great ball club

[00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.310]
Well, I think they're I think they're a real good

[00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.630]
There's only one team in the majors with more wins than they have and that's Oakland that's Oakland

[00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:19.110]
And there's what does that mean? Well, it means they're damn good team. Everything is relative. Okay. Look who they're playing

[00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:25.090]
What do you mean where can league is so weak and and not only that for the American League schedule this year

[00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.210]
You realize that in this last month that they're still doing interdivisional for example the Orioles

[00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.050]
Uh, we're playing the white socks over the weekend and now who the hell did they play last night?

[00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.770]
Well, I think they know they're playing in the division now, but they still got a lot of interdivision games left

[00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.090]
And it's all screwed up. It's a mess outside of the giants in the cubs

[00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.710]
Who are some good teams of a national league?

[00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.350]
Who are some good teams? What's wrong with Montreal? What's wrong with the Cardinals?

[00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.490]
And what's wrong with Houston?

[00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.170]
Montreal makes the title, man. Looks like you like look like he's at the top

[00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:58.690]
There's no question about it. I'm sure that Kansas City wouldn't like to have Langston or Dennis Martinez or Tim Burke

[00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:04.470]
What the face Galaraga or Tim Reigns. I'm sure that the Kansas City wouldn't want any of those guys

[00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.210]
Well, I think they want Langston that by the same virtue

[00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.110]
Uh, don't you think the cubs would love to have

[00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:16.930]
Saber Hagen or Gordon? Hey at this point the cubs would like to have anybody who could stand up and get the ball to the plate, okay?

[00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.370]
Okay, they'd like to have Danny McClain at this point

[00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:25.770]
Yeah, I don't think the Royals are a fine team. They're good

[00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.350]
I underestimated them, but Ed Kaplan still knows nothing about baseball

[00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.010]
Well, I can't when there's nothing about anything. Well, that's true. That's that was my point

[00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.870]
I don't have any extra grind with the royals

[00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:40.590]
I just think Ed Kaplan knows nothing about sports. Well, what can you say he's a met fan? Oh, well air goes, you know

[00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.690]
I hope you enjoyed the game last night, but I hope I hope the cubs hold on and I hope

[00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:49.230]
Oh, who the hell are they going to pitch tonight? Now they're saying Steve Wilson's going to pitch tonight. He can't get anybody out

[00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:55.790]
I heard Audrey Dawson. Well, there you go. At least he's got a good arm. That's right. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Bye

[00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.630]
What the hell we getting all in broiled about this is just a ball game, right?

[00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:00.870]
We'll be like arguing about the tennis

[00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:08.570]
It's just a tennis match exactly like Conner's what does he get so upset and hysterical about and that that idiot

[00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.310]
Mac and roll what does he get all worked up about? Huh? It's just a stick in tennis man

[00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:18.610]
200 years from now who's going to know the difference? That's that's a nice. Why is he short on cash? Yeah

[00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.810]
You can't know that word. I house my check

[00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:27.950]
Pipsqueak where the hell the denim bird go haven't seen them since you what I'm sure ask him about 1132 at W.I.D

[00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.610]
We're doing scrimmous and we can't buy a calling Palm Beach County. No, seriously

[00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.690]
There is nothing going on today. This is the word is this the way it's going to be from now to the end of the year

[00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.690]
No, this they this particular day after the labor day. This is a brutal

[00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.730]
Really tough day is it really?

[00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.310]
Was this gentleman out on work release now or what what did they just do let him out?

[00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:54.370]
Can't believe it look at that. It looks like an ax murderer with a suit on anyway. Let's talk about the melting pot right now

[00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.070]
Blompton you want to get away from all the grief and all the

[00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.770]
Traveils of the world just head for the melting pot tonight and sit there and have that incredible

[00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:09.290]
Cheese appetizer and nice chef salad just drowning in that honey mustard dressing and a great entree of either beef or chicken or

[00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:14.890]
seafood or combination array of the great new entree is like the teriyaki sirloin or the filet menu on fun

[00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:22.210]
Do and then of course top it all off with one of those chocolate desserts that you dip all your good fruit in do if we can say that here on the air without somebody getting

[00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:28.030]
hysterical and governing himself accordingly and you're just going to have a hell of a time the melting pot don't to be fooled by the

[00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:34.410]
imitators there's only one melting pot chain and there are two great locations waiting to serve you right now in South Florida in South Miami

[00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:40.510]
1935 Sunset Drive in Coral Springs on West Ample Road right next to the pizza hut just east of Pine Island

[00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.970]
Well, what a great idea good way to start off the post

[00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:50.430]
holiday depression by getting yourself out of that depressing frame of mind and cheering everybody in the gang up with a great evening at the melting pot

[00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.950]

[00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:02.990]
Not even song that didn't I say we got now there was this man standing in the window and we get all kind of shleppers that they bring in at stand in the window there and most of

That was the only problem. I don't have reverb. Yeah, not enough reverb not enough production

[00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.670]

[00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:43.950]
Isn't it a brutal business? This is a killer man look at all the people who have been just decimated and look at this

[00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.410]
Just did honor a cousin Brucey being here. They would have a lot of

[00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:52.010]
From pizza lock Jeff you really know how to do it. Yeah. What do you have on the pizza? What are you doing down here?

But at least we get fed well. I'll tell you that

[00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.490]
Yeah, isn't this great? Well, that's well. This goes on every day now. You know, I'm such a fat slum

[00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:22.310]
It's just impossible to lose the weight. Oh, this is so good. It's incredible. Brings it slow. Does this guy?

[00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:27.190]
Look at you know cousin Brucey. Do you know cousin Brucey? How do you know he's too young to know you though? How do you know?

[00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:33.410]
I'm not from New York. No, we we have people all over the country. You know, this music I play is multi-generational everyone listens to it all ages

[00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:41.850]
All ages really not the age from down here. They don't listen to it all you say. I you can't have all my cousins listening right on the win-more-in-century village

[00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.090]
Don't we have cousin brissy to a talk up?

[00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.450]
Did you play there? Oh, they can we find a little talk a record up for us?

[00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.530]
Absolutely. By the way, how do you like the way Deans coming back? You know we had Dean on the show a few weeks ago

[00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.970]
And his album is going through the road. Joel Frankie is doing all Frankie's now

[00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.210]
I posted Dean about a year and a half ago talked him out of retirement here

[00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.530]
He was doing Christian great guy and I put him into radio sitting music called with CVS FM

[00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.150]
And they sold out two shows in 90 minutes. You'll listen to that. You know what that means?

[00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.690]
That's phenomenal. Yeah

[00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:15.650]
Hey, he's a good guy. In fact, he brought his guitar in here the day that he was on the show and he just sat in that chair there

[00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.650]
And he is incredible. Here's a guy who has completely screwed up his life

[00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.590]
Hood himself badly came down here

[00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:27.930]
God God know to his father-in-law married to the same lady Susan and found himself and now he's combining

[00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.470]
Christianity which he still has a great feeling with

[00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.250]
With capitalism the jazz kind of like Jim Baker

[00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.510]
Didn't work to that for Jim, but Dean will be all right

[00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.710]
Come on, do it. All right. We got a little bit of locomotion coming up here ladies and gentlemen

[00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:40.050]
Okay, 1146 at WID just eat and relax. I got a little sponsor new here because that's what it's all about citywide insurance agencies

[00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.650]
And Dave Broward in Palm Beach counties

[00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:48.130]
Want to make sure you know about the new Florida law regarding car insurance the new law says you must carry minimum liability coverage

[00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:53.170]
In addition to the previously required PIP so don't monkey around with this new law because you can bet

[00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:59.250]
That the local pigs are gonna bust your real fast if you can uh caught without minimum liability. You got liability?

[00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.910]
Uh-huh. Thank God for you boy. They'll be waiting right outside the door

[00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:07.810]
The North Bay Village cops will be waiting right outside the door and listen to the penalty if you can't prove minimum coverage

[00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:13.630]
They can suspend your driver's license and tag plus slap you with fines ranging from 150 to 500 bucks

[00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:17.390]
Depending on how many times you've been caught at citywide insurance agencies

[00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.590]
You can avoid all that hassle and get started with a new state required liability

[00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:25.590]
Who was little as a hundred dollars so called your nearest citywide insurance agency right now

[00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:28.270]
Just call information and get the number of the location nearest you

[00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:33.550]
They're all over Dave Broward in Palm Beach counties remember at citywide you can get coverage for as little as a hundred bucks

[00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:39.290]
So we'll pay this new law now and avoid big problems later with citywide insurance. Hi everybody

It's a rock town is Neil says yeah, it is it's rust. It is a rough. How how could it be rough?

[00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.290]
I come from one of the roughest towns in a while. I mean it's survival

[00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:52.210]
You know what you come from that's the problem. Okay. We like to take some of them back with it. Why is it rough?

[00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:57.090]
Explain that because of any York kids as Neil says wait the wait a minute, but you you are northeast that are too

[00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:02.890]
I was in a wing, but they're not there's a big difference like Neil says is the difference from a New Yorker and a New York state person

[00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:03.310]
Exactly

[00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.710]
But as a me I'm from New York people say to me I'm from what I'm I think I'm from the city

[00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.130]
Wow

[00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:15.630]
But I but I but I beg to do because I'm a New York city person that I don't consider myself

[00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:21.110]
You know a person I can irritate or why do we irritate is no doubt about it for many years

[00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.550]
But I don't consider myself part of that clan. You just

Discussing is that the catering got some pretty nice people there too. We got some we got some stickers
