[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980]
And boy what timing man media here not from all over the country the media in this town from all over the world from every country in the world

[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.300]
And all these wonderful stories we're gonna be written about Miami this week in every single one of them is gonna be true

[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.120]
That's all they're gonna be about all right

[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.100]
Let's do a little break and we'll come back and like I said if you're looking for fun and games for me today

[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.480]
You're not gonna get it because I am foaming at the mouth

[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.580]
How the hell long can this go on and can this be tolerated?

[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.760]
Every excuse that these groups of barbarians get man there right there to jump on the bandwagon and seize the opportunity and

[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.280]
One thing I did not hear yesterday when I left here going home. I didn't hear any concern about this community and

[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.020]
What this is going to do to this community and the fact that it's the lead story now on

[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.420]
CNN and every newspaper and every newscast all over America

[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.460]
The only reason we got upstage a little bit yesterday for the lead story was this other

[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.620]
Abberent this horrendous grotesque

[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.540]
Episode in Stockton, California

[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.360]
But that thank God was an isolated incident

[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.800]
Although these things just happened to damn off it in this country

[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740]
In this gun crazed country well, let me do the breaker. I'm gonna get way behind

[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.760]
I got a lot to say today believe me a lot to say and I'm gonna say it all

[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.760]
Not gonna sit here and I'm not gonna gild the lily and I'm not gonna tell you what you want to hear. I'm gonna tell you the truth

[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.160]
It's 1014 at WIOD Gulf

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.860]
It's 17 past 10 at WIOD and I got to tell you I don't find anything humorous at all about any of this

[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.960]
There are people I guess who think that this is some kind of a big joke. I don't find it in the least bit humorous. It's

[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.520]
disgraceful and

[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.380]
The episode in Stockton, California brought me back to reality for a while there

[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.820]
I don't know I guess it's getting like a lot of other people and just angry you just can't be angry forever

[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.560]
And so I was you know over the last couple years really changed my opinion about guns and gun control and

[00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.820]
I was convinced for a while there that yeah, we all ought to have guns

[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.940]
You know five-year-old kids ought to be running around with guns because only the criminals and all that other propaganda

[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.300]
We hear from the NRA the sick people in the NRA and there are a lot of sick ones

[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.580]
But this country is sick man. They're out of their minds with guns

[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.100]
They're obsessed. They're still living the Wyatt Earp John Wayne syndrome in this country

[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.080]
Now how and you know one of the things I noticed on the story out of Stockton

[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.540]
They can't imagine how this guy

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.620]
With all of his problems in his history how he got these weapons. How is he able to go in and just walk in and buy him?

[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.700]
Wasn't it like an oozee or automatic weapon? We had three of them three three of them, you know

[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.020]
And

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.220]
All the shooting that you hear going on the gunfire the exchange the shootouts in over town Liberty City automatic again

[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.460]
All these punks have got weapons and I don't understand why

[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.480]
Automatic weapon, but that's because we live in a real six-society and you people refuse to give a damn about these things

[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.760]
You think that everybody ought to walk around like Wyatt Earp with a gun in the holster remember the period of time when we were

[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.540]
Talking about this and people said oh, yeah, we see nothing wrong

[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.120]
You know as long as you got it the showing you got a holster walk into the malls with it with a with a security at your side

[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.360]
Like wild Bill Hickock, okay? I mean you people are nuts and

[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.560]
That's why in the civilized countries in Europe they look at America

[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.700]
They think we're a bunch of barbarians and you know something they're right

[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.300]
And just like Howard Beale said you know he wasn't crazy. He was the safest one of them all

[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.700]
You watch this crap that comes out of the tube every day and you begin to believe that this is the way things are supposed to be

[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.100]
This is not the way civilized people live I

[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.260]
Was at Pompa no Park last night at the track and I want to tell you another thing that was handled really and a

[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.620]
Board of situation and that's with the Miami Heat Game

[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.660]
Here they've got that beautiful arena down there and

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.240]
Miraculously they're getting great fans support in spite of the

[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.480]
Horrible baller playing but you know that's to be expected there were new expansion team and people understand that and

[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.040]
The game was sold out over 15,000 tickets sold off for last night and what did they do?

[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.240]
They waited and they waited and they hemmed and they hawed and they did and they got a whole bunch of people

[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.440]
There were 500 people inside already by the time they called the game off and thousands of others on the road on the way to the game

[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.680]
And

[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.100]
Anyway, was it the track last night some of the people who were there were telling me about the episodes that occurred about how their windshield

[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.920]
Were just totally smashed and they said hundreds that maybe they're exaggerating, but at least dozens of other people

[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.240]
Who made the sad mistake of driving into those areas have bricks and bottles throwing at their vehicles and had their windows smashed?

[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.080]
Of the referees were and the referees were assaulted is which made big headline news today in Europe newspapers

[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.120]
So we got the arena there alright, but we can't play a basketball game and I

[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.700]
Heard some of the comments from some of these animals saying well gee they got some nerve

[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.320]
You know they should have called it off one of our people got killed and they're still gonna hell hold the game

[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.040]
That's why we're gonna disrupt everything is an excuse to disrupt

[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.360]
Because some perhaps trigger happy cop and I say perhaps again although at this point I

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.880]
Don't I don't find anything else. I mean there's just nothing else there

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.180]
They haven't even made up a good excuse yet

[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.880]
There's just nothing whatsoever in the accounts of that incident on the motorcycle and the shooting

[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.420]
That could possibly justify shooting this guy in a head no less

[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.400]
Not shooting a tie-out on a motorcycle or not shooting somebody in the leg or they armed a disable them, but shooting him in the head

[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.360]
So I'm not condoning that no one can condone it and

[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.920]
And anybody wants to tell me that we just have these isolated

[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.900]
Policens and Incinus community needs a good shrink okay or is living in some kind of a dream world

[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.540]
Because we have them won after another after another

[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.280]
But to turn this town into an incinerator is

[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.780]
Absolutely unacceptable

[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.280]
And how long does it take

[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.620]
The mayor and the chief of police to determine that if they're going to make this community safer people to live in

[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.860]
They're gonna have to act quickly and decisively and not stand around like referees in a hockey game watching from a distance waiting for it to all

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.900]
Peter out it didn't go to Peter out okay

[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.860]
Oh, yeah

[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.660]
Here's the entire

[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.320]
tire page op-ed page in the

[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.960]
USA today

[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.240]
tire page we made it again folks

[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.300]
The poll question that they take

[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.440]
On CNN national television last night

[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.480]
Do you think that the police caused the

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.480]
Unrest in Miami that was the poll question

[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.180]
So we're making it every minute of every major newscast

[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.340]
But then there are those people as I said who are on here evidently don't give a damn about the repercussions for this community

[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.600]
I mean, this is like this is like the end. It's like the patient has been in intensive care

[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.400]
Orlando Daytona

[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.460]
Bahamas all these other areas taken all the tourism boy all the business

[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.640]
It's 80 degrees today or 78 whatever it's gonna be it's a magnificent day. I'm driving to work

[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.900]
There's not a cloud in the sky

[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.020]
Micah saying it's gonna be 78 today. We broke the record yesterday 85

[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:41.820]
All these people are here to have a good time to get some sunshine to get out of the cold to see this community at its best and what do we give them?

[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.980]
We give them the same old crap that this town has been plagued with as long as I can remember

[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.640]
We give them cannibalism barbarianism. That's what we give

[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.460]
Because you live in your little sheltered condos and your little ivory towers placed your dog from all of it and just like Howard

[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:07.580]
Beale said leave me alone. Let me have my sweet and low and my my strong and my can ask the game and everything will be okay

[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.640]
And this cannot continue this cannot continue

[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:21.600]
And if they have to round up these barbarians and put them out at chrome somewhere behind wire fences and keep them there

[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:30.580]
The happiest people of all will be the law abiding black people who live in overtown and Liberty City and

[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.680]
Don't want to be terrorized every day by a bunch of animals. They'll be the happiest ones

[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:48.240]
It's 1024 at WIOD 1028 at WIOD we got a Miami police officer who worked in overtown last night. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.660]
Hi, I'm not with Miami, but I was down there last I do a bunch of people that were

[00:08:53.680 --> 00:09:00.560]
Different departments working last night right the only difference between this and the four or five others that I've experienced

[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.680]
In the last 20 years is that they knew something was coming but

[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:13.100]
Because they like your favorite tune be happy. Yeah, worry. They wanted to make it all like it is going away

[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.860]
Same the reason he didn't cancel the heat came encouraged everybody to get on the metro mover and come down there while I got a crowd

[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:25.560]
Moving in the assaulting the overtown station. Yeah, well, you see the problem is that we got the Super Bowl game

[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.440]
And of course, you know as important as to a lot of people it's still a football game

[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.300]
Exactly and the future of this community is a hell of a lot more important to a lot of us than a football game

[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:40.680]
So the same mood and takers that got the metro rail down into some God forsaken places that it goes

[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.640]
Yeah, the stadium and some God forsaken place. Mm-hmm. You're right. They're

[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.360]
90% of the people probably down there are

[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.100]
decent people and was like to see the ones that were out last night disappear

[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:59.000]
But that won't happen and they're not realistic about it. We sit back in the city Miami so shell shock now that

[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.760]
They're they're afraid to do anything they took a hit and

[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.140]
regardless of what

[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.440]
Result of this shooting comes out to be whether the guy was right wrong in

[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.500]
Between partly right partly wrong

[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.240]
They can't just stop reacting to the rest of the animals that are out there doing their thing

[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.840]
Yeah, and they have they decide to do that. They're so scared to do anything

[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.620]
They have 30 car caravans before guys each but they're kind of like, okay, you want to burn that down?

[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.760]
We'll build around it and watch it burn. Yeah, we did that all last night. Mm-hmm and

[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.680]
Just getting tired. I think and in the indecisiveness that went on to me was it was incredible

[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.440]
Not just with a heat game, but there was gonna be a curfew

[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.980]
I kept hearing that there was an 80 clock curfew and anybody else who was on the streets after a

[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.660]
Declot was gonna be rounded up and taken away and then next minute

[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.720]
I see the police chief on television I was watching at the race track

[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.480]
They had on the TV monitors and all no curfew were just you know waiting things out in the meantime

[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.800]
All of this went on and on and on and on and um, you know, what are they what were they waiting for?

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.640]
Well, I think everybody is like you say this is our

[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.500]
Supposedly our week or two weeks in the sunshine and regroup all this stuff

[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.620]
We've lost over the past ten years and it's not gonna happen and who cares?

[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.500]
Yeah, we have to stay here the rest of these people are gonna go away. That's they're coming back. That is correct

[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.960]
You know, I've got a little while to go yet

[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.920]
But I think I better put the house up for sale now because it might take that longer sell

[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.740]
Nobody wants wants to be here in a place like like this

[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.820]
Okay, I appreciate you I'll see it

[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.960]
You took most of my thunder you're I agree with most of what you said. Thanks a lot, but

[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.820]
1031 at W1. You know, I get this a wrap that I'm anti-police and I'm not anti anything

[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.940]
I'm anti-corrupt police and I'm anti overreactive police and I'm anti-bad police

[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.440]
See, I have a real strange philosophy, you know correct me if I'm wrong

[00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:01.140]
But there's certain occupations like doctors and policemen where the individual has the power of life and death over

[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.400]
A lot of people

[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.360]
So I don't think there's a lot of room for error. I mean we're all human and we can all make a mistake

[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.020]
But if a brain surgeon, you know, screws up or if you know surgeon cuts off the wrong leg or whatever it is

[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.320]
And then says, oh, I'm sorry. I made a mistake. It's not a satisfactory answer. Okay

[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:26.260]
So when people continue excusing a lot of the police brutality and excesses and just plain insanity and try to say oh

[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:33.740]
Well, these are just isolated episodes and I'm pro cop. I don't buy that. There's no such thing as pro cop or anti cop unless you're just an automata

[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.540]
The world just isn't that way. It can't just put everything into a nice neat little package and say oh

[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.940]
This is good and this is bad and this is a it just life doesn't work that way

[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.880]
Everything every issue every part of our existence involves shades of gray

[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.180]
Degrader of degree

[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.620]
And so if you want to pseudo-intellectualize all of this stuff

[00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.000]
I guess you can do that if you want to make it some kind of an exercise like mental masturbation

[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.080]
I guess you can do that

[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:06.640]
But this isn't a pseudo-intellectual subject. It's real man. It's out there. You can touch it. You can smell it

[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.740]
I was coming to work this morning and as I got off 95 and came over on 79th Street to the cause

[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.480]
I watched

[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.040]
People in the other cars and vans and people looking around there was a certain

[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.120]
uneasiness

[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:28.280]
In the faces of a lot of these people and I certainly can't wonder why

[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.660]
Because we're right on the fringe of it right here. That's right

[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.360]
And like I said a couple of years ago when they started building the arena right there on the fringe of over time

[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.900]
I was definitely wrong about one thing

[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.180]
I didn't think people would go there

[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.100]
And I didn't think this town would support a loser. I've been wrong about both of those things

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.700]
They've had great attendance and they've been enthusiastically supporting them through a disastrous season, okay

[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:58.000]
But how many more episodes like this is it going to take before people start wondering hey do I really want to go back there?

[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.740]
Now those people who want to say that these are isolated episodes again

[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.640]
They either haven't been here very long or they're living in some kind of a dream world

[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.080]
Remember when we had the whole series of

[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.720]
episodes where these punks from over town and Liberty City were getting onto the we're walking onto the

[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.480]
Entrance and exit ramps of i95 and

[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.560]
Acosting people as they were entering or leaving the highway as they were slowing down. Yes

[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.880]
And throwing bricks through their windshield

[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.200]
Okay

[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.880]
Curie Sullivan who was once the program director of this radio station was going to meet me one day when they were first

[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.240]
Couple years ago talking to me about coming to work here

[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.380]
And I went to the restaurant up in plantation and waited and waited

[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.480]
He never showed up and I went home and I got a phone call

[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.540]
They had thrown a brick through the windshield of his brand new car

[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:57.820]
Hmm now I guess some people forget that governor Graham had ascended the Florida Highway Patrol because we didn't have enough police

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.000]
To take care of these problems with barbarians on interstate 95

[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.260]
Attacking people and dragging them out of their cars and stealing their money

[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.600]
And throwing bricks and bottles through their windshield

[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.660]
This is not acceptable behavior and the people who do it aren't humans

[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.040]
So I shouldn't say people they're animals

[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.220]
Okay

[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.960]
And I don't know about you, but I don't fancy myself wanting to live with a bunch of barbaric animals

[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:35.300]
It's 1035 at WIOD it's 1040 at WIOD speaking of sports talk tonight

[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.540]
Six to eight Joseph Gacchi will be talking live from Super Bowl headquarters

[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.500]
At the high-end Regency will be talking to a several guests including

[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.340]
Larry Zonka former dolphin great-running back. So that's coming up from six to eight tonight

[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.500]
Anyway, although I don't I got to be honest with it. There's so much of this over shadows the game itself

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.540]
Which is unfortunate because whether you like the game or not or you're interested or not is not relevant

[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.480]
It's a game. It's supposed to be fun. It brings millions of dollars into the economy

[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.040]
One of the reasons that Joe Robbie built the stadium was not only that the dolphins would have a you know

[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.720]
nicer facility to play in and hopefully get better attendance which hasn't worked out

[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.320]
But also that we would be a viable site for the Super Bowl a year

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:22.080]
Now that the orange bowl had basically by the league been declared dilapidated outdated and antiquated and low and behold here

[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.220]
We have it this year and look at a great job. We're doing man

[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.700]
I think if we all live long enough we might get it here again someday

[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.260]
But not soon. Mm-hmm

[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:31.660]
Great

[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.840]
So really this is I started to say this before and I sidetracked myself

[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.240]
But it's like the patient has been in intensive care

[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.660]
You know how in the movies or in a soap operas?

[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.740]
There's always always seems to be some kind of a scene in one of those hospital type movies or somebody is

[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.180]
Like in a godfather that was that movie where he was lying in bed

[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.080]
And then we're gonna come to try to take away the life support systems

[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.680]
And in godfather to myrlansky was lying there in bed and he put the pillow over his head

[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.020]
Basically, that's like what's happened to us here now this week

[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.960]
The patient has been lying there in intensive care with all the life support systems attached to it

[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.620]
And now somebody has come along and yanked it all away

[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.520]
And it's like we're a corpse. It's like this community is dead

[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.400]
The beach has been dead for a lot of years, but nobody wants to admit it

[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.320]
They want to keep lying to you and telling you oh there's this incredible comeback man

[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.600]
It's great. They're full of crap. Okay

[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.140]
They're lying to you like crazy

[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.760]
Bob Cox and the morons up in Fort Lauderdale killed that city

[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:37.400]
Very quickly by the way, I mean one thing about them man. They didn't waste any time you know the beach that took years to do it

[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.220]
But in Fort Lauderdale bingo in two years we went from

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:49.020]
God only knows how many hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tourists and all kinds of excitement and life and living and breathing people

[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.620]
To an outdoor funeral parlor

[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.280]
Killing an institution that had been going on for over 30 years since the middle 50s

[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.660]
And in essence saying oh go to Daytona go to Texas go to New Orleans go step we don't want you here

[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.500]
We don't want your money. We don't want

[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.380]
We just don't want anybody here except those who are ready to die

[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:13.540]
And I get on a year day after day after day and you say these you've got to be blind not to see these things

[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.000]
The problem is most people in this community don't have the balls to say it. Okay. That's the problem

[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:25.420]
Hey, let's just go along like Alice in Wonderland like none of this you know like the guy said be where it be happy don't worry

[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.100]
Just be oblivious

[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.800]
That was our code word for the day of the day oblivious just pretend it is an out there

[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.200]
Well, I don't know how you can do that. I mean unless you just totally insensitive and have no redeeming human features

[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.300]
Whatsoever how can the hell can you live in the middle of this or even remotely connected to it and just be oblivious

[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.180]
So we got all these disconnected this jointed

[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.660]
Municipalities there's no city here. There's no core. There's no nothing here. I've been saying that for years

[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:03.140]
I mean in New York you know that man Hatton is the core of what New York is all about

[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.580]
I mean there are millions of people live in Brooklyn and in the Bronx and in Queens

[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.480]
But you know what New York is all about you know where the center of it is

[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.860]
In Detroit, you know where the center of it is with all their problems. They're still an identifiable

[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.380]
tangible city

[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.640]
And in Los Angeles even with all of their problems man

[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.320]
And they got more problems you can check a stick at you still know what the what when you think of Los Angeles

[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.980]
There are still certain things places that you can think of

[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:36.780]
But here what do we got we got the sunrise and we got Tamarack and we got plantation and we got Coral Gables

[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:44.160]
We got all these disjointed municipalities where where is where is it where is the center? Where's the tangible center of this world class city

[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.900]
That they keep telling us about it sure isn't Miami

[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:54.160]
I mean people have been fleeing out of Miami like like there was massive leprosy or something in Miami

[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.980]
How many people in Miami speak English

[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.680]
How many people don't want to go to Miami because they feel like foreigners in their own city

[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:15.120]
So you see so when you live in the suburbs of Detroit is I have done

[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:20.160]
Or of New York or of any other real cosmopolitan area

[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:26.580]
You still feel you know what Chicago is you know what Detroit is okay? You happen to live here as related to downtown

[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:27.860]
not here

[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:34.800]
Here it's like everybody's in their own little thing none of which have anything to do to the one next next to it

[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.100]
I mean in Detroit you can live in Royale Oak or you can live in Hazel Park or you can live in Southfield or you can

[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.180]
But he is still in Detroit

[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.420]
Anyhow we put up a couple of new buildings hey look at this

[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.520]
We have people with no vision. We have people have no concept of what they want this community to be

[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.960]
Except an outdoor funeral parlor in a dumping ground for refugees and illegal aliens

[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.000]
And

[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.520]
Again, these are things you're just not supposed to say these things. We're supposed to be an area that has just endless

[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.620]
Infinite capacity to take care of everybody from all over the world. We have infinite endless resources

[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.080]
That's why we got thousands of people sleeping on the streets

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.820]
Because we have infinite resources

[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:31.180]
And where are the Xavier and where the hell is Steve Clark bin in the middle of all this is he and hiding again somewhere is he in the damn closet again?

[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.140]
Haven't seen him every time we have a crisis in date county

[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.380]
Steve Clark goes off into hiding somewhere can't be found

[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.060]
I didn't see him down there in overtown or in Liberty City. Did you?

[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.220]
I haven't heard one quote. I haven't seen him on camera. I

[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.100]
Don't have any idea where he is

[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.820]
And he's supposed to be the mayor of this county

[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.740]
These are people with no vision with no courage with no guts with no nothing

[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:09.640]
And all they do is belly a conviction. Oh the federal government's doing that well if the federal government is doing things to us

[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.040]
Then you folks ought to be doing something about it

[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.680]
Take a fleet of buses and

[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:25.120]
Put these people back on those buses and send them back to Brownsville, Texas with a one-way ticket to ride, okay?

[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.540]
To spread the word that we don't have infinite capacity here

[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.060]
And we aren't going to let this administration do to us with Jimmy Jimmy Carter today years ago

[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:37.800]
We can't handle it right away if you say that you're anti-Hispanic you're a big head

[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.880]
You're the I'm so sick and tired of all that crap

[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.280]
And I'm so tired of the professional ethnic mentality that exists in this committee my god, aren't we all human beings?

[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:53.180]
Or are we just latins or anglos or blacks or whites or Jews or Christians my god that gets so damn old

[00:22:53.180 --> 00:23:00.720]
And how many times have I talked about that stupid thing that they perpetuate here in the media about our tri-ethnic community like this is some

[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:08.460]
Some bizarre experiment which explains why we have all these social problems here like it doesn't exist any place else

[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.560]
Have these people ever been in Los Angeles

[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:20.540]
My god there you go into Hollywood now in Los Angeles you drive through there and all the signs are in Chinese and in Vietnamese

[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.080]
And how many million Mexicans are there in California?

[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.520]
Huge Spanish

[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.840]
population in LA

[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.660]
And orientals of every size shape and variety

[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:42.280]
And I don't hear anybody say Los Angeles is a tri-ethnic community if you said that in New York they laugh at you

[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.380]
I mean New York ever since its inception practically has been a

[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:55.340]
melting pot a conglomeration of every kind of black white green purple you can name it they got it

[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.100]
And when they have problems there they all well, that's because we have our a tri-ethnic community

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.680]
That's because we got a bunch of redneck Yahoo's running this town

[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.340]
We've never even been out of the state of Florida. We got a bunch of crackers

[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:14.040]
We got the cracker mentality. They don't even know what a metropolitan city's all about they wouldn't know and if it bit them on the lip

[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.140]
And

[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.020]
All they want to do is keep running around

[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:25.360]
Feathering their own nest and bragging about oh, we're a world-class city. We're the gateway to Latin America or this where that that's a lot of crap

[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.420]
I remember when that

[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.880]
Happened in the early 80s. Oh, yeah

[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.300]
We don't have to worry about the Reagan depression. We're the gateway to Latin America and then the devaluation of the peso occurred man

[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.160]
And those people who are bringing all that cash up here

[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.980]
Buying all those video recorders and electronics equipment and everything else they can get their hands. They stop coming

[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.720]
Because their money wasn't worth anything anymore

[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.880]
And you know something they haven't come back

[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.140]
And they aren't gonna come back

[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.240]
Now I know that there are terrible sinful evil places in America like Las Vegas and Reno and Tahoe

[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.380]
Where they have riots every day

[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.620]
I never read about any

[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.620]
I never experienced any I never heard about any of them

[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.640]
But certainly they must have because those are

[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:18.180]
Dense of iniquity man sin they have casino gambling they have conventions. They've got hotels that are full all year round

[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.960]
Not just for two months out of the year when they call it the season

[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.940]
Hey, man, it's the season now you can come down here. You don't even have to live in a condo. How do you like that?

[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:30.800]
This

[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:36.760]
Community needs some leadership some people with some vision some people with bald and we don't have one of them

[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.460]
We don't have one of them in this town

[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.260]
not one

[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:49.020]
And as far as the black community is concerned anytime somebody offers himself or office like when Marvin done ran for mayor and Miami

[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.040]
Oh, we're not gonna vote for him. He's married to a white woman. He's an uncle Tom

[00:25:53.260 --> 00:26:00.000]
No, let's put brilliant people like Miller Dawkins in office man. There is a great brilliant man who represented the black community right?

[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.060]
Almost like a brain surgeon and I can in the reason that I gave up doing this kind of program two years ago

[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:15.140]
Is because I could sit here and I could sweat my brains out every day and scream and holler and get my blood pressure up

[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.360]
And it doesn't mean a god damn thing, okay?

[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.840]
It isn't gonna change anything in this god forsaken town

[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:28.800]
I was thinking when I was coming to work. I talked about you know look out the window in the sunny shining in smag nippers and it's the 18th of January

[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.840]
And I was thinking the only reason it's like this today is because the politicians haven't figured out a way to screw the weather up yet

[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:43.080]
Someday if we live long enough they'll figure out how to screw that up too, okay, but they haven't done it yet

[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.280]
It's 10.51 at W.I.O. Day. I want to tell you about

[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.280]
But you why would they I could go on for the whole four hours which I'm not gonna do

[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.960]
I could just sit here and ramble on I could have called you and said stay home today. I know I know but I didn't do it

[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.780]
And there's no point in just going on a four-hour soapbox because as I said you can keep repeating the same things over and over forever

[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.520]
And the fact that you got a whole bunch of different groups out there

[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.420]
You have those who don't care and are never gonna care like I said yesterday

[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:17.120]
You cannot force people to care about things that they don't care about no matter how much you believe they ought to care

[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.700]
If they don't care there is no it's like the old saying you can take a horse

[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.680]
To water, but you can't make them drink. Right, and it's the same thing here

[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.100]
And we've got a community where we have all these Neanderthals, you know

[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:35.720]
Closed you to weigh in their condos with their little supermarket right there next door and their little dollar movie theater and their whole

[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.440]
Their little buffet. I don't want to say sadies because that would make me sick

[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.820]
You know all of this stuff where they live in their own little world

[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.080]
They're not a part of anything

[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:53.440]
That's one of the reasons we can't we haven't filled up that stadium once if indeed the game takes place on Sunday if

[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.540]
Indeed it takes place

[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.900]
It'll be the first time since that stadium has been built that it's been filled up and I got news for you man

[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.920]
That's one of the most beautiful stadiums in the country

[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.640]
I hate to use the expression pardon us Tom jica, but it's state of the art. Yeah

[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.040]
The location couldn't possibly be better unless they brought it right to your living room

[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.540]
It couldn't be better. It's right at the daybroward line

[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.580]
Okay, it's right at the turnpike

[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:24.260]
I mean, it's just so easy to get there that it's on and yeah, they got parking problems life what you know life just isn't that simple okay

[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.680]
It's like when I lived in Detroit and we used to go to tiger stadium right downtown and one of the worst parts of the city

[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.000]
And every time you'd park there you'd pay a kid a dollar to watch your car and he'd see you know

[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.340]
They still would break it and steal stuff, but at least you know they wouldn't rip it up you'd get home, okay?

[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:46.700]
And that was never an excuse and even with garbage teams during a lot of those years they still packed in there like crazy

[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.400]
But this is a community that just doesn't care because we brought in all the wrong folks, okay

[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.060]
I'd say we got about 70% of the population here that ought to go someplace else like back where they came from

[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.120]
It's like that movie that I saw the other night towards song trilogy and ad bankrupt after her husband dies and the sun says

[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.620]
What are you gonna do now? Oh, I'll go to Florida. He says what for us is oh, that's where we all go

[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.420]
We all go to Florida for what

[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:17.980]
What logic is there that says that if you were living in reading person somehow you have to freeze your ass off all your life

[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.660]
Until you attain a certain age so you can come here and get a senior citizen discount

[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:29.340]
What logic is there in that why can't this be a cosmopolitan city with a balanced demographic just like any other city

[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.540]
I don't understand

[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.800]
This is a con game that the developers have been playing for years while they've been ruining this area

[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:43.140]
The same developers that stole all the beach in dade county and gave it to all the hotel people and the condo people

[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.260]
They just stole it from the public

[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.540]
And now they want to do the same thing in Fort Lauderdale. Of course, I won't make any difference because nobody's gonna be going there anyway

[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.360]
So Bob Cox can have the beach they can just have a big

[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.800]
gigantic majeun game up there on the beach

[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.000]
They're gonna make any difference

[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]
Because there'll be nobody there under the age of 100 by the time they get through with it

[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:16.400]
And I don't have any since you know anybody that comes on a year and starts giving you simplistic answers is a BS artist

[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.500]
Okay, there are no simplistic answers

[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:25.960]
Because it's going on so long and gotten so complicated. There are no easy simplistic answers. There's no magic pill

[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.720]
And anybody that wants to narrow it down

[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.780]
Well, it's you know the pro police people against the anti police or the racist against the real

[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.040]
It's a lot of crap, okay

[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:44.280]
The bottom line is that we've got problems just like any other major urban area

[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:52.260]
But you don't solve the problems by being barbarians and by destroying your own city and burning down people's businesses that they've worked

[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.780]
Their entire lives to build up and destroying their lives and their families

[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.000]
It's like a disease. It spreads its contagious. It's all through these communities

[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:08.300]
We're just supposed to sit here and say oh it's an isolated incident forget it life goes on a sunny shining right

[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.840]
Okay, we'll come back and get to your calls after the news

[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.040]
Henry is standing by with the 11 o'clock WIOD news and we'll come back at 11.05

[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.440]
It's 11.06 at WIOD we're back for our number two

[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:27.060]
Steve will be along it to this afternoon. I see that his guest today has been canceled as he got some other guests

[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:32.600]
Well, we'll find out as we go along. I don't know one of those things. Okay. We have an open line. It's in Boka 278

[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.420]
9463 where somebody got impatient. I can't say that I you know blame him but

[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.660]
It's a way it goes

[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:46.260]
One of those situations where what I have to say is a lot more important than what a lot of these people have to say if I can say that myself

[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.480]
Okay, our first call of this hour in Fort Pierce. Hello

[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.960]
Uh, yeah, uh, morning

[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.700]
There's an echo but uh, yeah, I called because I guess it was just trying to stress a point that

[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.180]
You made this morning and it's really directed toward a lot of people that I heard call yesterday

[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.300]
Not only on your show, but on a

[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.320]
Steve Kane show and I would classify these people as

[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.400]
You got a radio on that could be it yeah, there it goes. Okay

[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:16.260]
Um

[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:25.420]
I would classify them as a gung-ho militant. Okay. These are the people that uh think that the police didn't do enough in the situation

[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.500]
Then should have you know shot a couple of people and I would have made the situation a lot better

[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.420]
Well, let me say this to you. I want to apologize to a caller I had yesterday

[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.820]
Although I was a little suspicious about his motivation

[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.580]
But I caught somebody short who was saying that the police didn't do enough

[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.620]
But in looking back he was right

[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.420]
I'm not saying they should have shot a bunch of people

[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:49.300]
But they sure as hell shouldn't engage in this practice of standing back and watching people burn down buildings

[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.460]
And as I said you know assume the posture of the hockey referee

[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.000]
You know with their arms folded standing back and watching the destruction of these communities

[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.900]
It's not acceptable

[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.500]
And if we don't have enough manpower and we do have to call in the national guard

[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:08.920]
Then the powers that be should have the guts to do it and let's put a stop to it instead of just standing back and watching people burn your animals burn down their own community

[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.160]
It's unacceptable

[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:16.060]
I guess what I was trying to get across them was that you know like in any organization

[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.720]
You know whether the the police department or

[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:26.260]
The ACLU or even the clergy you're always gonna have a few people that you know or you know just you know

[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.820]
They're I don't know what you call them you call them a schlepper whatever you want to call them

[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:35.600]
But you know like you have clergy people that molest children and you know you have a couple police officers

[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.060]
No, you don't have a couple sir

[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.880]
Please don't insult my intelligence. Okay. We have massive police corruption in this community

[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.700]
And we've had a succession of these grotesque episodes

[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.780]
We just had the the beating death of this alleged drug dealer Mercado

[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:56.060]
I mean our police supposed to be the judge and jury and then carry out the justice and kill people is that what law enforcement's all about

[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.540]
See don't please don't get sucked into this idea that it's one against the other

[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.120]
It's either the blacks or the police or the that's not how life works

[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:11.280]
We have serious serious problems in law enforcement in this community in high a Leah and in Miami and other parts of South Florida

[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.640]
And just to say well or a couple of bad apples and any bunch. It's not acceptable

[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:21.780]
It's not acceptable and somebody has to take the leadership and every time we have one of these incidents right away

[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.640]
Like when the Mercado case right away here's the Hispanic police officers

[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.740]
Association and they're out there marching in the streets and protesting because the officers

[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:35.940]
Involved in the incident happened to be Hispanic. What the hell difference does it make what their ethnic background is

[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:44.180]
You know when somebody kills you you're just as dead whether they're Anglo or Hispanic or black or then make any difference what they're all about once they kill you

[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:44.820]
You're dead

[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:51.500]
So please don't be naive sir don't get sucked into this crap about well, and we got a couple of bad cops

[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.140]
We've got a police situation in this community that is disgraceful that is out of control

[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:02.680]
I don't mind me. I'm not really. I can't say you know. I'm right down. Where do you live? I'm in for Pierce I in Fort Pierce

[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:08.100]
Okay, sir. Well listen good luck to you. He's in Fort Pierce and he's telling us we got a couple of bad apples

[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:15.160]
See here's another guy who's in who you know believes that life is a talk show life is not a talk show, okay

[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:22.280]
This isn't a question of just some somebody getting on and opening his mouth and the you know giving opinions that are all right or all wrong

[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.320]
The bottom line is this is a very complicated mess

[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:34.960]
Well

[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.220]
Well, Nick has an interesting line on the screen. I could do the entire rest of the show on it line

[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:44.580]
He says since 1980 in this community every ride or disturbance has been started by a cops error that isn't true

[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:45.860]
the

[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.300]
You know, it depends on what you want to call a disturbance

[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.320]
The disturbance is on interstate 95 which went on for months where we had to bring in the Florida Highway patrol

[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:01.080]
Which weren't and they weren't in the same setting as a series of fires and looting and so on

[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.720]
But that certainly was a civil disturbance that had this community in an uproar

[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.020]
That wasn't because of something a policeman it's because we had a bunch of barbarian animals out there

[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:15.420]
Who were stopping people's automobile so they could steal their money and destroy their cars, but basically what you say is true

[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.680]
So this isn't something new

[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.340]
That we just discovered that we have police

[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:25.280]
Excesses in this community we have a bunch of trigger happy cops out there

[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.060]
And a lot of them are scared to death and if they're scared to death

[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.940]
They should go to work in birdinds or something. Okay, they shouldn't be police officers

[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.400]
I know they have a thankless job at an almost impossible job

[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.120]
But I would want it for all the money in the world and they're grotesquely underpaid

[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.100]
But nobody forces them to get into what they know it up front. Okay

[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.240]
One of those deals where you know it up front

[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.460]
We have a an ex-co

[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.860]
Well, let's see we got to do the break and then we'll get to him because it probably you want to give him a couple of minutes

[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.640]
We have an open line and you guessed it. It's in Palm Beach 655

[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:04.160]
WIOD if you've ever been turned down for a loan because of a negative credit rating

[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.820]
Or been aggravated with the credit bureaus then you owe it to me. It's 1114 at WIOD

[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.720]
We have an open line in Volka where somebody dropped off 278 9463

[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.100]
And we'll go to overtown hello

[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:15.880]
Yeah

[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.000]
Yes

[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.360]
Hello

[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:17.780]
Yeah

[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.240]
Hey, man

[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.780]
I'm gonna ask you questions. Yeah

[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.780]
I'm on the who you call on the animal and overtown man. Who is an animal?

[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.000]
Yeah, who you tell me who the animal is man. You want an answer to the question?

[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.980]
Yeah, who you call on the animal overtown. You explain that to me. I will if you'll be quiet and listen

[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:43.420]
It's not just an overtown. It's anywhere people who go into the streets and take out their anger or alleged anger or season opportunity

[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:44.640]
to

[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.120]
Sure this town has turned into it's good that you bring these kind of things out

[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:56.040]
I'm a retired New York City detective. I went through all those riots in New York and they named them as as they do this one

[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.280]
Arace riot. I don't believe that that cop knew who he was shooting

[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.620]
He just overreacted and he stooped or whatever and he would have shot his brother if he was driving by an

[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:11.080]
Immoticicle in the dark. I don't believe that that cop knew who he was shooting. It's certainly not racial

[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.280]
In New York. What do you mean it's certainly not racial? How do you know that?

[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:20.460]
Do you really think that that that cop was waiting for a for a if that was a white guy in the mouth?

[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.560]
I want me to give you an honest answer. I haven't got any idea. I'm not inside his head. I don't know him

[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.700]
I don't know anything about him. I don't know anything about his record. You don't know him

[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.480]
You know this business again to go back to what you say about a show

[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.900]
It's you know you can go on the air if you want to do this

[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.640]
You know what all these instant experts who have an an answer for everything within 25 minutes of it happening

[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:42.840]
I don't have the answers. I don't know what he was thinking about. Maybe he was scared to death

[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.360]
Maybe the guy in a motorcycle made some kind of threatening comment or gesture. I don't know

[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.900]
Oh, what I'm saying is he wouldn't be able to be caught in any evidence. How do you know that?

[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.680]
Well, you have to have a bit of sense

[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.740]
What you would have probably say you have to have a bit of a sense

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.920]
Do you think that the cops that the killed Arthur McDuffie had since

[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.760]
No, but I don't think they killed him because he was black. No, of course not

[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:14.200]
If he would be I would you know, I was involved in these kind of riots and the cops were scared as the people and

[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:23.000]
Well, listen if they're scared then they shouldn't be there they should like I said should be opening up a subred hotdog stand on a street corner somewhere and go find a nice easy job

[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.100]
Okay, sir have a nice day while you ponder the situation and 1119 at WIOD

[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.900]
And we have an open line in Broward 524-9463

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.820]
See it's it's very unusual. I wish we'd get that call for example

[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:44.300]
It's obvious that the black kid who called before had no idea who I am or what this program is all about or anything about

[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:50.600]
Anything because the people in overtime and liberty city are not listening to this radio station or listening WEDR, okay?

[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:55.860]
Or to hot 105 or power 96 they're not listening to these programs

[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.780]
Away Miami. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Meal. Yeah

[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:06.300]
Yeah, I wanted to call yesterday couldn't get through to you and Steve. How you doing today?

[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:08.340]
Good show

[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.180]
What can we do for you sir? Yeah, listen. I thought I had a good scoop for you yesterday

[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.620]
I wanted to talk to some of the fellows who work here

[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.580]
They're living liberty city in over town. I wanted to get to opinion on what happened

[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:27.380]
It gave me a new perspective on the whole situation. I just wanted to be later because only so a small article and a hell about it

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.740]
I asked them what they thought of when a fellow is getting killed in a motorcycle and

[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.760]
Tell me he says

[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:40.960]
Who is shot? She's a ghost. He's up dealing drugs. I left my wife before that liberty city

[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.880]
And that is then always right in and his motorcycle

[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.340]
But cops can't catch him well

[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:51.240]
So in other words you assume that the police officer was shot and knew that is I was just assuming that it's true

[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.800]
Which I have no reason to do wait. I just want to say this one thing

[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.600]
I just don't want the whole community to jump the gun right there

[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.520]
Didn't never Johnson until a year-old situation

[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.900]
What do you mean you don't want the whole community to jump the gun they already did

[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:12.620]
They already did they had no facts. They had no concept really of what happened except maybe those who immediately were an area and saw it themselves

[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:18.520]
These other people didn't have any don't you understand that the people who are committing all these barbaric acts

[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.880]
They're not doing it as a response to the shooting. They're using that that as an excuse

[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:33.380]
Every time there's another excuse you don't go out and and loot somebody's store and steal 80 thousand dollars of worth of food because you're mad that somebody got shot

[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.780]
You do that because you're a barbaric animal

[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.780]
Hey, you got it

[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:44.520]
The hell came out today showed this guy is arrested two years ago 90 times a man honored the output is convicted

[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.180]
So what about so does that mean that we shoot him in the head?

[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.640]
I'm not saying it that's one point in person but I have no idea what I mean is a joy writing young man

[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.740]
Now a convicted felon yeah, okay, let's call

[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.480]
What he is what he is okay?

[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.560]
Sir, it doesn't make any difference what you'd call and the bottom line is he is dead

[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:13.060]
He didn't wasn't shot because he was committing any grotesque crime other than speeding 60 miles an hour on a motorcycle that we know of

[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:18.160]
And the other party who's dead is dead because he was in a wrong place at the wrong time

[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:21.140]
Well

[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.620]
Just amazing and this is what disturbs me every time you try to have one of these discussions

[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.560]
It's another reason that I'm glad that most of the time we don't do these kind of shows

[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.860]
Is because you've got all these mavens out there man all these instant experts got all the answers and they've got to it all analyzed

[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.520]
Pal you don't have any idea what you're talking about okay

[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.880]
It's so more cut so much

[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.040]
What did the cops shoot him because he was black how the hell do I know?

[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:51.440]
But are we supposed to assume that it's just a series of coincidences

[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:58.240]
That Arthur McDuffy was black and Neville Johnson was black and this guy was but just a series of coincidences

[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.060]
And is it also just a coincidence that we can almost never convict a cop in this town on anything no matter what they do

[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.320]
Rarely do we ever convict a cop

[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.460]
Something got to be wrong in that

[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.180]
I

[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.240]
Mean we got so much police corruption here. It's difficult to tell the law biting people from the cops other than which ones are wearing the uniforms

[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.740]
And sometimes even that doesn't tell you

[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:30.160]
It's 1123 I guess it would be good 26 past 11 at W. I. D. Steve's guest this afternoon a revering Carlton Coleman

[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.700]
of the new Providence missionary Baptist Church

[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.220]
And the some other guest still pending and they'll obviously be discussing the ongoing

[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.640]
Disturbances in our community you know, again, there been disturbances. Yeah riots disturbance is civil disobedience

[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.420]
Whatever you want to call it makes no difference whatsoever. Quite riots. It's still old. Yeah

[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.540]
It's still amounts to the same thing. Okay

[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:56.100]
So that'll be coming up an in-depth discussion with some of the people who obviously live in these areas and are familiar with the areas

[00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:02.440]
One of the additional brilliant things to go back to that aberrant call we had about 1050 minutes ago this morning they

[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.220]
Started fires in a church in our own community

[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:11.720]
And so see when you get angry you burn down your own businesses and you burn your churches and no question about it pal

[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.180]
This is definitely the way to solve the problem

[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:17.100]
Hmm it works every time doesn't it

[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.440]
Now you have USA today there. I wasn't gonna say anything about this, but it really crossed me

[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.960]
I wouldn't have said anything except for the fact that T. Willard Fair

[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.160]
Has an interview on the op-ed page. He also showed up unfortunately on this station yesterday

[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.300]
T. Willard Fair is in a vowed black races to hates white folks

[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.780]
T. Willard Fair bragged in my show many years ago that as a young man in his community when he worked in the kitchen of a restaurant

[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.940]
He used to spit in the soup to get even with the honkeys

[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:48.940]
T. Willard Fair was quoted several years ago when we had the last major riots in

[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.760]
Overtown in 1982 after the Neville Johnson shooting

[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.800]
He was shown in the newspaper in a herald the next day playing golf out on the golf course when he was asked why he wasn't there in a community

[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:06.080]
He said oh they got it under control there and meaning meaning that the things that were going on the disturbances in the fire were the right solution to the problem

[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.340]
He says they'll take care of it. They're doing the right thing

[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.920]
And he's being quoted see that's another problem of this community

[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.920]
We got about a half a dozen of these chronic regular spokesmen

[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.560]
You know this one is a spokesman for the black community mr. Kuntz is a spokesman for the gay community

[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.680]
And all these other chronic people who keep popping up in the media and they're not spokesman for anybody

[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:31.180]
So it's interesting that a public national publication like USA today would fair it out someone as

[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.420]
Distacible as mr. Fair to be a responsible spokesperson under these circumstances

[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:43.520]
Although I notice his comments have tempered somewhat over the years, but yeah, and I don't see you're right

[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:49.800]
You know, I don't see Steve Clark here. I keep looking at all these we haven't seen hide nor here

[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:55.080]
Not of mr. Clark or any of the magnificent nine the metro commission

[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.560]
Now the last time I checked

[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.840]
I could be wrong, but the last time I checked over town and Liberty City and coconut Grove were all in dade county

[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.440]
Now maybe that's changed

[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:10.260]
Maybe we have something new that happened while we were doing all that frivolous the lighthearted stuff and we miss

[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.760]
I don't think so. I think they're still in dade county and I don't see the metro commission or the county manager

[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.800]
Involved in these things in any way shape or form

[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.640]
But par for the chorus maybe Steve is breaking a bottle of champagne over a boat somewhere

[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.060]
He's very good at that. That's his area of expertise mr. Clark

[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.440]
um my amy hello

[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.680]
Hello, yes, how you doing?

[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:40.580]
Okay, uh, it's funny you were just mentioning about Steve Clark where he is the commissioner reminds me of Ferrer when he was skiing

[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.500]
Doing the McDeffey rights. Yeah, instead of being down here where he belonged

[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:51.280]
And uh, this this this been going on for a long time now for many years

[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:58.120]
Going back to 1980 when we had to put through the police department so many people for affirmative action

[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.020]
Because of the fit the federal investigation that was going to come down

[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.840]
Because of the McDeffey rights

[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:08.500]
And this is just a byproduct of all the people that had to be pushed through the system

[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.940]
So Miami looked good

[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.900]
Yeah in front of federal eyes

[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:19.160]
Is correct is a lot of truth in that you know, and now we're paying the consequences, you know and uh

[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.860]
I myself um, I'm uh, I'm disabled. I'm blind and I run a snake barn downtown Miami

[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:28.700]
Instead of working to provide for my family today

[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.280]
I got to stay home because I have to be scared of what might happen

[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.900]
If I have nowhere to getting out of there if something does happen. Yeah, you know and uh

[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.920]
Instead of you know, you're talking about the Super Bowl. Hell it won't get a Super Bowl until the next century never see it again here

[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.980]
Never ever see it again. Never you know, I guarantee you know

[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.460]
And there are few things in life that are absolutely certain

[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.440]
But this is one you could bet every dime on that you've got that you will never see a Super Bowl played here again

[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.160]
Never

[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.540]
That's for sure, you know, this is an opportunity that we have a golden opportunity

[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.640]
To really change the image in the eyes of other people

[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:16.680]
Yep, and uh and we blew it. I mean, this is absolutely we blowing it not as a community as a whole

[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.580]
I mean, you know, this there's no fingers to be pointed at because every time you point there's three fingers pointing at you

[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:27.300]
Yeah, you know, and as a community as a whole we suck

[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.280]
You know, you really blew it you summed it up in one word we suck two words. Okay. Good luck to my friend

[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.160]
Thank you

[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:39.500]
1131 at W. I. D. We have an open line in date 751 9463

[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.700]
Miami. Hello

[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:47.540]
Hello, hi. Hi. Neil. Yeah. Hi. I call it because I'm pretty angry about the situation as you are

[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:51.740]
And I only hope that the person in overcount is listening right now

[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:56.120]
Because in my opinion there is never excuse for violence

[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:03.560]
And I can't understand how these people could express their anger in such a destructive way to themselves

[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:09.000]
One of the things that makes me the angriest is I keep hearing a lot of these pseudo intellectual calls on talk shows

[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.160]
I heard some yesterday and then some last night from people who are trying to say

[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.300]
What they're doing is wrong, but it's understandable

[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:20.680]
It is not understandable. It is not acceptable human behavior

[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.820]
You know, I'm a social worker and I deal with a lot of people

[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:31.420]
I sometimes take routes through overtown through neighborhoods that I hope my parents aren't listening because they wouldn't like to hear me say this

[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:36.180]
And people don't need to make changes in the lot and their lives themselves

[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:45.060]
You can't expect other people to help you to you know to make excuses that the nigger augwins are coming in and that's a good reason

[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.340]
These people want to work that's more than this person who caught

[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:52.520]
You know, you know, it's amazing, but until we had that episode two days ago

[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:59.440]
I didn't hear a word about any complaints about the nigger augwins were coming in and getting jobs for five bucks an hour

[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.040]
Nobody was talking about that

[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:08.180]
I don't hear anything about that and now all of a sudden that's another convenient excuse to try to somehow in some

[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.540]
Cock-eyed warped way

[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.020]
Justified the barbaric behavior

[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:19.120]
You know, there is no reason that the barbaric behavior is going on other than the fact as many have said including some of the black leaders in the community

[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:27.720]
That every time we have another tragic incident. It's the same groups of animals who get out there and exploit the situation and do the same things the same

[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:35.460]
And the chronic thing behavior over it. Not only hurting themselves, but they're hurting their entire communities and if Martin Luther King was alive today

[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:40.380]
He would be turning in his grave on his birthday that people had to act that way. That is correct

[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:47.600]
Okay, well take care, Neil. Thanks a lot. Bye. Here's a quote out of USA today national newspaper from

[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:53.260]
Annie Gooden 28 a divorced unemployed mother of two who lives in overtown. This is the quote

[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:59.660]
The only way we get any attention is when some of us loot and destroy and tear up our neighborhood

[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.080]
She says that the area has been ignored for too long isn't that brilliant?

[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.420]
Annie or a real genius of brain surgeon and let me just say this to you. Why couldn't the very same people

[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.620]
If they really are doing these things, I don't believe it

[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.360]
But if they're really doing these things because they're

[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:20.760]
Distraught over this latest episode police excess and a killing and so on to guide a motorcycle

[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.480]
Why is it they don't all get together in

[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:30.820]
buses or in automobiles or in vans and go down to dinner key go down a city hall and march and protest and do sit-ins

[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:37.200]
And do things that are not violent. Okay, that's what Martin Luther King preached non-violent protest

[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:44.780]
All right, wouldn't that get attention? He and his folks weren't busy setting people's cars on fire and dragging people out of cars and trying to kill them

[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.600]
That isn't how they accomplished anything

[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.720]
And

[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.300]
As far as the moron with his honky crap you ought to go see Mississippi burning and rediscover that

[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:01.160]
The two Jewish white people who were murdered two of the three

[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:05.140]
Were white and Jewish the civil rights marchers

[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:13.320]
That the president and the attorney general who responsible for more civil rights legislation and reform that anytime in a history of this country

[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.260]
Were white Irish Catholics

[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:21.540]
But don't confuse people with the facts see because we're all honkies and they're all niggers and all this other crap

[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:27.960]
I mean it's pathetic. I mean if you can't graduate if you can't get beyond that point of metal process

[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.980]
Then you're pathetic

[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:37.180]
It's 1135 at W.I.O.D. and we'll be right. It's 1152 at W.I.O.D. as

[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:41.080]
We're speaking the Miami City Commission is having an emergency meeting

[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.920]
And the CNN is carrying it live so some of you want to watch and listen to the same time

[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:55.940]
Maybe they can fill us in on what's going on right? Yeah, but it is being televised on CNN as we continue making headlines around the world showing our best feet

[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:03.320]
It's it's really it's just it's mind boggling. I have to laugh a little bit or I'll cry yeah

[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.740]
Okay, Hollywood hello

[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.700]
Yes, we didn't have Super Bowl week

[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:14.440]
Would you expect swaras to walk down the middle of the street during a ride with the net?

[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.320]
Well, I don't know I really don't know. I'm not going to I you know

[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.620]
I think Mr

[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:21.220]
Swaras is incompetent. I think he's basically a good guy

[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.500]
I think he's a decent person. I think he's in way over his head

[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.320]
But I I don't think he was there because cameras were rolling

[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.480]
I think he was there because he at least he was there

[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.320]
Which is more than I can say for a mr. Clark and 70s other people. I don't know where they were

[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:34.800]
Yes, or that is true

[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.920]
Because it seems like they're pointing like a commission to look in it real quick when

[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.620]
Seems like the other rides they

[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.320]
Really pay attention now and you mentioned that's there

[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:48.020]
Well, there's no question that because the entire world media is in town that they're there under enormous

[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:54.300]
microscopic inspection and under tremendous duress to do something as quickly as possible no question about that

[00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:00.700]
And by the way right in line with that you know as well as I do and not too many people have talked about this

[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:07.160]
That one of the reasons that the perpetrators of these acts continue doing what they're doing is because they know that the cameras are rolling

[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:12.980]
I would say to Glenn during one of the breaks earlier that it reminds me of the riots that they were having in terran years ago

[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:18.360]
And the hostages were being held there and while the cameras from the US and all over the world were rolling

[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.640]
All of these Iranian students were marching and chanting and screaming and shouting and they had the hankies

[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:29.200]
They were waving in the placards and the reporters told us that every time the cameras would stop rolling

[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.080]
They would then go about their business and they were eating hot dogs from vendors

[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.960]
We're selling food on the streets and they were laughing and having a good time

[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.200]
And they were just posturing for the cameras

[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:43.360]
So these animals in over town liberty city and wherever else they're waiting in the in the lurch

[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:47.700]
They know that the world media is here and man they're going to get on television see

[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.080]
Yes, sir. You're right. They're doing the same thing over in triple every time they turn the camera. That's correct

[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.540]
It's every single time. Okay, my girlfriend

[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.260]
Listening to you in there 10 to 11 hour

[00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:00.240]
Out when you went on

[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:07.640]
Really letting it out. Yeah, she hates your shell, but she agreed with you. Okay. It's pretty nothing nothing's perfect

[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:11.660]
Yes, but sometimes she doesn't like your thing, but she agrees with you perfect

[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.540]
Okay, you're right about four-large obi

[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.020]
Okay, thanks for your calls 1155 a WIOD. We have an open line in Broward 524

[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:24.300]
9463 Miami. Hello. Uh, yes. I would like to speak to

[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.800]
Neil Rogers, please speaking yes

[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:34.400]
Neil I I would like to say I you do a you agree with what you're talking about because I was down in coconut

[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:39.160]
Grove about a month and a half ago doing a friend of favor taking him home

[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.620]
I went off the wrong

[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:49.980]
Street and I thought I went over something in my card to make a long story short a black gentleman came out of nowhere

[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:55.580]
And he asked me if I wanted a binding crack. I had told him no

[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.280]
And to make a long story short he pulled a knife out on me

[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.320]
And he had said to me give me a money or or he wanted to what knife me

[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:12.720]
And I was I do live in North Miami Beach. I live with my eagram mother. I take a caravor

[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.380]
and obviously I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and

[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:23.500]
And I gave him $20 for him to leave me alone. I don't I wasn't raised in a place

[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:28.480]
Where you know, we're people fight with knives and nothing of that nature

[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.500]
Make well you better say you better come into the real world because that's

[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.100]
That's what the cities of

[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.980]
Unless you want to go out and live in

[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:43.980]
In the pohoke well, I'm not a good example either. There's got a lot of rednecks up there who not to I can't I can't think of too many places anymore

[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:48.780]
Where you can to get away from it, you know you used to be you go out in the country somewhere you get away from it

[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.660]
Not not so much anymore is no place to run. Oh sure you are

[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:56.360]
So right now, but to make a long story short as I was getting back in my car

[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:04.940]
He pulled off my gold necklace. I called up the police department when I came home and the damn cops didn't do anything

[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:10.480]
And I just think it's a damn shame. I am very angry at the city of Miami

[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.580]
They have to pull people over for giving people speeding tickets

[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:20.440]
But the meanwhile they don't go after these aren't me these assholes that go after

[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.160]
Rob being doing good drugs and things of that nature

[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.840]
And I just wanted to call to thank you for bringing this out in the open

[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:33.900]
Because I just think that the people around here should know what the hells are going on

[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:38.700]
Okay, I appreciate your call yesterday. I started just getting into something and then we got sidetracked on

[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:46.300]
Another topic, but the thing about jails and the people in this community like most places in the country don't want a jail or prison built anywhere within

[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:53.860]
Shouting distance of where they live and as a result we don't have enough prison cells to go around and we we just cannot put away

[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.580]
All the people that need to be behind bars

[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.980]
At least that's the convening excuse

[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:05.780]
That we have for not going out and regular sweeps every single day and date brown and the probably in Palm Beach as well and rounding up these

[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.460]
Barbarians who stand on street corners making a living making easy bucks by

[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.560]
destroying other people's lives by peddling them every substance has ever been invented

[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:19.320]
And of course the excuse the one of the stories we keep hearing is well, you know

[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.880]
We're not the ones who are the kingpins. We're not the ones bringing it in. We're just you know

[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:28.820]
That's a lot of crap. Okay. Nobody can force you to be involved in peddling drugs unless you want to do it

[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.860]
Unless you discovered that it's a very easy way to make a big buck

[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.860]
dishonestly

[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.420]
And it's a lot easier than going out and getting an honest job and making something out of your life

[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:44.560]
And we got it on every street quarry you can imagine man all through over town and Liberty City and parts of the grow

[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.340]
and other parts of South Florida

[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:52.420]
And certainly up in brown we got plenty of it in the city of Fort Lauderdale and in Lauderdale right there in Broward Boulevard

[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.880]
There are convenience stores between my house and i95 where a couple of times

[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.760]
I've gone in to get a newspaper or whatever

[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.400]
Or gone with a friend and stopped to have and get a pack of cigarettes and

[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:08.360]
Immediately approached and to buy some crack or whatever else variety of stuff that he had on him at the time and that's

[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:08.940]
Broward

[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:14.060]
Oh, yeah, just mention that in past. Oh, it's it's not hey listen new people in Broward county that think well

[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:19.820]
You know, this is down here in Miami man. You're living in a dream or you're out of your mind out of your mind

[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.960]
Anyway, we're out of time for this hour. We'll mention again that Steve will have a panel of local individuals who are

[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:33.100]
In one way or another connected with what is going on at least with what's happening in overtime and Liberty City

[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.980]
One of them are ever in Carlton Coleman of the new Providence missionary Baptist Church

[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.800]
Which is located at 7th Avenue in 53rd Street that'll be coming up on a steep paint show at two

[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.440]
News right now up to be it's 12.05 at wio. They were back for our number three and again

[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:52.760]
We are not you know, this is what we usually do anymore. I don't know this kind of show in many many a moon, but um

[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.280]
To sit down and try to be

[00:59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.280]
laugh and joking and doing that kind of stuff the last two days forget it just is not

[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.540]
possible, okay, and wouldn't be appropriate when make any sense

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.740]
Not at all

[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:14.620]
So anyway moving right along as we continue whistling our happy song. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes. Is this Neil? Yes, sir

[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:20.160]
Neil have been on since before the news and I hope you give me a little chance to

[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.360]
Spread some light in this darkness that I've been hearing coming over the radio

[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.220]
You for the past half four

[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.620]
Your caricatures of the people in

[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:38.740]
Overtown and other places animals is something that I find very offensive and I don't understand whole

[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.340]
Uh, you can

[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:45.100]
Need those kinds of expression. It's fascinating to me that you're you know, you hear what you want to hear

[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:52.100]
I said that the people who are engaged in this kind of aberrant behavior are animals in barbarian today

[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.900]
All I said sir let me finish at least one sentence, okay

[01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:04.880]
And I also said that the people I feel the sorry is for are the majority of the people who live in overtown and liberty city who are decent

[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.060]
Law abiding people who live in a constant state of terror

[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:15.000]
Fearing for their lives and safety because of the same barbarians. That is what I said

[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:23.400]
No, these barbarians that that that you speak of are people who are locked out of the mainstream of the community

[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:30.220]
Oh, yeah, here we go in in in in the United States here who are taking advantage of an who I'm not

[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.700]
Given avenues to the proper kinds of education

[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.000]
Oh, no, wait a minute. They're not given they're not given the proper kind of

[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.780]
I'm I'm sure what are you talking about? They're not giving the proper down here

[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.500]
I'm gonna put you on hold okay

[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:52.500]
Because you don't want to have a conversation you want to make a speech we don't do speak the only speeches on issue are by the host okay

[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.240]
What line is this guy on

[01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.940]
Was he on one are you there? No, wait a minute hold on. I don't even know where he was now. What line was he on?

[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.780]
Okay, Nick is doing his own show and there I have no idea

[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.700]
Um on two are you there?

[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:14.980]
Yes, I want to okay. Well, this is good. Well, just for a while. How about three? Hello now that's not him either

[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:16.580]
Okay, well evidently he's gone

[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.840]
Because I'm sure was on a date county line wasn't it yeah he's gone

[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:27.460]
I put him on hold but he hung up because he just want to make a speech and ramble on don't give me this tragic song in a dance pal

[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:33.120]
About how these people don't get a proper education and are locked out of the mainstream et cetera and so on

[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:36.380]
Just

[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:48.060]
Just another convenient excuse to burn and loot and rob and terrorize and abuse and behave like barbarians, okay

[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.920]
So please spare me the pain of

[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.680]
Trying somehow to rationalize totally unacceptable behavior and that's what you try to do

[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:04.860]
You try to make the unacceptable acceptable and it's not gonna wash here, okay? So save your breath

[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:10.820]
Pembroke pines hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah, instead of the gateway to south America

[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:16.240]
It's got to be called the bay route of the western world. That's pretty close. It's we're getting there

[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:22.040]
It's exactly the way it started in bay route Lebanon had the same problem was a beautiful community

[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.400]
it was warm in the wintertime and

[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.260]
Had money everything was there and all of a sudden

[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.480]
Tragedy struck because of this kind of mentality

[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.420]
And if we don't learn from history, we in trouble

[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:43.340]
Well, we're not learning from history. So you're not learning a damn thing this this episode keeps repeating itself in this community every couple of years over and over and over again

[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.020]
We're not learning a damn thing from history

[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.800]
Now how do you feel about the media on this? They they playing it the right way

[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.800]
What what way do you want it?

[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.840]
Well, it's in to be editorializing a lot

[01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:02.340]
You know what in what respect what do you want them to say? Well, I like the the gentleman that you just had on a couple before who

[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:10.320]
Not educated can't get you that's a lot of nonsense. He well, he what does that have to do with the media? I don't know that they don't play it the same way

[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:16.200]
Well, I mean the herald as I said before the herald has this pathetic page 13 today where they

[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.960]
You know promises to the public have it all been kept strides were made

[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.720]
But you need a magnifying glass to see them and they talk about all the problems that exist

[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.060]
I understand that but that isn't any great revelation. We know about those things

[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:31.680]
But what is that got to do with with what the kind of behavior that's been going on

[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:37.260]
But when they when they say those things they dilute the problem they they say

[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:44.820]
They give me the idea well, maybe they are uneducated. Maybe they they have to do this. That's that sense

[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.720]
They don't have to do these things. You're right. They should have a more

[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.240]
It's not a question of they don't have to they must not this is not acceptable

[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:59.600]
And that's one of the problems in this permissive society that we live in where we stand back and we just let people go crazy

[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.820]
And we say well, you know, there must be some reason for it. It isn't acceptable

[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:07.160]
And people who want to do these things have got to be locked up and got to be kept away

[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.400]
And if they want to continue doing them then let's let's open up the chrome detention center or find someplace in the Everglades

[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.540]
And put the barbarians out there in wire

[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.540]
You know and keep them away from people who want to behave like human beings

[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:22.100]
Now they're the head way to go. Okay. I appreciate your call and and any more of you that you know

[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.500]
I'm willing to listen to all reasonable opinions and have exchanges with people who want to discuss

[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:34.120]
But if you think you're going to go in here and try to somehow rationalize this behavior and make apologies and excuses for it

[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:40.360]
And give me a big cry in song and a dance about these poor poor people these poor kids who just you know

[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.420]
Have been locked out from society and don't have a decent education

[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.500]
They got the same education as their neighbors do, okay?

[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.280]
And I'm not saying that all of our schools at schools in black neighborhoods are

[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.340]
As same as schools in choral gables or choral springs because that wouldn't be true. It would be a lie

[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.360]
But Rome wasn't built in a day. Okay, and it isn't going to happen overnight

[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.820]
In addition to which a lot of the teachers who are teaching in those schools

[01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:08.640]
Haven't got any more business being in a school even being janitors in those schools. Okay

[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.240]
Some of them are downright illiterate

[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.240]
In our perpetuating the stereotypes

[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.620]
But when people don't have any priority on getting an education

[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:24.240]
You know, there's an old cliche it. I hate cliches, but there's one. It's very true

[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.040]
You get out of something whatever you want to put into it

[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.300]
Mm-hmm

[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:35.040]
And if you don't want to put any effort into getting an education and into learning some kind of a trait or making yourself some kind of a useful human being

[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.780]
Then you're certainly not going to get anything out of it because nobody is going to hand it to you baby

[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.780]
Nobody is going to hand it to you

[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:47.580]
The old chip on a shoulder routine man, you know chip on one shoulder and a ghetto blaster on together

[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.940]
That doesn't solve the problem that doesn't do it

[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:57.600]
It's 12 minutes past noon at WIOD if you put any way life goes on it's 1214 at WIOD the near Rogers show and

[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.600]
Steve will be along it too with the panel of local individuals are going to discuss the ongoing

[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:02.920]
Saga

[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.320]
I don't have a crystal ball so I'm not going to make any predictions. I did not do it yesterday although quite frankly

[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.440]
I was shocked yeah that it did break out again. Yeah, especially at the such a degree. I guess I must be very naive

[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.200]
But I thought that the police presence and the increased presence

[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.500]
Would be such that it would preclude it

[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.260]
But unfortunately it wasn't because the local politicians. I think their main consideration was well

[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:29.600]
We got the Super Bowl. We got all the worldwide media here. Let's not call him the national guard

[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.680]
And let's not you know

[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.700]
Let's just hope the school of wishful thinking and it didn't work out

[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.020]
So what is going to be the posture tonight?

[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.760]
Yeah, that's a good question

[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.640]
Because you would think you say somebody made a real good point

[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.440]
I don't I don't recall who who said this on the air, but somebody made an excellent point and you can be furious

[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:56.620]
Immediately after a tragic episode like the shooting of this kind of motorcycle takes place you can be furious about that

[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.940]
But then 24 28 hours later

[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.380]
To suggest that you're still furious

[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:08.000]
I'm sorry. I just don't buy that. I mean if you're one of the relatives if you're one of the immediate family

[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.680]
Handful or friends maybe you have a dozen a dozen 20 people

[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:14.340]
I can understand that but the idea that there are hundreds of these people

[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:20.320]
Most of them probably didn't even know this person who are furious to the point where they're going out and burning and just not a control

[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.740]
A day later. I don't buy it. So if what happens two days later

[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:28.660]
People will buy it even less. Yeah has nothing to do with it

[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.100]
Maybe it happens again. Maybe the National Guard could be part of the big halftime show at the Super Bowl on Sunday

[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.600]
Well, you make a joke

[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:39.560]
But let's hope that they don't have

[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.520]
Okay 1216 to W.I.O.D. and let me just make this comment in general not to anybody in particular

[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.220]
But just in general if there any other people in this community

[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:57.120]
Who can't handle reality you can't handle the truth then you know go back and stick your head in the sand like an ostrich and don't

[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.400]
Don't bother me. Okay. Just go away

[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:08.320]
Because if you think after 13 long tedious years in this community of having lived through all of this

[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.560]
Through the 80 riots and a Mary L. Boatlift and the 82 riots

[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:18.760]
And all of the other insanity that has gone on here the 84 riots

[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.060]
The drug crisis then is never ending ongoing situation

[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.580]
The political turmoil all of the ethnic insanity

[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.820]
I mean we've got to start being people and stopping ethnic entities

[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:37.720]
Just like the reminds me when Johnny Jones got caught with this hand in the gold the faucet

[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.180]
You remember that sure and right away all these people running our oh gee. It's a racist thing. He's black

[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:49.400]
Oh, I mean he was caught with a good baby. I mean he was just he he betrayed his own people. He did a number

[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:54.540]
On the whole community, but especially on the black community. He did a notorious number

[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:01.160]
Just like the thing with the beating of Mercado, you know the Hispanic police officers associations out there

[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:07.460]
You know, it's what difference does it make what his ethnic background is don't we have a system of justice in this country

[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:14.180]
Let's go back to the calls Miami. Hello. Yes. No. Yeah. Yes. Um, I stayed far from Liberty City

[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:18.580]
It's being a black man. You know, it really hurts you to see what they don't have neighborhood

[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:21.540]
Got innocent people in there. You know, it's hard

[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.180]
You know to do things and number one

[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.160]
Hey, I'm looking on TV the other night

[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.640]
This lady was calling. They got my husband either he was out there in the loon, you know, whatever

[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.240]
Why can't they keep him home? They can't they go on the street at night. They loon and loons who's they get arrested

[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:43.880]
They run down the street yelling all my baby baby baby. They're gonna go yeah, that really hurts me. Yeah, I can't understand

[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:44.440]
why

[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:52.240]
You know, that just cares no part. I can't you know first of all or the family structure is virtually non-existent in many of these communities

[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.400]
And that's another whole area which I touched on yesterday

[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.720]
But we could go into daily spend a whole rest of the program. I'm not gonna do it

[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.280]
But all of these 14 and 15 year old girls who are having welfare babies

[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:10.680]
That's another whole deal, you know, and then the problem is where you got you know 15 and 16 year old kids who are six foot two and six foot three

[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:14.520]
And you got a mother who's five foot two and weighs 95 pounds

[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.340]
And there's no father figure and you really think that she's gonna be able to discipline those kids

[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.000]
Lack of control

[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:35.680]
DMC concerts they can go there. Why can't they organize itself? Oh whoever these black community leaders are and organize something go down to the city hall

[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:44.000]
Exactly why don't we have why don't we have thousands of people demonstrating with placards and chanting and marching and doing the kind of thing that Martin Luther King

[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:49.300]
Advocated and participated in I mean why aren't they doing that? I mean that got results

[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.020]
They've got the attention of the media that got to the attention of the government including the federal government

[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:58.800]
Why aren't they doing that? You know, I'm tired of hearing people keep saying well, we're not a part of the system

[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.940]
You can only be a part of the system if you inject yourself into it

[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:08.540]
You want to keep operating on the periphery of reality then you're always gonna be on the outside. You're never gonna be on the inside

[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:14.480]
That's right. You just gotta get organized because when you're minding go there take some time free just organize it and go there

[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.400]
You vote these people and they come to you can really vote for me

[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.520]
You vote them man

[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.380]
Big on your sit back and you respect them and do everything

[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:26.480]
Why don't we just get off our behind and go there and take care of all problems

[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.640]
Still riding shooting and all this unnecessary stuff. Okay. Appreciate hearing from you

[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:36.460]
20 minutes past noon at WIOD. There's an open line in date 751

[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.760]
9463 Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes

[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.440]
Yes, ma'am

[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.380]
Yes, I am I just wonder you need a statement about

[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.880]
People in Liberty City and

[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:54.140]
Over time not listening to WIOD

[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.520]
Well, I'm sure there are some but I think the majority are probably listening if they are listening to a radio

[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.780]
I would think the majority are listening WEDR

[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:06.280]
At least that's what Mayor Suarez taught yesterday because he went over to the station and the went on the year to make an appeal to them

[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.220]
I just wanted because I needed to clarify that because I was wondering if it was a comment

[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:13.980]
Regarding you know

[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:18.240]
You were sort of hitting on the intelligence of the people in the room. No not at all

[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.820]
It's just that you know in Detroit. It was the same way there are two or three stations in Detroit that are black oriented

[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:29.280]
That the black human just like we have the stations that Hispanics listen to primarily in this community

[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.600]
It's not a knock it just a fact. Oh, I really just wondered because you know

[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.500]
I would have taken a thing to that

[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.380]
So I just wanted you to clarify that well

[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.060]
I was not intended to be offensive. It was just an admission of truth. I mean, I would you know

[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:42.540]
I'd like to

[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.640]
Delude myself into believing that everybody in the world is sitting glued to this show right now

[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:51.520]
But I know that that's not true. Oh, okay. Okay. I thought I needed thank you

[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.260]
21 past noon at WIOD we have an open line in Broward at 524

[01:13:57.660 --> 01:13:58.920]
9463 Miami. Hello

[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:03.760]
Neil. Yeah, how you doing today? Okay. I'm 100% behind you brother

[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:11.900]
You're not gonna believe this I went over to 62nd Avenue around 22nd Street to a company. I represent

[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:17.700]
For selling furniture on the streets man. Yeah, I could yeah

[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:21.580]
I couldn't believe it. I saw chairs and it was a sofa out on the street

[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.420]
I got a couch over there for something like $75

[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.040]
Yeah, and it's got a cut. It's brand new man. It's had to come out of that furniture store about three street over

[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.960]
Yeah, so somebody called the cops. I don't know if they're gonna go over there

[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.680]
I'm better than a flea market man. Just going over. They got some fantastic bargains for you

[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.760]
They may not live to you know take it home, but the hell of a deal

[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:51.300]
No, it's it's a shame. I got a lot of friends. Oh, I didn't I was gonna tell you this earlier now forget about the guy who delivered the meat

[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.600]
That got beat up pretty bad. Yeah, he got a broken jaw and everything

[01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:01.120]
He said that he pulled up their man and it was about four o'clock in the afternoon and he kept telling the people you know

[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.100]
I didn't do nothing to you. They just kept beating on him man

[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:10.040]
They stole his truck his meat and everything yeah, and now and I'm sure he's really a big part of the problem

[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.080]
He has a lot to do with all the grievances that these people have got no

[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:21.020]
What what the whole bad thing is now the most people over there because I got a guy to work when he's black

[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.740]
A lot of the more people can't drive so they will go over to that market to buy their food

[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:30.120]
The guy who owns a company called him and said you can eat dirt before we deliver over there anymore

[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.640]
Yeah, they're not delivered and now they now they shut themselves down

[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.140]
It's well

[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:41.960]
That's why all these people who want to call and try to sure coat this or make excuses or explanations and by doing so encourage your repetition of it

[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.280]
They're really doing themselves a grotesque disservice because these animals are destroying their own community

[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.620]
And if people want to live in those kind of conditions well more power to them

[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.680]
But I don't think that most of those people do I really I can't believe it

[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.060]
I don't I didn't like channel seven because

[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:59.000]
Channel seven was more or less playing it down last night

[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.720]
I don't you know, maybe I just caught a spot more than we were saying

[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.480]
They may have been playing it let me say this to you

[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.360]
They may have been playing it down

[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.420]
But they were sure given it a hell of a lot more coverage you're giving out a lot more information than all the other local

[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.460]
Channel put together

[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:11.060]
Well

[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:12.940]
Well behind you man

[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:16.240]
I don't know I don't know how you could be behind anybody on this though because

[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.880]
There's nothing we can do man

[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:26.180]
Well the only thing we can do is try to restore some sanity and deal with the problems instead of sweeping them under the carpet and get the rotten police out of the police force

[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:30.520]
And and clean that mess up that we got over there instead of just paying a lip service until the next election

[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.400]
Yeah, all right, brother. Okay

[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.760]
24 past noon at WIOD there's an open line in date at 7519463

[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.860]
Interesting. I hear some little sound effects from around a building like I heard about ten minutes ago

[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:47.480]
You know people who were um either mocking or whatever they're doing what I'm doing on a year here today

[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.720]
And that's fine. You can continue being mindless morons all your lives. That's fine. No problem

[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.820]
Or we can bring back um, you know the the board off they used to do this show on midday. That's okay too. All right

[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:02.480]
Now I'm not I'm not doing this to be dramatic here yesterday and today

[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.360]
I'm doing it because like I'm I'm a sick to my stomach

[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.580]
I'm sitting there at the racetrack last night

[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:11.340]
I'm turning on the TV and watching all of this and seven did do a really incredibly good

[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:13.600]
And I'm sick to my stomach

[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.780]
Now those of you that are too stupid to have any feeling about the kind of community you live in

[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.740]
Or care about the repercussions of what this is going to do to this town for years to come

[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:28.220]
Hey, just stick your head back in the sand man and be professional morons all your lives

[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:36.860]
It's 25 past noon. It's 1228 at WIOD and our next call is in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes. All right good

[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.540]
I just want to make a few comments

[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:47.180]
I was a place officer and day county from in the 60s and 70s metro. Yes, sir

[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.800]
and I recall in 68

[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.140]
We were

[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.340]
60 second straight in 17th Avenue

[01:17:55.020 --> 01:18:01.240]
We couldn't move into the city limits at the time because of a problem with jurisdiction and once the governor

[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:08.320]
Decided to allow metro in there. Miami didn't need the assistance. We moved in and mostly we were going from

[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:14.880]
Storefront just to a front end talking with the citizens there more or less to try to just keep peace. Yep

[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.920]
I can't help but forget I remember that the people

[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:26.420]
kept saying they were all saying the same thing that they didn't want to rise that they you know they were for us

[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.000]
They were they were behind us. They

[01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:34.860]
Would do anything they could they we fed up a line when they could call and they could give us tips on problems that were

[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:40.480]
About to start or yeah, the rumors that they had heard and so forth and

[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:45.160]
You know it goes back to the I think the point that you made several times today

[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:51.660]
It's not just it's not the people that live there. It's not the the majority of the people there. It's just it's the same

[01:18:52.940 --> 01:19:02.420]
percentage or the same minority of people that live there in the 60s that are there now in the 80s and probably into the 90s that are causing these problems

[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:10.060]
Uh the 1970s and 1970 with the the problem with the the rotten meat there to the pick and pay

[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.240]
We were out there for like 12 hours and

[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:19.160]
The Ryan started with with the rocks and the bottles coming from the teenagers not from the people that were

[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.340]
Yeah, having the actual problems behind the meat and being overcharged for the for the checks and so forth

[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:28.300]
It wasn't the law abouting citizens there. It was it was the thugs and the punks

[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.160]
I don't know what the answer is

[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.360]
It just seems to me that it's more of a of a rehearsed

[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:34.860]
learned

[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.020]
criminal

[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.720]
activity yeah

[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:42.520]
Yeah, yeah, it's always there just waiting to happen waiting for an excuse to turn it loose

[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.360]
And as soon as we have a convening excuse so here it goes again exactly always there

[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.160]
It's always simmering underneath and it's you know until

[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:56.860]
These people are it's made very clear to them that it's socially unacceptable and the most stringent measures are going to be taken

[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:02.880]
It's going to keep repeating itself over and over again. Well, I believe that the people understand that I believe it's just it's that small minority

[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.840]
That uh now you know you can look at the 80s right?

[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.880]
The ones in 1981 there were 18 people killed on that I think that's a different situation

[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.900]
You had people that were yeah, but it's a matter it's a matter of degree

[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:20.440]
It's a matter of degree. I mean thank God. We're not having that happen again people are getting dragged out of their cars and having their brains

[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.980]
Gouged out but it's just a matter of degree

[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:29.220]
You're not right not having their tongues get out. They're not having all selects laid down intersections and cars going sideways through it. I agree with you

[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.040]
uh

[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.680]
The thing that happened in overtown

[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:35.800]
Uh, you can't say it was a nice lady to do something

[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:36.820]
uh

[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.560]
What happened what the police officer did from what I've read?

[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.780]
I you know it's it's unfortunate, but it's it happened. It is going to continue to happen

[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:51.780]
Uh, what do you mean it's going to continue to happen? Why is it have to continue to happen?

[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.440]
Well

[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.780]
There's been corruption in law enforcement and they can't talk about corruption. We're talking about trigger happy con

[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:05.140]
Why do we have to have people killing killing folks who are committing traffic violations? You were talking about corruption before I'm just I'm just

[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:05.620]
Just

[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.800]
agreeing with you and that that respect uh

[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.380]
There's always been trigger happy cops in day kind. There's trigger happy cops in every state in this country

[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:18.440]
I don't know what the answer is. I feel like that day county has the

[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.000]
One of the if not to find is a police academy or training facility in the country

[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.360]
I don't know if there's any answer to how you can uh

[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:31.260]
predict what a person is going to do in that situation

[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.660]
I'm a Vietnam vet. I'm a next police officer

[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.020]
Uh, I must say that there were times when I was afraid on the streets. I think that's only normal

[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:47.420]
Uh, I feel like that a lot more can be done in the police academies and the training facilities days to to look for that

[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:48.800]
For that particular uh

[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.560]
weakness in a person whether or not he is gonna react

[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.520]
The wrong way under a stressful situation

[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.920]
But I don't know what the answer is for that. No, I don't I don't have any of the answers for any of it

[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.320]
But one of the things that's got to happen first is that this is all gonna stop. Okay

[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.880]
Got to stop and it can't be permitted to happen again

[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:16.760]
And if they have to send an every police unit from every uh from every municipality in date county and the national guard

[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.940]
That's what it takes to make sure it doesn't happen again, and they're gonna have to do it

[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:26.140]
You know because the media is our you know, we're already all over the world with this so so no matter what happens from here on in

[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:27.740]
It really can't have much more

[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.700]
I am still that's not a search party out from air park and see if we can fight him somewhere

[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.880]
I might suggest you would be done at the port would be a good idea port of Miami

[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:40.260]
They're christened a lot of ships and things like that and he's excellent at breaking those bottles

[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.700]
You know the champagne over the uh holo the ship

[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.280]
Okay, we have an ex-so police officer on seven hello

[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.620]
No, it's Neil sir

[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:56.680]
Neil yeah, how you doing? Okay, I just want to know if you heard the what the chief said last night in reference to like letting the people

[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.900]
First night a little bit around wait a minute. I can't know you could understand you in the beginning

[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:04.880]
But now it's your phone is muffled or your hand is over it or something what yeah

[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:11.340]
What with the chief said last night like letting the people run around the first day three and stuff that you get that

[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.760]
Let them run around and do what?

[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:18.140]
Uh, I just let them run around the first night because it was like a special occasion

[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.880]
Yeah, yeah, I did say I didn't hear him say because of

[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.280]
Well, I think obviously it was wrong

[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.940]
I think they should have gone in there immediately as soon as there were signs that we were gonna have a

[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.960]
Sirius disturbance and they should have used all of manpower

[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.760]
They should have done everything in their power to stop it because you know once you stand back and you watch it

[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:38.740]
It escalates absolutely. I really got still taked off. I told my wife thank god. I'm not in there

[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.760]
You bet, okay? I just want to let you know that um if

[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.500]
They would have done what you just said

[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.740]
Go in there the first night and really clean house, you know just go in there and

[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.420]
Arrest the people that we're doing. It's a very dangerous job

[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:59.940]
But somebody's got to do it. I appreciate the guys there out there now because I do know the feeling and

[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:04.900]
Got blessed them on. I agree with you. You know, I have my problems with a lot of police officers

[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:11.720]
But in this particular case you're right died and most of us who have any sanity wouldn't want to change places with what they have to go through

[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:19.000]
You're right. See you later. Okay, 1246 at WIOD. We have an open line in Boka 278 946 3 278

[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:23.540]
WIOD opalaka. Hello. Yes, uh, I'm

[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:27.560]
First of all, I would like to tell you that I think you're in rare form today

[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.220]
Uh, I think this is your excellent in what you're doing today

[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:35.480]
Well, because I'm fed up. I had enough of this. Okay. I've had enough of living in a Neanderthal place

[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.660]
Where we continue being made the laughing stock of the world over and over again

[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:44.060]
You know, I was kid during that one commercial or number one and auto theft or number one and veneerial disease

[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.900]
We're number one in drugs. Anything that's negative, man. We're number one in it. Yeah

[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:53.320]
I just like to say first. So I was born here 28 years ago. I'm in Miami Beach

[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:57.460]
Uh, I but many years. I've spent also in New York and Brooklyn

[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.300]
um, North of ox two

[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:06.460]
um, I could tell you that where we live we're integrated with a lot of black people and

[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:11.400]
Two things first of all what like you said before I agree with you 100 percent whatever happens

[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.220]
There's no call for doing what they're doing

[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:16.860]
Looting their own houses and burning their own big places of business and so on

[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:22.920]
I just I just failed to understand that instead of doing like we like you said before marching thousands of people towards

[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.780]
A courthouse or towards a municipal building or whatever it may be

[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:33.480]
Peacefully that would I think attract a lot more media than what they're doing now in a more positive manner than what they're doing right now

[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.020]
But the timing would have been so perfect. I mean I'm Martin Luther King birthday

[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:40.520]
A peaceful protest and say hey listen. That's what he did

[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.020]
We're gonna do the same thing and we're sick and tired of this

[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:45.460]
We're not gonna tolerate police brutality and excess anymore

[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:52.520]
We're gonna you know, we're gonna be out there and get the media and the cameras going and not bring disgrace on the whole area in destroy our own community

[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:58.840]
The second thing that I just wanted to point out is that I know in Brooklyn where we live where we're integrated with a lot of white people

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:05.080]
And we have we have our share of problems obviously, but generally we we always there's a lot of people

[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:09.480]
Between the Orthodox Jews there and the blacks who constantly aren't

[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.300]
Communication with each other. We always iron things out and in more or less in a peaceful manner

[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.020]
There are some small problems sometimes

[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:21.580]
But not nearly anything what happens over here and they have I know the blacks there in a lot of the Jews

[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:25.640]
They're complained of a lot of problems with police brutality and a lot of problems with racial

[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.740]
Lot of racial problems and yet we don't have anywhere near over there in New York, Brooklyn

[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.420]
Which goes on over here like what goes on over there

[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:38.960]
What goes on I mean you just there's no comparison whatsoever and I and there's a lot more blacks over there

[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.720]
And they have a lot more problems over there

[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.960]
I think and yet we generally live together and a lot of them are working and they're doing what they have to do

[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:50.060]
And I think they're making a life a life for themselves over there on the other hand over here

[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.000]
I don't see that my can understand why they can't do the same thing over here

[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:54.800]
I

[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.000]
Don't have an answer for you sir. I have no answers

[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.200]
All right, I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you 1240

[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:06.580]
Now here's Neil Rogers on news talk radio 610 w. I. O. D

[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:09.800]
Depend on it. You know what I mean? Oh anyway, it's a 105

[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:16.240]
At w. I. O. D. We're back for our fourth and final hour. We'll say this going by very quickly here today and

[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:22.980]
It was interesting and hearing that story that we just had on the news about the comment that the third night is

[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:27.220]
Usually the quiet how about that I didn't know that let's hope that that's true

[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:29.980]
Yeah, I don't I don't know that there's any such

[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.080]
predictable pattern that that necessarily is true, but let's hope that's right. Mm-hmm. Anyway, let's go back to your calls

[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.140]
We'll go to West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey Neil Glenn. Yeah

[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:45.920]
You know, I was born and raised in West Palm in 28

[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:51.420]
And generally I spent a lot of time. I mean do part of my business down there

[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:54.620]
And you know, I really like the town. It's a good town. Mm-hmm

[01:27:55.260 --> 01:28:00.180]
And I guess about few months ago my wife she was always really scared to go down there

[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.200]
And I took her down there. We stayed at the main fairhouse and we went out to Halea

[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.700]
One Saturday afternoon to to the horse races and

[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.760]
Yes, I saw sight of Miami that a lot of people don't get to see

[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:18.740]
And all they hear about is like what's going on now and it's really just a damn shame

[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.200]
Yeah, it really is

[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:26.680]
You know, I was sitting here. I'm working at home today. I was sitting here thinking this is

[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:32.420]
Really a good time for some people to learn favor the casinos

[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:36.980]
To start pushing that again because that might be our only saving grace down here

[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:42.020]
Sir, let me say this to you. Your intentions are great, but you're very naive, okay

[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:48.520]
Casino gambling if we live to be 200 you will never see casino gambling in this community, okay?

[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.540]
It makes too much sense

[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:55.780]
Yeah, also might bring some crime to the area. Yeah, we certainly don't have we don't want to do that

[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:02.220]
No, I might God forbid bring some tourists and some big bucks to this area and we and some conventions and

[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:06.900]
Create thousands and thousands of jobs many of which would be for some of the very same people

[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:10.620]
We're saying that they can't find any jobs and we certainly don't want to do that

[01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.520]
Yeah, it's just a damn shame

[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.620]
What you see you know you you sit here and you look around even just within the state

[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:22.240]
And you see a place like Orlando which used to be just a cow pasture and a bunch of orange grows

[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.840]
And you see the incredible job that they're doing up there and growing and now they're you know

[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:29.140]
The Hollywood thing is coming in there last time I was up there

[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:35.920]
They got these big billboards about Hollywood too and the movie industry is coming in big time to the Orlando area and Disney's constantly expanding

[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:42.840]
And it's just a miracle what they've done up there and of course they tell us got all the college kids now and doing a tremendous job

[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:49.640]
And we continue sitting here languishing and continue repeating the same self-destructive behavior over and over again

[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:52.420]
While the politicians tell us that everything's just wonderful

[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:55.620]
Yeah, I guess it all comes down to just the leadership that we have down here

[01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.920]
Yeah, you can't complain about the leadership because there isn't any right?

[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:00.560]
Okay, you have a good one

[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.960]
What a way to WIOD and Open Line in Palm Beach

[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.120]
655-9463-655-WIOD

[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:12.000]
I don't really remember I don't you the show we did yesterday was it

[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:18.080]
I guess it was very much like this, but not as heavy I guess but I I haven't done a show like this in so long

[01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:24.160]
This is what you were doing when I when I fell out I did it for years and I really don't enjoy it

[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:30.100]
I really don't I mean I feel compelled to do it because we can't see anyone make jokes today and play a lot of stupid songs

[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:36.620]
But I don't enjoy it because it's such a tremendous drain on your energy and you realize that hey

[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:38.000]
These are the same people

[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.940]
Buy in large YouTube and talk to for the last 13 years and if they didn't care 13 years ago or five years ago

[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.420]
They're not going to care now

[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.820]
And it's the same old hack politician, you know Steve Clark

[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:53.460]
He was the metro mayor when I first came here 13 years ago and he still some more now

[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.340]
We don't know where the hell he's hiding but some more now

[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:02.260]
And you know a lot of these same old tired hacks doing nothing and the same it's just like repeating a bad

[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:06.820]
Experience over and over and over again. Did you finally say I just don't want to do it anymore?

[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:14.480]
Anyway moving along I can't envision that we're going to do this again tomorrow already. I hope not oh god. I hope not

[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:20.400]
I hope you have a good time because I may call in sick. Yeah, uh homestead. Hello

[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.880]
Yeah, Neil. I hope you don't do it tomorrow either. I get more enjoyment

[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:30.580]
Laughing all day. Yeah. Well, it just not yeah, I just can't do it today. I just not in the mood to laugh to be I can't I'm not in the mood to laugh

[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:35.540]
Now what is that really something? You know when he's not cackling. It's really gotta be that a strong statement or what?

[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.020]
Now Neil you know

[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:43.400]
Down in homestead we got a lot of Latin and black farm workers down here. Yep, and I you know something is

[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:50.300]
Observation I've made is as less educated blacks and the land just cannot give it along

[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:52.800]
And it's it's you know

[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:59.200]
I have friends on both sides and it just doesn't make any sense that why when we had to riot in 80

[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:03.820]
Why there was no farms in Perine or in homestead or in Fort Launardale

[01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:09.320]
I wonder if the Latin cops and these blacks just cannot communicate

[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:14.380]
Well, first of all, you know not all the cops are Latin number one and I don't

[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:24.120]
but but the predominance of the uh, you know, the commissioners and uh the mayor of Miami. Why is this happening only in Miami?

[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.880]
You see what I'm getting at. I mean, it's just an observation. I

[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:35.900]
Well, I think it becomes like a pattern of condition behavior right it's just like like

[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:40.680]
It's just they do not respect each other. Yeah, and a Latin cop

[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.200]
May not this just this is just something I've seen

[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:49.220]
May not be able to talk to to a black bird. Yeah, but you're assuming again that the reason that

[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:53.460]
All of this activity is going on is because of that shooting and I would like to correct you

[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:54.440]
I don't I don't believe that

[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:59.080]
99% of it has anything to do with that of just being used as an excuse

[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:05.700]
No, nothing to do is what happened afterwards is the actual incident itself. Yeah, I don't know

[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:08.820]
I thought that after we had the disturbances in 82 and 84

[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:12.260]
I thought that we were going to have all these black police officers in black communities

[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:17.380]
That was the that's what they told us they sold us a good bill of goods on that and that these were going to be people that

[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:23.560]
You know work the neighborhoods and walk the streets and got to knew the people and had a real good relationship and rapport with the people

[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:28.640]
That was you know the game plan, but I don't think it worked out that way did it. No, I don't think so at all

[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.700]
Well, and it just it's just the coincidence is a large black population here in homestead. Yeah, I'm in prime

[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:42.820]
That the same thing it never happens here that you know, I think in Carroll City and in Opalaka and in parts of Pompano and

[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:47.940]
Brother parts of Broward. It seems like there's better communications. I mean, you know, yeah

[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:55.840]
In Miami, I think that that there's a resentment on both sides and and

[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.340]
The black thing that you know that the mountains don't understand them. They don't want to talk to them

[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:06.500]
They don't want to relate to them and this is you know, I don't I don't condone what they're doing

[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:12.100]
But I think it's a lot of to do with communications. Yeah. Okay. I appreciate hearing from you. All right

[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.300]
12 minutes past one at W. I. O. D. We have an open line in

[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.040]
Dayed 751

[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:22.160]
9463 if you're shopping around for a D. That's the best of Neil on Saturday from tentative

[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:31.060]
Okay, it's 115 at W. I. O. D. and let's go to hypolexo. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yeah, I just wanted to call and and

[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.840]
Say that I do certainly agree with you about the fact that

[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:44.960]
It's certainly a bit of problem there with the the blacks and the police both and when it all gets said and done

[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:50.020]
But I think that just to stop if they do just take a minute to stop and look and

[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:54.820]
And have a look at what they've done at the time take a look and should be a time of inspection

[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.880]
You know for the

[01:34:57.620 --> 01:35:02.320]
Police Department to see you know if they want to keep being a little abusive or

[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:06.980]
Well, no, a little abusive. I think is the understanding of the century where you keep people in the brain

[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.120]
You know, it's very popular. Yes, sir

[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:15.200]
And the black to see if they want to keep snubbing their noses that the rest of the populace

[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.320]
Yeah, but you've got to understand don't say the blacks because it's not the black

[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.260]
And more than it's the police. It's it's it's a group of barbarians and I'm not gonna apologize

[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:30.060]
To either side. Well, no, you know, and in these people if you're asking them to intellectualize the situation

[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:33.360]
Forget it because they're not they don't have the capacity to do it

[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:35.580]
These are people who just are animals

[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:40.140]
It want to behave in this way and they just wait for any episode it comes along like I said to the previous

[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:45.380]
Caught it's like condition behavior and that's why it keeps happening in the same neighborhoods in the same areas again

[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.160]
Because it keeps being permitted to happen and it's got to stop. Yes, sir

[01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:54.500]
I agree that's not in the next time that it starts hopefully there won't be but if it does ever start again

[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:58.820]
Then at that time which hopefully the whole world media won't be here and it won't be super bowl

[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.920]
We can be sure of that because it'll never be here again

[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.380]
You know, they'll call out the National Guard and put every possible

[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:09.300]
You police unit in that area immediately and say hey listen you're gonna mess with us and it's fini

[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:12.220]
We're not gonna tolerate it. This is not acceptable behavior

[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:17.920]
And we're not just gonna drive around while you burn down your neighbor's businesses and churches and buildings

[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.500]
We're just not gonna accept it

[01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:24.860]
Uh, I've been living here in the Boynton Delray area so I can't really you know

[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:28.500]
I can't really get real personal about what goes on down there

[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.400]
But we also have it up here. We have the same

[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:35.880]
Bad areas the same handful of bad people that you constantly see yep

[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:39.340]
Representing just because they're there the

[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:42.140]
uh, the the image of the community and

[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:48.600]
uh, matter of fact right here in Boynton last night and and uh, it didn't go too far in the press this morning

[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.660]
I was at hospital last night and

[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.380]
Fellow was shot by three gun men jumped out of their car over and uh that given bad area and

[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:05.500]
In Boynton Beach three gun men hopped out and and blew this guy away. Yeah, and I don't see the town of Boynton

[01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:12.960]
Uh, going up in arms and tearing it up and and you know because it wasn't a white or Hispanic or a cop

[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:18.740]
You know, but it was it was a another dead black man and and uh, I heard on

[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:26.520]
Uh, your buddy fall Harvey there. I heard on this show quite some time ago and I would assume that it must be somewhat accurate the biggest cause of

[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.640]
death of a lot among

[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:33.800]
young black youth or in the 90 percent

[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:36.780]
Range is young black youth

[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.640]
Killing each other. That's that's correct. Oh, yeah, no question about it

[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:47.940]
It's just you know the fellow that called earlier and he then he wants to get hostile with you the young black youth that called your earlier the show

[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:50.540]
It makes no sense and

[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.480]
Really, you know all we can do is sit back and watch

[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.860]
It sounds really helpless and you know

[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.020]
And all that but you like you said early you can't say much about him

[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.200]
But if they would just look at what

[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:09.020]
When it's all done my point was if they would just introspect if they possibly can on the on

[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.360]
What they've done to their town as opposed to the

[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:16.480]
Sure, again, I'm throwing couches and yeah, I appreciate what you're saying

[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.780]
But again, your approaches to people who are rational if they were rational

[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:21.480]
They wouldn't be doing those things in the first place

[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:27.200]
But uh, you know, man has very good intentions, but I guess it's a little bit naive because uh, you know, a sane

[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.680]
Rational people just don't do those things

[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:33.000]
Well

[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.020]
Um, I was reading uh in the herald

[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:43.640]
reporters that were caught in the uh, um violence and and this one reporter Ivan Romer

[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:47.880]
Talking about uh the crowd. He says they were dancing

[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:54.760]
Celebrating and screaming. Yeah, well you saw the ones who were at 10 o'clock on the you see an end the young people who were

[01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:00.140]
You know, one of them was screaming and they were allegedly outraged and the ones behind were all laughing and joking and yucking it up

[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:04.420]
And it's just uh, hey a lot of fun, man. We're gonna terrorize whitey now dancing and celebrate

[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:12.000]
You know do as much damage as we can and just be as out of control and wild and uh, you know reckless and hysterical and irresponsible and have a good time

[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:18.000]
Man, that's what it's all about. This is fun and it's a lot of crap. Okay. It isn't fun and it's not acceptable and um

[01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:23.000]
I'm telling you man that idea about the chrome detention center sounds real appetizing to me man

[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.700]
All you people want to be barbarians. We'll put you behind wire fences. You can terrorize each other. Okay. You can just have a wonderful time

[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:35.380]
Well, even equipped them with the weapons out there. Okay, and they want to shoot each other more power to them

[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.100]
Just keep them away from the civilized people

[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.080]
Which is the majority of the people who live in Liberty City and overtown

[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.660]
It's 21 past one at WIO. They we have an open line in Palm Beach 655

[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:48.060]
9463

[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:54.100]
Boka hello. Hello. Neil and Glenn. Yes. How are you? Good. I've been listening to you show with a lot of interest

[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:57.040]
Um, I heard one brilliant statement

[01:39:57.860 --> 01:39:58.780]
That there's a

[01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:04.720]
Vacuum of leadership here in the South. Well, I think it's worse than that. I think I don't think it's just a vacuum

[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:08.180]
I think we have terrible leadership very very very polio

[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.740]
And I can touch you many many examples

[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:14.040]
With relation to the riots, I'm like to

[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.980]
Give you a little bit different point of view. I grew up in Europe and

[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:22.940]
In trying to understand both sides of of the issue

[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:24.800]
You really

[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:27.360]
The really are no easy solutions of course

[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:31.820]
But to give you an idea. I have a question for you. Why is it that

[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.040]
Britain in the in the country that the village colonized

[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:40.540]
They took the the trouble or the cause of what have you

[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:45.420]
To educate the blacks to teach them to be

[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:48.440]
Clean

[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.000]
To be to integrate into white society much much better than anyone has done here

[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.280]
Can you ask me that question first? Well, probably because they felt it was in their own best interest

[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:03.580]
They certainly didn't do it out of altruism or benevolence because the British were some of the worst racist and the many of them

[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:04.980]
Still are in history of mankind

[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:11.820]
So I really don't think that they did it because I think it was part of their culture and they felt it was in their own best interests

[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:15.240]
Well, it is in our best interest also in this country

[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:21.400]
But unfortunately we had to go through 200 years of slavery and racism before finally in 1954

[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.060]
We had brown versus the Board of Education and the Supreme Board decided that hey

[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:31.060]
Maybe it was okay that the blacks went to real schools and got a real educate you got to understand so that's only 34 years ago

[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.020]
Right right

[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:34.640]
I don't think that President Reagan's

[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:38.820]
statement on his radio address helped at all when he if he was the black leadership of yeah

[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.760]
Well, we're very fortunate that mr

[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:46.680]
Reagan in there too is going to be leaving us and that this racist state years that we've gone through will be history

[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.540]
Although you know again, I see no relationship between that and what just happened here

[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.020]
But you know, it's one of the worst racist records in history of the country and mr. Bush

[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:57.800]
I'll give him you know the benefit of the doubt. He talks a good game

[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:00.960]
And he claims that you know he's gonna have a much different attitude

[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.700]
But then again, we've heard that before time will tell okay

[01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:08.620]
To try to find a little something positive in this whole incident somebody just took two or three calls

[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:12.780]
Well mentioned in cross-section. I think that's an excellent. This is an excellent opportunity

[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:18.180]
To look at ourselves because we live in a society that is brutal violent

[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:24.600]
People are very bitter hateful. I'm talking about not not in the extremes of of everyone

[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:28.600]
Burning houses on every day. I'm talking about just our every day normal course of

[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:32.080]
Yeah, we're like the shooting in stocked in the other day, you know as I said

[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:38.480]
It's very difficult to try to tell the American people to look in the mirror and see the chinks in their armor because we've been

[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.080]
Conditioned this number one mentality

[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.400]
We're the best and we're the greatest and we're the all this other crap right as a result when you say hey, baby

[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:50.480]
We got a lot of problems here and our attitudes are all screwed up and our behavior is just totally unacceptable

[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.200]
They don't want to hear that right and part of this Reagan era has been to convince people that you can be materialistic and

[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.780]
Screw everybody else and you can be a bigot and it's fashionable to do all those things

[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:07.760]
And so this is hardly the time to expect that the American people are gonna be introspective and look at their values and attitudes and say

[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.760]
Hey, maybe we ought to change and maybe a lot of the things that we thought were important 20 and 30 years ago

[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.420]
We're important and maybe you know how many Gucci

[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:20.880]
Parah under where we got in the closet isn't that important anymore? Okay or shouldn't be exactly

[01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.820]
Okay, thank you very much. Thanks for your call. Thank you

[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:31.160]
124 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line in Boka 278 9463 278 W.I.O.D. and we'll be right back

[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:39.440]
D it's 128 at W.I.O.D. and let's go to Miami. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes, you know, I'm I'm just tired

[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.920]
I really am I've been in this community for 39 years now and I'm just tired of all this stuff that's going on here

[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.300]
You know, this this whole situation goes beyond the shooting

[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:56.280]
It's it's a result of a band-aid fix that they did some years ago that gave this whole community

[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.660]
A shaft

[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.460]
You know, and I want to see a change in this community, you know

[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:04.480]
We need to work with the system and and it's a shame that

[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:07.340]
Less than 5% of the community

[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:14.500]
Uh, can hold it hostage like this, you know, what are we coming to you know if we can if we can I think the word is

[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:20.220]
Yes, you're right if we can't if we if we can't defend ourselves if we can

[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:24.280]
Protect ourselves if a law of issues can protect us from

[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.040]
These little bandits of whatever you want to call them, you know, I think you were too mild with them

[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:30.600]
Animals animals

[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:37.300]
And I'm a black man and I know you know, I don't know why people are getting offended, you know the Bible says so as you think it's so as you

[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:42.920]
And I don't even think I know I'm not animals. It doesn't bother me. That's correct. I don't care what people call me that doesn't bother me

[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:44.760]
Uh, but my concern is

[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:51.180]
We are just just just grazing the surface of this problem and these far-re

[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:53.300]
lazy no good

[01:44:53.980 --> 01:45:00.440]
Politicians that are sitting in there to eye for towels and get a coat of paint and put over a dirty wall

[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.940]
And then when that paint begins to peel off in a dirty wall to shorn again

[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:05.680]
We need to do some about those well

[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:07.620]
You notice we got another blue ribbon panel now

[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:13.300]
Which is the latest what is this the 400th blue ribbon panel that we've had and just like the community relations board

[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:19.260]
And they sit around and try to pseudo-intellectualize all of these problems and to make them very simplistic and pacify

[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:20.980]
Everybody till tensions calm down

[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:26.400]
And then as you say we go back to business as usual now it seems to me that mayor Suarez my memory could be wrong

[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:31.620]
But I think that when he a one election over Raoul Mospadal who was the heralds handpick candidate

[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:38.080]
And they heralded everything and they're powered to try to get him elected and mr. Suarez won in large part because of voting support by the blacks

[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:43.580]
Did he not right and as a result of that he said at the time that he wouldn't forget that and he was gonna be a mayor for all of my

[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.760]
I mean he was gonna do this and that the other thing and

[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:50.820]
Politicians make a lot of those statements at the time of election before and just after and then of course

[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:53.120]
Subsequent to that they don't do very much

[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.280]
That's right. I just hope that that the people in this whole community, you know

[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:05.580]
From Dave Broward wherever can realize that we we all need to take the chips off our shoulders. Yeah, and stop

[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:10.780]
This thing about black white Hispanic Haitian, you know forget about all that garbage

[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:17.060]
You know first of all we're human beings. That's the first thing. Yeah, all black people all white Hispanic Haitians

[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.380]
You know, none of us are going away tomorrow

[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:26.920]
You know, we're gonna be here and and we are gonna have to learn to live together in this community and make it a safe place

[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:28.520]
So that we can raise

[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:32.940]
Some children in this community to try to show them the right way

[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:39.600]
You know politicians need to stop this big act stop the gains their playing is not just a black issue

[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:46.020]
Are some of the people in the white community just want to snub their nose and think that it's just a black issue

[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:51.660]
It is not just a black issue. It's an issue for all of us to take issue. Oh absolutely

[01:46:52.180 --> 01:46:53.800]
I don't care where anybody lives in

[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:56.440]
Data Broward County and maybe even parts of Palm Beach

[01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:00.940]
But especially Dayton Broward this this affects the future of this entire area

[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:07.000]
It affects the economy of this area. I mean I will grant you that if you're a hundred years old and living in a condo

[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.180]
And you got a lot of money in a bank and you're go to see the CD rate every day and that's your big excitement

[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:16.260]
That you can isolate yourself, but for those of us who are living and breathing people and work and live here

[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:19.640]
This has a traumatic effect on the future of this community

[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:22.320]
And if you live in an area and you don't care about it

[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.680]
I mean, what does that say about you as a human being? That's right

[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:28.280]
Well, we're only seeing it on a small scale here in Dayton Broward

[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:35.860]
Well, it's just a small scale and the reason that this town is being highlighted is because of the repeated acts that are taking place here

[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:37.300]
Yeah, so mine is being highlighted

[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:41.060]
But this thing has an effect around the whole nation

[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:47.160]
And you hit the nail on the head when you talked about that old time up there in the white house that should have never gotten there

[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:52.860]
Who has allowed a lot of this stuff people have taken the attitude that I can do whatever I want to do to whoever

[01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:57.200]
Yeah, you know, it doesn't matter as long as my gun is bigger than yours and I got more for it

[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:57.940]
That's it. Yeah

[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:04.540]
Well, you got to understand you know when you were like the president who was impotent mentally and physically that you're gonna have a big gun somewhere

[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:11.420]
You know, so this this phallic thing that he brought into office man is obviously extended all throughout the country and he's really reinforced it

[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:15.780]
Well, I hope that I hope that something is really really learned this time and not just

[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:20.080]
You know abandoned six. I hope something is really learned this time

[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:24.360]
I hope so too. I wouldn't hold my breath because I've lived through it too many times, but I hope you're right

[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.800]
I've seen them all and I hope this this one is different because I'm like you I'm tired of it man

[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.680]
I'm ready to fall down on the floor. I'm so tired. I am I'm sick of it

[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:35.140]
I'm sick of it people, you know, white and black. They can't go in place this community

[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:38.780]
They don't know whether you got to look over your shoulder. Yeah, you don't know who's going to attack you

[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.900]
You don't know whether the police wouldn't mind attack you

[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:44.280]
You don't know that one day you might walk in the shop and send and walk up on a drug deal

[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:48.420]
You don't know what's going on. You can't go. I got a boat and I'm afraid to go too far my boat

[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:54.020]
Yeah, it's no way no way for civilized people to have to live sir. You're absolutely right. Appreciate hearing from you. All right

[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:54.520]
Thank you. Bye

[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:02.420]
134 at W I O D we have an open line in date 7519 463 and part of the uncivilized behavior is auto theft

[01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:08.460]
Which in this a beautiful facility and it's right there in the middle of all of this and in here last night people

[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.480]
Had their cars attack windshield's broken

[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.500]
People were assaulted

[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:20.360]
People had to leave the area people had to turn around and go back couldn't hold the game which would have been a sellout over

[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.420]
15,000 people

[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:25.340]
Because of these maniacs because of these barbarians

[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:28.060]
So what is it that they really want if they really want to prove it in the area

[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:31.140]
And they really care about where they live then they wouldn't be doing these things

[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:35.720]
Well, we also um you made one small mistake when you said that people were not being pulled out of cars

[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.880]
The cbs crew was pulled out of car yesterday and they were all beaten over the head the cameraman suffered

[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:46.460]
Enough that yet to go to the hospital and have some stitches in tans. Yeah, no, you're right

[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.780]
I did in fact we saw that at 10 o'clock on CNN

[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:52.180]
And I would just saying that they weren't pulling them out of cars and murdering them

[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:54.920]
But they were certainly doing their giving it their best shot. Yeah

[01:49:55.380 --> 01:49:58.580]
Well, okay, well have a good afternoon guys. Okay, thanks. See you later

[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:05.080]
Yeah, it's fascinating how the arena became a different kind of simple. Yeah, well sure absolutely right now

[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.180]
You think about it and it symbolizes the

[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.200]
sadness and the desperation

[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:14.600]
Of all the good people who live in those areas and of the people who work very hard to try to create some progress there

[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:19.940]
And you really would hope and believe me for all the knocks about you know the heat and what a bad team

[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.660]
They are I am not one of those gonna jump on the bandwagon and say oh gee, I hope they fail because I don't hope they fail

[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:29.740]
You know, I predicted they would fail because I never believed that this front running town would support a you know

[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.400]
A team that's one of four and lost about 32 or three games

[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.100]
They just couldn't believe that you know a douchebag town like this would do it

[01:50:35.100 --> 01:50:38.200]
But they have tremendously tremendous and the team is gonna get better

[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.340]
It takes expansion teams years to you know get to the point where they're truly always competitive

[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.060]
But it will eventually happen

[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:46.340]
What the question is you know in the problem

[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:51.280]
It let's just hope that this series of episodes isn't gonna start discouraging a lot of people from going there

[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:52.660]
Because if it does

[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.060]
Yeah, it speaks for itself

[01:50:55.620 --> 01:51:02.520]
Miami hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. This Neil. I think so. How are you doing? This is I'm Rudy. I'm from Miami

[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.980]
I got a question. What did the guy in the motorcycle do?

[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:12.320]
Uh to the best of our knowledge other than speeding absolutely nothing and you know

[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:15.740]
I think one of the problems that I should have mentioned a long time ago is the fact that the

[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.820]
Long long delay by the police department and trying to give any explanation of what happened

[01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:26.360]
I mean, maybe they were sitting around trying to concoct some excuse for why this

[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.680]
Outrageous overreaction took place but but even they didn't even do that

[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.800]
You know as you sit and you pour over all the articles and you read the police reports

[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:40.240]
There is absolutely nothing to justify the fact that this guy in a motorcycle was shot in the head

[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:45.900]
Yeah, it could for a shot at all because one story that I heard that he made an arm robbery

[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:48.620]
That's what I was told no

[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:54.700]
So the way I feel is again he was doing an arm robbery he took off. I can't understand it

[01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:59.480]
No, but they don't say what the guy did I was speeding he was going 60 miles an hour

[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:04.780]
He was being uh he had his license suspended. I don't know how many times with a lot of similarities to the McDuffies

[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:09.280]
Situation right yeah, but I think that McDuffie may have been a more savory individual

[01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:13.500]
But nonetheless still you know the idea that it was on a motorcycle he was speeding and there was a you know

[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.600]
Hot pursuit another one of these wild chases

[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:21.820]
But there is no indication and no statement that I know of that he did anything threatening or threatened the life of the officer

[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:22.920]
and again the

[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:28.660]
Very clearly the code of police conduct the city Miami's written out very very clearly their policy

[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:33.220]
That is that the officer cannot shoot at somebody indiscriminately and let he can only shoot

[01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:40.440]
If he's protecting his own life or someone else's in jeopardy, but certainly not just the arbitrarily start shooting at someone

[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:47.360]
Right, because see I got friends that are Miami-Dade cops and call gable cops. Yeah, they're everything else and they tell me yet

[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:53.160]
Some are more tougher than others. Some don't care. Some are big. Yeah, and some are totally irresponsible

[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:58.520]
Right now they want is the bigger gun and that you know and then and when they pull somebody over

[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:02.080]
If it's a black guy, they'll give him a ticket if it's a Latin guy they want

[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:04.440]
You know if they're Latin. Oh no question about it

[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:12.040]
And in fact, I've said that for years that a you know one of the wrong motivations and unfortunately all too frequent for people going into police work is they want to have

[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:17.220]
Their prejudices legitimized by the laws and now they've got the uniform they've got the gun

[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:20.720]
They got the badge and they have the power of the law and now they can terror and again

[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:25.780]
I'm not saying all police but far too many with that redneck mentality where they can terrorize any

[01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:30.260]
Individual who isn't part of a group that they happen alike right that I understand completely

[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:34.220]
I'm Latin myself. Yeah, but I was raised and filled out here in West Virginia

[01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:37.280]
So I don't even speak Spanish very good

[01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:40.840]
But what I've noticed is I've got along with the blacks

[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:46.420]
I've got along with the latins and I don't think the problem down there is with the black people

[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:53.720]
I think it's the kids the young generation. I'm 28 my brother's 17. He's got more jewelry on than I do

[01:53:53.720 --> 01:53:58.260]
And where does he get the money? He steals it. Well, that's great

[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:03.400]
You know, I know he does. I mean he's got gold that's worth a fortune. I work as a mechanic

[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.260]
There's guys young black guys with the Latin guys to come in trying to sell you gold

[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:13.700]
All the time and that's where the problem is soon as something like this happens. They say wow

[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:15.900]
I got a chance to get something for free

[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:22.060]
And they'll go ahead because nobody's gonna stop them. Yeah, and I you see these people on the TV Karen Calcies

[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:24.900]
And all why didn't the cops just go in there and stop it?

[01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:31.000]
You know, I mean it's got to be a little bit of force because they didn't have enough manpower and you know the hair

[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.460]
You got an unruly mob throwing rocks and stones in bottles and unless they were gonna start shooting people

[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:38.880]
Which would have really created just a total nightmare

[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:43.440]
And assured of doing that they just didn't have enough manpower to control it

[01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:45.440]
And that was the mistake that was made right from the beginning

[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:51.940]
You know because I know I you know, I'm 28 so I don't know how the 60s was or anything like that

[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:56.080]
But I I'm not for an eye for an eye all the way but well

[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:58.860]
We're not nobody can nobody can be for vigilante justice

[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:03.440]
It just is not acceptable whether it's done by the public or whether it's carried out by police officers

[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:09.300]
vigilante justice in a civilized society is unacceptable period. It's not a debatable point

[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:15.540]
And I understand it's like my wife works now down in the coconut grove area. Yeah, she's got a drive in a black neighborhood

[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:19.800]
Now somebody let's say something happens a black young guy does something tour

[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:22.280]
Now I'm gonna have a threat against all blacks

[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:27.740]
It's gonna be well all blacks are bad and I don't have that feeling. I know that it's a young

[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:33.840]
Some of the young generation some of it maybe the older generation, but it's not all the blacks

[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:40.220]
You see what I'm saying? Absolutely. It's it's you know, they're like you got some of the latins

[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:43.080]
I won't deal with some of the latins because they're just pigs

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:48.880]
You know like some of these refugees that came over they got more stuff and gold on them

[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:56.100]
Than anything in this world. I mean, maybe yesterday my friend people are people and this this obsession that we have and especially in this community

[01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:00.320]
Where did they just hung up on what your ethnic background is or your races?

[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.640]
Difference you're you are either a decent person or you're not a decent person period

[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.200]
You know that regardless of what any of those other synthetic things are that you have no control over

[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.860]
You know, I work hard for my money. I work. I'm right now at lunchtime

[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.240]
And this is the first time I ever made a phone call over a radio

[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.820]
Yeah, and I've got a boat. I've got a house. I got my two cars

[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.600]
You know, and I'm happy. I'm having a kid on the way

[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:30.740]
But you know, it's just if the kids would just get out there and work. I have them don't even go to school

[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:34.980]
I mean, you know, I see it in my own brothers and sisters because I've got two

[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:39.780]
younger brothers. They're always in fights. They're always worried about the

[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:44.680]
New jeans have come out and when I was young I never cared about that

[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:47.700]
No, I remember a few years ago. There was a big thing about the

[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:54.960]
the conditions in overtown Liberty City and some of the neighborhoods where there are rats and there's garbage all over

[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.120]
And I said on the air at the time and I still haven't had an answer to the question

[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:02.560]
We got all these kids who can't find jobs. We have a lot of idle time on their hands

[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:07.240]
Now I just can't imagine I bet there'll be a lot of people would be willing to volunteer

[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:12.300]
garbage bags, you know, big hefty trash sacks certainly aren't that expensive like a couple of bucks a box

[01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:17.280]
And if you have any pride in the environment that you're living in I mean no matter how humble it is

[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.680]
If you got any pride as a human being

[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:23.280]
Why wouldn't they be better off spending their time, you know, cleaning up all that garbage?

[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:27.100]
And of course once there's no garbage there are no rats right and

[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:34.540]
You know making themselves a livable environment as opposed to you know selling crack on street corners and throwing stones and rocks and bottles and

[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:36.340]
Raging people out of cars and beating them up

[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:39.580]
And I never got an answer to the question now. I still don't understand you know

[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:42.580]
There's a good commercial on I don't know if you've seen it

[01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:46.020]
It's about it's where these young guys I'm not sure if it's a

[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:52.580]
Drinking commercial whatever, you know Coca-Cola one of those types where they show a park and a

[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:59.140]
In a downtown like area where it's all destroyed and then everybody in the community got together and fixed it up

[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:04.520]
Yeah, you know, and that's what the people need to do, you know, you have to not just think yourself

[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:07.880]
Self self all the time, but give a help and answer well

[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.360]
Well, you know again repeat. I don't want to get redundant here repeat the whole show from yesterday

[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.480]
But a lot of attitudes within the black community are gonna have to change too

[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.340]
You in still values in the home and of course where there is no family unit. There is no real home

[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:24.840]
It's almost impossible. That's why we have a lot of these problems. Right. I come from two divorcey

[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.800]
My parents have been divorced my mom has been divorced two times

[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:33.940]
I've come from Cuba. I was born in Cuba and of course I lived in Philadelphia

[01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:38.340]
We didn't have anything I lived in a in a black neighborhood very close to me and

[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:43.300]
Whites here and everything was you know, it was like those apartments all

[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:44.900]
all the wall

[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:51.940]
type of things and we all got along. Yeah, we got broken in and they stole the TV that we got out of a junkyard

[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:53.540]
Because that's all we could afford

[01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.200]
But everybody helped

[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.880]
You know everybody in that community if I needed a couple of sugar

[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:03.800]
I know I could go next door and ask for a couple of sugar if I needed a you know something

[01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:06.120]
Happened to me they would come and help you

[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:10.420]
You know here you don't see it. I don't even know who my neighbors are in this. Yeah in this area

[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:15.980]
Yeah, okay. Well listen, I appreciate talking to you make a lot of sense to me and the things you say but you know again

[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:20.960]
You're not dealing with rational people well. They got to get tougher on them. Okay. Thanks. Thank you

[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:29.000]
151 at W I O D 155 at W I O D. We got a mobile on a Palm Beach line. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing?

[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:29.440]
Okay

[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:35.460]
You've there's a lot of good things being said here and a bit of information that I wanted to pass along to you and

[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:40.560]
Everybody there the newsroom I left a golf course about 45 minutes ago on West Palm Beach

[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:45.080]
right just north of Okachoby Road in West Palm. Yeah, and

[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.400]
we in fact saw

[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:51.620]
three extremely large helicopters flying low

[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:55.320]
Definitely military helicopters dark dark green

[01:59:55.780 --> 02:00:02.400]
They were headed south and then about another 10 minutes after that another one flew and they're flying about 500 feet off the ground

[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.640]
But they're a little to the west of us and

[02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:12.040]
Could not get well, let me ask you this why would military helicopters be coming here? Well, I would think that would be national guard

[02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:13.820]
They were definitely dark green anyway

[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:21.340]
Where they were coming from that I don't know I would assume I don't know where a large installation is presumably

[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:24.320]
Jacksonville or land though. I don't really know

[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:27.520]
But I would assume that they were definitely

[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:29.440]
some sort of

[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:32.740]
Three-in-a-fleet like that and these were the extremely large ones

[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:35.540]
A lot larger when you remember back to the time when

[02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:40.920]
Nixon was living down there and keep his game when I was living down there myself too at the time for about nine years

[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:47.960]
I hope it is that and I honestly do believe it is how to go about checking on it. I'm not really sure

[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.140]
But my I guess my question now is the integrity of our good old

[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:59.300]
Commission commissioners there in Miami and what in God's name took them so long to

[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:03.000]
Finally throw up the flarence. They hey. We need to do something

[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:10.420]
You know, I've got a lot of skepticism from over the northeast where I'm originally from and

[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.300]
You know people this could have been and should have been nipped in the bud

[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:16.380]
Uh, a day ago at least

[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:19.660]
Because this morning I was on Miami Beach early and watching

[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:24.820]
CNN news and you know, it has broken nationwide and whatnot

[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:30.680]
But I hope this does bring some relief and I hope something goes come about from it. Okay. Appreciate hearing from him

[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:30.960]
Okay

[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:33.820]
Yeah, I don't think there is one immediate answer

[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:38.900]
But again, he's right the right in the beginning. They should have reacted swiftly and strongly and had a good

[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:42.620]
Disho forest and they said hey, we're just not going to let things get out of control

[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:44.960]
And subject the area to another

[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:46.500]
grotesque

[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.320]
humiliation, but we have

[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:55.040]
We've had another not just nationally, but worldwide. I mean media is here. The super bowl is the single

[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:02.120]
Most watched event in the world. I mean you can't compare anything else even in the world series because the world series is

[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:05.480]
A four to seven games. It's a succession of games day in and day out

[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.720]
The super bowl is a single event

[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:13.440]
That is watched and covered by more media than anything else in the world and as a result we have

[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:16.740]
Media here from virtually every yes technical

[02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:22.640]
Technologically advanced country in the world. So um here they all are and this is what we are providing for them

[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.620]
And they've seen the way we've handled it or not

[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:29.540]
And they you know the impression that they're getting at what this community is all about of course as you pointed out

[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:33.160]
You know, there's a whole page there of media people who have been in the wrong place at the wrong time

[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:40.700]
It got beaten we saw the Canadian Prince and the guy with a blood pouring out of his head and this will be written about for weeks and months to come

[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:43.160]
So as I said yesterday do not

[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:48.540]
Look upon this is some kind of an isolated episode or something that we can sweep under the carpet

[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:55.380]
You know, you need to look at it from the larger perspective of not only how we are living as a community or not

[02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:59.040]
But how the rest of the world looks at us and I just I just don't know you know

[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:02.740]
I always keep saying it and we somehow managed to survive just barely but

[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:08.900]
How much punishment anyone community can take I mean it's been going on virtually nonstop for the last eight years and

[02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:11.640]
Uh, you have to wonder how much longer it can go on

[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:15.160]
Anyway, we're not going to go on any longer because we're at the end of the align for today

[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:19.620]
Steve is a coming along next and he's got an entire panel of folks are going to be discussing the

[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:25.360]
riots in over town in Liberty City and I guess we finally did conclude that we can use the word riot today right now

[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.440]
I'll Reverend Carlton Coleman of the new Providence Missionary Baptist Church which is located in the area in questions

[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:33.440]
Gonna be one of the guests and some others so stay tuned and

[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:39.860]
I want to thank seriously the audience we had some I'd say 99% of the cost they were thoughtful and reasonable and rational

[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:44.880]
And concerned and if nothing else show that there are those people out there concerned about the area that they live in

[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:49.260]
Okay, have a great day. Let's hope we're peace and quiet and the cooler heads to prevail tonight

[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:52.340]
