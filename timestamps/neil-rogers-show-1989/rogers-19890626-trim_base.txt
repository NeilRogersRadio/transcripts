[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140]
For pay for a meal Steve have you ever known it says he never pays for me ever we never we keep waiting see I could do that

[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.020]
I don't have I just

[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.660]
Don't have the guts to do that. I mean there's too much shame involved you know to keep going back

[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.300]
I could eat at sponsors seriously. I could never pay for another meal as long as I'm in this business

[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.960]
Okay as long as I'm here you don't have it in you. I don't I can't it just do I some people have no shame

[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.200]
You have to do when he reached over and kept grabbing more and more of those char-hunts are difficult

[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.200]
So I thought to myself this is shocking okay

[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.880]
shocking

[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.100]
First it was a couple then it was a couple more and then it was like a part of a stack

[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.380]
It would like a chunk you know off the top there. Yeah, I didn't take a one. I didn't need it in the listeners

[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.880]
You know I could be free

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.940]
I'm hearing always wanting food. I just don't have it. So anyway, you're a great guy Hank and we love you

[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.320]
But stick it in your ear. Okay mind your own business and tell all your butt liquors on your support talk

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.520]
Okay, I'm so glad we finally went back to the phone

[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.880]
Hey listen

[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.820]
You were talking about fat rich and joy in his food. I'm at the meds fans won't be able to have any lunch with us today isn't it?

[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.200]
You were talking about fat rich and joy in his food earlier. Yeah, well he enjoyed my food too on Saturday

[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.620]
Did he had a plate of

[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.040]
Couple slice of pizza there

[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.300]
Went to a picture with me and he took the pizza right off course

[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.360]
That's where you got to watch him at every move man. I was watching every turn what how are the meat balls were

[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.140]
Scented that's all I had I had a meatball and I had some sausage and peppers and a one slice of pizza

[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.300]
I would have liked to have had another meatball, but there was some the guy with a hair net

[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.680]
You know the one I'm talking about yeah sure do standing in line. He shows up every time that very weird guy with a hair

[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.640]
And he ate all the meatballs really yeah, well what they did thought it was say these buffet

[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.140]
After you guys were done they put the rest of the tray over to the other table

[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.420]
And there was a meatball on a half there and the dog man I

[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.600]
Guess the guy with the bad shirt that they were trying to get rid of him

[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.280]
He was just putting stuff in his pocket. It was unbelievable. Yeah, he wouldn't golfing it all up a real

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.200]
Yeah, he first of all he starts it all up then he starts screaming

[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.660]
He stands out in the middle of the crowd starts screaming about how little food

[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.780]
They're not enough food for everybody and what a rip off this is so we finally had his ass kicked out

[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.980]
Hey, listen, we had to wait a little bit for the food, but it was just sensational. Yeah, it is he did the

[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.560]
Salvas up quite often got a Hank's tank spy report for you quite overdue in fact, but

[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.300]
I'm a seasoned ticket holder down at the arena for the heat games and I sent the whole

[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.500]
Using with the privilege of hanging tanks sitting right across from me, you know in the press area with Tony Sarge and so and the like and

[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.700]
That man can eat yeah, no two ways about it. Absolutely. We take best before every game

[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.400]
You know how many times tanks gonna go out for food and the total food is gonna eat

[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.400]
I went quite a bit of money there. I don't want to be roses and listening right now because I know that's illegal

[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.740]
But I'm man. Yeah, some people have to win money and that's to do something you might recover their gambling losses

[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.360]
I guess the win money to cover his eating losses

[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.780]
He's something not shows in a hand

[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.200]
Or drink and beer and slapping no then brighten on the back and

[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.240]
Sports people man, they know how to suck it up don't they well, I think I'm gonna I'm gonna change my career

[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.920]
I'm gonna become a sportsman. I understand it didn't cause me anything. Yeah

[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.940]
You got it

[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.160]
He really isn't like that. I work he'd stop killing for the track and for the dolphins

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.560]
And you know just tell it like it is

[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.100]
Don't claim to tell it like it is really telling like it like Joe the gucky right there you go

[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.020]
Okay, yeah, this is jug head all right. Oh, it's jug here. Of course. How soon they forget that's right? Okay, jug

[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.440]
Okay, juggie

[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.780]
Next month. See you. Have a good life. Okay. Yeah. I remember now pressure pack first out

[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.400]
We got a lot of stuff in a battle. We didn't get too much about this new story about the

[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.220]
Pathetically low pay

[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.620]
It's embarrassing and humiliating and speaking of that how do we grow?

[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.620]
Is

[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.640]
Don't have to drive you to drink

[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.020]
Working all those years getting paid like some kind of a slumber Henry Barrow standing by with the 11 o'clock WIOD news

[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.040]
And we're gonna come back with our number two at 1105 Steve has another one of those

[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.220]
horrendous condos stories a but a still hurlwitz and their little dog are gonna be here with

[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.640]
The condo meanies from carriage hills. Okay, because they don't want them to have their little dog

[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.520]
So it's gonna really be something and they're gonna be throwing dog bones at each other and having a nervous breakdown

[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.240]
And we got sports talk tonight sunny and

[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.380]
Whatever else at 605 followed by bush beanband

[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.200]
Steve K this afternoon and two on new stock radio 6th and W IOD

[00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.340]
It may call call out the opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those stations now

[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.560]
Here's Neil Rogers on new stock radio 6th and W IOD

[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.280]
Oh

[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.580]
You can't be dead you know you're right. I've heated that when the pretty as much as I like Dion that music right there

[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.960]
You can't really grow on me anyway

[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.700]
7.06 to W IOD we're just having a great Monday here and we covered a lot of ground boy in that first hour and

[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.340]
Can't wait till Hank is on here again, so we can you know take a little shot back, which I'm sure he will

[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.520]
I just don't understand it. I mean what is the mind is on stinking business?

[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.420]
Okay, I had a bad experience. I agonized about it on the air didn't I and I said I didn't want to hurt the

[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.820]
Image of all the other kids who are good and honest and don't do it

[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.840]
I didn't have a problem out there before but when two people get ripped off back to back on the same day

[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.840]
It looks like they're developing a problem out there, okay?

[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.260]
But one thing about a lot of businesses in this town in this state in Florida. It's a Florida way to the business

[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.860]
Don't confuse us for example up north

[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.140]
And I guess here too if it's a good restaurant you go in and if you have a bad experience you go to the manager and tell them and they're happy to

[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.420]
Hear about it

[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.420]
Because they want to know of course and a lot of places down here you do that

[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.500]
They look at you like get the hell out of here and go to hell don't ever come back. You know that kind of thing

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.580]
Don't I'm saying but to be fair

[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.160]
It would be like if somebody called the show and said we don't like that you eat on the air

[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.000]
That would be like my saying get lost or ever call a show again as opposed to saying okay, we will never do it again

[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.000]
Right which we always do that don't we?

[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.920]
That's not a good example

[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.340]
I thought we were the back

[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.220]
Is it all that?

[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.660]
Thanks anyway tomorrow we're doing a four-hour. We're gonna bring a psychologist in who's gonna talk about Steve's obsession with getting everything for free

[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.300]
Right

[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.440]
I've been waiting for this movie passing food

[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.820]
I mean Steve really just has this little hang up. He's got this obsession

[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.760]
With getting things for free

[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.620]
I think the Chinese called out of snores. Now what they call it?

[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.820]
It's 11.07 at W.I.O.D. We'll take a call in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yeah

[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.280]
Yeah

[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.140]
Yeah

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.180]
I'm like oh look at the power of this ring. We are on a thank you for posting that little thing on our death

[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.300]
Everyone who comes in my office to see that I was really yeah, yeah

[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.220]
You were there. I can testify to that

[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.740]
I

[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.860]
Don't

[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.720]
Look up

[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.340]
I was there

[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.700]
What

[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.600]
Of course I do

[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.900]
Don't he was occupied he had he had robin there the first half and then he had to do it the second half

[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.780]
He wasn't he wasn't talking anybody else. He was mindlessly signing autographs on pictures paying no attention to any of the people

[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.120]
A lot of a ton of nice people out there including you

[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.540]
Exactly, but he just was totally oblivious because he had to do a group. He's there sitting there salivating on their

[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.820]
That's not really correct. There were a lot of people talking to me. What you have to do is just want you just say something

[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.840]
Yeah, yeah, why did you do that?

[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.960]
Yeah, well, I don't know. I stopped like that. I'm not a goofy mentality. Well the way it looked to me is you didn't speak to me

[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.080]
I'm sorry, right? You know this is an interesting clock is in person. You were great on the phone

[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.060]
You're just this maybe it's the phone. You know, it's a bad phone

[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.100]
Because you never did speak to me. Yeah

[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.420]
You broke your heart you broke her heart

[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.700]
You broke my heart. That's right. Isn't that cute?

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.300]
It was pretty cute. It was pretty cute. It was really pretty. It's also a pleasure being the block lady. Yeah

[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.960]
Yeah, she was really very impressed. She's nice. Yeah. Yeah, I'm thankful that you're my idol. Okay. Have a wonderful day

[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.800]
That was for a reason and that's cuz blind Mike

[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.520]
Blessed us with his presence. He did everybody was there on Saturday. I couldn't believe it me the hearing showed up and Nick and

[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:15.220]
On and on and on and on everybody I just was shocking everybody you'd ever hope to see in a few you hope never to see it

[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.960]
Bob was there from Cooper City, right? So he better govern himself accordingly and Joey was there and Joe

[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.600]
I didn't see Joe was Joe was there with a friend of his they were like backed up against the wall because they were keeping their eye on

[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.240]
They're a truck they want to make sure they had a Terry Claude thing over their license plate so nobody could take them

[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.300]
And it was just amazing. I've never seen anything like it in my life

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.700]
We don't want to keep boring you with this because obviously the rest of you who didn't show up didn't couldn't care less

[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.980]
Right, but I think I finally had an impact when I said let's get some different and new and people to show up because we had a whole

[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.660]
tons of people that we've never met before right included a few of the chronic regulars

[00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:01.920]
Who just enough to spice it up? Yeah, but a lot of the chronic that we had never met. Yeah, oh, yeah loads of new people

[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.820]
Which was great because who now wants to do those things and go out and see the same

[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:11.980]
Hundred people every time, you know, I mean some of more nice people and then again some of Marriam morons, okay?

[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.280]
Here's a mobile and Broward. Hello. Hi. Yeah, how you doing now great?

[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.780]
Listen, I didn't get a chance to see you in the bird. I guess they could I wasn't there

[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.840]
And well, you know a lot we weren't there yesterday either so

[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:23.960]
Saturday

[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.820]
That was a one I didn't see yeah

[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.600]
It's like going out to the call today in fact I guarantee you the Valley Parkers won't touch anything

[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.080]
Yeah, they're not racing today. So I have to call their go out to the highline. Yeah, there you go have a nice safe day

[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.480]
Right, I just a couple things like the cup stock

[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.920]
With a lose three in a row

[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.060]
Well, they scored one run in three games. You don't win too many games with a third of a run again

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:52.820]
That's true

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:58.960]
Well things, you know, they have that way, you know, I love the way everybody's seizing upon is they had one five in a row including two

[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.260]
Montreal

[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.300]
Yeah up until these three the fact is they don't play well at Wrigley Field

[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.960]
They suck at home. They're great on the road, but they stink at home

[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.900]
Well, it's time to clear that stadium down exactly. I'm off for that. Yeah, don't stay in there some

[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.560]
Yeah, play in the winter with artificial turf. They play well on the artificial turf with all those stolen bases

[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.180]
Yeah, but then they got all the old timers won't be able to play on that kind of stuff

[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.860]
So I have to start getting some more new players

[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.860]
What old timers in the old

[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:28.440]
Andre Dawson, Rowan. Yeah, he's a real old man. He's 34 years old. He's the oldest guy in the team problem here

[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.740]
Well, you've played 15 years or an old man, right? Okay, whatever you say

[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.420]
Okay, and also just want to say Mac the hack is a douchebag and having a day. Okay, bye-bye and the same to you

[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.140]
Okay, 1115 at W.I.O.D.

[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.300]
Yeah, if there's anything you don't like about the show just call in will change you immediately

[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.020]
Okay, we don't this business about we're not

[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.340]
Interested what kind of crap is that who said that like I was talking about some of the restaurants. Oh

[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.500]
If you have a complaint they should kiss the ground. I mean if it's a legitimate complaint if you're just one of those

[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.160]
Panning-ass people like complain everywhere. It's like people like go into a restaurant order steaks

[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:09.180]
Okay, and they eat 90% of the steak and then they call over the waiter and they say now this was too topper

[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.160]
It wasn't cooked around not gonna pay for it

[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.300]
Okay, those are just more people looking for a stinkin' free meal

[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:20.620]
Yeah, that's like watching 80% of a movie and then walking out and saying I don't like the movie

[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.000]
I want my money back. Yeah, and people do that

[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.920]
That would be like listening to this show till about the till the lightning round and then saying you watch your money back, okay?

[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.540]
Let's go to Boca. Hello. Hello. Yeah, I got my money back. Okay, right now as a matter of fact call a bank

[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:41.260]
There's a number listen, you know, I read that article too about the caller. Yeah, and you mentioned he's in town today

[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.540]
Yes, is there any chance he's coming back? Yes

[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.980]
Well, what do you think he's doing here coming to buy a house of course he's here with a chance to get the located again hot

[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.560]
Damn, yeah, of course of course. I'm one of his oldest fans. Well, he's a great guy. I talked to him on Friday

[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.440]
And he's still he's still you know got a great sense of humor

[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.100]
I don't know how but I I told him he really ought to write a book

[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.460]
He thought I was joking, but I'm not he should write a book as he's had more nightmares in his business than

[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.500]
Anybody could imagine I mean just beyond belief

[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.500]
Yeah, he really ought to including the way they screwed him over at this company

[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.480]
I want to underline that several times because they screwed him here so bad that it's just pathetic

[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.560]
Yeah, they ought to hang their heads in shame

[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.080]
You know and then the nictrugones that the gall to say to me when I first came here

[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.140]
Well, you know what bill does is pass away that well if that's the case

[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.920]
Which isn't true, but if it were the case how come they would hire him in the first place, okay?

[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.440]
That's a douchebag

[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.740]
Yes, he is funny guy. He posted on what he's doing. I'll do it. Okay. See you

[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:47.540]
51117 at W. I. Do what I'm getting excited about I took I would be off my radio button when they fired go call

[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.920]
There and he got and I'll tell you another guy that really really screwed him over badly badly

[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:59.360]
Was Howard Prima over at KAT I mean Bill you know he wasn't happy working overnight

[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.940]
Nobody you know had me working overnight to the I. N. Z

[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.900]
But at least he had a good thing going you know we had that thing back in fourth

[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.360]
I was on 8 to midnight he was on overnight and we I used to stick around every now and then we had a terrific thing

[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.800]
on and he had giant numbers he beat the crap out of witchner and of course at that time

[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.440]
Witchner still had good numbers before most of his audience died and

[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.100]
The bottom line is Prima comes along and hires him away in fact

[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.780]
It's in this article about how they were gonna resurrect the great entertainers. Oh, yeah

[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.740]
Well, I don't know if I ever told a story on the air

[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.980]
But one of the guys who's got a piece of the action at KAT

[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.100]
Invited me to dinner one night here a couple of years ago

[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.360]
without telling me what station it was and

[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:41.020]
Then give me this big come on he's gonna give me a piece of the station and was gonna do this and that

[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.940]
To resurrect KAT. I wish they would just and of course now that it's brokered radio

[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.720]
They just broke her the time which is which is the smartest way now don't turn it down again

[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:56.240]
It was so cold in here. We came in it was 60 degrees. I put it on 70. Oh, please please

[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.560]
It's so cold. I mean if I'm cold. You know, it's gotta be phased you've never complained these guys are not

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.180]
It's gonna be a new thing now with a studio over here

[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.480]
Oh, maybe they need to open the fence up and they're gonna do something because it was so cold in here man today

[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.680]
I thought I was gonna die and I look at the thing and it was set on 60 degrees

[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.800]
I need people not

[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.840]
60 degrees you can work in an igloo

[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.700]
And he reaches Mitch reaches his hand in here and he's got a ready to crank it down again. Don't do it

[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.820]
It's just nice now isn't it almost up to 64 now

[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.860]
It's my breath is starting to in fact my my mouth is frozen together my lips

[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.680]
Anyway, what was I saying about K.E.T. and

[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.900]
Boy if I would have ever done that they come along with all these grandiose ideas. They've got any idea what they're doing

[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.480]
Just like the thing with Jim Kelly remember that with the leather jacket covers and

[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:53.840]
That lasted about 10 minutes the old East Asian. I mean, you know, here's somebody his father will all whatever it is somebody in the family

[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.840]
Bob Howard the station. How are you supposed to be a news flunky when I first went over there?

[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.900]
He was Joe free the system really and he sat out there in the lobby one day when Mrs. Herndt that remember the a senator from New Jersey

[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.580]
The whatever the hell he was the state senator herndt that and

[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.520]
He sat out there. She was ready to fire him and the new PD who would just come in quit

[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.460]
So she brought Howard and instead of firing him she made him program director

[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.280]
It gives you an idea how they run at radio. Yeah, that's like over here

[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.640]
That's a true story. He was waiting that he didn't even know it

[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.280]
He was waiting it hired and she made him program director and then all of a sudden like his father were lost somebody

[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.800]
I bought the radio station for $45 whatever it was and all of a sudden he's a programming expert and what they've done over there

[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.460]
I mean what they're doing on the years bad enough. Okay, it's pathetic

[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.040]
But the bottom line is what they do to people's careers

[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.020]
I mean callers like and not not a child out on the street. He's a guy

[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.020]
You know, he's a human being with a wife and responsibility and they give him a big song of dance and he went over there

[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.980]
It's all too much personality, you know too

[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:57.320]
I don't mess around with a traffic guy and don't do this and don't do that and they just made him miserable

[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.380]
And then they were gonna let him go that weren't even gonna pay him off. I always the one

[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.680]
I'm always the one who has to be involved in these things

[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:10.240]
I said don't you dare leave without forcing them to pay off on the rest of the country they were gonna just screw him all together. Of course

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.260]
It's just pathetic. So anyway, it looks like things are looking up and like he's gonna know what something's gonna happen here

[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.380]
So I'll let you know. I guess I'll probably be gone, but we'll see what happens. Yeah, well no

[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:25.460]
Bill could call the book do not get in this business. Wouldn't that be a good title?

[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.980]
They're pretty close. I told him the name of the book should be stay out of the

[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:35.960]
See what I'm saying laugh. Do you think I'm joking? I mean if our good friend can keep writing these stupid books

[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.960]
You know, he used to write checks now. He writes books

[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.860]
You know the one I mean I come just desperately looking here. I can't they're not here. I don't know boy Roger

[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.300]
Just got nuts here with these cards. I can't find anything

[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:56.160]
Like I said our good friend the fake earthenwright all these books by the slurry King. Yeah, that's a one worth waiting

[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.660]
That's a one

[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.620]
22 past 11 at W.I.O.D. and to take a little break here. I guess we'll be right back

[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.580]
26 past 11 at W.I.D. went. Yeah, I heard yes. I heard

[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.120]
Well, we can take care of it

[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.400]
It's like I'm losing

[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.740]
Good enough to play the whole thing, but we just don't have time so very busy Monday, isn't it boy?

[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.820]
And I guess 26 past 11 at W.I.O.D. we do have an open line in Broward

[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.420]
We haven't given any numbers out here today yet. Isn't that shocking?

[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.880]
It is and if anybody's got any more free food that they want to send over for Steve please do it

[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:54.200]
I guess we should be the last ones to talk, but you know we do it with people that are desperate to send it over here a little different

[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.760]
But it's one thing to like gravel, you know what I mean?

[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.500]
All the weed gravel down here at times when it looked like we were gonna get shined

[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.400]
But just not the same. No, it isn't the same. Not quite the same genre

[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.360]
Miami, hello, what's the question?

[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.520]
Long time nearly me. How are you doing Larry?

[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.500]
Okay, I've kind of got a Mickey Dane Spire Report that ties into that

[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.500]
I was on the train in Washington DC that was boarding. No, I guess about three weeks ago and

[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.080]
Here she comes waddling down the jetway and

[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:30.460]
Seems to be having some difficulty and she told the flight attendant it was a long show. Oh, what show was that man?

[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.220]
Larry King and five out of way to tell you

[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.700]
Great. Yeah, that's your fits in together, and that's yeah

[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.000]
He's fun to listen to for about five ten minutes, but he's only fun to listen to when a people from here are calling him

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.660]
That's what it's really fun. Yeah, I don't know who that is. I don't know who that is. What's the question?

[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.840]
Hey, I picked up your show on the ground and Viral Beach and on the ground

[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.100]
Airplane. Oh in the airplane. I thought maybe just in the air no

[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.320]
On the ground and Viral Beach loud and clear well, not so loud, but clear great

[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.840]
Then a I'm on the ground in Viral Beach. Well, there are a lot of people have been on the ground

[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.180]
By the way, when I get done today, Mitch

[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.300]
I'm gonna cut all those spots in that little room. It's gonna be empty right when I get off that little ugly room in there

[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.280]
Wherever you want. I don't care. Just done a big reel just to get it over with like real fast like in about four minutes

[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:26.660]
Viral Beach terminal plate. Yeah terminal. My mom lives there nice town, but but but also

[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.780]
Listen now understand Robin was at the aromotive Robin was there a

[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:37.140]
Terminal amount of time. Okay, just forever just on and on and on but luckily somebody handled it was great

[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.820]
And I didn't know it was kind of like a pseudo psychological conversation. I heard little bits and pieces in the background

[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:51.780]
Oh, yeah, yeah, hey Glenn. Yeah, I robins age weight size and IQ all the same number. Yes, I see as she told us that she had come out the

[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:57.140]
Saturday before and we weren't there. Yeah, that's a true story. That is true. I love it

[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.040]
So she's a little confused, but she does live in plantation so she she's got an excuse

[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.800]
I really enjoy talking. Yeah, she was all right for a while

[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.340]
Okay, well I would say it's about the same

[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.400]
Okay, great day. See ya

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.100]
past 11 at W. What was that?

[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.200]
At W. I. O. D. Well, that was strange. Well, now here's a great record

[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.920]
What's they also don't play? I don't want to start in on magic again

[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.180]
And I know that the trend went zooming. They had these enormous numbers. They're music has gotten so sour so bad

[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.820]
I don't know what's wrong with them. I don't know what's wrong with them. Their music sucks compared to what it used to be

[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.040]
It play all these like sleepy

[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.360]
Dreamy it's like gloves 94 oldies. Okay, you know, they played Bobby Vinton again Saturday night

[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.100]
I love how you love me by Bobby Vinton. Oh, man

[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.220]
I think that I must have a Polish program director over there

[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:57.400]
Well music director or something. Okay, because you know those Polish people in Bobby Vinton. They just go nuts

[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.660]
I haven't heard this record

[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.940]
I can't remember the online at least every half hour power rotation

[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.220]
Never will hear it

[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.020]
Really pisses me off too

[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.960]
Anyway, it's 11 30 at W. I. O. D. Here's Palm Beach. Hello. Yeah, Neil. I haven't heard that song since I listen to cool 105.9 last week

[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.140]
Well, that was a good station. This sure is. That's wonderful

[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.500]
You pick that thing from four pairs all the way up to Jacksonville. I'll take it back into great station

[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.360]
Absolutely great. They have these little things that they do once in a while to which makes it nice

[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.420]
I you know when you have an oldie station like that. You know about things you like to have a theme for everyone in your shows

[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:39.180]
I know yeah like our theme today. Yeah, you know, we need pirate radio this week. They'll go to play in the cups

[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.280]
Yeah, thank you for that boy. I wonder how we get to play the Phillies. That's what I want to know

[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.880]
I don't know you'll play the Phillies after they trade for a Guerrero guys like that know whenever game in the world. Yeah, probably

[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.860]
Yeah, I hear that some of the people with Pete roses in a little bit of trouble. No, that's just a room

[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.200]
Oh, okay. I just thought I own sports on the other side. No, no, no, in fact, he said don't bet on it

[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.360]
Yeah, well, I know it's it's you know, it's nice when you can do cocaine you can write people you can murder

[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.440]
But whatever you do don't gamble. Well, see that's what really kills me

[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.280]
I of course I can understand if you're involved in the thing you can be betting

[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:17.900]
You know, there's a conflict of interest there obviously there's always the fear that somebody is throwing the game or something and it you know

[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.380]
It's dangerous for the integrity of this for but on the other hand

[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.520]
You hear all these people sitting around who are who are betting with bookies and we're giving the odds on high school polo

[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.620]
Water polo games and they're like decrying this terrible thing. He's got this gambling thing

[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.260]
And I you know, I just I just don't understand that whole bookie thing to begin with you know

[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.700]
That's a one thing in America everybody just winks and laughs and everybody does it

[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.440]
God forbid some guys should get caught like with a prostitute on a biscuit in Boulevard

[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.040]
They're gonna crucify him and destroy his life and put it on the front page of the newspaper

[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.180]
But if you bet illegally in this country no problem at all. Yeah, yeah, I don't understand it

[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.140]
I don't know. Don't get me wrong. I'm all for gambling, but why the hell is it illegal? Yeah

[00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.180]
That judge I was pretty funny watching that yesterday. Well, the judge. I don't want to say it

[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.220]
He's already got his comeback line for next week though when they suspend Rose for a year or whatever

[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.880]
The people to send he gonna climb up the steps of the court out

[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.940]
He's gonna say hey, I never promised you a rose party. Cute. Not bad. Have a great life

[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.180]
So all of that to get to that line. Okay, what it was all right wasn't

[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.300]
My own moderate. It's 1132 at W.I. The it's over. We have an opening in Palm Beach

[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.600]
I guess we better mention that huh and now I'm gonna start this spot a little bit early because it's gonna take me a little bit of time

[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.320]
Because I want to we already discussed this with an earlier caller who unsolicited called in right in first call

[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.520]
I think yeah about the melting pot and

[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:40.040]
And you know, I have to laugh when I listen to my colleague in the afternoon going on about this other second rate

[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.020]
Fondue place because it's a joke at all at a melting pot

[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.720]
And he noticed he never mentions the melting pot by name. I'll be glad to mention St. Gregory's because I we're not paranoid at the melting pot

[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.700]
Okay, in fact, you notice on national TV a lot of times they mentioned the competitor by name

[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.840]
That's that's all had if you're not paranoid and

[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:01.000]
The bottom line is that the reason they don't serve the old for example fondue with the melting pot is it doesn't work

[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.660]
Not everything is mentioned is meant to be dunked in the fondue pot. I can think of several things right off the bat

[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:08.540]
and

[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.900]
Lobsters are the same they tried that originally the first place to try it with the melting pot

[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.840]
They tried it as a special I think for father's day year or so ago

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.280]
Mm-hmm, and just they didn't like it. It just didn't work out

[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.200]
They want their product to be fantastic to be sensational to be orgasmic

[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.320]
And that's why they go to great lengths to use the very finest meats and the greatest seafood and the freshest crunchiest vegetables

[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.180]
And of course that great chocolate fondue for dessert including the unparalleled white chocolate with amaretto

[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:40.720]
Without almonds in a fight away. You won't find anything bumpy or lumpy in your chocolate fondues at the melting pot because they don't melt up

[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.320]
Nestle's bars with almonds, okay, just just not the way it's done

[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.360]
So you can go to the other place and you can get you know

[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.580]
Oh, you get something for free

[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.800]
Which of course is Steve's idea of a great place to eat as if you get something for free the melting pot

[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.940]
The prices are so reasonable and the food is so great

[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.180]
They don't have to give food away for free to do a tremendous job which they are and

[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.020]
So the bottom line is if you want a great experience

[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.600]
tremendous service and

[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.980]
Delicious fondue the one place to think of is the melting pot with three locations

[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:13.860]
98.35 cents at drive in South Miami 31.43 North East 163rd in North Miami Beach

[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:19.720]
And West Apple Road just east of Pine Island and Crayol Springs except no cheap imitators you had for the melting pot

[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:31.680]
Speaking of shameless I don't believe this man fat rich just walks into our Monday no less Monday

[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:32.960]
Monday

[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.880]
Straight from his

[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.080]
incredible display

[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.660]
At Toyota Hollywood on Saturday in which he ate an entire tray of meatballs while standing up

[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:45.960]
We're shocking

[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.380]
You hear the guy call and said you ate his pizza ripped off the guy's pizza is that a true story?

[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.860]
Oh, not that he remembers right when you go when you're about where you've eaten so much you're ready to go into a coma

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.780]
You don't always remember everything that you stole okay

[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.020]
So he doesn't remember it, but I'm sure it must be true anyway

[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.800]
He heard that we had Arnold's coming in today

[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:12.280]
So we just happened to come in a little bit early today and I noticed the barks. You notice I brought my own today because they brought it in the other day free

[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.280]
Steve was happy about that

[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:20.320]
You're getting the hang of it okay, you're really getting the hang of it, but anyway the barks diet root beer is incredible

[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.360]
And it'll kind of probably you know weighing he'll probably bring in some birch beer

[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.080]
So you'll have to help them because we got that container. We got to give back to them

[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.920]
That the frosted mug which they do now have frosted mugs over there in the birch beer

[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.580]
Okay, so you don't have to water it down with ice which dilutes the quality of the birch beer you have to be a real kind of

[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:43.340]
Weird for that stuff. Anyway, what was I gonna do before he came in and just totally threw me off?

[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.780]
I had something very important that was gonna pass along something shocking

[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.080]
Just flip by

[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.620]
Slip right on by we want to congratulate Zeta by the way and that tremendous remote they did

[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.720]
How would you feel if he went out to do a thing like that?

[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.600]
And we're like six seven people showed up and right next door yeah

[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.860]
We were there with people lined up as far as the other was a bitter pill to swallow up that there was no one there

[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:12.260]
You know I drove out a big girl to swallow not a person. Well, this whole audience was there. Yeah, no one a person

[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.300]
What a shame

[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:21.160]
But like I said we're gonna be speaking of gambling. We're gonna be taking up office pool on when Mark Cune and Rosefolds

[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.080]
You're both get it at the same time. I mean how can how long can that go on amazing?

[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.020]
Maze is me. Oh, I know I rich showed up today

[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.660]
Of course we'd had big smile on his face because here's another one of these smarming New York met fans

[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:39.640]
Alex say hey, we need the billies. We need the billies. Oh, oh, oh, oh, big deal. Okay, the Rochester Red Winds could be the Phillies, okay?

[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:46.640]
Did you win this one? Yeah, we lost three games. Okay, they forget about the five and a row we won before that including two in Montréal

[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.740]
We'll see how the match do in Montréal the next three days. Okay. We'll see just how great they do up there

[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.880]
Meantime it. It's like there's three teams within a half a game. So it's anybody's race

[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.000]
Anybody's race and I'll grant you we're falling apart at the seams

[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.180]
But they'll be put on a good show for a while anyway for a lot of day. Hello

[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.360]
Great. I don't bury

[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:12.260]
Okay, no, it's not a cup. He's all upset because he we had a let me tell the audience a little story

[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:18.260]
There were a lot of people who came by on Saturday who were Cub Spans and they had you know shirts on or caps or whatever

[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.000]
Every time and he wasn't even paying any attention

[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.320]
He's talking to Robin and the dark lady for three hours. Okay, but anytime anybody mentioned baseball all of a sudden his head started

[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.980]
perspiring and he got right in the face. Oh, are we gonna have to hear about this for three hours?

[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:38.360]
Nobody was even talking to him about it. Okay, but it's just it's like a Pavlovian response. Okay. Like an automatic reflex

[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.860]
A little bit of exaggeration. He could be sitting at home down in Kendall and somebody in sunrise could be talking baseball

[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.700]
And all of a sudden he starts sweating and getting computations. He doesn't know why but he gets upset

[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:54.060]
Well, I was there outside. I tried to get an autograph from the bird. He was a bit too busy

[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.780]
He was busy, though. He was real busy

[00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.300]
Yeah, I got a I got my picture taken within the oh, I don't know if you remember me

[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:05.440]
I was the hippie type with the add-on whatever you say. Yeah, I was wondering if I'm gonna get that into an eight by ten

[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.580]
I was wondering if I sent it into you with a return envelope if you could autograph it. Of course no problem

[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.820]
Just in the 50 or 100 bucks. Okay. No, no problem. Okay. Um, I was also wondering did a

[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:21.100]
The D lady show up there? Of course. I don't know. I don't want to say her name not the dork lady, but you know, oh

[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.220]
Donna

[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.400]
No, no, she never showed up. She's another one of those all talks. She didn't show up or if she did

[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.760]
She didn't we don't know who it was yeah, I know who she is

[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:36.580]
Unfortunately the blotcher named bambi did not show up with her panties and a lot of guys really pissed about that true

[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.080]
Like there were guys taking off their underwear in a hallway and they were getting upset

[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:46.780]
Good with that. I mean great. What is gone? Yeah, you must know that lunch is coming from Arnold's today

[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.420]
Yes, it was

[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.340]
Uh-huh. Okay. Well, that's about it. Neal

[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.420]
Star struck down. It's about what I don't know. Just seeing you in person. You know, you just

[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.940]
Yeah, it's shocking isn't it?

[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.520]
That's why we stay inside most of the time

[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.940]
Okay, have a great day. Okay, let me call a Robin Todd. You're both a couple of douchebags. You're right. Okay. Thanks Neil

[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.560]
Bye-bye.

[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.100]
20 till noon at WIOD boy. It's a great day for the Irish isn't it?

[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.080]
Hmm, that's the old saying isn't it's a great day for the Irish? I don't know what the hell that means

[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:22.100]
Uh, glory fades for radio news. We haven't had too much of a chance to get into this in depth
