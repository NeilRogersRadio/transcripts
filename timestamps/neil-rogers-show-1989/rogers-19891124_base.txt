[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]
I'd like to hold for Donnie.

[00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.160]
Yeah, I bet.

[00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.380]
Told you to hold this.

[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.760]

[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.340]
Interesting hour.

[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.720]
Whoops, Miami.

[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.620]
Hello?

[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.240]
Hi.

[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.060]
Hi.

[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.580]
My name is Laurie, and I like to know, can I please hold on for Donnie please?

[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.440]
Of course, Laurie.

[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.860]
Oh, thank you.

[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.340]
I have been calling you since.

[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.600]
Now, don't start hyperventilating on me, okay?

[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.840]
I'm trying not to.

[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.940]
Hmm.

[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.140]
But I've been holding on.

[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.320]
I've been waiting to talk to him.

[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.320]
You're just foaming at the mouth, right?

[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.780]
No, actually, I'm just saying I'm going to press out in tears in a minute.

[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.500]
Oh, no, don't get emotional, okay?

[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.060]
Let's try not to make fools out of ourselves, all right?

[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.160]
Oh, I'll try not to.

[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.120]
Okay, Laurie, hold on.

[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.160]
Okay, thank you.

[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.860]
Wow.

[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.420]
The emotional level in here is rising to a fever pitch, okay?

[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.400]
She's a mess.

[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500]
She is a wreck.

[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.580]
I don't know who's more excited.

[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.960]
Her or Johnny Dark at the prospect of pizza love showing up.

[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.260]
Hey, came in here during the day.

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.220]
Where's the child?

[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.840]
Where's the child?

[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.580]
Oh, boy, he is incredible, isn't he?

[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.280]
I didn't want to get into it.

[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.520]
Oh, I don't.

[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.140]
Plantation.

[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.740]
Good one.

[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.060]
1217 at WIOD doing a good job of screening.

[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.920]
He's called Ladies Only, okay?

[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.300]
Ladies, ladies.

[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.220]
Do we have to draw you a diagram, Nick?

[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.820]
Too many of those shows with Reverend Polar, so I think it's worth to do it.

[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.340]
Now, he doesn't know a lady from his armpit.

[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.640]
God, maybe George will have to answer the phones.

[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.720]
He's got this straightened out.

[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.220]
That's embarrassing, isn't it?

[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.400]
1217 at WIOD.

[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.640]
7519463 and date.

[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.800]
524WID in Broward.

[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.740]
See, they're all flashing, but he's going through this traumatic.

[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.520]
Are you a lady?

[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.700]
Yes, I am.

[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.520]
Well, you are.

[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.500]
Thank God.

[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.660]
Did you hear that last one?

[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.780]
Yeah, that was no lady.

[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.400]
Yeah.

[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.920]
Now, are you waiting for Donnie Osmond?

[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.440]
Yes, I am, but I like talking to you too.

[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.060]
Oh, okay.

[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.120]
Today?

[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.880]
Oh, you mean another time?

[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.320]
Well, any time.

[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.080]
Okay.

[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.760]
Hold on.

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.340]
Okay.

[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.240]
She didn't want to talk to me.

[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.580]
You don't have to lie and make us feel better.

[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.680]
You don't have to do that.

[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.420]
We'll survive.

[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.100]
Hello.

[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.380]
Hi, how are you?

[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.980]
Great.

[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.140]
Are you really going to have Osmond on?

[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.360]
What do you think?

[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.560]
Well, I don't know.

[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.020]
I just turned you on my boyfriend's home from work today.

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.080]
And we listen to you every day.

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.040]
Now, why did you call me?

[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.880]
I was going to call him Osmond.

[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.740]
Donnie Osmond.

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.140]
Yeah.

[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.860]
You don't have to be embarrassed to say that.

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.880]
I mean, I know it sounds a little prepubescent and everything, but you can say that.

[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.640]
I know.

[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.080]
And you want to talk to him?

[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.940]
Yeah, I'd love to.

[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.520]
Hold on.

[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.620]
I think.

[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.100]
A little nervous about that.

[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.240]
When you know what I'm saying, yes.

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.320]
A little nervous.

[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.940]
She thinks we're having, what's the name from C-B-S?

[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.180]
Oh, Charles Osgood.

[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.860]
Charles Osgood.

[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.300]

[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.460]
No, she does.

[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.060]
She really does.

[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.320]
She don't have Donnie Osmond from Flipper.

[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.040]
And Luke Alpin, by the way, might be stopping by, OK?

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.660]
Anyway, George is here to take pictures.

[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.060]
Channel 7 is coming by.

[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.900]
Johnny Dark is here to eat pizza lot to probably be here any minute.

[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.160]
Just really something.

[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.300]
It's not like what usually happens on the show, is it?

[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.980]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.700]
Or they just ignore the cramp out of us.

[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.280]
OK, Broward Air.

[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.900]
Boka, he's at the door, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.960]
He's at the door.

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.460]
There goes Nick.

[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.300]
Nick is on his way to get him.

[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.040]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.300]
Oh, boy.

[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.040]
W-I-O-D.

[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.300]
Hi.

[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.440]
You know, Roger's there?

[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.700]
Yes, do you want to speak to Donnie Osmond?

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.380]
Yes, I would.

[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.880]
You know we'd want to speak to Neil, do you?

[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.240]
No, I don't blame you.

[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.620]
Hold on.

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.680]
Hold on.

[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.620]
W-I-O-D.

[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.300]
Hello.

[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.040]
Goodbye.

[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.420]
OK, so we got the Dayton Broward lines all set up there,

[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.780]
and all those ladies out there.

[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.540]
Now, the one on two, I'm not the one with Charles Osgood.

[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.040]
Yeah.

[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.700]
Just, uh, yeah.

[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.840]
You want to check her again?

[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.660]
You're still there, right?

[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.980]
Hi.

[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.800]
Hold on.

[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.020]
Now, panic now.

[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.560]
Palm Beach.

[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.420]
OK, good one.

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.680]
Lee Fowler wanted to talk to him.

[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.420]
Great, but his spot just ran out, and he couldn't hold on any longer.

[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.460]
Sorry about that, Lee.

[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.580]
You'll have to make do with the guy.

[00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.940]
What's that?

[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.300]
He had a great show today, boy.

[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.660]
I didn't see it.

[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.140]
Forget what it was.

[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.080]
Oh, it was incredible.

[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.820]
Let me look at that.

[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.660]
Something about how to make your flowers grow.

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.820]
Did you have a pretty hand?

[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.540]
No, I think he had Steve Pitsakano or whatever that guy's name was.

[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.380]
I think I was talking about yesterday.

[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.960]
Yeah.

[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.040]
That was growing those funny flowers in his backyard or something.

[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.860]
Boka.

[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.580]
Hello.

[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.960]
Yeah, you keep hanging up on me.

[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.360]
I know.

[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.120]
Too bang.

[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.520]
Palm Beach.

[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.580]
Mike Miller, please.

[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.580]
OK, hold on.

[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.500]
OK, 20 extra milk.

[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.400]
Wow, we're getting somewhere.

[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.580]
At WIOD.

[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.760]
Let's begin the break, because I see the whole entourage is coming in here.

[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.560]
This is pretty exciting.

[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.980]
Look at this.

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.960]
There are just thousands.

[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.060]
Thousands of people flocking in here, but we haven't had this much excitement since Mike Disney came in.

[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.120]
Right?

[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.480]
I think that was the last day.

[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.980]
It was shocking.

[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.320]
Johnny is there.

[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.680]
Nick is really a family doing a little bit of work now.

[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.600]
This is so exciting.

[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.060]
I could just pass out on the floor.

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.720]
And there he is, ladies and gentlemen, the star of stage and screen.

[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.560]
How you knew?

[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.540]
I think so.

[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.460]
Last time I checked.

[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.100]
Great, Johnny.

[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.220]
It's wonderful to see you.

[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.120]
I've got a lot of desperate drooling ladies on the phone waiting.

[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.520]
The bird.

[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.600]
You can tell why I can't you.

[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.100]
For the bird.

[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.080]
Johnny's in there.

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.320]
Johnny's in there.

[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.420]
Johnny's, he just hangs around.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.920]
He just hangs out and eats.

[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.620]
All right.

[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.540]
You can relate to that.

[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.140]
Look at that shirt that he's wearing.

[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.320]
Is that incredible or what?

[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.020]
Isn't incredible.

[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.620]
I don't know.

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.840]
It looks haloshes.

[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.700]
Anyway, haloshes a little joke.

[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.660]
Seeing he's got a little bit more.

[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.340]
The time he leaves, halosh, I'm going to be Jewish.

[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.580]
Did you have eye-cows were Jewish?

[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.120]
Yes.

[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.020]
It's one of the best kept secrets in America.

[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.420]
And these people from Channel 7 who are on work release, by the way, they only work on haloshes a week into when they let them out.

[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.660]
It's incredible.

[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.420]
Hey, I want to say one thing.

[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.120]
I'm listening to you.

[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.300]
You're not going to whisper in my ear.

[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.780]
And I was going to whisper in my ear.

[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.140]
I'm not going to whisper in my ear.

[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.720]
I'm just trying to do something else in your ear.

[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.960]
Really?

[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.960]
What is that?

[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.460]
One thing you said on the ear, you said, ladies only.

[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.640]
Why are you avoiding questions from the men?

[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.540]
Oh, you never heard of it.

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.860]
Hey, we're talking to anybody you want to talk to.

[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.420]
I don't care if you were in for a lot of grief.

[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.200]
Doesn't buy me.

[00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.400]
Why do you want to talk to the guys?

[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.820]
Anything they want to talk about.

[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.200]
Really?

[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.640]
Sure.

[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.060]
Is Marie's real name, Olive?

[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.740]
It is.

[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.240]
Say, we got that out of the way immediately.

[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.600]

[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.820]
Some fake are called in yesterday.

[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.860]
He said her name was Olive.

[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.020]
I probably said meat now for announcing that.

[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.240]
No.

[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.740]
Well, you and she aren't too tight anymore anyway, right?

[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.900]
No, despite what everybody thinks we are.

[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.860]
We may get along great.

[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.980]
We do, right?

[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.260]

[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.420]
But the only problem is we don't see each other that much.

[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.840]
Yeah.

[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.300]
She's so busy doing her thing.

[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.360]
And that's only by accident.

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.440]
What?

[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.720]
That you work on the East Coast when she's on a West and vice-person.

[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.300]
No.

[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.680]
As a matter of fact, this tour is taking these two love the same venues.

[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.060]
Really?

[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.440]
Yeah.

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.020]
And are you like hanging out together?

[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.440]
No.

[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.600]
It's the last time.

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.620]
I like his refreshing honesty.

[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.460]
You know, that's the amazing.

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.840]
Even when it hurts, it's incredible.

[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.080]
Can I do a little break?

[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.560]

[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.980]
No.

[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.440]
I mean, it's your show.

[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.400]
We got all these ladies.

[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.680]
Well, you don't want to talk to a bunch of dumb guys.

[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.360]
What are you saying guys are dumb?

[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.600]
Well, on this show they are.

[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.520]
Yeah, trust him.

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.040]
No.

[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.420]
I want to prove that very wrong, guys.

[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.260]
You call and...

[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.500]
Okay.

[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.760]
Anybody who wants to call and make an ass out of yourself is...

[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.060]
Okay.

[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.840]
Okay.

[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.800]
23 afternoon Donny Osmond's in the building.

[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.640]
Look at this, Ollie.

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.340]
They don't come in.

[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.540]
Now, I want to tell you, you saw Channel 7 is right next door over here.

[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.740]

[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.940]
Yes.

[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.360]
They never come in here.

[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.740]
We could be arrested for murder or a show.

[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.740]
We could do anything in the world.

[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.560]
They wouldn't come over here.

[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.200]
It's too far.

[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.860]
It's too far.

[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.400]
We'd be on a front page of the herald.

[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.300]
They didn't do it far for Channel 7.

[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.960]
But Donny Osmond comes in and air here snapping and shooting and smiling and pukeing and

[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.200]
licking.

[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760]
I'm just embarrassed.

[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.300]
Anyway, come in.

[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.140]
What a surprise.

[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.600]
And look at that.

[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.740]
She's got an album.

[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.620]
She looks really desperate today.

[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.900]
Okay.

[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.000]
Laura, come right on in here.

[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.560]
Laura wants to give you a big hug and a kiss.

[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.380]
You don't mind that, too.

[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.720]
His wife's not to praise you about it.

[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.420]
That's okay.

[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.100]
By the way, notice how big that wedding ring is that he's wearing.

[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.860]
It's like a message.

[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.040]
Now, I'm talking about the ring.

[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.840]
Anyway, here's...

[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.180]
Here's...

[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.980]
Oh, here's...

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.760]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.740]
Did you hear what he just said?

[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.260]
Hi, Laura.

[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.660]
She said she doesn't care.

[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.420]
Look at her.

[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.300]
I was...

[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.400]
It's all made up to her.

[00:07:59.640 --> 00:07:59.640]

[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.820]
You look just like Tammy Fade today.

[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.500]
I think that's bad.

[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.600]
Well, close.

[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.640]
The mascara's running down her pupick.

[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.340]
It's incredible.

[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.240]
Down her way?

[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.020]
Down her thing.

[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.280]
Now, what are you going to sign her album?

[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.080]
This is great.

[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.920]
Forget the call.

[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.080]
I've got a few people on it.

[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.820]
But this is like history and a making.

[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.760]
Laura, you're right.

[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.020]
Laura, you're right.

[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:17.720]
Okay.

[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.080]
Historical and he's got the pen and he just...

[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.020]
Look at what he did with it.

[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.620]
It's incredible.

[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.380]
Look at her.

[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:24.860]
She...

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:24.860]

[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.200]
Now, don't say when you were...

[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.940]
See, that's what he's trying to break away from.

[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:28.840]
He wants to be...

[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.220]
No, he doesn't.

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.920]
I want to get that up.

[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.920]
He wants to be a 15 years old again.

[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.300]
No.

[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.060]
Yes.

[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.560]
Despite what a lot of people think,

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.500]
I am not embarrassed about my past.

[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.520]
I have to admit, though, I...

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.160]
It's a funny way that he put it, isn't it?

[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.480]
Yeah.

[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.700]
But I have to...

[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.740]
I have to admit that there wasn't a period of my...

[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.400]
In my life that I just...

[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.480]
Just regarded everything I did.

[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.980]
Because it was the very thing that was bringing me down on the gutter with my career.

[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.820]
You know, the denny ass and the goody-touchy things, you know.

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.800]
But that's what she loves.

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.360]
That's why I don't deny it anymore.

[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.160]
Because it was a big part of a lot of people's lives.

[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.680]
It got me to this point where I am now.

[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.060]
Although she said she would leave with you today at the end of the show.

[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.160]
We'll talk about that.

[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.940]
She'll make her sacrifice.

[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.080]
You got one?

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.740]
Scott is with you?

[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.580]
Oh, her boyfriend's here supervising.

[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:12.960]
Okay.

[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.140]
Boy is he ever.

[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.100]
But you dump him in two seconds, right?

[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.120]
Yeah.

[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.160]
Don't put her in that position.

[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.440]
She said, get lost, Scott.

[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.680]
She doesn't need a ride home.

[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.120]
Go ahead, I'm sorry.

[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:22.620]
Interrogate.

[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.400]
No, but I don't want to make fun of the past anymore.

[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.840]
I don't want to deny it.

[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.640]
I don't want to put it down.

[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.900]
Because, hey, there were some good songs in the 70s.

[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.220]
For the time, I mean, they certainly wouldn't hold up now.

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.900]
But I'm sure a lot of people would do it tonight.

[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.960]
That, for instance.

[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.240]
Yeah.

[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.740]
See, we got it all here.

[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.500]
We're already four.

[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.320]
On Dick Clark has a list of the best summer songs ever written.

[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.640]
And I think that's number 16 on his charts.

[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.080]
Did he say that to us when he called that day?

[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.100]
Somebody noticed?

[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.620]
He was pushing the hell out of that record.

[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.180]
Well, I get royalties on all that old stuff.

[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.140]
Okay.

[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.880]
We know how you guys work.

[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.600]
You're not playing again.

[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.700]
We get a full-course payback.

[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.360]
We can't play it.

[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.580]
You know, it's BMI and ask after it.

[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.500]
We're not asking in on it.

[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.080]
You bet you.

[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.140]
But, you know, somebody called a little while ago.

[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.820]
What is that?

[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.020]
Oh, it's Jays.

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.300]
I get so panicky when those beepers go off.

[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.380]
Listen to that.

[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:08.780]
Tea, please.

[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.540]
Must be Joey Reynolds.

[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.060]
Anyway, somebody made an interesting point about it.

[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.060]
Who is this ugly Joey Reynolds guy?

[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.740]
Oh, geez.

[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.160]
He ugly?

[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.180]
I don't know him.

[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.220]
But everybody's calling him.

[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:17.540]
You don't know him?

[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.880]
You don't know Joey Reynolds?

[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.340]
I don't mind.

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.780]
He's got a midday job.

[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.080]
Well, it's pretty weak.

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.800]
He used to be the monster.

[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.340]
Like, when I was a kid growing up about 80 years ago in Buffalo,

[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.220]
he was on a radio.

[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.680]
He was a giant in the industry.

[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.060]
Maybe I know his face, but I know.

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.700]
And I know.

[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.280]
You don't want to know his face, okay?

[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.360]
But anyway, somebody made the point that Michael Jackson started out like his little

[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.480]
Pipsqueak in the Jackson Five and all those pre-pubescent records.

[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.340]
And his career has gone steadily, although you haven't had any plastic surgery,

[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.220]
which may be part of it.

[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.780]
But it's gone along without any interruption.

[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.840]
And he's got, I don't know.

[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.340]
Does he have the same following or a different following?

[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:53.720]
No.

[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.320]
Michael took a different route.

[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.560]
Who's to say what happened?

[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.300]
I mean, I don't really know.

[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.980]
I think television had a lot to do with it.

[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.620]
But as big as it was for Donnie Osmond, and Rodonium Ries, I should say,

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.300]
it kills a record career.

[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.880]
And there's something about television that is almost very plastic.

[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.420]
And it's fake.

[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.820]
He did see Joey show.

[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:13.460]
You see that?

[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.240]
Particularly variety, you know.

[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:15.680]
Okay.

[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.420]
Variety, it worked for the time.

[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.180]
Well, there is no more for us.

[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.940]
It doesn't work nowadays because it is very plastic.

[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.500]
And people are not so naive anymore.

[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.020]
And they know what goes on behind the scenes, what goes on behind the camera.

[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.400]
And you can't fake them out anymore.

[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.560]
So it's not so goody, goody, and everything is so perfect.

[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.380]
Because we're not living in a perfect world.

[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.360]
You know, nobody's that goody, goody.

[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.240]
And that's a lot.

[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.660]
Well, even when you were doing those shows, you weren't that goody, goody.

[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.720]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.080]
Right?

[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:41.680]

[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.040]
The show had a certain format that had to stay that way.

[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.660]
Because we were getting the ratings, and we were locked into a format, Neil,

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.400]
that gave us that very good clean cut wholesome image.

[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.320]
Now, mind you, I wasn't in the drugs or that whole type of scene.

[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.420]
So if you want to call that goody, goody, then I'm goody, goody, goody.

[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:02.480]

[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:02.900]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody, I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:02.900]

[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.340]

[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:03.420]

[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:03.960]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.380]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:04.780]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.720]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.080]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.800]
I'm a goody.

[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:23.800]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.560]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.120]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.360]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.380]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:27.520]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.520]

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.640]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.200]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.420]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:29.420]

[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.960]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.060]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.660]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:43.980]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:53.780]
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.

[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.600]
I don't know, but Donnie, I was going to seem to have this boy in a bubble.

[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.260]
A type of image for so long that he could do no wrong.

[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.480]
He's so perfect and going to give boy next door.

[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.000]
Well, have you got any video cassettes like Rob Lone?

[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.400]
Now, that could do a lot.

[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:08.420]
No.

[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.760]
I'm not proud of the fact that I don't have any Rob Lone cassettes.

[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:11.200]
I don't think he helps them, yeah.

[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:12.740]
I don't know.

[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.980]
I'm going to disagree with you on that one.

[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.540]
You think you could do.

[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.040]
You bet you.

[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.780]
And that's a sad scenario on society nowadays is because,

[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:19.940]
we'll look at Vanessa Williams.

[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.740]
Okay, there's another good example.

[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.640]
How controversy helps.

[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.840]
It's a matter of fact, Patrick Leonard.

[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.540]
I believe that's his name.

[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.400]
He produced Madonna's material.

[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.820]
He came up with a quote, got back to me through a friend of mine.

[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.080]
My music director is a matter of fact.

[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.900]
He said, controversy sales.

[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.960]
If you can be controversial nowadays, people will buy your material.

[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.260]
You'll get press.

[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.320]
And the more press you get, the more popular you'll be.

[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.640]
I don't think about that on this show, maybe.

[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.500]
Well, it's true.

[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.500]
When you think about it, the more controversial you can be.

[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.780]
That's why these guys call up and they say what they say.

[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.420]
Because it causes talk.

[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.680]
It causes excitement.

[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.200]
What guys?

[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.300]
Well, you know, like a couple of the phone calls ago that you got.

[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.840]
Oh, you mean the ones calling here today?

[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.260]
Yeah.

[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.220]
Oh, we get that every day.

[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.000]
They just, they just have a little problem.

[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.240]
Yeah.

[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:08.960]
That's true.

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.440]
A little problem.

[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.120]
Very little problem.

[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.720]
No, I don't think so.

[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.460]
But we'll find out.

[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.340]
Okay, 1234 at WIOD.

[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.600]
When we get back, because, now I don't know how long you're going to stay.

[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.740]
I'll stay when I'm done until I'm done, I should say.

[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.640]
And then like, oh, and pizza lofts here.

[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.760]
So food is, we got pizza.

[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.280]
Yeah, we got anything you want.

[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.760]
I want to say, I mean, Laura's going to feed you.

[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.960]
If you're going to hand feed you, okay, it's going to be just obscene.

[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.000]
Look at this.

[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.440]
And you notice now, Jeff usually comes in alone.

[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.260]
But today he's got a lot of land.

[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.360]
Isn't that incredible?

[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.240]
Yeah, he's got, how you doing?

[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.160]
Calculate some pizza loft, bring it in.

[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.360]
What's in that box?

[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.440]
What's in that box?

[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.160]
T-shirts and all kinds of hazeriah.

[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:45.800]
Look at that.

[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.380]
Isn't that incredible?

[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.360]
And he must have heard that at every parent's, right?

[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:52.540]
Great.

[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.960]
Okay, so you're going to dish the food out.

[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.100]
I'll do a little break here while you're getting the food ready.

[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.740]
So now we figure that a way to make him stay.

[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.460]
If you're looking for a great night of entertainment for your family,

[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.720]
call 38 at WIOD.

[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.200]
Okay, are we done?

[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.000]
The TV people don't see TV people.

[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.880]
Once they're doing stuff, the radio people are like,

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.320]
P.O.

[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.540]
Okay, they're just in radio.

[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.040]
You know, we're in the TV folks.

[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.920]
Anyway, Donnie is stuff-

[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.660]
Eating it is excellent.

[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.620]
Pizza loft is brought all the great stuff.

[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.320]
And we do eat on the air, okay, which is bad radio.

[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.680]
But we don't really give it to him, right?

[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.820]
What is that?

[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.180]
Are you giving him a GTR T-shirt?

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.440]
Great.

[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.200]
All right.

[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:27.940]
Great.

[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.820]
My thing, you'll be able to be dressed for a long time when you leave here,

[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.460]
man, you're leaving with all the good T-shirts from Pizza loft and GTR,

[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.320]
little pizza there.

[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.040]
What is that, Calzone?

[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.240]
Calzone?

[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.920]
Geez, just incredible.

[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.600]
It's the works.

[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.240]
Okay, so how's he up and doing?

[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.040]
It's doing great.

[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:41.980]
We're almost gold.

[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:42.740]
Great.

[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.160]
We're hoping that by time Christmas rolls around or the New Year rolls around.

[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.540]
Well, we're going to put you right over the edge.

[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.460]
The whole three day.

[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:48.840]
The whole three day.

[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.900]
And if people appreciate it.

[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.680]
If our people next door, GTR had any brains, they'd be playing it too.

[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.040]
But their numbers are dropping like a rock, and that's part of the reason, you know.

[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.520]
That's true.

[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.660]
I'm sure they appreciate you saying that.

[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.360]
Well, no, listen, this is the honest show.

[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:00.920]
Okay, it hurts.

[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.620]
And they're Scott and they're laughing.

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.420]
He knows it's true.

[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.240]
He knows they're searching for an audience desperately.

[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.380]
But once they start playing a good stuff,

[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.340]
they didn't even play the Roy Orbison record, right?

[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.040]
Which was number one AOR record in the country.

[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.660]
We were playing and we don't even play music on this show.

[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.600]
It seems as though people are very careful as to what they do.

[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.220]
Yeah, I mean, a lot of people are sheep in the business.

[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.260]
They always try to follow the trends and see what's going on rather than sticking their necks out and saying,

[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.300]
I like this.

[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.420]
Let's go for this.

[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.360]
And using their ears instead of statistics.

[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:31.120]
Yeah.

[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.840]
Well, they're using some part of their body over there.

[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.660]
I don't think it's their ears.

[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.300]
But anyway, I want to get a lot of these calls on.

[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.860]
And I want you to think that it's just we want all these young ladies to call it and gush over you.

[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.040]
But this is like for them, it's their whole life.

[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.820]
You do understand that.

[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.440]
It's like, he's like, I'm serious.

[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.780]
I don't know what you're laughing about.

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.480]
It's true like they're just foaming at them.

[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.500]
I like her. Look at her.

[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.580]
She's really usually looks very nice.

[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.480]
Today she looks, she's got enough makeup on to it.

[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.180]
Seriously, I don't understand you.

[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.420]
Give her a break.

[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.800]
No, she is.

[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.600]
She's attractive.

[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:01.320]
She's wonderful.

[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.260]
She's bubbly.

[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.240]
But today she looks like Alice ghostly.

[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.080]
She's got enough because you want to impress him.

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.580]
Isn't that true?

[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.460]
She looks nice to me.

[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.660]
Well, there you go.

[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.220]
So she did impress you.

[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.140]
No, but you see what I mean?

[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.220]
You came in like him.

[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.160]
He doesn't, he's got that crappy shirt on.

[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.120]
He doesn't come here to impress you.

[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.280]
He does.

[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.080]
He said it straight.

[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:20.400]
Yeah.

[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.920]
It looks like he got that a came art.

[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:23.240]
Okay.

[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.060]
You saw Rainman.

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.460]
This was a very expensive shirt.

[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:25.840]
Rainman.

[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.200]
You sure it's my new deal.

[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.160]
And you saw, you heard what Raymond said.

[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.080]
He said, came art sucks.

[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:30.580]
Okay.

[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.320]
Well, that's right.

[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.820]
Now, he goes and buys it.

[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.640]
Like probably he wasn't.

[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.520]
This is not a came art shirt.

[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.240]
Oh, it's not a came art shirt.

[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.200]
Where did you get it?

[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:37.680]
It's called.

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.780]
Don't tell me absurd.

[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.900]
No, is it?

[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.380]
Get it a target.

[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.320]
Yeah.

[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.160]
No, I can't imagine.

[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.720]
He was shot with 10 pages.

[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.380]
At the mall in Detroit, where are Detroit?

[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.000]
Southland.

[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.460]
Westland.

[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.100]
No, it was Eastland.

[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.340]
No, I can't imagine.

[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:53.920]
Okay, it started with an L.

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.840]
You were just in Detroit?

[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.760]
Yeah, last night.

[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.660]
Because I was in this one.

[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.900]
I went to Michigan for 12 years.

[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.020]
Not that you care about that.

[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.040]
I went to a Lions game.

[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:00.580]
Yes, really?

[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.020]
Did you rent the game yesterday?

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:02.960]
The ones with the Browns?

[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.520]
Great game.

[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.440]
13 to 10.

[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.280]
You believe that in a section at the very end?

[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.180]
I thought it was a good idea.

[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.180]

[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.600]
I thought he scored on it playing.

[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.040]
We were dead.

[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.420]
He did.

[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:09.880]
He did.

[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.400]
He didn't count.

[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.780]
Oh, it didn't count?

[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.240]
No.

[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.820]
Because it was already 13 to 10 and that was the final score.

[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.720]
What do they call it back?

[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.180]
Does anybody know?

[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:17.920]
They didn't count the touchdowns.

[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.080]
Look at the looks I'm getting like.

[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:19.720]
We don't know.

[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.060]
We don't know nothing about football.

[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.180]
That must be your crowd.

[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.360]
Well, you have the phone calls.

[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:23.980]
Oh, well.

[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.040]
That was a good idea.

[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:25.880]
Sorry.

[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.740]
The way the Lions won, which is very rare, by the way.

[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.680]
Okay, who's that on the bat line?

[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.980]
Is that another inside call?

[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.260]
Or is he doing another deal with Joey?

[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.780]
I think you've had a lady holding for an hour and 15 minutes.

[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.720]
Okay, let's get her right on.

[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.080]
Okay, are you anxious to speak to her?

[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.260]
Well, for a lady's been holding an hour.

[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:39.720]
Hello.

[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.500]
Hi.

[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.880]
Hi, this is your big chance.

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.520]
Okay.

[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.360]
Who is this?

[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:43.960]
This is Denise.

[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:44.660]
Hi, Denise.

[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.220]
How you doing?

[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:45.820]
A fine thing.

[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:46.380]
How are you?

[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:46.660]
Great.

[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.300]
Where are you going from?

[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.880]
I'm calling from North Miami.

[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:49.980]
North Miami.

[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.440]
You've been holding for how long?

[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.840]
I guess about an hour and 15 minutes, an hour and 20 minutes.

[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:55.800]
Showing you, Neil.

[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:56.920]
Denise, is it?

[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:57.480]
Yes, please.

[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.300]
What have you been holding?

[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.160]
And Sister Joke, Denise.

[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.260]
Don't answer the question.

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.100]
I've been with the Anavir now for about 15, 16 years though.

[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.880]
And this is the first time I get to talk to you.

[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.160]
I think I'll pull up your concerts, but I've never been fortunate enough to meet you though.

[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.080]
Well, it's nice to talk to you, Lisa, with the phone.

[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:13.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:15.840]
You lived in Florida all your life?

[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.060]
No, I'm originally from New York.

[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.260]
I went to school in California and...

[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.520]
What part of California?

[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.240]
Malibu.

[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:22.960]
Oh, okay.

[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.220]
Yeah, it was really nice over there.

[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.940]
But anyway, did you have a nice Thanksgiving yesterday?

[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.420]
I did.

[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:34.920]
As I was telling Neil and Glenn, I went to a Lions game in Detroit and had a little turkey dinner in the whole bit.

[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.280]
It was kind of fun with my wife and my little boy.

[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.220]
What about your other boy?

[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.600]
They're back in Los Angeles.

[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.080]
I flew them out earlier on the tour separately.

[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.440]
And they joined me and watched what I do.

[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.600]
Is that your little boy in there?

[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.440]
Yeah, I say your little boy?

[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.400]
Are you serious?

[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.240]
He looks just like Jimmy.

[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:50.980]
Really?

[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.020]
How old is he, Donnie?

[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:53.220]
Four.

[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:53.740]
Four?

[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.080]
Yeah.

[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.000]
Doesn't he look a little like Jimmy?

[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.600]
Little.

[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.620]
Yeah, he does.

[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.000]
Not Jimmy Osman, Jimmy Carter.

[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.220]
He's eating pizza.

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.660]
Wouldn't that be something his son will grow up to be president someday?

[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.140]
Then he won't have to worry about all this crap.

[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.120]
He's like, go ahead, Donnie.

[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:08.520]
I'm sorry.

[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.500]
I'm taking up your time with all this bad material.

[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.040]
That's okay.

[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.060]
How old are your boys now?

[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.180]
Well, I tell you.

[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.760]
I'm not going to talk about that too much because that's my private life.

[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.760]
And I try to keep that as private as possible.

[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.860]
So, they're just normal kids.

[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.100]
In other words, in his normal life.

[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.780]
In his business, Denise.

[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.340]
That's okay.

[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.980]
I like he's paying no attention to this.

[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.840]
He's just eating pizza.

[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.600]
I like that.

[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.060]
You bet.

[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.540]
Normal lifestyle.

[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.120]
Let me ask you about your tour.

[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.960]
Then, how much longer do you have with your tour?

[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.100]
About another month, three weeks or so, something like that.

[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.060]
We end up in Los Angeles.

[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:50.200]
We're going to hit New York here next week and then work our way west until we hit Los Angeles.

[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:50.980]
And that's the last show.

[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.240]
Are you planning another album soon?

[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.480]
Well, I'm going to jump into that in January.

[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.900]
I don't know exactly when I want to release it because I'm going to take my time.

[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:10.140]
See, I'm in a critical position in my career right now because this next album, if it's anywhere near a very poppy, formulated album, my career is over.

[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.680]
Because I've gotten the attention of the industry now with this album.

[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.440]
It was an interesting story to be told with what everybody's referring to as a comeback.

[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.620]
I'd like to refer to it as a resurgence more.

[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:27.960]
But I'm going to make sure that the quality of this next album is good, straight rock and roll.

[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.020]
Real strong material.

[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.180]
I'm not going to tour a lot next year.

[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:37.320]
I'm going to just stay in the studio and really work hard on the album because I think too many bands make the mistake of touring too much.

[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.240]
And then the second album is doing, they'll say, well, let's go in the studio and hurry and rush this album out.

[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.400]
And it suffers.

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.280]
So I'm going to take my time with it.

[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.860]
Are you planning to write any of the material for the next album?

[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.280]
Oh, yes.

[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:48.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:49.180]
Great.

In fact, I've started.

Yeah.

What about TV?

[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.580]
Do you plan to do any of that?

[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.180]
Nope.

How about acting?

[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.520]
Do you plan to do any of that as far as, like, maybe movies?

[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.440]
Well, here again, you know, if I'm going to do that, I'm going to make sure that it's good.
