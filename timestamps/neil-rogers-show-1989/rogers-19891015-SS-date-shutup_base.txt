[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580]
The time-breaking poses. It's 12-0-8 at WIOD. Let's try Bokka on the Palm Beach line.

[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.360]
Oh, there is somebody there. Yes.

[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.320]
Hi. How you doing?

[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.940]
Hello?

[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.160]
Yeah, how are you?

[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.820]
Hi, I just wanted to say I enjoy your show.

[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.300]
I want to also put in my two senses about the news media.

[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.220]
I feel that they create a lot of our problems that we have today

[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.600]
because they are so insensitive and the act like Barbie dolls.

[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.180]
They can possibly know what tragedy is to an individual.

[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.300]
And why I'm on is gone. I want to also say who is laughing?

[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.600]
This is laughing. You know, reminds me of a weasel.

[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.620]
Yeah, what we have.

[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.640]
I'll play him down. You know how you listen to someone and you try to

[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.160]
pick you what they look like.

[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600]
But the last just drives me crazy.

[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.820]
Well, that's the WIOD weasel as a matter of fact.

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.140]
Uh-huh. Is it real?

[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.520]
Yeah.

[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.620]
Okay. This thing came myself, Harrison, talk to you for a moment.

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.480]
Oh, sure. No problem.

[00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.840]
Okay. Thank you. I enjoy the show.

[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.460]
Thank you.

[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.780]
For that.

[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.840]
Yes. He knows a lot about it. That's for sure.

[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.300]
Any meal?

[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.800]
Yeah.

[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.640]
A couple of something.

[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660]
Um, listen to you guys for a long time.

[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.480]
You guys are hilarious.

[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.800]
Yes, we are. We're a panic.

[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.300]
Really?

[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.940]
Would you explain to the other lady?

[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.760]
No, no, no.

[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.740]
Not go ahead. Don't.

[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.980]
Everything you got to make a big sentence.

[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.680]
She just hates your guts. Go ahead, sir.

[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.980]
God, what was Bernie going to say?

[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.900]
He wants to start a big argument with being in a way that he doesn't know.

[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.660]
I want to say I don't want to argue.

[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.580]
I just wanted to ask this nice man if he would explain to her who I am.

[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.560]
The weasel. That's it.

[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.420]
Well, you're a good sidekick, but you're awfully soft skinned.

[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.360]
I don't know how I asked him to.

[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.200]
Two still things.

[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.820]
I was.

[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.240]
I didn't try to keep you.

[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.940]
I mean, you were just going to ask.

[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.760]
Just shut up and let this guy go on.

[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.960]
You don't have a lot of time here.

[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.120]
We've got important stuff to do.

[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.060]
Oh, good.

[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.840]
I think the Clarks network had saved himself six digits by just getting an endless loop of words

[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.140]
to laugh and eating the orange areas on.

[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.380]
See, you had to start with this guy.

[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.040]
You didn't know when you were well off.

[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.060]
No, but Glenn, you're a great guy.

[00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.660]
You really are.

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.180]
I've been to a lot of your remotes.

[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.420]
It's the most recent where I went to was down at specs.

[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.880]
That's great.

[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.000]
It was. It was a great, it was a great remote.

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.300]
And I was down on the friend of mine who I'm going to call a douchebag in a second.

[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.060]
But one thing I couldn't believe was how tight you guys are with the food.

[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.240]
Well, we'll type with the food.

[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.340]
I mean, Matt Rich had to be surgically removed from the ice cream.

[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.940]
Yeah.

[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.880]
Fuck them.

[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.340]
Hell.

[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.520]
It's damn near kill them.

[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.520]
I like that that Rich got ripped too.

[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.060]
Yeah.

[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.000]
And if he thinks he lost 70 pounds, tell him I found him.

[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.540]
Okay, well listen, and closing.

[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.680]
No, one more thing.

[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.340]
Um, following closing.

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.460]
If I have to close now, we call Jen and Beave and Adam and Mike douchebags.

[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.040]
And we really love you guys.

[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.180]
But don't be so sensitive.

[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.060]
Be, huh?

[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.560]
Be.

[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.760]
Yeah, okay.

[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.000]
We get the message.

[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.800]
Have a great day.

[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.480]
It's the best deeper salesman in South America.

[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.200]
Have a great day.

[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.780]
Yeah.

[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.420]
So 11 after noon at WIID, I have a fax here with a map of broward parts of Broward County

[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.820]
here for Lauderdale.

[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.820]
And it says this is a street in for Lauderdale.

[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.600]
They have marked off there right on the ocean on for Lauderdale Beach.

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.500]
Beach front homes.

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.180]
There's only one in for Lauderdale.

[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.420]
No blue hair is mostly rich bags.

[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.240]
Wow, I better check it out.

[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.240]
Huh?

[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.920]
Okay, let's do a little business here.

[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.940]
Some very important business because we wanted to talk about it.
