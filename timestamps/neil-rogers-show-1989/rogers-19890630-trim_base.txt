[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:08.520]
Yeah, it's very little bit. Yeah. I was just back this past weekend to move back in Miami.

[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:17.380]
As you know, it was raining all weekend. Oh sure. I don't know why, but many years ago, a friend of mine turned me on to it.

[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.720]
And the first place I ever had Thai food was at the original Thai house in Hyalia.

[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.760]
I just I flipped over it. I just it was just perfect for me. I just liked everything about it.

[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.720]
And I've eaten it ever since. Have you gone to any place other than Kaya Orkut in Miami?

[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.920]
Oh sure. Oh yeah. I've eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants in Miami.

[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.000]
And yeah, I like a lot of them. I live in South Miami. I'm in Lodis room. Bangkok in Bangkok City.

[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.960]
Of course, Thai house too up in North Miami. There's a lot. Sure.

[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.500]
Okay. You would go crazy here because the first two weeks I was here, I hit seven Thai restaurants.

[00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.980]
But they're big out there too, huh? They're real big out here.

[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.180]
Really? Does they're real popular down here?

[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.120]
Oh yeah. And my brother and I I'm sure win is listening right now. We go to Kaya Orkut. Not as much as you do.

[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.160]
Oh, it's right by my house.

[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.840]
Oh, I know. I was wondering if Toy brought you anything back from Thailand when she came back.

[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.820]
She absolutely did. And I should think her publicly. She brought me back a pajamas.

[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.100]
Like oriental pajamas. They're like silk.

[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.400]
I'm jealous. You only taught me a shirt.

[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.820]
Yeah, you should be jealous. Was that nice?

[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.700]
That was nice. That was real nice.

[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.280]
Like there's oriental pajamas, which you just can't get here.

[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.860]
Yeah. I love them.

[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.440]
Toy is such a nice lady.

[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.640]
Absolutely. All the oriental people are so nice.

[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.220]
I agree. I agree.

[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.720]
And even that the people out here, not only the Thai people, but everybody, you know, they walk by and they say hello to you.

[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.160]
Yeah. You walk in front of their car and they stop and let you pass.

[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.320]
Right. Like, booing up at the Siam Dal is just like the nicest person and he's brought me a lot of presents also.

[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.320]
Yeah. They're just the most gracious people I've ever met.

[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.140]
Yeah. It's unbelievable. And even when they fight and they fight in their native language, it doesn't sound that bad, you know.

[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.320]
It doesn't sound like they're fighting.

[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.120]
And they don't fight that often. Yeah.

[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.400]
Great. Well, I just wanted to call and say hello.

[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.380]
Well, I'm glad you did.

[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.680]
And I probably will be back in a couple of weeks.

[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.480]
Okay.

[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.900]
Maybe I'll give you a call next week.

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.180]
Okay. Thanks, Glenn.

[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.540]
Okay. There it is. A call from Seattle.

[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.740]
Stephen Neal's gone. We still keep, you know, that stuff continues.

[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.200]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.740]
Hello.

[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.420]
Hey.

[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.680]
Yes. I'm Gwen.

[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.080]
Yeah.

[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.580]
Just wanted to put on a good word for the great city of Lakemont.

[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.000]
I know you take a lot of bus.

[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.600]
From your cohort over there.

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.740]
Well, some people don't understand, you know.

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.180]
They've like just been through it. They really don't get it. You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.660]
Oh, I understand 100%. I get it all the time from my friends.

[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.200]
I went to school up there at Fort Lauderdale.

[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.680]
Did you? And they call in sort of.

[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.020]
Yeah, they call in sort of thousand.

[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.120]
I was wondering if you'd ever darken the doors of any of the, uh,

[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.920]
the drinking establishment in town there, such as maybe a Zimz on South Florida or, uh,

[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.300]
Calc out corners.

[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.520]
Uh, Calc out corner. I have been to, uh, that's on Main Street.

[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.880]
Great place.

[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.900]
Yeah. Great place.

[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.260]
Someone I went to high school with parents on the Calc out corner.

[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.940]
So I used to go there and of course the, uh,

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.840]
XYZ Lounge.

[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.020]
Famous.

[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.560]
We used to call it the XYZ.

[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.340]
That's famous.

[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.880]
Um, the great place.

[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.880]
Also, there's a great place.

[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.300]
How are they in, uh, in South?

[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.340]
That's not far to have.

[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.960]
And it was good.

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.340]
Yeah.

[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.760]
Yeah.

[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.780]
Yeah.

[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.540]
Well, I had that new place down at Lake Christina too, which was good.

[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.560]
Well, I'm not a big drinker, but I have, you know, certainly been to the places.

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.880]
Well, I'm not here, but those are the places we used to go to college.

[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.240]

[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.400]
One other thing I wanted to put in one comment about yesterday's show.

[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.020]
You know, no apology.

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.020]
I needed.

[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.740]
But, uh,

[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.900]
that's really big guy.

[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.560]
A caller told in and suggested our dense, the guest right of the ass.

[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.780]
And if he was the US citizen and the guy was pretty much dictating the way we should handle terrorists in this country.

[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.600]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.420]
And I think the man really had no right to express his opinion.

[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.140]
Yeah.

[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.000]
Wasn't it, wasn't it, uh, terrorism isn't so bad, isn't it?

[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.020]
That's what we were told, I think they were going to talk to him.

[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.860]
Absolutely.

[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.400]
That's not that steam, oh boy.

[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.400]
I don't know where, you know, Neil says the same thing.

[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.980]
Where does he get these people?

[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.340]
A total buffoon right now.

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.220]
I've seen any worse radio in my life when the station I listen every day and that.

[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.580]
Mm-hmm.

[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.840]
Well, I don't know.

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.840]

[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.000]
Well, we did tell him Neil and I both.

[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.480]
Yeah.

[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.200]
Well, I hope they have a big, clean, direct up.

[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.740]
Me too.

[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.080]
Well, as I understand it, the stevo insisted on Felipe.

[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.480]
So there you go.

[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.020]
So.

[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.620]
That's a disappointing.

[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.120]
Yeah.

[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.360]
Well, when he comes back, you know, I hope he hears about it.

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.180]
Well, if I can get through, I'll certainly have to.

[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.380]
Okay.

[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.360]
Listen, thanks a lot.

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.840]
Okay.

[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.800]
All right.

[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.080]
Okay. It's 11.34.

[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.560]
We have a call from Boca.

[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.620]
We'll take that before the break.

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.160]
They're so rare.

[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.860]
Hello.

[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.140]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.400]
You know, the heel plan.

[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.940]
Yeah.

[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.900]
Very.

[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.900]
Yeah, hi, Barry.

[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.140]
What did Neil's mom think of Steve ripping everybody in terror chills since she lives there?

[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.840]
You know, he didn't talk about it much, you know.

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.800]
And I didn't talk to mother Rogers about the situation.

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.520]
But, uh, so I really don't know.

[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.760]
You know, Neil just said she just said, well, little dogs bark a lot.

[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.860]
So I guess that's about all he kept saying that she said.

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.140]
You see any good movies lately?

[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.480]
Um, good movies lately.

[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.780]
I don't go out to them as much as I used to, of course, Barry.

[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.360]
I've kind of gotten out of that whole scene.

[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.660]
Have you seen any good movies lately?

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.840]
Well, it poets society is real good.

[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.560]
That's why everybody says it's that.

[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.380]
That's the best round.

[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.640]
There's another little sleeper that's out in some of the theaters called Miracle Mile.

[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.920]
It's about nuclear war and it's an excellent film.

[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.360]
Really?

[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.780]
Other than that, all the big ones are, uh, yeah.

[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.360]
Or the big blockplusters are more of a bomb than anything else.

[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.540]
Well, when I was a movie critic, I was, of course, a movie critic for seven years.

[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.060]
And Summer was my least favorite time of the year.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.540]
You're right.

[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.440]
You're right.

[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.080]
All the kids.

[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.140]
You're a couple of good ones out there.

[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.660]
You gotta just...

[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.780]
Always. You know, they're always like one or two decent and the rest is just, you know, they use your fluff.

[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.420]
Right.

[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.700]
Hang in there. It's glad to hear you on the air by yourself for a while.

[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.940]
You deserve your own show.

[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.180]
Well, I don't want my own show, Barry.

[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.300]
But thanks for the kind words.

[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.880]
It's nice to hear your voice on the air.

[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.920]
Well, it's rare that I get a call in, you know.

[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.540]
But we'll be going away next week.

[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.680]
So I wish you luck and catch you when I get back.

[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.280]
Okay, Barry.

[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.960]
Good talk to you.

[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.380]
There he goes. Very Epstein, boy.

[00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.560]
The voice is you here today.

[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.120]
This is a stounding incident.

[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.840]
All right. Let's do the break and then we'll continue with these unbelievable phone calls.

[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.880]
I know what we'll do with the golf game.

[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.720]
We'll play the golf game when Jeff brings his lunch.

[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.720]
Jeff's bringing his lunch from the pizza lot.

[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.320]
So that's when we'll play the golf game.

[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.300]
And that'll be in the...

[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.760]
Because it's like over three and a half minutes long.

[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.740]
It's like 346 or something like that.

[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.300]
Okay, it's 1139 right now.

[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.380]
And the neo-Rodges show, neo is on vacation.

[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.040]
This is first day of vacation.

[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.820]
And these phone calls have you noticed different voices?

[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.680]
I mean, extremely different voices.

[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.980]
Well, you know, Dave. Hello, Miami.

[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.040]
Hello.

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.660]
Hi.

[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.480]
Talking to me?

[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.020]
Yeah.

[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.140]
Hey, bird.

[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.520]
Different voice. Yeah.

[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.580]
I've been listening to you a neo-Rodges for years.

[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.240]
Have you?

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.060]
Yeah.

[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.800]
And I've never called.

[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.160]
Like I said, different voices.

[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.540]
Now, let me put them, give you a little background on me and whatnot.

[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.320]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.960]
If I may.

[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:19.640]
Okay.

[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.800]
Steve, Steve came to reserve the location.

[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.900]
Now, um, different voices.

[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.080]
Yeah, but that's just a little too different.

[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.140]
I mean, it's a little early, don't you think?

[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.440]
For, uh, for that, let's go to Miami. Hello.

[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.560]
Bird.

[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.400]
Yeah, hi.

[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.620]
What happened to Gabby yesterday?

[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.000]
Well, you know, I saw that in the paper this morning.

[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.300]
And it's amazing I made it to work, you know.

[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.760]
Gabby got defeated.

[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.960]
She's had a bad year.

[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.520]
I don't know what happened.

[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.980]
And I, uh, I don't want to go into...

[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.280]
I'm bored.

[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.600]
The audience about the tennis.

[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.040]
Yeah.

[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.680]
Because I don't go on and on about it.

[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.940]
But, uh, she was doing so great.

[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.400]
You know, she would always get to, like, the last, the, the finals match.

[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.840]
I don't know what it is.

[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.940]
I don't know what happened.

[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.980]
But I think you better brush up the needle, but he was really coming down on the other day.

[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:16.000]
About, uh, just, it, it, it, it, it, it being his show and everything.

[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.080]
Oh, man.

[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.440]
That's just part of the show.

[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.260]
I think she called the Goon Hill Show this week.

[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:21.400]
No.

[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.420]
Well, we love to hear Young Neal down here in Miami.

[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.020]
Okay.

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.040]
Uh...

[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.660]
I'm going to tell you.

[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.340]
Okay.

[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.620]
Let me, uh, see if we got Young Neal.

[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.920]
Because we could do that one too.

[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.380]
I didn't even think about Young Neal.

[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.220]
You know, that's a, that's another tradition that we play.

[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.200]
Let's see here.

[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.940]
Young Neal.

[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.420]
Well, boy, this, you know, we got more...

[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.260]
Oh, here's Jeff.

[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.620]
Jeff is here with lunch.

[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.500]
How you doing, Jeff?

[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.740]
Boy, what a way to start our, uh, couple of weeks, uh, vacation.

[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.860]
You know, Jeff came from Pizza Lock.

[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.140]
He didn't go crazy today.

[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.100]
It looks like, you know, sometimes you, uh,

[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.100]
go look...

[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.100]
Yeah, I'm here alone and, uh...

[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.060]
Oh my.

[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.300]
Cheesecake.

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:03.560]

[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.340]
What?

[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.680]
Pizza Lock.

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.600]
You're a flagler.

[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.560]
Right off the pometo.

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.380]
Jeff of course feeds us all the time.

[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.300]
Oh my god.

[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.220]
Look at this.

[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.300]
Cheesecake.

[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.080]
But, Jeff, I'm, you know, I'm all alone.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080]

[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.840]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.460]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:30.800]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:30.800]

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:30.800]

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:30.800]

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:30.800]

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:30.800]

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:30.900]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:30.920]

[00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.480]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.520]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:32.880]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:33.040]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.440]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.560]

[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:39.940]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.740]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:42.500]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.220]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.800]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.780]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:46.520]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.460]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.760]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.340]
I'm all alone.

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.340]

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.340]

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.340]

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.340]

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:54.340]

[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.680]
so, and we can eat while we play the young Neil.

[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:56.900]

[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:56.900]

[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.560]
I don't see it.

[00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.180]
Jeff this cart-rack.

[00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.280]
Jeff this cart-rack.

[00:10:59.280 --> 00:10:59.420]
Jeff this cart-rack.

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.460]
I mean, I mean, I have a job ahead of me.

[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:01.780]
what I mean.

[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:01.920]
What I mean.

[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.120]
I do this every time the oh goes on vacation.

[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.120]

[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.200]
vacation.

[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.820]
We alphabetized the cart-rack, you know.

[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.420]
But, look what I did find.

[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.420]
let's wait a minute.

[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.300]
But you know, while I was organizing the cart rack, I did find this

[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.500]
But I can't find you on me. Oh

[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:25.280]
Yeah, seven up great. Thank you. So we do have our lunch and little pizzas. That what you have there?

[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.980]
I can't find young you all but we do have

[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.880]
This and we have time to play this right now while I start eating

[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.300]
Our little early lunch today

[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:42.860]
Robber

[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.000]
Clamp

[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:52.300]
Come to Neil Rogers. Oh, we want to thank Jeff for your sleep and the pizza lot for bringing this by lunch

[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.800]
He brought his pizza and all kinds of stuff and this incredible cheesecake

[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.660]
Which I'll try after we eat so let's take a break here

[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.160]
All the lines are lit up except Palm Beach of course, but you know, we don't expect you know

[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.300]
Don't get excited but every other line is lit so we have some interesting calls coming right up

[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.780]
Good. Are you doing today? Okay?

[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.220]
I'm called to often. I probably remember me a few months back. I was the

[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.460]
infamous Ranjara and Meso Felicia Cola. How could I forget?

[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.040]
Listen, yeah, I haven't called you in a while, but I was in Holland, they were a couple of weeks ago

[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.960]
Oh, my I saw something that really crossed my ass really

[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:36.360]
In Holland, yeah, really I was up by shoppers paradise and they had these anti-neil buttons

[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.480]
What?

[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.800]
It's a Neil button. What do they say they have like you know the ghost bus distinct? Oh?

[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.260]
Really?

[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.440]
No, buddy has ever told us that I have seen them

[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:51.780]
Incredible

[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.520]
Well, you know isn't that funny that they would feel that strongly

[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.340]
Well, you know, I don't blame because he rags on him pretty heavy don't he?

[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.840]
Neil are Neil

[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.760]
Yeah

[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.040]
You're right. They deserve every every and more don't you think I'd say well

[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.040]
I want to congratulate you for getting out of Howlandale. Oh, I'm glad I got out of the safely, you know, especially with them jumping out in front of your car

[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.380]
Okay, I have more ripping to do, but we have a mobile you know like I don't have a log

[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.860]
You know as soon as Neil leaves you know how he has to bitch on the air every day to get a lock

[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.020]
I know log, you know too much dance for mobile. I'm good. I'm the one

[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.720]
No, what's up? Yeah

[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.280]
I'm sorry sir. That's just that's incredible. That's unintelligible, but bird juniors here to save the day

[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.540]
Everything's fine

[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.160]
And here's Casey K some

[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.360]
Hi bird Neil Casey Casey. I heard that Neil's unbeach and I'd like to know if I could fill in

[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:17.840]
All right, I'm gonna do a little audition for you. I'll go ahead. Hi. This is Casey K some this week

[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.480]
I'm W. I.O.D

[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.320]
My friend

[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.540]
Steve K the man with an asshole larger than his own

[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:25.720]
My

[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:32.780]
Guests today will be Sam Kinesa the leader of Christians against Christ

[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.500]
Well now compare it to this we're up to our long distance

[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.220]
dedication and this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand

[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:51.100]
Whether we have kids or pets or neither it's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio and here's what he writes

[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:58.600]
Dear Casey this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll meet a lot if you play it

[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.020]
We thought there was a death in our family

[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:06.580]
He was a little dog named Snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of us come straight again

[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.180]
From coming out of the record play the record, okay

[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:11.960]
Please

[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.160]
You see when you come out of those up-tempo damn numbers man is impossible to make those transitions and then you got to go into somebody dying

[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.840]
You know they do this to me all the time. I don't know what the hell they do it for but damn it if we can't come out of a slow record

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.020]
I don't understand it is down on the phone

[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:39.600]
Okay, I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a thing up-tempo record every time I do a damn death dedication

[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.380]
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week

[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.180]
It's a god last damn time. I want somebody use a

[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.000]
Brain to not come out of a damn record

[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.500]
That is that's up-tempo and I got to talk about a

[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.780]
Dying

[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.840]
What is a pondorous man ponderous and ponderous

[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.240]
It's a

[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.980]
Now do you remember that one?

[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.520]
That's a little obscure here. Let's listen to this one

[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.360]
Boy this machine you know Neil's right. It doesn't have a mind of its own wait a minute

[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.140]
This is challenging

[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.460]
Nothing

[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:37.000]
There's nothing on that cut. How can that be wait a minute wait wait. Oh, I see I see. Okay. All right. How about this?

[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.860]
Well, we don't have time right now because we have you know I do it

[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.940]
This is already has been star studded here. It's only 1031 and look who's on the phone

[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.480]
It's Ed

[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.000]
I'm clocking everything here. What are you doing? I'm clocking your

[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.500]
Clocking every time I have my clock right here next to you. Tell you your clogging

[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.020]
Clocking clocking

[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.420]
Now Neil doesn't really understand it, but I know he doesn't speak English

[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.520]
But I sure understand it

[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.380]
Sure wait a minute I got to turn this down

[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.380]
Yeah, well listen Ed before you run off here

[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.780]
Can you answer a question for me?

[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.440]
If I can well, you know we had a report

[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.880]
I don't know we could go or so Ed that nice a couple days ago that Elvis was spotted up in Thunder Bay

[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.540]
I don't know if you're going up to Thunder Bay. I'm going to take a trip to Canada

[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.740]
There we am now do you really think you know? No, I know what it was it was a prediction

[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:02.380]
I'm not sure if you're correct. Yeah, and they said he was going to be spotted in Thunder Bay and he would be spotted by a TV

[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.500]
Yeah, who's gonna take so now you totally believe in this right? Oh, I don't know

[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.640]
I know I know

[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.720]
I know a lot of imitations out there. Yeah

[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.520]
Okay, well, I you know I wanted to I wanted to go to the source. I wanted to ask yeah

[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.620]
Well the fact that sound like doesn't necessarily mean I look like a

[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.620]
Call me Monday yet, okay?

[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.780]
We'll mention sugar apples. What's the difference between sugar apples and their regular apples?

[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:38.780]
Oh

[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:46.520]
Boy I tell you know Neil doesn't get it. He just doesn't get it, you know if if you if you I

[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.180]
Guess if you don't understand

[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:55.940]
Maybe very RFT the indie Griffith show you don't get it but I don't know my amy be chill

[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.120]
Are we coming up on a break? Oh?

[00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.940]
Yeah a couple minutes. Why?

[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:05.400]
Okay, so let me see a couple minutes. Yeah, I'm really enjoying the CD. Oh, yeah, and that wonderful

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.640]
That was great yesterday was fantastic. Yeah, yeah, that was that really it

[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:17.240]
Can you see him in your head like I was talking about on 32 so the majority of them I can see a couple of days

[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.440]
The dinosaurs TV USA is without a doubt before my time was it?

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.280]
Yes, Sunday night at nine o'clock. We used to all watch Ed Sullivan at eight

[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.460]
CBS on CBS and then we turn over to watch Dina

[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.280]
I Dina may have been on NBC. I can't remember but anyway, we turn over at nine

[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:39.520]
It was the Chevrolet hour Chevy bought the hour and she always ended with that song at the end and then she'd throw a big kiss

[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.160]
Mwah, you know, and it was like what everybody it was a

[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.280]
Every in the country knew about it, you know

[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:52.700]
What was the chronology of this CD? I mean does it have to say date because some of these seem newer the audio commercials fairly recent

[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.740]
Within the past ten years there's no dates on it

[00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:01.160]
I really haven't even because Neil played the show. I'm it really even figured out, you know, the the numbers

[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:06.820]
It's really tough finding their own musically oriented though. Yeah, there are no speaking commercials

[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.600]
I don't think so not really, you know, you'll hear a little of that

[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.780]
But basically no and we'll see they were all jingles back in that time. They really were as you can tell

[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:21.380]
That was what TV commercials were, you know, the audio port was a song

[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:27.200]
It now results originally a little speedy. Yeah, with every jingle. Yeah, mm-hmm

[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.720]
I got that here somewhere. I just have to figure it out and how to find it, but

[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.960]
The ones that they let's see the what so let me try this one now here

[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.620]
Like this one for example

[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.660]
See if you can hear now this

[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.800]
See I'm having trouble wait a minute

[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.920]
I'm having trouble working this. Let's see if this

[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:54.340]
You remember this? Yeah, I'm out of country. Yeah

[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.700]
You can take sale on all the country

[00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.760]
You can take the country out of

[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:07.540]
Unbelievable now that's really a whole genre of commercial gun that's now gone the cigarette commercial. Oh sure

[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:14.460]
Yeah, it's gone truthfully. Yeah, I'll probably some more of those like the Winston and all because we just grew up with those when we were kids

[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:20.140]
If I call next week and we discuss film for a couple minutes, absolutely. Oh, that's I made you a whole show next week

[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:27.440]
I'll film really maybe one you're not gonna have any guests. No, no, no, that's great. Yeah, okay. It'll be great one more thing

[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.100]
Yeah, what do you really think about Phoebe Kate and Kevin Klein? I mean, is that a marriage made in hell?

[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.200]
Well, I think he's too old for her. I don't understand it. Well, she seems to really love him though

[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.880]
They've been together for a long time. You know, they would they lived together for several years before they got married

[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:48.100]
And there wasn't even a baby they didn't see you know, so obviously she really does truly love him

[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.420]
So God bless him. You know what I mean? I know what you mean, but I recovered. I hope you do

[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.540]
Excellent questions this morning on the Neil Rogers show with the bird at 1036

[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.100]
We're gonna take a break and then we will continue with these unbelievable phone calls

[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.600]
Yeah

[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.220]
By your day gets a call

[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.480]
Well, that was on the on the ball games a lot, but Roger brought me the TV

[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.380]
The what's the dictionary to prime time TV and I was correct

[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:41.840]
Sunday night Ed Sullivan was on at 8 o'clock on CBS and Diana the dinosaur Chevy shows officially what it was called was on at 9 o'clock

[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.260]
Now when I was kid this is 1957. I'm looking at I was nine years old and

[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:54.960]
What Ed Sullivan I call it to the state the Ed Sullivan syndrome whenever the Ed Sullivan show came on well that meant

[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.180]
school tomorrow morning. That's what that meant it tomorrow morning was

[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.140]
School so I always refer to that as the Ed Sullivan syndrome now

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:10.460]
I remember even younger like and let's see if it was on like in the mid 50s when I was even younger

[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:16.900]
Yeah, 55 Lansing at seven o'clock now I had to be home on Sunday night when I was you know

[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:23.840]
Seven eight years old I had to be home to see Lansing and then last year was a half hour than Jack Benny came on

[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.520]
Then Ed Sullivan and then later. Let's see in

[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.520]
57 then Diana Shore came on it's incredible to look at this because I remember

[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.800]
Watching these shows I love Lucy was on Wednesday night at 7 30

[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.560]
Phil Silver Shovel the one I was going to leave it to beaver

[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.440]
Friday nights on CBS

[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.040]
At 7 30 now this is something else kids today don't remember today television

[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.020]
Prime time television starts at 8 o'clock. It used to be 7 30

[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:05.340]
Remember back in the 50s. It was 7 30. That's when prime time television started. Okay, so anyway what what you remember is

[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.260]
Back in that time, you know, wait a minute

[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.000]
This CD is a trip I have to admit it anyway back in that time

[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.580]
Nancy, I don't know how Neil does it. I'm serious. I don't know how

[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.740]

[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.680]
Yeah, I see what Neil was talking about you'll completely forget about the calls with this CD man

[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.660]
You get you get so into it, you know, and and I will continue to to play with this because I love this man

I'll do that in a few minutes. We're not even gonna have time today to do what I normally do

[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.340]
We'll do it next week

Alpha-tizing the cards and we'll go through the bitch, you know and play one from every letter

[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:46.180]
That's a traditionally started back at Zeta a bee takes a whole show, you know to get through the whole alphabet

[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:52.420]

And you want to know why we waited so long to call you why?

[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.140]
We waited for Neil to go on the case because we knew that he'd be sarcastic to us. Oh Neil

[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.800]
Well, see Neil doesn't understand you know what I'm saying. He just you can't you can't hold it against him

[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.900]
He just you know, he's just not into it. I understand

We love you. Well good and listen if you run into anybody that looks like PBK's give me a call, okay? I do

[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.260]

Hi

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.620]
I'm joking now. I'll let you know we have a lot of people coming in here a lot of pretty girls

[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.920]
And if I say anyone to look like TV all call you up. You'll be the first person to know

[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.220]

[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.200]
Remember that that's another one Neil just doesn't get I

[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.740]
Love that that's

[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.740]
That's poppin French

[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:03.440]
Wayne Arnold is on the hotline. No, he's how oh Wayne Arnold here comes a message

[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.580]

We're getting out of here early on the fourth of July Wayne

[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.920]
We're gonna be out of here at one o'clock for the ballgame

[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.740]
So that would be perfect because there's nothing open on the fourth is I we can't only Royal canceling us

[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.100]
They're open every day they never closed twenty-fours a three hundred sixty five days a year

[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.300]
And so we can't get any food on the fourth of July so that well Wayne that would be great

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.600]
So now we have we have more to look forward to on the fourth of July

[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.820]
So that would be great. We have a three-hour show now Steve was gonna do is flag burning show

[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:20.500]
Yeah, um Walt was like 1110 it was a daytime right I remember them and they were a great station

[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.060]
I mean that's what I grew up on they were a wonderful station. Why did they ever switch format?

[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:32.500]
You know, I don't know. A.M. Died eventually from music, you know, right and they just went the way but I you know

[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.840]
Bob Collins who's now of course in Chicago was at Walt. Nice start there

[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.560]
But he did mornings there for a while. I heard Bob Collins now when I was a kid say like 1960

[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.160]

[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.680]

So I got something for Mike and we'll do it right after this

[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.400]
Board Lauderdale. Hi

[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.620]
Hearing all the calls you've been getting I've been

[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.100]
Sitting here shuddering because I got some kind of I don't have reminiscing stuff to talk about

[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:11.020]
I was gonna tell you I've been waiting to tell you about this great new row and stupidity in Broward County

[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.920]
I came across in Broward in Broward is that possible?

[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.380]
It's possible. I was sitting in the lake waiting to make a left hand turn

[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.120]
Oh God and

[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:26.840]
a car or truck actually if I bet truck came rolling out of the

[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.980]
the left hand

[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:29.820]
cross

[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.620]
Road made a turn and something rolled off the back to guy kept on going

[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:40.220]
I looked over and they're sitting in the left hand South down lane with an engine block

[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.120]
Oh

[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:48.720]
Got to the best part. Uh-huh the right change and because I'm making a left hand turn I'm still sitting there

[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:57.060]
The guy in the left hand South down lane pulls up about two feet from the engine block and blows his horn

[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:07.900]
Now that's appropriate. Yeah, I was just like a maze. I said I thought just like you say about radio

[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.220]
Sometimes you think you 37 years old

[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:17.400]
You've seen it all you see it all. Yeah, nobody comes up and says no you haven't yeah, that's right happens all the time

[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.660]
Doesn't it? Yeah, well enjoy your term on the radio there bird and I'll be looking forward to

These brain surgeons here at IOD they got everybody gone on the same day

[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:36.480]
I think this this we should send this to the broadcast museum up in New York because I don't believe this

[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:43.200]
has ever happened in radio history which dates back to the 20s Hank Goldberg on sports talk tonight

[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.160]
Well, lucky and the Yankees at 7 30 this evening on 6 10 W IOD Henry Red

Okay, that's a new intro isn't it the

[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:24.540]
They put my name on there that's unbelievable. I think they put that together at the last minute. Okay, it's 11 o'clock

[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:24.940]
six

[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.080]
First hour of pretty good we had some really good calls is that incredible? So that's the thing with Neil

[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.900]
Is gone all these people that he will talk to call in and that's what I like so let's go

[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.660]
Let's go to another call where we wait for Phil's call. See who's on this line. Is this my weeb?

[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:48.540]
Yes, it is. Hi good morning. Good morning. I was gonna compliment you on the lower decibels this morning

[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.280]
It's kind of a relief. I

[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.680]
Listen to your your program

[00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:00.760]
This past week because I'm doing a very boring job at the office. Uh-huh

[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:07.460]
I worked at a 50 watts petition in Lakewood about 15 years ago 50 what yeah, you know the

[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.720]
Son-up to sundown. Oh, one of those. Uh-huh

[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.260]
Yeah, I used to answer the phone and do the the log so it's been a kind of a treat

[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:22.520]
However, no one else has said it. I have to tell you yesterday after men's program set radio back 50 years. Why?

[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.240]
If there was so much yelling and screaming

[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.620]
Nobody could understand a word anyone was saying. What do you mean yelling and screaming? Not your program?

[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:31.180]

[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.280]
Oh, well there was so there always is some not like this

[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:47.640]
Now do you remember what what what made you turn it off anything specific the whole tone of it really?

[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:54.660]
Mostly the screaming no one would give anyone a chance to speak or to express themselves and the host

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.600]
I'm not sure who he was can it kept interrupting the guests

[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.900]
Which of course oh yes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I didn't hear that I heard about that

[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:10.000]
Yeah, yeah, that's that's the leap over Vera. That's what you're talking about. Yeah, I understand

[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.740]
interrupting the guest. Yeah, and you couldn't understand a word any other thing. I didn't listen to one

[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:21.520]
Second of that and I would like to say that publicly. We were embarrassed

[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:29.200]
That was that I will say it that was Steve Keynes insistence that they do that and we warned them we warned Sharon

[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.360]
Oh really well, we tried to tell him trust me. We tried

[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.240]
Yeah, but it was it was it was so distorted. I mean just everything

[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.460]
I mean the first program with the young woman who was supposed to be a feminist well

[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.320]
If it had been an English it might have been well, it was

[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.060]
always an English

[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.140]
I'm not even going to what

[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:57.000]
What she had to say about feminists especially when most of us were waiting for their decision from the Supreme Court

[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.200]
They come down and they put us back and I have to wonder it and Steve couldn't be back on Monday

[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.720]
But it's so weird you I only presents Neil Rogers and Glen Hill

[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:17.460]
Neil is taking the day off today Glen Hill is in to get in touch and talk call 751 W I OD and day

[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:24.020]
524 W I OD in Brothers or 6 5 5 and 278 W I OD in the Palm Beach

[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:30.780]
The opinions expressed by the host guests or colors are not necessarily those of the station now here's Glen Hill on

[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:36.960]
Newstalk Radio 610 W I OD what a newscast that was great that

[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.360]
For April all April everything you went to wasn't there what happened

[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:52.140]
You want to come in and give a rebuttal to that that was oh that's that's like a news person's nightmare

[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.280]
Did you notice every card?

[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.380]
Every actuality everything you went to

[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:04.600]
failed that's awfully that's like a yeah, that's like a news person's nightmare now a talk show host nightmare

[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:10.480]
We had the other day where the phone you know, it's just there the colors there you keep pushing off off off

[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:17.200]
And it's the guy still there and you know, it's a adder somebody this is a talk show nightmare

[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:24.120]
What Johnny dark is here ladies and gentlemen the infamous and just in time to eat

[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:29.160]

[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.120]
You know tell us I'm gonna tell you a story about aren't you?

[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:38.400]
I don't know the story behind that. Oh jeez don't you remember John if you go back way back

[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.420]
In the craniums of your brain when we were doing the show in Zeta

[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.280]
When he was on the case we did like on a six or eight shows

[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:55.280]
And we played the rack we played nothing but bits one show we played like all the bits

[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.120]
And you kept track of what the people were asking for

[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:06.980]
And as I recall you told that was the most requested bit oh was yeah, I didn't know if that's what you're referring to but

[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.540]
So it is a true story right? Yeah

[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.640]
I'd say boy. This is this is really something well now see if

[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.920]
Johnny see if you can remember this see if this brings back any memories

[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:41.860]
Well

[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.200]
I did

[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:54.480]
But this is ponderous. I mean we hated these commercials when they were out years ago and we hate them now ponderous ponderous

[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.760]

[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.580]
Just knew huh?

[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.960]
Okay, we're good. So maybe if stores don't have it yet. They'll have it soon

[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.240]
I would just keep going up, but I mean I know they're getting it

[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:15.380]
Okay, all right. Well, thanks a lot. No problem. Okay, and I

[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:21.020]
Viamily disagreed if this is pond and then nothing takes it off like no

[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.100]
This is a ponder is

[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.800]
Oh

[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.120]
από

[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.680]
Take it off

[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.020]
You need not leave us

[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.280]
Let me know

[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.800]
Made it came to tell you

[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.340]
You know, you're such a video junkie it's unbelievable

[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.320]
Isn't it?

[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.860]
And that's why you're so excited about this because you're a video junkie

[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.320]
But for those of us who ate television

[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.560]
vehemently

[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.600]
Are you glady, Kim?

[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:31.760]
We'll be right back

[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.520]
I wanna tell everybody what

[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.120]
What happened during that new scan?

[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.600]
She's very good looking

[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.300]
Of course she's good looking

[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.940]
I have incredible

[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.020]
Incredible taste, I don't make these things up

[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:47.100]
Oh, we have another car here

[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:47.940]
No, it's dead

[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.840]
Oh, we already did that one

[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:50.780]
Okay

[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.120]
Should we do the golf game?

[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.520]
Get that out of the way

[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:56.440]
Huh?

[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.760]
You should really say that

[00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:58.540]
Four

[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.860]
It's like the climax of the day

[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.140]
I told everybody to play at the sound

[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.260]
Okay, you did, I heard that I wanted to

[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.280]
I can save it for later in the hour

[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.720]
No, you have other stuff excited

[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.200]
Young Neil coming up

[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.820]
And my wife left town with the banana

[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.280]
I mean, we got more stuff

[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.400]
I can't even, we couldn't even do

[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]
I was gonna do the alphabet

[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.900]
Left to it next week

[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.460]
I don't know if we'll ever even get to these

[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.720]
No, we're so busy here

[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:26.800]
I was gonna do a bit, you know, from each one letter each

[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.180]
A, B, etc. takes the whole show

[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.100]
So we'll do that one day next week

[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:31.640]
Miami

[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:32.480]
Yes

[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:32.980]
Hi

[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.340]
Hi, my, Glenn

[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:34.660]
Yeah

[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.260]
I'll thank you

[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:37.360]
I've fallen once in a while

[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.420]
But it's trying to get me in during the week

[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:45.060]
I heard nobody call about the case program yesterday

[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.540]
Oh, I love these reports

[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.400]
Are these reports unbelievable?

[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.340]
I cannot understand

[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:55.080]
Why a station that has a rating in this station is

[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.740]
Which allows such a limited to be honest

[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.040]
A limited to very well chosen

[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.340]
A limited to

[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:06.600]
I thought the man was just going to become a rating maniac

[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.200]
Uh-huh

[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.380]
I listened to it for a few minutes and I couldn't stand it any longer

[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.340]
I turned it off

[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:16.600]
And I think your station lost a lot of listeners just a afternoon

[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.840]
Wouldn't be surprised, they lost me

[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.660]
I mean, it was...

[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.200]
I heard him ask a question

[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.840]
A par call then asked a question of the guess

[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.140]
They tried to answer

[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:31.440]
And this man became such a rating maniac

[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.920]
The guess couldn't even answer

[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.580]
I'm trying to hear what they're saying

[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.960]
And you can hear anything

[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.200]
And the next par agreed with just a position

[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:43.780]
And he's trying to everybody shut up

[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:44.960]
And listen to the call

[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.220]
Oh, gee

[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.080]
It was just outrageous

[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.880]
And this is the same man

[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.120]
They think it was this day's hero

[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.420]
At an article about him that he's not even a citizen

[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:56.080]
Right

[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.860]
And that he also has been involved in terrorist activity

[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.960]
Well, you know, his position

[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.740]
Terrorism is not so bad, you know

[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.440]
Oh, I know

[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:11.540]
And there's not enough argument on that other side of the issue for my money about pro-terrorism

[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.720]
Right, I mean...

[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.260]
Jesus

[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.100]
I can't understand it

[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:20.060]
But if they keep hiring people like this street

[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:23.880]
All right, you're going to have the same rating as the B.O.L.D

[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.860]
Correct, I couldn't agree more

[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.820]
I mean, it was just...

[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.180]
Steve Kane gets outrageous

[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:33.420]
And everybody knows that he's, you know, a jerk at times and a clown

[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:33.800]
No

[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.360]
But this man went beyond the limits of being outrageous

[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.620]
Oh, that sounds like it. I'm so glad I missed it, you know

[00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.420]
You should be very glad

[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:50.600]
I mean, he is really a disgrace to the Cuban community

[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.640]
When they have two artists people in this market

[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.500]
Like Stan Major, and World Colder

[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.560]
And they're great-worthy, different people

[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.540]
I don't want you to play like that here

[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.880]
And they hired this fanatic to get on there

[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.760]
It just...it's just you and my mind

[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.680]
I had to turn it off

[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.620]
I'm sure he was free

[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.480]
I'm sure they don't have to pay for it

[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.780]
All right, I'm sure they did

[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.200]
I was free, that was too high of a price for your station

[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.440]
I couldn't agree more, man

[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.840]
Well, thank you very much

[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.180]
And I'm really enjoying your program today

[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.440]
Then you're doing an excellent job

[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:25.160]
Well, I'm really glad you called up to say that, I appreciate it

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.260]
And have a nice day

[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:26.640]
You too

[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.420]
All right, boy

[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.960]
And like I said, it has nothing to do with us

[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.860]
We told them, we warned them, we told them exactly what was going to happen

[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.520]
And still, I apologize

[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:41.120]
When they show you after the A.O.K.

[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.760]
That's how strongly I feel about that

[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.020]
Oh, look at this, a rare, oh man

[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.060]
These are rare's hint-steed

[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.200]
It's a call from Palm Beach

[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:50.840]
Hello

[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.780]
Yes, good afternoon

[00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:52.240]
Hi

[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.720]
Oh, no, I'll tell you something

[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.880]
It's nice to have peace and quiet

[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.780]
Without Neil running his mouth all the time

[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.760]
But on a serious note, something's really bothering me

[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.860]
How does Batman paraphernalia mean?

[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:05.860]
Yeah, hi

[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.500]
Everywhere you go, you see Batman, Batman

[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.900]
I know, I could tell Barry Epstein had called earlier who's a film critic

[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.860]
And while I was a film critic, summer was my least favorite time

[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.780]
Because that's what you get, you get all this hype

[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.400]
All these kids movies, you know

[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.320]
My desire to go see Batman, you know

[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.380]
No, I saw the movie and it was good and ery

[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.360]
I'm not going to lie on a spend $12 on a hat or a sticker

[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.320]
I mean, that's what makes I think rare's at a lost start

[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.920]
And all those, excuse me, other steam's billboard movies

[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.000]
Unique, but they all got in time

[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.300]
To clam it down your throat with merchandise

[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.940]
Yeah, that's what it is

[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.560]
But to all those people out there who do buy Batman paraphernalia

[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.960]
And all the junk, you're wasting your money

[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.220]
Ghostbusters too, alright, thanks a lot

[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.520]
Yeah, the Ghostbusters, I think they have Ghostbusters

[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.920]
Glances when you go into that ridiculous McDonald's

[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.760]
Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs

[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.720]
What kind of kids eat on a hot dog?

[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.600]
The rest is eating kids, kids, you're my man, hot

[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.340]
Hot kids, kids, kids, you're my man, hot

[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.480]
Even kids with chicken pots

[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.180]
What? I don't understand why you playing commercials

[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.940]
Old ridiculous, we hated them then, we hate them now

[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.680]
Because, don't you understand

[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.480]
Before there was cable

[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:33.580]
The commercials, you know, we saw them in the 50s on TV as we grew up

[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.600]
Yeah, we used to watch them and we were sick of them that

[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.120]
And it's not that I'm trying to sell you anything

[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.500]
So you miss in the point, I'm not trying to sell you a damn thing

[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.220]
You know, some of these, not even in business

[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.900]
I know it's nostalgia and everything

[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.540]
But that's what it is, it's like playing the themes to the TV show

[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.160]
The old TV show is the same thing

[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.020]
And it's great

[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.500]
Oh, geez, man, I'd say like

[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.140]
The Broward line, are you in dear fuel?

[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.280]
I'm in, yes

[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.380]
Oh my

[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.920]
Like I said, different voices

[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.040]
Oh look, I just found young Neocaroleum

[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:10.640]
Alright

[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.640]
So we're gonna have that coming up

[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.140]
Alright, I'm waiting here at the golf game, I've never heard it

[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.300]
You never heard it?

[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.760]
I got it right here, I will

[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.300]
I'll tell you what, I'll play it well early in the 12 o'clock hour

[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:21.880]
Alright

[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.520]
Now this is gonna be exciting, you're gonna get to hear that finally

[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.020]
Alright, I've been waiting for it, I've been looking forward to it

[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:31.460]
For a long time, well Neal threw it out, Caroleum, and I got it back

[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:37.260]
I wanna thank Joe Johnson, one of our best listeners who furnished that to me

[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.600]
I'll take off the ear here

[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:40.600]
And I appreciate it, Joe

[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.960]
That's great, you've got a lot of great people that send you a lot of good stuff

[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.800]
Yeah, not the Joe Johnson at Magic, it's another Joe Johnson

[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.560]
And not the Joe Johnson that does step in out, right?

[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.540]
Right, there's so many of them

[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.900]
And just for you, later on in the show, I'm gonna play my wife left talent of banana

[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.080]
Oh thanks

[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:09.180]
I've got, you know, the reason I was calling, I can't believe that Mr. Disney has not been inundated with calls and letters

[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:09.780]
About?

[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.060]
Yesterday's show

[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:15.300]
Oh my God, well I don't know if he has or not, you know, there's so oblivious around here

[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.760]
Nothing's been said to be, of course, has nothing to do with us

[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:23.000]
Well, I know that, I know, but I mean especially from the feminist movement

[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.800]
Because this is weird, but this girl that was on there to be in the show, I only listened to the beginning

[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.640]
No doubt

[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.700]
But the subject of rape came up

[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.600]
And this guy said, well, you know, I can't understand these guys anyway

[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.720]
Rape and these joggers because they're all dirty and sweaty and stinky

[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.280]
I mean, they should at least be showered and perfumed and everything

[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.480]
Oh my God

[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.400]
And you know, terrorism isn't so bad, you know

[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.560]
Yes, but I just...

[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.320]
I just wanna say now, I understand it Carolyn

[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:57.840]
Steve O insisted this guy do the show, Felipe yes, Nick says yes he did

[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:03.220]
Well, he had him on like a couple weeks ago, he was on the show a guest

[00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:07.840]
They don't want Stan or Joey or anybody like that, they want this guy

[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.360]
No, he did a great job with Tom Jigga

[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.020]
Yes, he did

[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.760]
I enjoyed that very much driving home a couple days ago, about TV, that was really good

[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:22.760]
No, you know, maybe they should try...

[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.940]
Well, first off, I would suggest putting this show in English

[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.320]
But you know, it goes by that story that Neil told about the guy over KT

[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:35.180]
Who, you know, when he hired somebody, he wondered more mediocre than him

[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.020]
So he looked... I don't know, but...

[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.020]
Well, I just wanted to give... you know, I just thought I'd give the show a chance and listen to the guy

[00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:42.580]
Not me

[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.660]
Oh, I couldn't believe it

[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.640]
We warned him, we told him exactly what was gonna happen

[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.980]
And they're just oblivious, you know, they don't care, you know, fine

[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:57.420]
Felipe Rivera, terrorism is not so bad

[00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.180]
And, you know, I mean, well, I don't even want to talk about it

[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:02.920]
Exactly, I don't blame it Carolyn, I don't believe it

[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.700]
I just wanted to say one more thing, Glenn

[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.140]
Today is the 30th and you're not gonna be there on the first, so when is gonna be your chronic day?

[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:17.320]
Well, we... well, see, the way that works, you know, that's the first show day after the first

[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.500]
Oh, okay, so...

[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.940]
You know, I haven't called since the first

[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.260]
Well, I think chronic day is a good idea, don't you?

[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:22.800]
Sure

[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.480]
I always enjoy it, we did that, what?

[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.460]
We did it when Neil was sick or something a few months ago

[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:32.440]
Yeah, well, that's then also June 1st, that's the last time I called there

[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.580]
Yeah, because a lot, I was getting a lot of hate calls that came out of me, you know, so I said, hey

[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:41.160]
We'll do it, Monday, thanks for the, my that's a good idea, I enjoy those shows, because you hear all these people

[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:47.360]
Well, you know, Mike did call today, but you called, but we'll do all chronic, that's a great idea

[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:49.100]
Is Neil gonna call from Europe?

[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.140]
He said no

[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.780]
Oh, he said no, I don't blame them

[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.480]
No, and...

[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.600]
He had to head away, you know

[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:57.100]
Exactly, that's what he said, he doesn't want to think about it, I don't blame them

[00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:01.700]
Really? Well, Grant, have a great weekend, I got four days off and I'm really looking forward to it

[00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.060]
Well, lucky you, okay, Caroline

[00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:03.960]
I'm sports at July

[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.680]
See ya

[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:04.900]
Bye

[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:08.460]
Alright, there she goes, and we go to Miami next, hello

[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.060]
Hello, Grant, how are you doing today?

[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:10.480]
Great

[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:16.860]
First of all, we're, you know, we're, you know, I think with pirate radio rocking in, we can get, we can get that from

[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:23.700]
That came off a air check, a pirate radio that they had over next door at GTR

[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.560]
Johnny Dolener, somebody just dubbed that off for us

[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.700]
Don't be a dickhead

[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.440]
Lock it in

[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.080]
100.3F10

[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.420]
Pirate radio

[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.480]
Now that actually came off an air check, a pirate radio in LA, that's one of their liners

[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.900]
Could, could they, could they call the station and get it from there if they wanted?

[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.080]
What do you mean?

[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.880]
That particular car you're on, it could set it from there if they wanted it

[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:08.420]
What you would have to do is have somebody tape pirate radio out in LA, you know, that's the only way, that's how we got it

[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.260]
Oh, I understand

[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:18.140]
Yes, and everything, you know, sometime back you played this jiggle or jiggle from WIAD and the 6th and Wackert's twist

[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:24.040]
Yeah, well how about if you guys could play let's say some air checks from the old WIAD or from WCK

[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.020]
I have there are any in the building are there?

[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.960]
Not that I know of, those are rare, what you heard those are very rare

[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:37.960]
Oh, and I had cold specs to see if they have that, that contact is with the red light

[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.000]
Wait, wait a second sir, what, what is this?

[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.000]
What is what?

[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.120]
What is it?

[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:47.920]
I, I called specs, yes, they just find out if they have that, that, that, that CD with the

[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.580]
commercials, I think that they didn't

[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:55.780]
Really? Well, you know, I don't, I don't doubt it, I have no idea where it came from or anything

[00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:01.780]
or I friend James Holmes down at the Sound of Ice down in Kendall just put this in my hand the other day a couple days ago

[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:07.600]
And I don't know, you know, where I've never seen it in my life, it's called TV Tunes, the commercials

[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.220]
I'm gonna call James Monday and then say if he works by my own company

[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.920]
You know, you ever seen those CDs or those albums with the TV themes?

[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.980]
You ever seen those, it's the same thing, they, they have them

[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:25.880]
So any store and I would assume it would be in any big record store like Peaches or Specs or any Sound Warehouse or any of those

[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.540]
If they have those, I assume they have these, it's the same thing

[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:34.340]
Right, and, and a couple more things, you know, you know who else is in Europe, Jim Kelly?

[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:35.260]
Yeah

[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:39.340]
And also, could you please play Neil Heydroom? I haven't heard that in a long time

[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:42.820]
You see Robin Williams, you'll see him in a totally different life

[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:48.960]
And he's just incredible and not too movies, not too many movies ever choke me up

[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.040]
That movie just really gets a hold of you

[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.600]
Well, I don't like to go to the movies in the summer, I think if I go see one that'll be the one

[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.200]
Yeah, I definitely recommend it

[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:03.000]
And in closing, I just wanna say to Felipe that there's one phrase that is sort of universal

[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.220]
and it'll go in any language and I'd like to send this out to Felipe

[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:07.960]
Yeah, I'd like!

[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.640]
Okay, and here's your cafeteria, Santeria

[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.220]
Tired of the same old restaurants? Try the cafeteria, Santeria of Hailea

[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:21.500]
How much is that doggy on the menu?

[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:27.960]
The one with the barbecue tail?

[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:34.260]
How much is that doggy on the menu?

[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:40.880]
I'm sure that the chef out of jail

[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.680]
That's right, no matter what the weather's like outside

[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:50.000]
It's always raining cats and dogs at the cafeteria, Santeria of Hailea

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.800]
We'll make your stomach stop growling and make your neighbors pit bull stop doing the same thing

[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.020]
Talk about delicious

[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.080]
Mmm, mmm, your meal is always fresh

[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.900]
We kill it right on the premises

[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:06.220]
For a heavenly meal at a sacrifice price, it's the cafeteria, Santeria

[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.280]
Try it once, you'll eat there religiously

[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.760]
How much is that doggy on the menu?

[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:20.240]
The one that is fried in deep fat?

[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.700]
Your guts!

[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.840]
Please bring me that doggy on the menu

[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.920]
And bring us side order of cat

[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:39.000]
Walk one or catch a greyhound for the cafeteria Santeria of Hailea

[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.100]
Where we give new meaning to the word, pet food

[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.140]
Boy, it's been a long time
