[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.380]
dropped off okay really it's called counting your chickens before they drop it

[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.380]
up strong i was listening i was i was listening i was reading the u.s. h.a. today they have a list of

[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.620]
the top 20 uh the top rated radio stations in 20 major markets yeah and under the Miami

[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.360]
say today yes yesterday right uh they have uh among the uh top rated stations in my

[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.620]
army w.i.n.v.a.m. news talk radio 940 what is this from two two three years ago

[00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.040]
this is yesterday's newspaper no they're a little bit behind the side they keep going

[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.920]
they keep going with 96.5 wait a minute this listing is for people over the age of 80

[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.480]
then probably they're correct no let's you know they don't have a footnote so

[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.000]
and they don't say anything but that was pretty that's okay yeah they say they're the top station

[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.620]
in the market or what do they say here's a list of the top rated radio stations in 20 major

[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.940]
markets yeah so they go on and list all these different markets and then they go down to Miami

[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.200]
four-loaded or hollywood and the very first one is 940 news talk w.i.n.v.a.m.

[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.380]
w.i.n.v.a.d. is nowhere to be seen here um i even live classical 93.1 wtmi fm

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.900]
orbin contemporary country 940. they found out you know uh USA the day is published by

[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.000]
guñet out of rochester right and they found out they saw in print somewhere they saw

[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.520]
g-a-n-n-e-t and they thought it was guñet it's gana and poland main but immediately they panicked

[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.460]
and they said well you better put w.i.n.z in the list okay because it looks like our station which

[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.160]
it's not this is amazing us tmi and kiss both have like very small ratings i know well they're

[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.280]
all right they are country of country of mw.i.k.k. how about zeta is that in there no no

[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.420]
neither not yet that goes to show you it's bogus is it in there and you know it's not for real

[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.940]
yeah well they're turning the corner there uh they sure have yeah all right thanks a lot okay

[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.580]
to take care and the fhp is out there trying to find it okay i guess i was getting a little

[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.620]
over enthusiastic we do have some lines open now one in date one in brown and one in bokeh it's

[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.800]
kind of like balanced out now just to make it even i was getting a little carried away you know

[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:37.360]
after yesterday's debacle but it's not too bad you want to talk to that man for a second about what

[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:45.440]
about a couple things no to what man bitch about what about cd players and no we're not going to do

[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.880]
that on the air we know no he's bad enough we got a little bit of rf back in here again he

[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.740]
walked out anyway okay let's take one problem at a time all right oh are one of the worst

[00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.940]
troublemakers i've ever seen in my life we got an open line in bokeh 278 9463 278 w.i.d i think

[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.840]
what would be a lot more important than any of those things if we get one of those cbs

[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.760]
opt-a-pad or opt-a-max or whatever they call those that's what that we could talk to him about

[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.140]
too so that when a mic plays music in the morning and we occasionally play music that it doesn't sound

[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.400]
like way in the background like that it's got to when you have one of those things in there

[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.880]
it like brings out the highs and it actually doesn't sound that bad on a m right i'd like

[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.660]
like we used to have it i and z yeah i'd like to talk in fact why don't we have mitches go over there

[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.760]
and he can steal it out of the rack because they're not playing music anyway over there well remember

[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.920]
that thing we used to have a cbs opt-a-pad or whatever they call that so the music sounded real good on a

[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:43.560]
m.i.m. you know what it's called opt-a-mod mini pad something like that opt-a-mod anyway maxi pad

[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.740]
that's what it was called because max was one of the engineers so they called it a maxi pad right

[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.320]
but anyway he's aware it wants to know it was kind of cute but they're not playing any music over

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.480]
there any plus they're almost off the year why don't we just go over there and borrow it

[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.860]
because the music on this station just don't cut it it really doesn't sound so good you know what i mean

[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.420]
we're not trying to find problems but we just we would like to we're striving for excellence okay

[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.640]
now sooner or later when we reach mediocrity then we'll know that we're at least one step further

[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.600]
toward excellence right but what about when Arlene was occasionally sings over there that is true

[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.240]
that is true and when they say is it real or is it mammurex okay boy those lines are just

[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.740]
going nuts again here today you people just man you know how to keep people manic in this market one

[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.980]
day it's like death-fally days and the next day i'm not saying they got a lot to say but they're

[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.500]
sure in a much-friendly or mood today then they were yesterday we could offer to a hundred bucks

[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.980]
a call yesterday and i guarantee you nothing yeah absolutely nothing to say of course if they would

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.400]
have turned the damn transmitter on that would have helped i guess but we'd like to give everybody a

[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.080]
handicap it's a ten forty eight twelve minutes till eleven at wio day let's uh oh we got a mobile see

[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:28.280]
751 9463 and there's just somebody inspired and brownered to 524 wiod well a good part of it is

[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.500]
it's like recycling because when everybody drops off during the news like that then you start

[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.200]
all over again you know you get all the rid of all those hangovers from before the news we got a

food already okay let's just get the food in here and hell with it i think i'm just gonna change

[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.760]
my mind on that let's just eat every day because we make a lot of gutterable sounds and it takes

[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.680]
up a lot of time then you just punch out anybody you don't care as long as they take up a little you know

[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:16.400]
as hannanda you know hello hellow nil yeah i'm just reading a nonglick at least happens across at you

[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.240]
we don't you don't think the fine by discussing him on the year like you know i just

[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.380]
read it and just a new way to not only you you know that why you're reading that anyway I don't

[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.000]
know there's nothing but ads in it and pictures of you know who would jewelry around his neck

[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000]
right i don't know why you were by the reading nobody else picks it up i've been trying to get

Well, I hear the last guy asked each one of us separately how we doing and we both said great now

[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.900]
I realize it wasn't a great call but since his call and your call nothing has happened to change things

[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.060]
Well nice to hear that you guys are doing well. Yeah

[00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.680]
I got a great

[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.720]
Why the wait can I ask you a question? How you doing? I'm doing fantastic. Well, it's nice to hear that

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.560]
I got a blue hair story. We went to my wife and I went to this restaurant in in Hollywood

[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.200]
I don't know if I could use a name camis and

[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.000]
We're sitting there. What do you mean you don't know if you can use the name camis and then you throw it in there on

[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.720]
I don't understand

[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.620]
Hey, you know what you gonna do rip him

[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.300]
Well, no, no actually they have some great shrimp pasta if you ever wanted

[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.360]
They're a direct competitor with one of my sponsors. I'm not gonna promote that guy. I won't do that then

[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.880]
I won't much in there again

[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.260]
Good anyway, so we're sitting there and they're like six blue hairs sitting next to us in the table having a big feast

[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.760]
And so my wife are sitting there my wife and I are sitting there having dinner

[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.720]
And as we start

[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.260]
That's what you get for going into a place like that you get a bunch of blue hairs sitting around you, okay?

[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.380]
This couple on the end right next to us

[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:56.180]
They they reach over and they take napkins from our napkin holder to start

[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.600]
So my wife and I think well no big deal. They just took a couple napkins

[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.720]
Next the guy reaches over he takes our ass tray

[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.240]
Now I'm a smoker and I wasn't gonna have you know a cigarette because it's small cramp quarters

[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.940]
So he takes our ass tray meanwhile. They're not asking for anything they're just just

[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:17.360]
Just reaching over and grab it. Yeah, I can relate to that he takes our ketchup mind you

[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.160]
They reach over and they take our ketchup

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.860]
Better cocktail sauce. Finally I said look excuse me. We're sitting here. You're over there

[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.860]
You've got plenty on your table. Would you mind keeping your hands to yourself? They look at me like I'm crazy

[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.000]
And so they they proceeded to get really angry with me because I told them that they couldn't take crap from our table

[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:37.980]
and

[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.620]
Anyway, the blue hair stories that I've heard on your show are

[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.640]
Nothing compared with a look on this guy's face. Well, we make it all up though according to Sunny Rosenberg

[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.820]
We just make it all up. They worked so hard to change the image of this town

[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.700]
They actually brought in three couples under 110

[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.620]
Last month, okay to try to change the image

[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:01.840]
I know hey um, they were 108 way to go on that weight loss with nutrition. You sound like you're doing good

[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.700]
I've been going to a gym. I'm doing it the hard way

[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.280]
You know, you know every line that you say is that has got the potential for me to do about a half an hour

[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.220]
You do realize that don't you on me or no just a half hour on the line. Oh, okay

[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.820]
All right, anyway, I'm not doing real good. Okay. I was doing real good in this weekend

[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:24.940]
They're just you see these sales people their thing is in fact one of the people

[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.380]
I don't want to mention Tom Denenberg

[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.980]
No, seriously he come up with a line a couple of weeks ago that was shocking

[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:36.400]
He said I'm not going to mention the name of a sponsor because it's a fine sponsor of ours and they're nice people

[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.720]
But he said they're bringing food tomorrow and I said no, we don't want food tomorrow. We got to stop

[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.420]
He said now they insist there's no such thing as you insist, okay?

[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:52.720]
See the last the last I remember from broadcasting 102 our job is like when somebody buys spots

[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.780]
And we do a great job for our sponsor

[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.740]
Especially the food sponsors okay, and spite of the fact you're promoting a competitor

[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.400]
We do a great job for our spot and what we do is we do the spot we get enthusiastic about it

[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.220]
We know what we're talking about we make it sound great. We get we do them we get them great business

[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.900]
And we do that for all of our food sponsors guaranteed, okay? Yeah

[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.320]
We don't have an obligation to be force-fed on demand

[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.580]
And he sales people well they insist they can insist my ass, okay?

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.280]
There's no such thing as they insist it doesn't exist

[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.660]
Well, it seems like they bring over here something like that they insist

[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.760]
I mean I just I don't understand these sales people

[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.480]
No choice in a matter exactly you're gonna eat it whether you like it or not

[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:38.260]
Well, I'm worried you don't like it. We're gonna let the bird eat 20 pounds of it right in the front of you just to make you feel like a jerk

[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.340]
I know because apparently the bird doesn't gain weight

[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.780]
Isn't that amazing? I don't want to hear about it

[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.340]
And I'm just lucky

[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:48.680]
Well, I just in closing while it's nice to hear that you're getting hard on

[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.780]
Junsu. What else in closing? I had milled you a letter or a cop you a letter. I sent Mike Disney

[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.340]
Regarding that was a few weeks ago. Yeah, regarding Mr. homophob in the gables and

[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:05.340]
If you need any other, you know audience participation and then letters written just ask for it and uh

[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.940]
You have a big fan following out here and we're willing to do it. Okay. Good. Well. I'll see you at shelves next time

[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.300]
You want to go out for a secret? I want to try I want to try the on my real nice you won't fight all those

[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.680]
Ancient people in there either you'll find living and breathing people under a hundred who won't reach over and grab your thing either

[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.120]
I'm gonna try I hate it when I grab my thanks. Yeah, I'm gonna try the armadillo cafe

[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.040]
That's what they all say pal with a smile on their face. Okay. Have a good one. I'm a good one now

[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:35.120]
God almighty each call today is like a major psychological traumatic experience, isn't it? Yeah

[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.140]
It's true. We have an open-line in date if you move real fast now

[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:44.840]
Let's do a little amateur psychology on these listeners 751 W I O D and Palm Beach is finished for the day

[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.140]
They're done. I got a horse. Oh, all right now. Let me just before you give us your horse

[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.500]
One is it nimble chris in the eighth the 15 horse

[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.980]
Will it get sprains? Why do you keep picking these horses with numbers that are not gonna get in? I don't pick them by numbers

[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:05.080]
pick them by name all right that horse is not likely to get in nimble chris in the eighth mm-hmm

[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.800]
And not only that but that they're gonna probably be a whole bunch of scratches in that race because it's gonna rain that race is scheduled on a grass

[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.640]
Take one a crash race goes on the dirt. There are a whole bunch of horses that get scratched

[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.640]
Don't maybe we'll get in you know, I'm no dummy

[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:18.740]
Well

[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.380]

These are different morning line odds man

[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.560]
We could get a price here on this double olive i with Doug valianti in the first race the six horse

[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:36.560]
And BL striker uh-huh in a second race with jury Bailey the two horse six and two

[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.160]
No, I just uh, I watch the weather channel. I got news for you man. That stuff from the west it looks

[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.880]
And it's gotten closer since we've been here for an hour and a half

[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.740]
But it's not gonna last all that long though. Is it no no, but it will be it will rain cats and dogs

[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.480]
Probably sometimes during the show

[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:38.700]
possible in fact, I bet you another hour or so at my house see there in westbroward. It's right at the edge

[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.680]
Well, right in the brown or it's moving into westernbroward

[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.960]
Yeah, the first western day the first one has just made it into brown

[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.380]
Just now over the line. Yeah, this kind of like watching a real slow horse race

[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.200]
Very slow who takes out for a lottery. Hello

[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.300]
Okay, thanks so much for waiting. We sure appreciate it Miami. Hello, hey deal. Yeah

[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.260]
How are you in the bird you guys still doing good? No, not too good since we saw the rain come

[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:08.640]
Hey, uh, tell the bird that I don't think you can get any calls from the track of I don't think there's any phones there

[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.620]
For some kind of war I never know they while they do have that law but in the press box they could call out

[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:17.300]
But I don't there's a there's a time thing on there. I think it's like half an hour something after yeah

[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.140]
I was think so because of obviously

[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.940]
Yeah, I think they've called us before is what I was thinking well you could just no not from the track

[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.660]
So I know left the track. Yeah after the worst one maybe just to lead up to my next comment

[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.240]
You could probably just send a leaf hour over there and you could scream. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea

[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.260]
Too bad it's during the show

[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.380]
Gee, yesterday I

[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:43.100]
No parking lot eat my lunch and I flipped over there when you guys had one of your commercials and I flipped up there and somehow I got le

[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.620]
And maybe I don't even know if my radio was working on I got him but I did hear him and

[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:53.240]
He had he was he was copying your show so bad. He had uh, you know that screen you do that

[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.180]
You know one with your voice. He was playing that or of cheap imitation of it

[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.400]
He was shooting people with that little gun

[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:00.920]
That

[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.440]
It was uh, he's like a child. It was a it was a crime

[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:09.440]
People who imitate like that like Alice and Lee Fowler and and

[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:15.580]
Elaceter they're like overgrown children, okay. Yeah, juvenile tell everybody what Lee's doing today

[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.220]
Remember cross-deaf lighting. No, I don't remember it. No seriously. What did it say? It's what?

[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.820]
Jewish women

[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.280]
They're prospective on Jewish men

[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.680]
And in tomorrow he's gonna have Gentile women discussing their perspective on Jewish men

[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.080]
And on Thursday he's gonna have Jews talking about goyem

[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:41.840]
He also said the cover news all accordingly. Yeah, really really where the god. He did well

[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.320]
That's great. He's really coming up with all the new stuff, isn't he? Yeah, and he also used a phrase

[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.760]
I guess they had a change up there Jeff Charles is going someplace to no kidding. Yeah, who's doing afternoons?

[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.300]
He called a mr. polyester whoever that is

[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:53.580]
Uh

[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.360]
Somebody who works there the name sounded familiar

[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:03.400]
It's you know sir this call in the words of Lee Fowler makes me apple plucked it

[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.260]
You don't like it

[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.660]
It's just a little joke pal. Okay, I don't I won't get hostile

[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.680]
Wasn't doing it good anyway. Okay. Well listen have a wonderful day and thanks for the report

[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.840]
Your code ring is in the mail. Okay boy. He sure got off of there quick, didn't he?

[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.600]
29 past 11 at W.I.O.D. Steve at two o'clock gun education in the schools

[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:31.320]
Mm-hmm and the Mary and Hammer of unified sportsman is gonna be one of the guests along with Dr. Ray Armstrong the all-american boy

[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:37.860]
And he is a child psychologist and they're gonna be talking about gun education in the schools

[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.000]
Great. Anyway, let's see look at that phone. Just started to drop off and Broward again

[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.620]
Broward's not been too involved in the show last couple of days

[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:50.740]
If you notice that we started out today all the data lines were lit up and it was Broward after some prodding and cajoling

[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.100]
Now I don't want anybody to be alarmed because I haven't done the tell star spot yet

[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:01.220]
But I spoke to the very nice lady one of them who works over there yesterday to find out the progress on my satellite dish

[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:06.940]
And it seems I don't want to I don't want to create any havoc, but it seems that there is someone

[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.080]
In plantation either

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:17.700]
One of the powers that am or somebody in my neighborhood who doesn't want that satellite dish going up

[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:24.680]
Any reason so every time we do all of the paperwork and all the stuff that they tell us we need to do and then when they come back with it

[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.780]
And then they come up with two summons

[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.480]
You know what I mean? Yeah, like every time you think okay

[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.080]
We've done everything we need we got all the permission and we got the signatures

[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.980]
And then they come up with new deals okay just because they don't want it

[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.380]
They don't want me to have it is basically what it is and I'm let me just say this to you

[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.120]
I don't really care at this point okay because you people in plantation

[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.640]
I'm not talking about the residents but the politicians and some of my neighbors

[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.980]
I have some very nice neighbors

[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.060]
But we also have some snobbish snooty miserable

[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.380]
Creetans okay

[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.880]
And doesn't bother me at all because I'll be more than happy to move

[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.280]
All right now that may bother my landlord, but that's too bad

[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:04.120]
Because if I can't have I don't notice that when people put up these ugly antennas

[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.640]
Which is all a satellite dishes anyways a form of antenna

[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.800]
I don't have anything to say about it and I can see them

[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.080]
Mm-hmm can't you yeah right there on a roof

[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:18.020]
You remember what Tom said when he was here the neighbors are jealous that you have something they don't have exactly

[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.480]
That's what he said exactly

[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.340]
So there you go, but I don't really give it them anymore because I'm getting sick and tired of that snooty attitude up their

[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.660]
Implantation and then my one neighbor down there the end of the street

[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:32.040]
Those always tell me oh no they just got to do all this they got to make sure everything's on the up and up

[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.460]
Yeah, I'll give him something on the up and up

[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.840]
It's just a bunch of bureaucratic crap and they're in bed with a cable people and anybody who doesn't believe that out

[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.240]
There's living in a dream world, okay? You're living in a fantasy land

[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:49.080]
Because I think the city gets a certain percentage for every subscriber. They got some kind of a deal

[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.820]
Mm-hmm with the cable company do they oh absolutely oh

[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:59.320]
So they like nipping the satellite business in the bud see because then they lose X number of subscribers and I'm sure that my

[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.440]
You know six cents a month or whatever it's gonna be that and not only that

[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:09.380]
I would still have the cable anyway just like when I had it up the first time right for the basic for back for backup for basic

[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.760]
Yeah, not for backup or local

[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.580]
Yeah, sure

[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.880]
But I just want to put you jackass is up there in plantation on notice that you know

[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.900]
You can think that you're gonna create a big heavy. I don't really give it damn. Okay, because I can live in for Lauderdale

[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.180]
I can live in

[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.660]
Halondale I might just go ahead move to Halondale

[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:34.260]
And run for mayor this plantation they're incredible with the bags and everything and nobody up there here

[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:38.520]
Remember when I try to get some people do something they couldn't give it damn less whatever they tell them

[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.900]
They just like good goose stepping little

[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:45.040]
subservient douche bags they just go along with it no matter what the powers that be tell them

[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.680]
They do things. I've never heard of any other yeah, I'm innocent. Whoever heard a plantation back never any

[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:56.300]
No, even even in Georgia they never had plantation bags. Okay, even in the cotton fields they never had plantation back

[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:04.000]
It's 1133 a WI the in speaking of what we were just talking about sports channel of Florida is something that those of us who have

[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.360]
Certain cable companies are out seeing and as a result we won't see tonight the George Town at Miami baseball game from Mark Light Stadium

[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.720]
We won't see the NHL game Pittsburgh at Los Angeles at 1030 tonight on sports channel of Florida

[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.160]
We won't see the heat game against the Lakers tomorrow night at 730

[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.860]
We won't see the Gators play Virginia and baseball Thursday at 5 p.m

[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:29.300]
And we certainly won't see the Michigan Wolf Reigns play basketball at Northwestern at 8 o'clock on Thursday night

[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.220]
We won't see racing from Gulfstream

[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:38.200]
We won't see racing from Pompano. Okay, we won't see any of it unless enough of you get your butts on the line and pick up that

[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:44.340]
Telephone and call your local cable operator's pronto. Okay, because the pressure is on it starting to have a real effect

[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.200]
Trust me you call your local cable company if you're a sports fan and you tell them in no uncertain terms

[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.780]
You want and you want it now sports channel of Florida home of the home team

[00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:00.820]
Bob Soapers complete an accurate weather make new talk radio six 10 your only station for weather

[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:10.180]
Whether you like it or not now more with Neil Rogers on news talk radio six 10 W I O D 11 35 at W I O D

[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:18.400]
Here's a call in Hollywood. Hello, hey Neil. Yeah, it's the first time I've ever called in but I got something I like to say about Wimpy George

[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.700]
Our president. Yeah, well

[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:27.540]
Sorry to announce this but it has something to do with the Eastern crisis and uh, yeah

[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.800]
He really uh, he really asserted himself and that didn't it? Yes. Well, what bothers me is the US government

[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:40.100]
Is back that's always seen in the news the last couple years the uh hole in union and they're right to strike

[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.300]
And protests for decent wages

[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.940]
Everything now we have it happening in our own country

[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:52.140]
And President Bush is back off and not only does he not make a personal appearance and state his point

[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:56.300]
Whether he wanted a board or not. He didn't came up. He didn't come up and go to the state

[00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:00.900]
You busy uh running around trying to get John tower confirmed. Don't you think that's true too

[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:05.360]
But not only does he show his face but but then he threatens labor and says if you

[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.240]
Secondary boycott the country

[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.080]
I'm gonna introduce emergency legislation

[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.140]
So knock it off now

[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.720]
His content. So we're not discussing the eastern strike

[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:20.840]
I thought we and we said that at the beginning of the show. Okay. Steve did that for like four hours. Yes

[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.360]
I know, but I just wanted to bring up the thing about the

[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:29.120]
The president the way the way he's handled it. Okay. Well, thank you so much. It's 1136 and WIOD

[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.240]
We have two open lines in date on a very uh lukewarm kind of show today 751

[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:38.220]
WIOD we have an open line in Broward 5249463. We're not discussing

[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.780]
Sonny Rosenberg. We're not discussing the eastern strike

[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:47.640]
Uh, in fact, we're not discussing anything. Are we? No nothing well good that way that way we like it on the show. Okay

[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:52.840]
That's exactly the way we like it because no matter what I bring up you people aren't gonna talk about it anyway

[00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:02.100]
Right no no matter what I bring up I could bring up for I could go through an hour monologue like I used to in the old days at the beginning of the show in a first call would be

[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:06.100]
How loud now what can you tell me about Felby

[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.280]
Uh, so what's he use okay? We understand where we are

[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:18.540]
Look at that now the rain that line is moved just into uh boy. It looked like right in sunrise there too

[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:24.140]
I'm like they're gonna get some serious thunder boomers and sunrise moments from yeah probably now as we speak

[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.740]
Way out there like by um the sawgrass. Yeah

[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:28.600]
Yeah

[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.980]
Probably be a lot of frogs hopping on the sawgrass today

[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.760]
In fact, we might bring up that mexican family

[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:40.100]
I can't get them up that was like I can do like a little uh tap them a little mexican headbands on the sawgrass for a little free uh

[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:46.140]
For show for you okay no charge although the sawgrass it's wonderful if you're going like in very limited areas

[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:52.080]
But it cost an arm and a leg true. It does that expensive. Yeah for Lauderdale. Hello. Hello Neil. Yeah

[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.700]
Well, I guess I fit right in with the program because I have absolutely you know

[00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.140]
Absolutely nothing to say. Well, that's good. You're right in there with everybody else who's called so far today sir

[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:05.160]
That's my pleasure to fall in line. Okay. I heard the Palm Beach line was empty and I thought I'd take it then where do you live?

[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.320]
I gotta say this is the quickest ever we got on show

[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.380]
Well, you're called the Palm Beach line

[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:15.480]
Excuse me. Where are you calling from? I'm calling from Florida. Oh from for Lauderdale on the Palm Beach line

[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:20.780]
Well, it's pretty creative. That's a way to get in. Well, you know, you said that you said that that Palm Beach line was empty

[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.180]
I just so I can't stand for this

[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.100]
That's really the situation. Well, I got an even better idea. Why'd you move to Palm Beach?

[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.920]
Not too far. No, like Boka, you know

[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:36.700]
Everybody sooner or later everybody moves to Boka. No, those people at their brain data. I can't handle it. Okay

[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:47.080]
To no rest. Oh, there's more thinking don't you understand he's like taking little rest. Okay. No, I'm not thinking it's your show. You want to send me?

[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.840]
Oh, are you done?

[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.200]

I want to talk about my cable company. I'm not here. I'm just I'm just making chewing sounds like there was food my mom. Yeah

[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:22.280]
But I'm not eating anything. Yeah sure listen, listen, I don't think you said with cable

[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:32.980]
And I say to a why can't I get paid for you she goes in the fall well. We don't carry that service

[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:37.960]
So I wrote them a letter. I've called them and I want to put a dish in my neighborhood

[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:43.620]
I live in the private community in Bokka. We can't put a dish up one out the home association doesn't allow it

[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:48.000]
Oh, isn't that wonderful? I would move if I were you I just spent 300,000 dollars

Well, there's nothing else I can do you have any other suggestions? Uh, you know, what can you do?

[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:02.640]
I think I would consider arson at this point. How can they know you have a dish? How's that possible? Because my house faces

[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.120]
Communo Rial which is a pretty major road trying to milk the bulk of Del Mar

[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:10.660]
What about it? They don't want any dishes based in the road. They don't want to drop time to drop dead

[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:17.180]
You won't change anything, but it'll make you feel a lot better Larry where's my lunch?
