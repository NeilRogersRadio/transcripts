[00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.960]
They started to tattoo her on the air and about a third of the way through they ran out.

[00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.940]
Is she like a monster in the business?

[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.400]
She's a giant in the industry sir.

[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.400]
Have a great day.

[00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.960]
Okay, they're all stealing my lines, you know what I'm saying?

[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.040]
142 at WID.

[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.600]
Maybe Kevin will call back tomorrow.

[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.360]
Maybe we don't usually.

[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.720]
I like to discourage chronic.

[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.080]
Although he is no Mr. Tremor, I'll say that.

[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.780]
But maybe Kevin can call in every day this week because it is the beginning of the Dauphin Exhibition season.

[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.520]
Big game divided case you didn't hear the promo is 40 times the top.

[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.300]
And we kind of get an update on how things are doing in a locker room, okay?

[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.060]
That's a good idea.

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200]
Yeah, actually.

[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.360]
I mean, you know, these sports people, they think they got the whole thing all locked up by themselves here.

[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.480]
We're part of the WID family.

[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.620]
We're a family, so the spirit of the Dauphin Exhibition is right there.

[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.280]
And we ought to get in a little of the action too.

[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.020]
Here's a mobile and date. Hello.

[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.980]
Hey Neal, how you doing?

[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.500]
Great.

[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.340]
Hey my buddy's down from Chicago and I was telling about your promo you have with a thick and freeway.

[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.340]
He's just, I try to explain it to him.

[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.120]
I don't know if you don't...

[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.220]
What do you want to draw a diagram?

[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.840]
Well, I always wonder if you could play.

[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.420]
I know you don't do that, but could you play it?

[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.180]
Or did you just like kind of drop the coast in the living room?

[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.640]
Yeah.

[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020]
No, I got it in the machine right now, you know why?

[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.520]
Why?

[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.840]
Because it'll kill about two minutes.

[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.420]
When you're under the weather, man, anything that'll kill a little time, you know?

[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.080]
Oh, okay, but I appreciate if you play it.

[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.020]
Your buddies from Chicago?

[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.540]
Yeah, right.

[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.780]
You look right behind Riggly Field.

[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.340]
So he's a big cubs fan, huh?

[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.940]
Yeah.

[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.020]
I guess he is, you know.

[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.300]
But I don't, I don't mess with him myself, though.

[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.180]
Oh, geez.

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.880]
Well, listen, you guys had a great weekend.

[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.900]
Hey, thanks a lot.

[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.360]
But you're still in third place, you know?

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.600]
Yeah.

[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.260]
What can I say?

[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.960]
Okay, well tell him to crank it up and the mind is on business.

[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.780]
Hey, thanks a lot.

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.200]
See you later.

[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.520]
Bye-bye.

[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.440]
Okay, this is for all our great friends from Chicago and those who aren't.

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.040]
Turned about.

[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.480]
Rad House, doubt.

[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.720]
Listen.

[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.900]
Shenz is on.

[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.200]
Hi.

[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.900]
Hello.

[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.280]
What are you doing, huh?

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.240]
I'll say.

[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.020]
You come here often, pardon me?

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.340]
Have you been here before?

[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.040]
No, first time.

[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.400]
What's your name?

[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.080]
Freeway.

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.700]
Freeway, that's nice.

[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.920]
Let me speak it.

[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.540]
Please, do you speak it?

[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.600]

[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.360]
I'm here.

[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.540]
You are here to get a cleaner.

[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.460]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.620]
You work around here?

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.020]
I'm a waiter, but Ashley, I'm an actor, you know.

[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.040]
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.

[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.120]
What's the top of it?

[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.000]
You probably need to rely on me.

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.240]
But, you know, with everything that's in the news and all, it's just, hey, you can start relaxing right now, freeway.

[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.420]
I brought something.

[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.420]
Ooh, she, huh?

[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.340]
And freeway.

[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.080]
Not just any she either.

[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.860]
Look.

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.120]
Wow, gold lame.

[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.820]
Yay.

[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.040]
Pretty geeky condom, but here's the most important part, freeway, from the ProTech label.

[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.500]
ProTech, huh?

[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.580]
Aren't those indoors by the City Council of San Francisco?

[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.840]
Absolutely.

[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.540]
You know the ProTech slogan, don't you?

[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.280]
I sure do.

[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.500]
Certified, safe by the City by the Bay.

[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.280]
Well, what do you say?

[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.140]
Darn, look at that.

[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.720]
I dropped this soap again.

[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.180]
I'll get it.

[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.380]
You bet your life he will.

[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.820]
And with confidence.

[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.980]
Because freeway and spick had have condoms.

[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.280]
Don't let worry, spoil those chance meetings in public showers.

[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.320]
Always carry ProTech.

[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.020]
PROTC.

[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.040]
TMI-3S-MB.

[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.340]
PROTC.

[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.940]
TPP.

[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.140]
TPP.

[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.220]

[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.020]
Bend down with no apology.

[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.200]
Don't doubt.

[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.600]
Know what it's all about.

[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.140]
The ProTech's cheap.

[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.220]
So they won't send you a free ProTech condoms.

[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.540]
I'll division a black flag house in Garden Pets and Gold Division.

[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.760]
Keep in situation safe since 1887.

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.080]
You're a bastard.

[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.700]
Okay, 146.

[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.300]
A WI.

[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.180]
I'm going to tell you about Low Jack right now.

[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.240]
He's I think the timing could be weak.

[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.900]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.640]
Why?

[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.400]
After hearing that?

[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.500]
Oh, seriously.

[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.500]
Well, a lot of these people in the audience

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.460]
get all these different product-infused.

[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.220]
No, Low Jack is to protect your vehicle, okay?

[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.360]
Which is your second biggest investment after your house.

[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.560]
And a lot of us have cars that like mean a lot to us, okay?

[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.960]
Like my super sitting outside.

[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.340]
I don't want some Jack ass running into my car when I'm coming to work in the morning.

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.080]
Some wild man out there who's irresponsible using his car like some kind of a demolition

[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.920]
Derby weapon.

[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.920]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.300]
But the bottom line is if somebody steals your car more likely than not,

[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.060]
you're never going to see it again or if they do finally find it,

[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.780]
you probably have a couple of wheels and a steering wheel and not much left.

[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.700]
Unless you have Low Jack protection.

[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.140]
It's an amazing device.

[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.580]
People are getting it like crazy all over the place because it really does work.

[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.900]
And here's how it works.

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.620]
It's a small radio transmitter that they hide in your car truck.

[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.380]
And if your car is stolen, police automatically activate the transmitter.

[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.180]
And it begins sending out a homing signal that they can home in zero in on in just a matter of minutes.

[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.900]
The average time of recovering the vehicle with Low Jack is about 30 minutes.

[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.620]
And not only do they almost always get the car back, but very often they catch the thieves as well while they're still in the vehicle.

[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.780]
Low Jack is guaranteed and it can be installed by bonded technicians at your home or office in just a matter of minutes.

[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.040]
And when you call for all the information, be sure to ask about a 25% discount

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.040]
on your comprehensive insurance when you have Low Jack protection.

[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.580]
You just can't afford not to have this, especially if you've got a car that's worth something to you.

[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.620]
And that's most of you I'm sure.

[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.060]
Here's the toll free number.

[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.820]
There's no obligation.

[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.620]
Call right now.

[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.340]
Get the information.

[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.180]
Call 1-800-33-Found.

[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.900]
That's 1-800-333-68-63 and ask about Low Jack.

[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:54.340]
10-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2

Does everybody have chaff and baton in theinhaapbluey?

[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.760]
the cup got the hitter that's right they come from the what you are

[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.160]
all you know i grew up in Chicago uh...

[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.580]
well i'm telling you they're doing it if only we could get Dawson hitting man

[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.040]
Dawson's like an impediment to progress every time it comes to the plate

[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.360]
all you know it's a double place strikes out or pops out with runners on third

[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.880]
base

[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.860]
but we're still scoring a ton of runs you can't win every day we're still two and

[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.460]
half ahead

[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.020]
and you know it's all i care about as long as you're still in first place

[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.080]
everybody else can talk a big game but they still have to pass you

[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.400]
that's right as long as we keep it near where there's no stop long as ryan

[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.120]
oak he's sitting in the sandberg and grace grace had three hits again yesterday

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.940]
they're doing it

[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.200]
alright and you're home

[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.320]
twenty four games in a row you got it

[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.940]
okay had your palies full of crap okay

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.560]

[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.800]
what fifty two a double nine i'd like to see the Indians do well the Indians

[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.980]
uh... last that i remember that they were in the uh... series nineteen fifty

[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.380]
four

[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.660]
when he said in american league record they want a hundred eleven games that

[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.580]
year they were big favorite in the series in the giant's beat him in four

[00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.160]
straight

[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.880]
you remember that don't you the new york giant the new york giant

[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.520]
and dusty roads and not the rest of the baseball player at all those little

[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.220]
pop lie homeruns in the polo grounds

[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.680]

[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.060]

[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.360]
forty five and they haven't

[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.680]
they have it no way to make it

[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.180]
yeah nineteen forty five last time they won a series was nineteen oh eight i think

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.380]
it's eighty one years

[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.360]
now you understand why there's all this history and frenzy man so long long

[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.100]
drought in historically it would make it directly yeah make sense

[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.260]

start catching on to what this area is all about we don't want to

[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.840]
excitement like Vegas or or why kiki or any of that stuff do we

[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.500]
huh god or even like Orlando we don't want to have a whole bunch of tourists

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.600]
here again messing things up for us and all that heavy traffic and

[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.060]
we'd like a nice and quiet and peaceful okay dead dead is the operative word

[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.000]
oh and who the hell was telling me about the new thing in four-larter day what

[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.500]
the hell was it about the brown shirts how they're

[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.260]
like lining up on a one a on either side with all the police cars

[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.120]
so that people aren't cruising the strip you know oh it just i think norm can't

[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.480]

[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.880]
yes the brown shirts up there are just going nuts

[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.380]
and pretty soon we're gonna have all those wonderful people sitting in

[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.680]
uh nor i see i call it north beach we got south beach on my amy beach

[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.020]
and for a lottery which used to be a lot of fun now it's north beach it's just

[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.800]
like south beach a little further north and it'll be sitting out there in their

[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.760]
rocking chairs staring at the sidewalk looking at the other hundred-year-old people with

[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.180]
their walkers crossing a one a very slowly and very carefully then we'll have to pass

[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.900]
an ordinance about not not having open containers of prune juice while you're

[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:31.160]
crossing a one a okay and we just kind of sit back and bob cocks can sit there

[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.360]
with them on the porch rocking back and forth with his 1948 hair cut just uh

[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.540]
oh god men are killing this town and you and the thing of it is you people don't

[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.340]
hear that's what i don't understand they don't do they

[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.100]
they don't care they just keep moving out like i mean like a lot of you live in

[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.160]
places like plantation and tendle like us

[00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.240]
you got to be ashamed of yourself you think you can move away from the

[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.620]
problem you can't do that

[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.520]

[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.740]
you know we could all be in an area where you have a lot of fun and a lot of tourist and the economy

[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.960]
was booming and it was really a swing and great open place it's much more fun being in a repressive

[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.680]
area like this it feels like you're in some kind of a concentration camp you know and then we have

[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.600]
you know the data look forward to when we all get out won't that be great oh yeah when we
