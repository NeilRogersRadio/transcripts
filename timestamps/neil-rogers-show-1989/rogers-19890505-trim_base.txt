[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]
I'm a cup tan, I'm a butt man, and I trust you are too.

[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.640]
What is that?

[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.680]
Wow, thank you Sharon so much.

[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.500]
1006 at WIV, do you think we got this word supposed to be?

[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.160]
I don't know.

[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.360]
You don't even know what it is.

[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.620]
No.

[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.600]
You don't?

[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.020]
Mm-hmm.

[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.480]
I'm gonna call Johnny Dark and tell him you're slipping.

[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.920]
What is it?

[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.520]
By the way, my horse, uh, we're gonna come in way back yesterday,

[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.000]
made a little move in the stretch and he's still running it highly.

[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.340]
That's all the right.

[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.780]
And I'm not picking one today because I'm picking, um, for the Derby tomorrow.

[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.620]
What's the one I picked?

[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380]
Sunday Silence with Pat Vellan's Weila.

[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540]
I mean, anybody can pick easy gore.

[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.340]
Okay, we got something here from specs. How do you like that?

[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.660]
So many things going on here. We got Johnny Dark on the floor, but he's gonna hold, right?

[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560]
Yeah, I just, I just called up. I was gonna guess, come a little bit closer by Jeremy Americans.

[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.160]
Hold on.

[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.080]
Hold on.

[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.600]
Hold on.

[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.940]
Because we got a, oh, we got a collect call from Washington.

[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.560]
Hello. Yes.

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.160]
Collect call from Washington. Yes. Zeta spy report here.

[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.320]
In Washington?

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.860]
No, I think Washington.

[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.040]
Now listen, yesterday they're doing a lot of work.

[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.120]
What do you mean it isn't Washington?

[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.620]
It says on the board, collect Washington DC.

[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.500]
Well, I told Mrs. Zeta spy report.

[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.220]
Wait a minute, give me the wrong number.

[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.540]
Just a second. That's on four.

[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.880]
What do you mean it's on four? Johnny Dark's on four.

[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.460]
Well, Roger is just, I know it's Friday, but poor Roger is just crumbling, falling apart of the seams.

[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.740]
Go ahead as long as you're on there.

[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.120]
Hey, what's it only take a second?

[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.920]
Yesterday they're playing Led Zeppelin whole lot of love.

[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.880]
Well, that's shocking.

[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.700]
Yeah, what's it talk up of KC in the background?

[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.840]
You know, doing his little thing, you know, what's done on the phone?

[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.260]
Oh, no.

[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.220]
Oh!

[00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.700]
And then they're slipping in another talk up with, uh, what's it named, Dan Quail, you know, I knew Jack Kennedy, you know, that, uh, we, you know, we told you from that.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.260]
Oh.

[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.500]
Mixing that all together.

[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.280]
Wow.

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.020]
Was this on Gondershow?

[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.000]
No, this was on, uh, it was about three o'clock.

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.460]
Oh, the, and the afternoons?

[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.720]
Yeah, about three o'clock.

[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.580]
Oh, no.

[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.440]

[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.580]
That's a bitter pill to swallow.

[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.300]
I'll tell you that.

[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.920]
Well, listen, by the way, I'm slapping, uh, unbelievable bumper stickers on all the rental cars I can find.

[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.200]
Okay, slap it.

[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.360]
And listen, uh, Glenn?

[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.020]
Yeah.

[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.620]
You're not a pretty rat.

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.460]
Take it easy, guys.

[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.400]
What?

[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.640]
I didn't get it.

[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.320]
I didn't either, but it must have been good.

[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.360]
Uh, 751, WIOD and D8, 524, WIOD, there's an opaline and brown, the Washington D.C. call is on.

[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.780]
Now, wait a minute, are you still there, Johnny?

[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.080]
Yeah.

[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.980]
Okay, hold on.

[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.840]
Hello.

[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.820]
Hello.

[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.400]
Yeah.

[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.180]
How you doing?

[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.180]

[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.780]
Okay.

[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.440]
Are you doing Neil Glenn?

[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.540]
We're doing okay, like I just said, you know?

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.320]
I'm on line three.

[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.560]
Yeah, you're on three.

[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.160]
Okay.

[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.460]
So when we put you back on hold in a second, you'll know.

[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.360]
Absolutely.

[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.500]
So what do you want?

[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.380]
Uh, just talking, guys, you know how nice it is up here today.

[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.460]
It's real rainy.

[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.860]
Yesterday was beautiful.

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.820]
Well, it's not as shining.

[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.720]
It's going to be about like 85, 88 today, something like that.

[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.460]
It's beautiful here.

[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.840]
People are morons, but it's beautiful.

[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.320]
Oh, you should see it up here.

[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.640]
There's restaurants, things to do.

[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.520]
It's great to be out of that town.

[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.920]
Yeah.

[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.540]
But, uh, just wanted to call, say hello, put another pin on the board from Washington, DC,

[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.200]
and wanted to call Marvin and Rick douchebag.

[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.880]
Okay.

[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.620]
Well, we'll put you, we'll put the pin right next to the Oli North Memorial pin next to our map.

[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.040]
Okay.

[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.620]
Put me on hold for a little while.

[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.320]
Right next to the federal penitentiary.

[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.440]
Okay, you want to be on hold?

[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.240]
For a little while.

[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.680]
Okay.

[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.000]
Well, he's on hold, John.

[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.760]
How do you like that?

[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.480]
That's amazing.

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.700]
I wasn't a good that we got that Zeta spy report before your call.

[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.160]
Yeah.

[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.840]
We got somebody on here that wants to talk to you.

[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.680]
How do you like that?

[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.020]
What's that?

[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.520]
What?

[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.500]
We got somebody on here wants to talk to you.

[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.340]
Can we do this?

[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.020]
Hey, Neil.

[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.760]
Johnny, are you there?

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.200]
I'm here.

[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.660]
Oh.

[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.740]
That's what, Johnny, would you please tell me on the board that way back when, um, that um,

[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.040]
Howard Stern did do a song called Johnny Dark to his coming to town?

[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.280]
Yeah.

[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.140]
What?

[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.480]
He didn't do that.

[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.700]
I sang that for Christmas.

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.460]
Oh, why don't you bring it in?

[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.500]
Because I like to hear it.

[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.720]
Because I don't have a copy of it.

[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.460]
Oh, come on.

[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.240]
I'm sure you do.

[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.800]
Come on.

[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.980]
I don't only, only Howard has a copy of that.

[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.200]
Oh, well, I've never really said.

[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.980]
Uh, well, I was in strike.

[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.640]
Okay.

[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.200]
All right.

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.740]
Thanks.

[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.380]
I'll wait a minute.

[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.340]
How am I going to do this?

[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.580]
Just a minute.

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.900]
Okay.

[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.200]
Amazing.

[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.040]
Yeah, I was.

[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.020]
And I was saying, I'm out of material before I started because you took away what I was calling about.

[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.460]
We took away your, we stole your thunder.

[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.780]
Yeah, I was going to, I was going to call up and get guests the, uh, the record.

[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.780]
Oh, well, how about.

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.400]
Oh, come on.

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.340]
Count me in.

[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.960]
No.

[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.120]
See, I even said that.

[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.000]
Count me in isn't on the, uh, CD and your guests in count me in.

[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.680]
Boy, you guys both have lost it.

[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.620]
You'll never get hired back and share our show to again.

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.260]
I'll tell you that.

[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.180]
Wow.

[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.120]
Did you hear us play the new colony six yesterday, John?

[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.560]
Yeah.

[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.160]
Well, I didn't know that that was on CD.

[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.120]
Isn't that great?

[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.900]
In fact, not only is it on CD.

[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.100]
I think I still got it here, but it's the you know how they have records on the front pictures of records on some of these CD

[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.120]
Oh, yeah, it's got the picture of that particular record

[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.320]
I'm mercury on that on that tan and um, wait a minute. Let me find it and didn't we lit it?

[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.800]
Yeah, I'm a lit on that tan and red remember with this kind of like stripes curved stripes. Oh, yeah

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.680]
I have a copy here. I'm sure you do probably have several

[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.840]
I don't know how people have baseball cards

[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.400]
Johnny dark is God he trades records like baseball cards

[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.000]
He stolen them from the best stations in America and many of most of them are in mint condition. They've never been touched by a needle

[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.740]
But the trouble is that that's way too much of a hit for the new colony six you have to go deeper into that CD

[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.420]
Oh deeper you have to go deeper and that's a lot of some of the ones that you know

[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.480]
We're not quite first of all. It's not a new colony six CD. It's a mercury collection volume three

[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.800]
45s on CD. This is a great collection by the way. I've got at least seven seven records here by the new colony

[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:12.740]
You don't have if I can get the crying shames on CD. I would just about kill for that. Yeah, but no luck. I have it on record

[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:20.600]
I got well anybody can get it on record. Did you hear I like it like that by Chris Kenner on CD? Oh, yeah

[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.320]
Wow God only knows what this country's come and do next and then some of those are actually original recordings

[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.640]
Yeah, one or two. Yeah, I love it when you play the ones that are echoey and have big audiences in the background

[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.260]
That were recorded in a garage well good. I got a whole bunch of those will play them all today

[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.200]
That'll kill some good time in between eating the Chinese food. Yeah, anyway. I'm totally out of material now

[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.320]
Okay, guys have a good weekend good day. Okay. There he goes Johnny dark now

[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.140]
That's not the Johnny dark that used to work on WMCA that is the Johnny dark that used to be a super sure

[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.040]
Fired boom boom can understand like that. Did he fire him? Yeah, wow. Yes, he did I

[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.120]
Guess he shed the wrong thing

[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.240]
Something like that 10 23 a W I do you okay up there now? Okay, hold on

[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.040]
I'd like to make sure our callers unhold are doing okay

[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.900]
We like to check on them once in a while because if anything happened we could call a paramedics or whatever

[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.020]
This Saturday it's tomorrow right at high a Leah you can not only see the Kentucky Derby

[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.380]
But you can bet on it too. I think I'm gonna call Dave Johnson a little later on in the show because I got his number in the ABC TV trailer

[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.800]
Mm-hmm and Dave was kind enough to send the post positions just moments after they were drawn at Louisville yesterday

[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.300]
So we had him first I would think Louisville Louisville as in a Louisville sluggish

[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:40.580]
You know boy Gary. Yeah, is that gonna be any ideas boy Gary like getting on a bus you can still make it

[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.520]
You can still make a well pack your sandwiches anyway

[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.620]
The Derby will be a telecast televised

[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.940]
What do they call it?

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.880]

[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.920]
Mm-hmm here. Well here. I'll give you the list

[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.900]
Those are the only come on now. Let's get serious also the feature tomorrow at highly will be the

$175,000 black Helen handicap Ravenella heads a field of that one and then on Sunday

[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.240]
It's the $50,000 dolphin handicap and I bet you so Joseph Gackie gets out for that one too

[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.240]
We got to talk about you on a second year about that article by Dave Hyde and don't forget

[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.680]
I know it's a little ways off but the last day of highly is racing season. That's a Sunday May 28th highly will feature free

[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:36.040]
Admission for all on that day so get out see and bet the Derby tomorrow post-time 1 p.m. at high a Leah the one that I kind of

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.060]
I'm just

[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.040]
Estonish about is the one that says Goldberg on cane

[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.060]
Yeah, so I think says I think he's one of the most more despicable people I've met

[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.900]
Neal's good. He's funny, but Steve's not a funny guy

[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.900]
What I don't like is he's an uninformed guy trying to bring attention to himself

[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:03.600]
Oh, I took real exception to him after going after Zagaki Joe works 60 to 70 hours a week does a great job cane does nothing

[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.240]
He gets his audience from Neal in the minute Neal leaves. He's back to a field goal

[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:08.960]
Who?

[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.960]
What a shot you brought Steve told us a made up and they were

[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:19.240]
No, not anymore and then Zagaki on Rogers. This is a good one. He's been doing the same thing for years now

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.940]
He rips the sales department on Monday. He rips management on Tuesday, huh?

[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.360]
And rips our department on Wednesday. It's part of a show

[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.140]
Now we don't just rip the sales department on Tuesday. Okay. That's where you're very wrong or Monday

[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.840]
Whatever he says speaking of that look at that here's

[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.380]
And God only knows

[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.900]
Now Disney's working on a in fact they got the bundled the big shots from Atlanta

[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.420]
They're working on a group session in San Diego. You know where they perform those little abotomies

[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.360]
I'm gonna send the entire sales department out there and just reach into their brains and pick out those little

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.140]
That's about little things. Yeah

[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.060]
So anyway, I'm sure a lot of you saw that and that'll

[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.700]
Saw all of the guy in Washington didn't see it right?

[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.920]
Is he gone? No, you did see it. How'd you see it? I was there just yesterday

[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.360]
Well, let's in this morning's paper

[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.900]
Oh, I'd get the paper up here too

[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.520]
Yeah, this is starting to sound real shaky now. You don't know Ali North do you?

[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.960]
We went out by the

[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.420]
Quarterhouse yesterday. There were a lot of reporters. We didn't get to see him though. Uh-huh

[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:29.120]
It was pretty wild over there. Does he call you once in a while? Alley now. No now

[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.020]
You sure now I never sent you any travelers checks or anything? No

[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.180]
Okay, hold on

[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.940]
Starting to sound real shady and on them send anyway that wasn't the record I had cute about one good Johnny hysterical

[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.360]
Oh, I know which one I had cute up

[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:51.880]
So anyway, they were doing on Zeta. I still can't get over that spy report about the doing talk-ups with Casey Kason and oh

[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.600]
Hey, this is uh, well

[00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.380]
That's about it. It's fighting in Georgia, Gassy

[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:08.800]
That wasn't bad not bad at all now. Bestie for a kid for a little kid can even do talk up now

[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.160]
That makes me mad what they're doing over there. So therefore I'm gonna retaliate today. Uh-oh now to mark our

[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.700]
Sixth month anniversary here at iode which is coming up in just a few days. Well, it's today because today

[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.340]
Well today is the fifth and we started a seventh. Whoa unless we're coming in on Sunday. No, we're not

[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:33.300]
So in honor of our six month anniversary, I'm gonna tell a story about Zeta that has never been told on the air before today

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.300]
shocking

[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.640]
Yes

[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.080]
That's about as exciting and Georgia's acid

[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.140]
Yeah, it's pretty tight huh little too tight

[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.020]
Not bad

[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:55.100]
That's the things that I say and do thanks again to my friends at specs for making this show livable today

[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.500]
Got this Dion thing. I'm gonna play all of them. I'm just gonna go nuts today

[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.440]
We've got a lot of calls on here, but who needs them right, but we better take these mobiles because they'll go away. Hello

[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.740]
Thank you. Thank you. It's about time right right? Right time. Jays enough is enough already right? You're gonna like this

[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.600]
Okay, um on sunday. I was listening to a show of Meg someone or other uh-huh

[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.240]
She uh she adores you. I don't know if you and believe me

[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.400]
She called you the king of talk radio. No, she's honest to God. She said you've brought

[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.340]
Thousands of listeners over to the station. You've done more for this. I'm being serious

[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.540]
Well, that makes she really has been sucking around lately hasn't she? No, she's great. She really is

[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.780]
She's never on the air, but she's great only time she gets on the air is when she calls her an area in the morning

[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.340]
Trying to get those free promos man desperate. Well, you know when you work here

[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.080]
You got to get promos anyway you can because it's always a big secret

[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.480]
She really wants a bat for you. I'll tell you not to bet to bat to bet for me

[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:54.100]
The bet for yes, you want to bat for you and no she really stuck up is one caller called in how could you be on the station and

[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.260]
That's what she wanted

[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:02.640]
You know these these douchebag what was it some old bag some old bag that called it was an old bag in a half yeah

[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:10.600]
Oh, Meg is so refined and so wonderful. How could you be on with that douche bag? Oh, Meg

[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.680]
Sad isn't so Meg

[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.400]
Dusty Rhodes is gonna be here today. He is the emergency

[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.620]
Says what it says in the Sun sent. I think nightmare is the word all look at that

[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.160]
He's back to that wrestling stuff

[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.400]
He Rhodes will he fit into the studio seat will he pound me?

[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.280]
Will he show up all you're wrestling itty. It's all of those me with an IQ of under two

[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.840]
Wrestling on the cane show today and of course Steve will be wrestling with his conscience all we can't after doing that show

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:44.860]
Was it on Monday that Hank and Joe were blasting someone or other I didn't I don't hear sports talk very often unless I'm in the car

[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.480]
Hank was running and raving. He called someone an asshole. He called Stephen asshole. Yeah

[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:55.740]
Yeah, it was really ramping and I never heard of and that was the nice part that was a compliment compared to the rest of it

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.760]
You know you two are very similar. I don't know if you

[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.500]
Is that you and Hank oh, yeah, you're very

[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:08.000]
Well, we're both fat. We both like the horses. There are some differences. I will say that right up front

[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.440]
You both had a breath you know you both had a lot of things that is correct. Yeah, we're both Jewish

[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.380]
We both don't go to shoul in fact Hank works on Shabbos just out of spite every week

[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.960]
Val your very nice boys and now you're real you really are I think doing a lot for the station

[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.860]
That's about as exciting as Joe's a gassy

[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.400]
Well, I think I'm more excited

[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.640]
Don't start now. Thank you very much

[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.300]
Okay, five don't start old Dave Hydle have another big expose next week

[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:43.760]
Let's see is there something on here that I want to play for oh, yeah, this is the one these guys. It's specs made our whole stinking show today, you know

[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.320]
1034 I

[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.540]
61

[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.980]
Oh, this is a great great. This is okay sounds great. Mm-hmm

[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:10.440]
And then this I think you can just look him right ahead on here. Don't can't you when she kiss me

[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.580]
I was born that she's that good by yeah, and I knew right

[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.820]
I was

[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.700]
1035 I'll tell you one thing you know bill wise. He's all excited because they got a good book over

[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.340]
They got another one of those fluke months of GTR and he's got all these did you see him on the wall? Yeah, you know

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:35.140]
That's pretty tacky, you know what I mean we go out of our way here to try to in fact even cleaned up the studio because Mike

[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.840]
What's his name from Atlanta came in today and he wanted to make it look like the place was really neat and refined

[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:48.340]
And we're not a bunch of slabs which we are and here spike wise got the wall with all these tacky posters with GTR bumper stickers on them with all the big numbers

[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.160]
GTR and then she and then Zeta weighed down in little tiny print of the bottom, you know

[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.320]
Which was a bitter pill for them to swallow over there

[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:01.940]
They've been swallowing a lot of bitter pills over there, you know what when you tell that disgusting story later on well little later on in the show

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.720]
We don't want to we don't like to release the good stuff right in the beginning

[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.200]
We like to kind of hold back something that's right by the way if you weren't listening yesterday

[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.560]
We got the Palm Beach book here and we kicked some serious ass on this show and Palm Beach in the book

[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.580]
Okay, which is why nobody would send it to us

[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.200]
But we have a Palm Beach spy who passed it long and

[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.600]
In all the meaningful demographics we kicked the daylights out of JNO

[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.380]
Out of PBR in fact out of the both of them put together my favorite let's see 10 to 3

[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.200]
My favorite number there's one that's higher 18 to 34 men

[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.680]
But in person's

[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.460]
25 to 54

[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.360]
Midday we had a 5 3 and JNO had a 2 3 PBR had a point six

[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.600]
So we doubled the two of them put together just about okay that our mark is yeah

[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.540]
It's not even our market and we beat the crap out of you fakers up there in Palm Beach, okay?

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.880]
In men why am I mentioning this again because I like it

[00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:00.380]
You get a bad chick us they don't want us to know this exactly that John Fakano that paranoid douchebag up there at JNO

[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.380]
Men 25 to 54 we had a and only an 8 3

[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.800]
In a Palm Beach book JNO had a 3 9 and PBR had a 1.2

[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.260]
So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, okay?

[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.600]
We do have a lot of people in Palm Beach for just a bunch of anti-social morons, okay?

[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.360]
Now we are two dumb to dial the number we are sending this by a

[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.260]
Gold star in a purple jelly. Yeah two of them. Yeah. Yeah 1037 a W I O D

[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.840]
Charhot is open right now as we speak so those of you who are starving physically as well as mentally

[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.720]
We invite you to go over to char hot and get out of that junk food habit there is

[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.180]
Too bad we don't have time to play the whole record

[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.600]
Oh

[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.740]
Thinking about the difference between F and A

[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.440]
We were on F

[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:57.280]
You did the talk ups and then you played the record don't wreck a.m. You do the talk up. We don't play the record

[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.600]
That's the difference right?

[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.680]
Yeah, that's basically different plus on the FM you could hear both channels, but other than that

[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.060]
That

[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.520]
That was shocking I even surprised myself

[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.740]
It's 1040 at W I O D the neo-rodger show with the Glenn Hill the bird

[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.820]
Just mention that because then because then boy gear didn't have to do a whole thing about I don't know what show their

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.660]
Most in your name. Yeah, that's why we do so well

[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:29.620]
Okay, that's why we have these gigantic numbers because they don't know the name of the station or the frequency or what they're listening to you know

[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:36.040]
Just please you know boy gear they even know I know this is credible and he's I can believe me

[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.800]
For a second they even know by the way where's my check?

[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.240]
They even know who comes on after us. Where's my check?

[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.180]
Hank Goldberg knows who comes on after us

[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:51.560]
Uh, is anybody in a building got my check like Cheryl because I know we got these big wigs and all these big powwows and

[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:57.900]
Confabs going on, but I I like to start early on this because they do have a tendency to forget don't they every Friday

[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.640]
It's like a big it's embarrassing to have to talk about it in the air

[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.920]
Uh, wait a minute don't I keep it in the wrong one there. It must be a reason for that. You know what I'm saying?

[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.040]
Are you there? Yeah, I'm still here. Okay

[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.160]
Um, but it's just something I got to do because it's the only way I get it

[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.600]
If I didn't talk about it on the year, I'd never get the check

[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.920]
See I could go in a hallway and do it inside private, but then they'd look at me and laugh

[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.660]
But on the air it's kind of like there's a lot of public pressures

[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:23.700]
That way

[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.620]
Okay, let's take this mobile if there's still I can't believe I'll leave old. I'm still here. Well, you're incredible

[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.320]
Neil Burg, K-Thow

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.480]
Yeah, you're doing good easy for you to say listen

[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.980]
I was gonna call and guess everybody loves the clown for the actual thing. Yeah, that was

[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.240]
You're gonna have your last acid you're gonna have your i95 acid casuality

[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:03.360]
I wouldn't let me go. Yeah, that's right. Hey, but wait a minute wait a minute at least they were honest, okay

[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.480]
They didn't pull one of these deals where they pretend like they're gonna let you win and then just as you start

[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.860]
Trying to work your way and then they floor it, you know, they didn't do that. I feel like I want to go back to New York

[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:19.020]
Oh, no, don't say that wait. I want to prove what I said that New York is like 50 billion pounds of garbage

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:23.380]
You know, it's you don't want to go back there. I mean just because they got all kinds of things going on and it's a lot of fun

[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.360]
That's no excuse

[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.160]
I just want to prove to my dish bag causing Gary that it's me

[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.300]
Wow

[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.280]

[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.840]
That's true if you want to be on the same line that Johnny dark call

[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.540]

Long way down

[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.160]
Oh

[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.180]
This is a this is a tough one

[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.840]
Kids you know want to try this at home. No, whatever you do now next week

[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.540]
We made do an hour of letting the audience try talk-ups

[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:50.080]
But don't practice at home if we can alone unless you're accompanied by an adult over 90 with blue hair and blue shoes

[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.580]
Because you could just absolutely devastate yourself

[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.600]
Like that

[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.260]
With now it's just you can't really do it because it's

[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:06.680]
You know it's constant. It's a never really sounds clean. I thought it was pretty good. Yeah, it was but it wasn't

[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.660]
My feelings are hurt. Oh

[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.360]
Very difficult

[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.040]
Huh the other one was very difficult, but it was there. I mean it just there's like a whole bunch of something starting at the same

[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.440]
Yes, now this one I guarantee is nailed

[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.220]
See can mess around with me once but

[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.660]

[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:30.240]
I mean, he didn't even do up here today. It's raining. You didn't even listen to how it's during this morning. No

[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.840]
I caught a little bit of John Debella last night on TV. Oh, if you catch John Debella you got to go to a specialist

[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.140]
Hold on pal hold on and that sound like

[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.140]
Some kind of a venereal disease John Debella

[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.300]
Okay, I don't I don't want to talk to these people. I want to play music

[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.080]
Little bit

[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.960]
I want to know where my check is

[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.020]
And I want to know where the Chinese boot is too other than that

[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.240]
You know you drive me wild

[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.200]
You're such a little evil child

[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.080]
Now I want you to listen

[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:20.980]
I want you to listen to the what's that what are those seven and a half eight and a half and nine what are those

[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.800]
I'm judging your oh

[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:30.240]
I got you know, it's Friday Roger. I'm not that sharp on Friday that I can follow that. No, but I've got now

[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.000]
I want you to listen to the instrument and see if it doesn't sound like

[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.540]
Zamfire the pan flute

[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.240]
On this freaking I listen

[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:39.700]
Yeah

[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.200]
Very similar

[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:54.960]
It never saw Zamfire and Dion together either did you kid so that I think there's a lot of my questions

[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.300]
Okay, both those Palm Beach lines are open, but you know something I don't care now that we have the Palm Beach book in hand

[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.800]
We see that we're just absolutely knocking their butzop up there

[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:04.960]
We don't

[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.920]
Fear a lot of noise in the background. I'm opening these don't you think there's a better way to package CDs

[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.000]
Don't you think if you know they've been around long enough now like two years ago

[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.880]
We were saying pretty soon they'll come up with a better way to package him

[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.760]
They do this so that people don't kids don't steal them. That's really the main reason they make them so big

[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.160]
But wouldn't there be a better way?

[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.140]
You know

[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:32.060]
The AST open up a CD I mean by the time you get through rip in his cardboard and shredding your fingernails and

[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.500]
Standing on your head your apoplectic now do I have time to read the radio?

[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:45.780]
How does the girl would say no after our break okay after the break is I want to talk about Toyota of Hollywood where the previous caller who knows Brian Epstein Jr

[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.820]
Uh, he said he got a great deal and you will too when you deal a Toyota of Hollywood

[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.520]
See if it sounds like I'm obsessed when that jingle ends you know, yeah, it's a shame not to come back with music

[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:01.760]
I

[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.480]
See I wasn't gonna let it happen twice in the same show. I got burned early right at the beginning

[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.320]
I was not gonna get burned twice in a row

[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:23.980]
Anyway, we're really Gary Lewis and a playboy is intensive today because Steve did that show on Jerry Lewis a couple of days ago

[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:30.900]
And we're just delighted to give Gary all the all the publicity he wants and probably BMI and ASCAP are setting him back like crazy too

[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.620]
Miami hello, hey Neil hasn't hang it okay

[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.680]
Well, they're okay. They'll be all right

[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.660]
Joseph khaki does really suck, but oh come on now that's terrible to say. I mean even if it is true

[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.760]

You didn't want to bother me while I was on a year. I got news for it when it this comes first

[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.440]
Go ahead

[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.160]
Alice Rantel has

[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:10.740]
Rick trash

[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.560]
Trashman

[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.840]
Yeah

[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:19.000]
Former he's related to Gene Cash. Yeah, Rick Trashman who I saw a few weeks ago

[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.580]
The Trashman didn't they do Serpent Bird? Yeah, former Navy officer who blew the whistle on Duff and abuse

[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:29.440]
That's the exciting Alice shudts. Now how did I want some spy reports on his show with Jerry Butler?

[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:35.700]
Yeah, how did that go? The ugly Harry Pornos star who's a little on the who seems a little on the swishy side

[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:41.600]
Anyway, there's one more that I have a question about you in the radio highlights. He don't seem on a swishy side

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:47.640]
630 tonight by the way, I want you to look at Gary Lewis seeing this disc look at his

[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:54.340]
His lips and his chin. Was that it? No seriously. Does that have Jerry Lewis written all over it? Sure. He's got that

[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.560]
Jerry Lewis a chin and we apologize to him for that. He wasn't only traumatized in Vietnam

[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.780]
He was traumatized every time he looks in a mirror and he thinks of his dad and he breaths all over himself

[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:10.200]
Okay, go ahead Alice Rantel has got no he just picked me up. There's just one I want to ask you about

[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:17.220]
I'm not going to go through all the V's 630 tight on WJNO AM 12. Oh, yeah, my favorite station Doug young

[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.060]
Is doing a show that's what it is oh my god

[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.840]
Holy Toledo as Keith Isley would say holy Toledo

[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.980]
Yeah, it is shocking

[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.000]
Ha ha ha

[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.400]
Now that's an easy one okay what it's a tie well

[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.720]
Yeah, but anybody who can't talk up this time in a ring has got to be has got to probably know Joseph Gackie

[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:51.560]
I don't dislike anybody in the sports department. I like him all oh sure

[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.240]
Joseph good guy. I mean, he just a little uptight and surly, but he's a good guy

[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.420]
In spite of those horrible things he said about this show, but we do the same thing every day

[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.340]
They's Friday. He didn't mention what we do on Fridays

[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.740]
Okay, and then he can say he rips me every Friday. We'll make it like a ritual

[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.360]
And Hank is just Hank is you remember when he first came here and Steve was feuding with Hank and I said

[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.860]
I don't understand how anybody can feud with Hank because he's just a super guy. Yeah a super guy

[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.640]
He is, but he and Steve like it's not just for make believe it's for real. I hate each other hate

[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.280]
Yeah, you should have heard what Hank said about Steve

[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.020]
But when I was up at the track last Saturday. I can't repeat it on the air

[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:32.420]
But they hate each other. Yeah, and you should have heard what Steve said about Hank in here last Monday

[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.760]
But beside that well, that's good and maybe we could get a Hank with dusty roaches after

[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.580]
Then you'd see some serious

[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.020]
Fisticuffs, okay, then you'd see some serious pounding into the ground as they say

[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.200]
Okay, the Palm Beach lines are very mellow

[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.000]
They're just kind of hanging loose and we understand that we did very well in the book in Palm Beach

[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.360]
So we're feeling we're feeling our oats as they say

[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:58.840]
Um speaking of oats. We got Chinese food coming in hopefully very very soon

[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:06.000]
Okay, what is it now did we miss something? We only got like two we made the sun set no two

[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.600]
Whoo the John Levit show

[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.060]

I'm not gonna say anything

[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.000]
With aim

[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.600]
It's 1117 at WIOD and this is a special request from Johnny dark

[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.500]

[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.140]

Holly Wally doodle all the day

[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:14.340]
God

[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.800]
They're paying us to do this

[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:30.120]
Okay, that's a great record. I'm sure glad I found it see on some of these oldies collections is where you'll find some really good stuff

[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.980]
See you won't find a CD of the new colony sixes hits

[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.360]
Because they didn't have any I mean need this one well. They had that

[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.640]
But I mean, I don't think they had any other ones that I can think of and I'd rather than have some pain in

[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.800]
He asks pseudo intellectual calling will look it up in the he said we had to go deeper things

[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.160]
I'd like to say

[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:55.040]
Was a bigger head reach number 16, but I don't I'm sure if I heard it. I'd remember it, but I don't it doesn't

[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.780]
Yeah, you would and I will always think about you only reach number 22 with six week on a chart

[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:05.000]
1168 see the reason I remember it is because 68 69 were the two years. I was in Kalamazoo

[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.480]
at WTPS, which is now

[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.760]
WBUK or some godforsaken country station

[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.300]
But that was great. I was the general manager the program director

[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.320]
I pulled an airship everything and I used to type the logs

[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.520]
Yeah, seriously do production to and every night we used to drive to Detroit to go to the track

[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.620]
So I was kind of busy

[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.780]
Not seriously. It was in a house and when I went there they were like up to their ears and dead and it was kind of like

[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:38.240]
PBR it didn't show in its own market in other words WLS out of Chicago used to beat them

[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.920]
In the book. Mm-hmm. Seriously. They sure know that was pulse in Palm Beach and then in the six months

[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.440]
We were number one in the market. Hmm fact. I remember when I came in and we started playing all this music

[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.940]
That a lot of these people never heard including a lot of Motown. They said oh that'll never fly here

[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.700]
We don't have about black people in Kalamazoo

[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:59.140]
Well first of all black people don't listen to Motown anyway. That's white people's black music, right?

[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.200]
That's why black people don't listen to Motown. I mean some of them do

[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:08.040]
If they live like in the upper rent district, you know, they want to try to pretend to be white people something like that

[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.160]
But black people have got their own music, right? They listen to like the dead milkman

[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:13.900]
And stuff like that

[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:19.540]
Anyway, it's 20 past 11 at WIOD. We have an open line in Boko, which is really a shocking

[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.860]
2789 463 278 WIOD

[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:26.780]
We're just kind of killing some time until I think we got to call Dave Johnson

[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.720]
Got you got a lot of calls there, but I think they can wait

[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.380]
Oh, let's see one

[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:34.860]
two

[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.000]
What was that?

[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.920]
I know idea wow couldn't hear it on the air

[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.560]
Anyway, it's 20 past 11

[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:53.420]
And the Hank Goldberg is going to sneak in on a cane show this afternoon and duke it out and dusty roads will save Steve from being pounded in the ground

[00:36:53.420 --> 00:37:00.100]
They had to restrain Joe physically. Oh my god. I'm gonna put this. It's ringing

[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.820]
So she'll put it on the air

[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.140]
Because they might get apoplectic. Hi, is Dave Johnson around?

[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.860]
Dave is not around, but I can leave a message for him. Okay, tell him we're on the year by the way

[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.720]
This is Neil Rogers at WIOD in Miami

[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:20.080]
And Dave was kind enough yesterday. He called me with the after the draw was for the post positions for the Derby

[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.760]
And he left the number and so I thought I'd give him a call and maybe he'd call us back on the air, okay

[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.060]
When oh, anyway, we're on till two time anytime until two okay, give me your name again

[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.960]

Right in fact, what I'll do is I'll put you on hold and then my

[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.860]
Board operator can give you our hotline number. So Dave you know if he's got time

[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.160]
It's not a big deal, but I just thought we'd chat for a couple of minutes about the Derby okay, hold on one second

[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.120]
I appreciate it. Okay, that's on the bat line give her the

[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.840]
Bat line number and maybe Dave can call us back

[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.540]
21 past 11 at WIOD

Well, we got all kinds of that we got several something's going on knowing

[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:06.560]

[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.200]
By Jerry Lewis on the playboy

[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:23.660]
Oh, that's what we always like is a real comedian, you know, hey deal. I like to make a request

[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.000]
Very Madelow for Alice and have the Copa oh

[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.760]
That was nasty sir, but of course it does fit

[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.860]
It does fit Neil listen to that

[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.520]
I didn't do a thing. Just kind of like started by itself again

[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:40.940]
shocking

[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.700]
You got to admit you like Gary Lewis in the playboy. I do. Yeah, see I can tell you sound like the kind of guy who like Gary

[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:54.500]
The best show a South Florida radio bar none and is there any question about that? Oh, there's no such thing

[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.060]
So what does that tell you about the rest? Okay, this show is pathetic

[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.740]
No, it's okay in 25

[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:05.400]
Neil what? Oh, Neil you're not listening that well. Well, neither is anybody else

[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.380]
You have to say I mean you tinkled all over us and I was growing

[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.660]
You noticed when Tom Durkin called yesterday he was saying tinkle

[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:17.560]
I mean here's the public address announcer at the metal lands a legend in his own time and he's saying tinkal

[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.760]
No, he's great. He and Dave Johnson like I don't want to go into it again, but they're both so good

[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.220]
I'm in all of them. It's kind of awe inspiring

[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.960]
I was gonna call up and say Neil. This is your listener, but you know

[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.700]
But you know, but the thing you didn't right have been a real short song. We better give me the gong right yeah

[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:39.180]
Neil and 25 words or more. Let's have your callers call up and say why I like the Neil Rogers show is oh

[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.180]
God and that's the kind of thing that Steve would do okay. Oh, no, I don't do that kind of stuff

[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:49.100]
No, you need it. You need to see what happened call and say why they hate the cane show okay, which would kill four good hours

[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:54.360]
No, Neil I've listened my bell. Steve is you know, he's had some problems. You're insecure Neil

[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.320]
See Steve is a kind of guy now that we're on the same station and we get along fine

[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.840]
But I there's something about Steve and I think this is what Hank does to Steve is the kind of guy you enjoy

[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:10.060]
Ripping I don't know what it is, but they're just something about Steve. I don't know what it is

[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.500]
You know, you know, it is joy ripping him because he deserves it

[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.900]
You know what it is with Steve Neil the longer you look him you realize the man has a little or no time

[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.960]
That's that isn't true. He's got some talent there somewhere. I don't know where it is now come on

[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.480]
Let's see now you're being create all you you guys out there find a little opening or right away

[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.840]
You assume we're inviting you to rip one of our colleagues plan. Now what were you saying what?

[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:39.360]
I think it's time to rip one. Oh have a nice day sir. God. I mean that's getting really carried away

[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.400]
It's one thing to rip Steve because Steve can handle it

[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.440]
But when you rip somebody who just can't deal with it

[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.480]
It becomes hysterical and starts pacing the floor like the cubs were losing or something

[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.160]
Yeah, I actually got a good night's sleep last night

[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.880]
You know what because the game was early it was a daytime game it ended six 20-yard time and they won four nothing

[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:01.000]
And it was relatively painless and Balecki pitch went all the way so to speak and it was it was great

[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.720]
God it was good

[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.100]
No, that doesn't happen very often. I got my cubs cap on by the way

[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.700]
I feel like I got my check now so after we eat I can go home

[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:16.100]
Because they're playing tonight on the west coast. They're playing L.A. for three which means three consecutive losses

[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:17.260]
what

[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.340]
Hmm

[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:25.480]
Did you ever do the Zeta thing you were gonna do? Are you holding that back? Okay, that's coming up ladies and gentlemen

[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.800]
We're holding it back. We're waiting for the audience to build

[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:34.120]
They want you to go to your telephone directory right now call everyone you know from four eight assholes to

[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.420]
whatever

[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:41.980]
25 past 11 at W.I.D. The only open line on the board is in Palm Beach where we're just kicking kicking

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:45.960]

Re-enacted live yesterday and during the game they came back at the end of a half inning

[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.600]
Early and Harry didn't realize he was on yet and they had this shot of these two

[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.780]
Very voluptuous young ladies. This is in San Diego in their bathing suits and some young guy with him

[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:47.060]
And he says to Steve he says see that one on a left-steed that's my kind of woman

[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.040]
And he didn't realize he had no idea he was on here and then there was about a three second pause

[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.840]
Harry Carrie back at Jack

[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.900]
No idea that it was on it was great. Yeah, he almost came close to that. Yeah

[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.300]
I'm sure you did because of course we're still very good buddies. Oh, yeah

[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:47.500]
And you know life goes on of course. How about DJ DJ don't come around since you can't get any more free meals I understand anyway

[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.020]
Yeah, listen I tried to call you the other day. I've had a very rough week and

[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.580]
I was trying to get through to you from a yeehaw junction and I thought the bird could relate to that

[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:07.900]
I had a problem. He's from Lakeland so he's seen a lot of yeehaw's in his time. Yeah, it should be Yahoo!

[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.340]
By the way if anybody been on a turnpike lately outside of the immediate area

[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.360]
I mean I know they increased the toll here a little bit

[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:19.660]
But when you go upstate like when you go to Orlando it used to be four somewhere that's like

[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.260]
755 now to go they've like almost doubled the rates on the turnpike

[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.900]
I can say I didn't have to pay anything because I had my vehicle my brand new vehicle

[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.460]
Toad all the way from yeehaw's junction down to the dealer that I bought the vehicle from

[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:40.240]
Why the strangest story ever told it was only a $440 telling bill. You have had a roughly

[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.520]
We brought it right to the to the showroom door and

[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.200]
Set it there for a little while that everybody take a look at it and it was real interesting good

[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:54.100]
And I didn't make a mistake, you know, I want to be patriotic and oh that's what I figured stay with the

[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.000]
Now you can't American vehicle and

[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]
It might not be as bad

[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.300]
Everyone says it is

[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.420]
It is though, you know, I listen to you all the way down from

[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.820]
Mickey land and

[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:08.660]
I was up there on a little business. I visited MGM studios

[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.940]
I don't want to hear about it because I got preempted from that. I had a freebie there last weekend

[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.760]
But you know, I was department here at some other ideas. What is the story?

[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.240]
They sent Uncle Mike up there to do the show, right? No, I'm not talking about the show

[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.740]
But I had like a weekend and the hotel and everything and they just they keep setting up all these remotes every I don't mind doing the

[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.300]
Remotes I enjoy it, but I'd like to do it at a time that's convenient

[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:34.480]
Of course for me. I know that's shocking, but that would be nice

[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:41.880]
Uh, and then Lynn and fried ass. What can I hear the how does person for dates on every most there's only two dates out of the whole year

[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.920]
Other than my vacation that I you know didn't want to do one and that's when she gets it, you know

[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.640]
Well, you know so to speak when you're when you're

[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.840]
A peon, you know, it really doesn't matter. I was right. Show so much weekend. Yeah, you know

[00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.200]
Bird I went I happened to go through I had to go over to Tampa and St. Pete and I had to go through

[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.800]
Blakeland. Yes, on the way over to Orlando and yes, I saw the billboard

[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.220]
Lakeland home of the bird and

[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.480]
Was it a bitter pill to swallow each other? I got a nice

[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.960]
I went by you know, not actually a billboard. It's kind of like

[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.020]
Well, it's somebody holding the sign

[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.900]
Holly-Wolly doodle all the day

[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.660]
Exactly. Hey could have been your mother or something. I don't know

[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.580]
I doubt that

[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.500]
I was up at MGM

[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:34.500]
I was discussing possibly a remake of one of my dad's movies again

[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.100]
starring you and they want to possibly do GI blues

[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.740]
I'm on the verge of dropping a whole bunch of carts here. So if you

[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:47.940]
Don't take it personally, you know, I'm saying I won't I won't listen. It sure has been a lot of fun

[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:53.020]
I haven't got any idea of anything that you said, but it sure as usual is pretty cool

[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.480]
Did you happen to see more poopy? No, I don't watch morey poopy

[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.260]
They had something on it. They under his show Tuesday night. I was watching the hotel room and I was

[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:07.320]
At the last part of the show, you know, he usually goes out with well these cute little teasers or whatever

[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.960]
They had a female impersonator of my daddy

[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.300]
Now it struck me oiled viral and it really did look like him

[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:20.520]
And I don't know what this woman is proud about but it really did look like him right near the way

[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.200]
Well, I see your blow in the story this supposed to be a big secret

[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.400]
But after the operation is when and he disappeared, you know, I was wondering about it. It's a little bit too embarrassing

[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.820]
I was gonna ask you could it be that he's coming out of the closet now after the after the big one

[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.220]
There is an all-zone provocateur. I a

[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.400]
Listen, have a wonderful life

[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.040]
And it sure is really really something here in your voice again

[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.300]
What the hell was that?

[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.600]
Wasn't that a little bit loose?

[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.980]
Those little drumpies. Oh, there's little tick there in the beginning

[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.700]
Oh, this is for the guy who's so excited because he heard the pet news gun on any of the other day

[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.060]
Yeah, but we don't have time to play it

[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.620]
1153 at W.O.D. Dale Murphy got a hit for the Braves yesterday

[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.540]
That's the big news. Dale's now heading probably about 205 or he's

[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:13.960]
Struggling the struggling lady wants to call up how you doing? Oh, what's your name? There's April. Mm-hmm

[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:15.560]

[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:35.360]

[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:42.040]
pseudo religious shows and of all the best of nil it says the day after stand fills in on a cane show. Oh

[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.900]

And of course we'll be out at Boats our restaurant from noon to three while that's on the air so that'll be really exciting

Well, I'll be glad to put you back on hold

[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.520]
Curious I have a question. I'm almost afraid to hear the answer to that's not that song that you play occasionally

[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.960]
I want to die in Florida. Mm-hmm

[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.420]
Is that for is that for real?

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:07.280]
Is that a is that a real type that somebody tried to market? No

[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.480]
Now that's a it's just a bit. It's something and you know who gave it to me now. I had no idea

[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.840]
Haha John levit

[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.000]
Ah years ago. Yeah, he uh, that's fashion. He wrote it

[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.240]
And of course, I can't think of anybody better suited to write it now that's a perfect bit

[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:28.800]
But it's recorded so well. It sounds like something. I mean it's recorded so poorly to sound like something real well

[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.220]
I was done in somebody's basement

[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.620]
John used to hang around a lot in basements. I thought I heard a toilet flush in the background. Mm-hmm

[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.100]
I get a little flush every time I hear it. Uh, yeah

[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.080]
Um

[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:47.720]
In fact, we're getting our call from flushing in the next hours that all kind of fits together that flushing matters or flushing just just plain flushing

[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.720]
Just plain flushing going down the tubes again

[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:56.880]

[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.200]
Like I said yesterday don't blame the kids for his incompetence, right?

[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:41.220]
Kids don't program that station

[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.760]
Okay, go ahead. I'm sorry. I get carried away. I have never told this story

[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.940]
We told a lot of stories about what they did to us over at Zeta

[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:53.440]
I never told this one story and I would like to tell the entire world this story really

[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.500]
Well, we were shocked we were at Zeta 4

[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.860]
Uh in the spring of 1988

[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:06.400]
We were the number one morning show in South Florida every really category. Huh every category

[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:13.480]
The show was sold out. We accounted for 30% of their revenue. According to them. I would say probably 50%

[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:19.700]
At two radio stations they even admit we accounted for 30% of the revenue the show was sold out

[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.240]
We had big expensive national accounts

[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.820]
We were just we were incredible. You mean sponsored somebody was really paying for?

[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:32.380]
On Zeta that was unique. You mean it wasn't the ad team for like 15 bucks a pop

[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.220]
Come on, so um

[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:40.940]
I understand they got a new gimmick over there selling dollar a holiday they're bringing that back. Go ahead

[00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:46.040]
Anyway, do you remember those little microphones that they used to have what do they call those remember years ago

[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.800]
They had those little white microphones many many years ago

[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:55.060]
No, seriously what the hell did they call those the white mic I think they called it and that was like like

[00:56:55.060 --> 00:57:00.440]
50 cents of spot or something they would take up the whole station and just saturate it with spots

[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.120]
I don't know okay for that

[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.020]
Go ahead. Sorry. Well, it's before your time anyway. I um

[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.680]
I felt that I was underpaid for the uh

[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:13.200]
Job that we were doing what job were you doing?

[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.980]
What was your job description would you like to tell us what it was I did the news

[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:26.020]
You did and yeah, the news when you used to butcher all those words stuff. I it left

[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.660]
I was the mortar between the bricks

[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:37.080]
Over there at Zeta I was the mortar between the story okay the story was that right away

[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.540]
I'm eating on the ear. This is bad radio

[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.860]
I shouldn't be doing this not because we got some hot shots in here from Atlanta my

[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:46.240]
Job description was morning news. That's how it was described officially

[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:50.940]
Now the last two guys that we're in there you are getting so carried away with yourself

[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:56.940]
It's just since they wrote that thing in Metro magazine and hasn't been the same you ask nobody reads Metro magazine

[00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:00.740]
I never mentioned met nobody ever heard of Metro magazine

[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.340]
So do you started talking about it go ahead

[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.460]
So anyway, Mike

[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:13.760]
The last two guys that were in the position of only you're doing this story for Disney because you said he was a douchebrain

[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:22.060]
There's a moronny at the brains of a pig me the last two guys in this position were

[00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:28.320]
Ace Young as a matter of fact who oh yeah, I think we're gonna have some stuff on him and who was that idiot that

[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:33.700]
We threw out that was in that position when we went over to Zeta there was some what was his name

[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:41.480]
That guy who in what position Lawrence wanted to throw in you to do your news and you said absolutely no way and they kicked them out and

[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:45.600]
He's doing tennis now. What was that guy's name?

[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.040]
Jeff Chase chase okay

[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.460]
Now these were the last two guys to tell him a story and I got to give all the name

[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.540]
They were paid X number of dollars

[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:03.240]
That's not what they paid me they paid me so far under what they paid these last two guys. You mean this is the story?

[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.040]
No, oh who got

[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:09.200]
These guys got like one ratings and we were number one okay

[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.520]
But the story does have to do with money

[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:18.100]
I just want to tell you that at this radio station we had a five five

[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:24.560]
Mid and this is not an anti-Chef Ganger story. This is an anti-management story, you know

[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.200]
Sharon just wrote on the screen here the bird is being ponderous

[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:34.020]
This is the longest preface even in Warren peace. They didn't have a preface like this. It isn't a preface

[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:38.920]
The longest build-up. It better be Dan Good now. Oh god. So you were underpaid

[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:44.620]
Oh, I appreciate it. It is they didn't speak to you. They hated this. Yeah, they hated all of us

[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:48.340]
So I would go into it. We got it made now because even Phil Coston speaks to us now

[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:53.360]
It only took six months, but now he's speaking to us. So we're really doing it now since the book came out

[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.460]
You notice only since the book came out

[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:56.740]
So

[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:03.540]
Well, it's just that I felt very unappreciated very underpaid now used to yell that's the story. No, no, no

[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.440]
No, gee the story is

[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.060]
That Jeff guns or who was on who is still on midday and had ones

[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:16.840]
The ratings in the nine o'clock hour used to go from the high fours to the ten o'clock hour to the high ones

[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.100]
This man had no spots on his show. It was a vast wasteland

[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:24.400]
It was nothing had ratings in the one he was nothing

[01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:32.580]
He's an all-john provocateur exactly and they paid the story is they paid this man Jeff guns are

[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:33.780]
Double

[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:40.360]
What they paid me that's what I want this this story. That's what I want the whole world to know. Oh

[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.800]
Gee, well, Holly Wally doodle all the day

[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.540]
I want the whole world to know that because it used to cross my ass every day

[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:52.740]
Oh, it's not like we're late for lunch. Disney's are getting hysterical for lunch because that's what he does best

[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:58.940]
Is it those executive launches he does it like nobody exactly well a little bit of that to Henry's probably waiting over there with a little

[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.840]
Something to wash it down. We wanted to hear that story. Okay. Nice seeing you and stay out of trouble

[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.080]
They both want to hear that story. Okay, listen

[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.620]
It's 11 past noon. I apologize for this

[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.460]
No, he is all thunder all of

[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.640]
I want everybody to know

[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.920]
I from Atlanta the new big guy

[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.760]
Whatever his name is Pupik and he's standing here waiting for something to tell them in front of management

[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.800]
Yeah, they can relate to that because he told me boy

[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.740]
We're really you're bleeding us with this

[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:28.160]
We don't mind paying you but this bird brain in there

[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.960]
I'll never forget when Gilbertson and just went on and on and on with that memo about

[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.880]
He doesn't need some cackle you know there. Oh, geez

[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.060]
We could tell stories about that place forever. I just wanted to tell him

[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:45.100]
I think yesterday's memo that somebody intercepted somewhere. I think that spoke for itself. I couldn't do that

[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:51.220]
Okay, we have an open line in day 7519463. We'll get to those calls and I really again apologize

[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.780]
Profusely don't apologize. Are you nuts? I wanted him to know okay?

[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.700]
You just say

[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.120]
Gonzer who's a no talent nice guy, but with no talent no audience was making more money than I was

[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.820]
I wanted him to know how much more ragged out and make a big long

[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:13.540]
It's out of it. A lot of people listening didn't listen to us

[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:18.440]
In fact, the body is knew that you were getting paid to do this. They'd probably really be laughing. Okay, they'd go nuts

[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.860]
I wanted that out. I do apologize for taking up a few minutes. Okay, well, they do the law all the day

[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.860]
But I wanted that out thanks for the patience. We do have a break to do

[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.440]
I'm sorry that we don't have time to continue

[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:35.380]
I think the audience for their patience very much today. I do that very nice of you. Thank you ladies and gentlemen

[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:41.780]
I'll never tell it again. Please. Is that a promise? Is that a plate? I wanted it out. Okay. I wanted it in public

[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.060]
I did

[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:50.480]
Leave me alone. Are you through? Oh, do you're a little break and yeah

It's 1213 at W.I.O.D. We'll be right back

[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:04.580]
I think this kind of fits in with that story

[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:10.900]
Oh, yeah, you finally got through with that laundry story. This is what everybody turns

[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.520]
Well, again, I want to thank the audience for their

[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.660]
stream patience

[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.560]

And I said boy, you sure fit the role now. He's a good guy. What's this guy? They might go public from Atlanta?

[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:38.820]
I don't know. I said got another Irishman man. They hire all Irishmen in this company. I don't want to start a thing

[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:44.520]
It's 1218 at W.I.O.D. and let's go to Davy. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yeah

[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.560]
Well you know

Now the reason that I like this song is

[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:18.800]
I know why well I was in the exorcist and it was the scene where the priest the young priest and the old priest were sitting in the bar with Henry Burrow

[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:23.760]
And the young priest was saying he was losing his faith and Henry said shut up and keep drinking

[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.440]
It was shocking

[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:35.020]
20 past no to w ID something wrong in the building though because today everybody is so friendly

[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.340]
If you notice that it gets yeah, there's something I don't know

[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.880]
It's called sucking around a little bit too much. Okay, they are because Gail Bright said to me

[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.140]
She said boy your show is so great. We always have it on we always listen in the newsroom

[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:52.580]
Which I mean Gail's very nice. They're all nice in the newsroom. Okay. Is Andy gone by the way?

[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.580]
They can vacation

[01:05:55.460 --> 01:06:00.080]
What was that all about that Roger was feeding us that crap about how Andy was leaving or something?

[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.740]
He's not going anywhere is he he is I didn't hear that

[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.400]
Okay, here comes the message now see when we do these long pauses

[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:11.720]
Andy will be yeah, he's going someone gone

[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.800]
Soon. Yeah, well like what you mean voluntarily

[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.640]
Yeah, he's leaving us voluntarily

[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.460]
Bigger and better not voluntarily

[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.860]
Oh God

[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.180]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, he's not leaving us

[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.240]
Loss Roger now wait a minute. What what is the story?

[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:39.160]
Rodgers. Oh God. I guess I shouldn't have said anything about this right time for Roger

[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.900]
Man, it came every for it. Is this a secret? He doesn't know he's gonna be gone?

[01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:47.740]
Oh, he's being I said squeezed out

[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.800]
Why he is a good guy is a great guy not a good guy. He's a great guy

[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.780]
And we want Andy here now, okay get rid of some of these other

[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:02.260]
Suda would like to will do so that you're right here. They don't do anything. Okay, they can't even describe their job description

[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.340]
They want a higher one and anchor

[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:10.900]
I think they ought to tie an anchor to the whole building and take it out into the bay here for a while and clean it out

[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:16.800]
That's what they ought to do. That's true. And he's a great guy. They do want and he's getting squeezed out and we're pretty pissed off about it

[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.980]
Okay, so call up every single day and just go nuts and say we want Andy

[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.780]
Anyway, right Sharon agrees too

[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:32.440]
Andy's one of the they're like four or five same people in a whole building and he's one of them. That's true

[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.320]
Right Sharon another one although she has her moments because she has to see Steve every day

[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.980]
She knows pretty well. Yeah, she hangs in there. Mm-hmm, but boy there and where's where's Peter from U of M? What?

[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.480]
He's got out out

[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.400]
Yeah, that's because he looked too good to be in this building

[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:55.360]

[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.440]
This boom boom says you sat on the phone

[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:21.460]
I'm sorry on the airway. I tell you what sir, you know when you have your own show. Are you Charlie now? You won't have to

[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:27.920]
Yeah, when you have your own show sir, you'll have to put up with this. Okay. Would that make you feel better? No

[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.260]
How do you do is to laugh?

[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:36.640]
Not to sit there and waste 15 minutes of Neil Rogers program

[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.240]
Okay

[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:39.240]

[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.740]
Say it again, sir

[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.860]
Okay, and that's it

[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:55.080]
Do you really okay and waste our precious time right? Okay, these very few moments that we have together each day

[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:01.520]
What you have to say was that douchebag gets paid double that you get and it is over

[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.000]
What did you do?

[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:04.840]
You're all get out

[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.740]
The phone on me because it was so bright

[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.620]
He's trying to hang up

[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.640]
Shut my mic off. I'm not gonna let him do it sir. Get out of my board there now sit down

[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:27.660]
I can reach the hung up on you sir. He actually got out of the chair and came over here

[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:31.300]
I can't read fear what I don't see taking up valuable airtime now

[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:38.020]
He's interfering with the technical operation of the show. I think this calls for a two-minute suspension and

[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.280]
30 seconds without pay

[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:48.040]
Okay, we got an open line in Broward where that in Palm Beach rather where that idiot just hung up six five five WIOD six five five

[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:51.840]
nine four six three by the way, here's a song for Alice

[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.160]
I hear Alice got a two-two

[01:09:59.020 --> 01:09:59.460]
Oh

[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:02.680]
Yeah, I'm not talking about it in the book. I'm talking about the kind you wear

[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.920]
Sorry, I miss that show yesterday. I totally forgot about

[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.460]
What was it about?

[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.380]
Who's swim up?

[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.860]
Reports on it. I wonder what is that tell you

[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.340]
Well anyway, Alice

[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.700]
I have nothing to do

[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:30.080]
Yeah, you wear it well. You wear it well. It's so we can't we can't wait to get to the punchline because you killed so much time with that boring story

[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.920]
1225 at WIOD on a wonderful Friday. God. This is a great day, isn't it?

[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.360]
Everybody is so and filled cost and was smiling and laughing in the hall and

[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:45.320]
Oh, you never guess who was really tinkling all over downstairs when Denimberg with

[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.100]
You know time just can't control himself

[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:54.940]
Lynn Fridays came down here and she was going on and on about how much billing she's got off the show

[01:10:54.940 --> 01:11:00.420]
She's making a fortune and and I slapped her real hard a couple of times and she smiled anyway

[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:03.560]
And I thought boy there's something really strange going on here

[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:05.380]
Really strange

[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.100]
They are sucking around big time in this joint. Yeah, I guess they must have seen those Palm Beach numbers

[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.800]
Okay, we got a mobile in Palm Beach, but we got a spot to do. What are we gonna do here, sir? Man

[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.800]
Well, I just wanted to call and say I'm I'm upset. I really am. Oh

[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.520]
About bird taking up

[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.640]
10 minutes we have a break dear. Don't we? Well, we're gonna postpone it, huh?

[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.780]
Bad connection I think I can't hear a thing the guy saying

[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.500]
You're all that static

[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:40.420]
We're late for a break. I'm sorry boy. You lucked out there

[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:40.840]
Ha

[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.240]
Want to complain about it at least have a phone at work. So okay, that would be a good start

[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:55.100]
We got some energy and shells wants to make you crabby this weekend the boats are in in fact people are jumping off it and winning the Florida lottery

[01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:01.640]
And the boats are in from the first major harvest of Alaskan snow crab and the catch was one of the best in recent history

[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:08.240]
And shells serves Alaskan snow crab clusters so that you can enjoy the meaty crab shoulders

[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:13.780]
I love those shoulders not split legs that have been broken off the crab and lost their natural flavor

[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.260]
But large clusters chock full of sweet juicy crab meat

[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:25.240]
Shells is serving pound and a half orders of Alaskan snow crab clusters steaming hot to your table for only

[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:32.140]
$8.95 I'll tell you one thing it shells. There's so much food that's served steaming hot that some days you go in here. It looks like the

[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.760]
What's that place where the lock nest monster hangs out? It looks like London on a bad day

[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.680]
Okay, because it's so foggy, but the food is great humongous portions and of course incredibly low

[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:48.140]
Docside prices at all five shells in South Florida. So make it a shells weekend this weekend right have a real shell

[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:56.780]
Abration at any of the five South Florida locations including the one in Oakland Park just a quarter mile west of US one on Oakland Park Boulevard

[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:04.120]
Can you tell us what CD this is that you're playing all this music? I found where very curious

[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:08.680]
I

[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:15.100]
Mean if it was one CD we're playing all the stuff all over it would have to be the size of Mount Everest have to be the size of Arlene Ross's butt

[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:21.040]
I did not see anything in that intercepted memo of ours about Arlene Ross by the way, did you?

[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:26.940]
Do you know it got so bad over there that it got to the point they didn't want us to mention Arlene Ross on the year?

[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:28.960]
That's a true stirring

[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:36.500]
Because they thought she would sue the company for sex discrimination for like I mean with some good no matter what we talked about

[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.740]
Oh, you can't talk about that don't talk about this and don't the algae or whatever you don't mention this

[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.940]
True at least when Gary Lawrence was there he enjoyed it

[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:51.160]
Yeah, he reveled in us ripping him okay, mm-hmm and talking about him pulling into the parking lot and what time it was no

[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.240]
I stick we used to do with it he didn't speak to us for a couple months because he knew he was getting canned

[01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:01.020]
But at least he had somewhat of a good time with that we ripped him unmercifully. Yeah, I believe

[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:06.420]
And he deserves yeah, I believe a good guy. I have no I have a good guy and I think most everything

[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.740]
But he is a good guy. Yeah, but

[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:16.180]
Compared to you know who compared to Tim Williams. He was like Albert Einstein true. No, that's a true statement and that is saying a lot

[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.440]
That is shocking. Yes

[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:23.360]
And I kept telling people and they said oh no, oh no, we're gonna we've turned the corner now. We're just really doing it

[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.180]
Little did they know that when they opened their eyes they'd be on I

[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.180]
95

[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:32.240]

You might actually have a few people under 90. I don't know what we do. Well, that's good

[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.140]
But I want you to know that we love you here some of us anyway

I want to say something profound. Mm-hmm. Where's the beef?

[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:46.100]
That's it

[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:52.120]
Well, let me say something profound to you. Okay. Yeah, I go holly-wolly doodle-all with it

Yeah, that the Walter was winning Minnesota

[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:17.380]
Clara Peller comes to mind. Mm-hmm. It's interesting. Where's the meat? We still remember Clara Peller

[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.320]
She died by the way, yes, I think she ate too many of them. Yes

[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:27.140]
27-1 at WID. Actually, Clara Peller was only about 27, but if he eat enough in that one

[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:32.100]
joint man, it'll do it. Anyway, speaking of excitement a week from Sunday, boy, it's

[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.840]
like creeping up on it. I'm going to have to do something for my reason.

[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:42.800]
That's correct. Boy, that just dawned on me. Wow. I guess I'm going to have to go

[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.700]
by my mother-a-watch at Jules by us. Out you watch, I'll get a call.

[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.940]
Now, don't, whatever you do. I've had this watch for a hundred years.

[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.460]
Anyway, if your mother isn't kvechi like mine is, and she really, my mother is wonderful,

or something like that, they'll be happy to do it. They have a huge selection of gold

[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:23.080]

tremendous. So check out all the great gift ideas in the limited edition line by saco as well.

[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:28.820]

[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:34.400]
just a little joke. He's all right. Well, I really, I want to. Comedienne, Shelley Brick.

[01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:01.440]
People on a Friday afternoon are driving home from work. Didn't he see how those numbers go down

[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:06.820]
between four and six and those last two hours? You don't want heavy duty between four and six.

[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:11.500]
They want to laugh. They want to puke. They want to get done. Reaction to the Oliver North verdict

[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:18.880]
from four to six with John Larson Nudnik or should lick. Should lick. What is that?

[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:27.540]
What is that? Careful. Good lick. Conservative hardliner and Lynn Auerbach, who wants a retroactive

[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:35.860]
impeachment of Reagan. Oh, geez. Such a chaseraio. Can't you talk him out of it? Talk some sense into that.

[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:44.000]
Come on. Dusty roads for four hours. Look, I don't like wrestling but there are a lot of pinheads out there who do.

[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.520]
That's already demographic. They don't care about Ali North anymore.

[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:55.880]
No, forget about Ali North. Nobody cares. He's like yesterday's garbage. Okay, nobody cares about him anymore.

[01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:00.120]
Look at that. We got a thing from Donna in a mail again. Didn't we just talk about here earlier?

[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:04.160]
Yes. Now, come on. Call him up now. I'm sorry. I don't want to interfere with this show but then

[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.660]
Hank is doing sports talk tonight. If he does this, Hank will rip him for an hour and a half.

[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.820]
Okay. What do you want me to read then? John should lick.

[01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:24.480]
Oh, God. Nudnik, I think we were right the first time. Now, don't do it, Sharon. Call him up now.

[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:29.360]
Go ahead. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's your show. I know it and you're so chronic anyway that they don't like it.

[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:35.380]
I haven't been lately. Yeah. That's easy for you to say. You're all right. You're okay. You just

[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:43.520]
carry it away. I just want to stick up for Glenn. Like I said, he never asks for anything. He always

[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:49.200]
supports you. He always laughs. What is this like sympathy thing here? He does just fine. Okay. He's

[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.380]
laughing all the way to the bank. Okay. He's making more money than God for doing almost nothing.

[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:58.520]
He's having a wonderful time. Well, couldn't he like take five minutes? He works like three weeks

[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.480]
a year when I go on vacation the rest of the time he comes in to eat lunch, which is fine. Oh,

[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.920]
that's what I wanted. I don't do much either. So, don't worry about it. That you know that lady who calls

[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:12.200]
and says to my greenery, could she come in and butter his mackerel? Yeah. Well, when you're on

[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.900]
vacation, I'm opening the mail. That's the noise by the way. So, don't anybody panic.

[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.400]
When you're on vacation, if I could come in and sit in with Glenn. No, no, you can't come in.

[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:24.740]
But like with Glenn, okay. He'd up his courage. Okay. You ought to call John should lick.

[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:28.020]
But I could heat up his curry pop and stuff his tortillas.

[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:34.160]
Now, you've been here before, haven't you? No, just that one day to pick up the ticket.

[01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:37.340]
Oh, look at this. Here's a letter from Dot in Key Largo. Thanks a lot, Dot.

[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:43.840]
Nice letter. I really appreciate your, I'm not paying any attention to what you said. What you said.

[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:49.820]
Neil, did you know Kevin Elster got kicked out of the game last night? Did he? Yeah. Wow.

[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:54.460]
You went out. He was already out. He went back to the dock out. Now,

[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.420]
after the last guy got struck out, he went and argued with the umpire. He got kicked out.

[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.240]
And then David Johnson got kicked out. Well, I'll tell you what, what was that?

[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:09.260]
A little short there in the mic, or I think. Give this to the bird.

[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:16.900]
I don't understand this. This is a thing to make. And he said, oh, look at this.

[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:24.120]
Oh my God. Not completely. You're feeling bad for him. Yeah. When he sees what I just opened

[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:30.400]
up in the mail. You know how on your plane ticket, there's a little thing that you tear off on the

[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:36.340]
end that you keep the boarding pass. Right. I want you. This is from Atlanta to Washington

[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:42.200]
National. The date is April 22nd. I want you to look at the name on that ticket.

[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:53.700]
Holy God. Oh my. Yes. Phoebe. Yes. I swear to God. A boarding pass. Yeah.

[01:22:54.040 --> 01:23:01.920]
Feebe. Oh my God. Oh, this will go so great in the shrine. I have it home.

[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.060]
Wow. Isn't it right into the shrine? Yeah. You can put that right next to the river Phoenix

[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:17.080]
post. Okay. Listen. Have a wonderful day. We'll talk to you like what day is it today?

[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:22.140]
How about Monday? Yeah. Like I said, we'll talk about a weekend. We're still

[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:29.920]
here. So okay. See you. Perfect time to call. Oh God. 1244 WID. Before we open Donna's

[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:35.260]
in temperate car. Donna's been really on her best behavior lately. I think this person has

[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.680]
really thanks to the person who sent him the Phoebe Kate's thing. Oh yeah. I know.

[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:43.940]
I'm obsessed. He's already licking it and doing this. Disgusting things with it. In fact,

[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:49.540]
the word is saying something about John should like. We're in God's thing. Did they get this?

[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.620]
Okay. Donna is one of the few people who gets musical accompaniment when we open up her man.

[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:11.420]
It's another card. Oh my God. This one goes on and on and on and on.

[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:19.580]
And that's beyond obsession. Wow. Where are you getting your stupid info? I was unhold on

[01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:25.790]
Palm Beach line for seven minutes. During that time, a female called named Trixi or Dixi,

[01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:30.710]
you hung up saying that was Madamax. You used to call it up. I didn't remember any Madamax.

[01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:36.770]
And then you took my call and obviously thought I was that other caller. Rodger put me on hold.

[01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:42.370]
I'm now sorry. I didn't help tell him I was Donna. Then you'd realize I couldn't be on two lines

[01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:47.190]
at the same time. I've never called it using any voice. Oh, and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.

[01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:55.590]
I didn't bother to go to there's the Chinese food. I didn't bother to go to Toyota's because your new

[01:24:55.590 --> 01:25:01.310]
callers sounded like idiots with little to say just like you and Glenn. Don't flatter your huge

[01:25:01.310 --> 01:25:08.330]
ego to think I'm listening. I'm busy and bored with your show. Yeah. You know, this broad has got

[01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:13.050]
such problems. I mean, didn't I have an I always said like one day we'll go along with her like two

[01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:17.750]
weeks and get all these she'd tickling and just and then all of a sudden if some little thing happens

[01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:22.630]
right away we're idiots and she didn't listen to the show and we're doing bad. And then like on

[01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:28.630]
Monday we'll get a card. She loves us. Boy, Donna, you are serious, serious. You know what I mean?

[01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:35.490]
Sirius. Boy, she is not a well-chaun. All right, I'm going to do our little message here for Toyota

[01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:40.270]
of Hollywood after opening this next thing here. Wait a minute. This looks like another intercepted memo.

[01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:57.470]
Wait a minute. I think so. Oh, look at that. It's not. It's a letter from one of our listeners from

[01:25:57.470 --> 01:26:01.670]
Janet. I won't mention her last name. She says, send Boy Geary. You know, telling him it was obvious

[01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:06.150]
you knew nothing about your show eating on the air. And that if you wanted to help you, hey, by the way,

[01:26:06.150 --> 01:26:10.390]
there's Craig Worthing. I'm not supposed to say you're here. Okay, Craig Worthing got here. Look

[01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:14.510]
at that. He's wearing his red socks cap and I'm wearing my Cubs cap. And by the way, we're only a half

[01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:19.990]
came out. How the red socks do it? Are they in there? That division by the way. Is we come on in here

[01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:28.170]
now? Come on Craig. You're not coming in? Why not? Get W-I-O-D. Is that time? Yeah, it's that time again.

[01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:34.990]
Okay. Boy, you got Phoebe Kate's airplane ticket stub down. And Dave Johnson called in and do a

[01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:39.910]
special call of a race. Oh, God. This has been more than I can. And then we had that guy Mike

[01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:46.670]
Puppy from Atlanta, the new, uh, head she that is named Mike Puppy. Yeah. Uh-huh. God. Oh, yeah,

[01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:55.590]
the new Nick Tregoni. Yeah. Junior. Mani. How you doing, Neil? Okay. How's everything? Great. All right. Um,

[01:26:56.410 --> 01:27:03.810]
you still have the sports section there from the hell? Let's go to uh, Pompano. Hello.

[01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:08.950]
Hi, Neil. How you doing? Good. I'm going to see Steve Tornig double-vergeist.

[01:27:11.190 --> 01:27:14.830]
Okay. Hello. Well, these are people that got caught in the lightning round and they realize you

[01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:19.330]
know. Hello. Yeah. I was just wondering, does anybody have a brother named Wheel?

[01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:25.530]
Dave County. Hello. We love you, boy. Plus you, asshole.

[01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:31.290]
Oh, God. Pompade. Hello. You're such a bitter pill.

[01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:38.150]
I recognize that, boys. Yeah. We don't want to be number one. We'd be happy

[01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:43.490]
to be number three. They didn't realize being number 23 is not where it's at. Broward. Hello.

[01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:58.550]
Oh, my God. You've got to send us the tape on that. What the hell is that? Everybody loves

[01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:03.070]
Steve Stone. No, everybody must get stuff. No, that said, every, it was a parody.

[01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:07.390]
Everybody loves Steve Stone. No, it's just like Dylan. Boy, you are so slow.

[01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:12.590]
I sound just like him. Everybody loves Steve Stone. Well, see, I'm just not into that.

[01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:16.950]
Except for Grace. Yeah, see, I'm not into that here. Dave, that's Steve would say.

[01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:23.410]
Dave County. Hello. Pictures? Yeah, somebody's taking snapshots.

[01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.450]
Bokeh. Hello. Is this a mic, Disney, sir?

[01:28:28.210 --> 01:28:31.670]
Broward County. Hello. Oh, you're blotching over here.

[01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:35.690]
Duck.

[01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:41.830]
Get back to work. Oh, God. This is a good one.

[01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:46.970]
Good one. Dave County. Hello. Can the bird tell us another story?

[01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:50.450]
Yeah, briefly. Broward. Hello.

[01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:52.310]
County. You did too. It only fits.

[01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:58.090]
Lot of Sally Fitz material during the lightning run. Have you ever said?

[01:28:58.330 --> 01:29:00.850]
Every day. Real quick, too. Dave County. Hello.

[01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:03.810]
And the roof and then go go go. Do spags.

[01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:07.350]
Palm Beach County. Hello. Uh-huh.

[01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:12.790]
Well, I like that. Even in spite of those numbers, he's still got a good sense of humor.

[01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:14.870]
Broward County. Hello. Dead.

[01:29:15.290 --> 01:29:18.070]
Dead. County. Hello.

[01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:25.770]
Carlos. Yeah. I think Carlos is an O'Shaun provocateur myself.

[01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:30.110]
Palm Beach. Hello. By the way, speaking of Carlos,

[01:29:30.110 --> 01:29:32.890]
have you noticed who's been conspicuous by his absence?

[01:29:32.890 --> 01:29:34.350]
I'm not complaining, by the way.

[01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:39.010]
But since I talked about his brief police detective career,

[01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:46.170]
and about that very strange story that he told me, and I don't know, that Joe with six ends,

[01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:50.590]
there's something very bizarre. But we haven't heard one word from him.

[01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:53.270]
You notice how he's been? Broward. Hello.

[01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:55.190]
Longing with him.

[01:29:57.190 --> 01:30:00.410]
Only a WIOD, sir. Dave County. Hello.

[01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:03.710]
And Eli was over there to Yoda on Saturday.

[01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:06.230]
Yeah, forgot to ask. I'm big as you're right.

[01:30:08.210 --> 01:30:11.310]
Broward County. Hello. We don't talk fishing until tomorrow, sir. Hello.

[01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:19.030]
Palm Beach. Can this be happening during me? Where's your what? Oh, Sharon.

[01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:22.710]
Sharon's got your copy for that. Yeah. Dave County. Hello.

[01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:23.630]
Her one shift.

[01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:26.830]
Her one shift.

[01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:33.250]
Palm Beach. Hello. Oh, they're just apoplectic today. Broward,

[01:30:33.390 --> 01:30:34.810]
while it's the end of a busy week. Hello.

[01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:38.830]
Yeah, I'm saying I need you blue to you.

[01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:42.550]
Yeah. Dave County. Hello.

[01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:50.070]
Was that spigot or freeway? I kind of get the talking views. Dave County. Hello.

[01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:52.770]
Hi again. Hi. Hi. Hi. This is your friend, Ron.

[01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:55.970]
Hi. Ron. Yeah. It sounded more like joy to me.

[01:30:56.930 --> 01:30:57.570]
Palm Beach.

[01:30:57.850 --> 01:30:58.230]
Wow.

[01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:02.130]
A Broward County. Hello.

[01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:03.350]
After you. Good.

[01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:07.650]
That was James Brown Jr. I'd recognize that voice anywhere.

[01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:11.850]
Volca. Hello. Leo Badger. Ocean Park. College.

Oh, preview here for you.

[01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:33.790]
Little preview of what you'll be hearing probably about a week from Monday.

[01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:35.190]
Volca. Hello.

[01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:37.350]
I'm so in for my wifey vice-Jack.

[01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:41.070]
Well, there's a long line ahead of you pal.

[01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:44.550]
A long line. There's a light of fallaway to Jupiter and Uranus.

[01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:49.050]
Dave County. Hello. What's going on right now?

[01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:54.310]
Broward. Hello. Broward.

[01:31:55.390 --> 01:31:58.950]
Well, I hate that. I just addressed me nuts. Dave County. Hello.

[01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.130]
I love you.

[01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:04.390]
That was Madamax. Okay. Well, it's trust me.

[01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:05.250]
Was it? Or Donna?

[01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.970]
Volca. Hello.

[01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:09.070]
Neil, if I ever go get you, it's with you.

[01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:13.110]
Okay. Broward County. Hello.

[01:32:14.850 --> 01:32:16.790]
You can ask with fifty thousand words.

[01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:18.770]
Dr. Vod.

[01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:20.350]
All the way out to the Bahamas too.

Great.

They are out there today.

[01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:40.130]
How are they calling from Bayside?

[01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:41.690]
They're from Dr. Vod.

[01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:42.930]
Yeah, they made my day.

[01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.910]

[01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:01.770]
Okay. Boy, some real douche bags in Palm Beach today.

[01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:06.250]
In fact, I noticed if you look at that listing there with all those Palm Beach numbers,

[01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:07.870]
number one in douche bags by the car.

[01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:09.570]

Okay. Palm Beach.

[01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:18.810]
It's a good time for the great day.

[01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:22.710]
Well, I guess he's got a lot of spirit time these days, huh?

[01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:24.230]
Broward County. Hello.

[01:33:24.450 --> 01:33:26.110]

[01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:37.270]
Yeah, if I was a sardine, would he kiss me the can?

[01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:39.990]
Broward County. Hello.

[01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:42.170]
Hello. This is Christine Jorgensen.

[01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:45.250]
Yeah, we'll be there at your funeral, Christine.

[01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:46.130]
We hope you have a good one.

[01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:47.250]
Dave County. Hello.

[01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:50.390]
Dave County.

[01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:54.430]
He said by any other name still thinks the same.

[01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:54.830]
True.

[01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:56.970]
Come on, not on circuit.

[01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.690]
I'm on Rose.

[01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:59.310]
Okay. He never stole a freight train.

[01:34:00.170 --> 01:34:02.430]
Only we wish he'd hop on one of them and go back to Portland.

[01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:03.650]
Volca. Hello.

[01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:04.310]
Hi, Neil.

[01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:05.690]
Is it true you're an octa-room?

[01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:08.410]
Broward. Hello.

[01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:08.670]
Hello.

Boy, we sure got some real creative people out there.

[01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:15.550]
Let's call Dave Johnson back.

[01:34:16.190 --> 01:34:16.850]
Broward. Hello.

[01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:17.910]
Neil. Yeah.

[01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.330]
I'd like to vote that the bird should get a haircut.

[01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:25.010]
Dave County. Hello.

[01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:28.750]
Yeah, that was worth repeating.

[01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:29.810]
Yeah, say it again.

[01:34:31.130 --> 01:34:31.930]
Good one.

Neil.

[01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.550]
Yeah.

[01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:36.890]
Do you ask me the guy that says there at Kumaro and the guy says cool?

[01:34:38.410 --> 01:34:39.270]
Dave County. Hello.

[01:34:39.650 --> 01:34:40.670]
Hey, bud.

[01:34:40.770 --> 01:34:42.370]
I'm still waiting at Gerber.

[01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:45.410]
Broward. Hello.

[01:34:45.730 --> 01:34:47.570]
There was no quid.

[01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:48.150]
Brow.

[01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:52.850]
Well, you know, when you got a president who's as whiny as that,

[01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:55.230]
it makes you really stop and think from it.

[01:34:55.230 --> 01:34:56.770]
You know about America and our future.

[01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.890]
Palm Beach.

[01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:00.010]
I like to be tied up with Bob wire to you.

[01:35:02.190 --> 01:35:03.270]
Dave County. Hello.

[01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:03.870]
My good.

[01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:08.250]
Oh, my God.

[01:35:10.930 --> 01:35:12.970]
A lot of short calls in his lightning.

[01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:13.710]
Very short.

[01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:14.390]
Boka.

[01:35:14.890 --> 01:35:16.370]
No, I'm in the homin, homin, homin.

[01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:19.590]
They must be getting ready for Shabbos, huh?

[01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:21.850]
Broward County, our final call.

[01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:23.730]
I don't need a damn history lesson.

[01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:27.070]
Okay, nice hearing from Don.

[01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:28.450]
That was done on the phone, wasn't it?

[01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:29.990]
Yeah. Well, that's going to do it for us.

[01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:31.850]

We're going to have a piece of paper.

[01:35:33.850 --> 01:35:35.810]
Pizza law pizza and we can give away anything.

[01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:37.750]
We can get our hands on and pictures and

[01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:40.930]
we'll be auctioning off at rich and certainly giving away a

[01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:43.130]
couple of ourselves people free for the asking.

[01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:46.030]
Okay, if we might pay you to take them stick around for

[01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:48.830]
