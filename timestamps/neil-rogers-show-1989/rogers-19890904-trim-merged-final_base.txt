[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.880]
1037 at WIO, they're going to have four choruses of Sammy, Sammy a little bit later on in the hour.

[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.320]
But first, a Miami call. Hello.

[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.260]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.460]
How are you? Welcome back.

[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.200]
Yes, sir.

[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.280]
I wanted to tell you that for the bird over there, Joanne Rice is going to be at the Amnesty

[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.840]
or Malt today.

[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.600]
What does that mean for the bird, Joanne Rice?

[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.520]
Is she going there for the bird or is she going there for some other reason?

[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.080]
No, she's going there for another reason.

[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.400]
But I know, going to be trying to hook up with Joanne.

[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.520]
Well, I got news for you, sir. Glenn has been trying to hook up with anything that's alive.

[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.320]
No, no, no, no, no, no, please.

[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.840]
Trying to hook up with me.

[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.440]
What does that mean?

[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.540]
She called me.

[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.740]

[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.400]
She's trying to hook up with you. What does that mean?

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.460]
She wanted to meet me.

[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.880]
Is that like one of those Texas like hook-um-horrings or one of those things they do in the football with the,

[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.480]
yeah, this finger up in here?

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.420]
She called.

[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.800]
Actually, I strained this finger the other day.

[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.320]
I told you I fell down. I strained this.

[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.500]
But now this one's starting.

[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.080]
Thank you, sir.

[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.580]
Yeah.

[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.540]
I have been trying to get back.

[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.740]
You still didn't answer the question.

[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.280]
For what?

[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100]
She wants to meet me.

[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.960]
She's never wanted me.

[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.640]
She wants to meet you?

[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.220]
That's all.

[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.080]
Don't waste your time, Joanne.

[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.000]
Trust me.

[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.220]
Yeah.

[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.180]
Also, you know, I've heard a lot of things about Don Shula.

[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.420]
For what I've been told, he's one of the nastiest coaches in the league.

[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.060]
And right now, in fact, he's probably ripping some pretty big ass asses out of the players.

[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.860]
Sammy, Sammy, how do you like that Sammy, huh?

[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.500]
He's doing great stuff.

[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.880]
He's doing it.

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.900]
Up in Orlando.

[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.160]
Up in two eggs, yeah.

[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.220]
Yeah, I think he's going to be a secretary for the magic.

[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.880]
Yeah, the magic 102.7.

[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.720]
Yeah, all right.

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.620]
I'm just about out of material.

[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.740]
Well, listen, thanks for the tip there on Joanne.

[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.920]
I'm sure somebody will be trolling over there in Oatah.

[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.480]
Okay.

[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.240]
Have a great day.

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.400]
1039 at WID.

[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.260]
Isn't it interesting how these people seem to be under the age of 100?

[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.980]
It doesn't seem to be that...

[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.480]
Oh, Alex, you're so refreshing.

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.860]
We have to contend with it, Neil every day.

[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.780]
Every day, she said, you have to contend with me.

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.300]
I remember.

[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.420]
Now, what the hell are you listening?

[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.800]
You disgusting old bag?

[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.640]
You have to contend with it.

[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.960]
Don't you have anything else to do?

[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.800]
Can't you take your prune juice, animal during these hours?

[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.060]
Clean your brains out.

[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.640]
We have an open line in Boka and Del Rey now, which is pretty disappointing.

[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.340]
I really thought we were going to make a little comeback there.

[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.900]
We haven't even touched that line yet.

[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.640]
278.9463.

[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.780]
Well, see, I'm just cleansing my whole system because I know Wayne Arnold is coming any second.

[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.740]
And Fat Rich has definitely got his beeper and his buzzer and his magic twanger.

[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.180]
But everything else said, just in case there's a little blurt at the bell out there, he's going to rush.

[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.660]
Oh, a quickie here.

[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.020]
Hello.

[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.440]
Yeah, the bird was a butt-licking this Alex Bennett the whole week.

[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.300]
I believe it.

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.520]
That's what I heard Thursday and Friday was disgusting.

[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.980]
I want to know, were the lines full or are we clen?

[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.460]
No, but I was still busy butt-licking.

[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.640]
I really didn't notice.

[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.540]
Neil, you're the brother of fresh air.

[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.260]
Good to have you back.

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.820]
Okay.

[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.140]
Thanks for your refreshing honesty, sir.

[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.280]
The lines were not full at all.

[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.360]
They were not full at all.

[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.900]
They were light.

[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.840]
They were light.

[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.260]
That's how I would term it light.

[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.700]
And I will say this, management for it will ignore this, but when I do the show for you,

[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.900]
and Fat Rich may disagree with this, but they stayed pretty full.

[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.660]
Fat Rich said that the birds a liar, but I saw several times during the week where they were all empty.

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.320]
Several times.

[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.060]
I mean, Tony Bennett.

[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.420]
And he would have to give the number to ask on the air for call.

[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.680]
Well, it takes those old people a long time to get to the phone.

[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.840]
They have to crawl on their hands and knees.

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.520]
They have to go and get their walkers out.

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.100]
Hello, Alex.

[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.780]
It's so refreshing.

[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.560]
So one thing about this town, man, we got the worst bunch of butt-sucking bird brains in this town

[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.000]
that you're going to find anywhere in the world, probably.

[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.260]
Anywhere in the world.

[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.340]
The first day I came to this market, WKAT, 13 long excruciating years ago,

[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.320]
13 and a half long excruciating years ago.

[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.660]
And I sat down and little dick-sciates sat there in the studio.

[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.060]
I just got his ass fired and I was replacing him, but they made him show me the rope, so to speak,

[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.920]
and that big old horrendous, mausoleum-like studio with Frank Katzentine's picture on the wall,

[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.920]
and the thing about it is he had died like 30 years before and his eyes were moving in the picture.

[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.620]
It was incredible.

[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.600]
Every time he looked up on the wall, his eyes were like looking around at the piano and the bird bath,

[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.640]
and Craig Worthing's toilet tissue cozy on the piano.

[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.080]
And I punched up the first line and they said,

[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.160]
Oh, you're such a breath of fresh air.

[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.040]
And I hadn't even said anything yet.

[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.920]
Here's a mobile and brown word.

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.160]
Hello.

[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.360]
Oh, Neil.

[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.800]
Yeah.

[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.160]
Mom and I went to call there.

[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.840]
Hey, they're having a big day out there. I'm glad you mentioned that.

[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.320]
It's a big, labor day card out there today.

[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.680]
I'm calling the front-end if you have any winners for me.

[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.100]
Well, let's see if there's anything I like here today.

[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.380]
Oh, look at that.

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.880]
I'm a thoracian bird. Help me out.

[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.640]
Well, he doesn't have the entries just a second.

[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.000]
I've been cold lately.

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.460]
What? You've been cold?

[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.500]
I like D'Roma Feast with Gonzalez in the second race.

[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.020]
Okay, I'll play in the double.

[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.020]
And let's see. Look at that.

[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.100]
I'll tell you again.

[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.800]
I expect Mike to have a good day today because he's probably wearing off the effects from being on Calder's show.

[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.800]
All right.

[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.600]
What I'll do is I'll play D'Roma Feast and if it wins, I'll give you a call back and let you know how much money I made.

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.820]
Okay. Good luck to you.

[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.460]
Yeah. Have a good day.

[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.180]
Bunch of brains out. They need your money now.

[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.820]
You got it.

[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.100]
Okay.

[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.620]
There we go. Big, big, labor day card on this Monday.

[00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.880]
They added Calder 11 races. They've got the $50,000 Calder handicap in the 10th of my lemonade on the grass.

[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.200]
They've got the simulcash to the $200,000 Jerome handicap.

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.340]
That's a great one race from Belmont.

[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.620]
Small field in their six horse field is a true with Pat Day.

[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.700]
Fast play with Cordero electric flash.

[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.020]
Climb the stars with Richard Melliori.

[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.700]
I'm influential and D'Rosch.

[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.340]
Hmm.

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.760]
D'Rosch.

[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.100]
Hmm.

[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.720]
So that's what's going on out there.

[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.760]
A call to get out there and plunge your gut so there's something for you people to do.

[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.700]
Have nothing to do today.

[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.800]
Here's another mobile and brown word. Hello.

[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.820]
And yeah, how you doing?

[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.440]
Okay.

[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.380]
You're brumper for sure today.

[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.420]
And intimidating too, right?

[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.880]
Uh-huh.

[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.480]
Good.

[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.760]
Hey, uh, Bert?

[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.760]
Yeah.

[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.100]
I think you would have done a better job yourself.

[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.540]
Well, listen, I want, I want to go on record.

[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.020]
I want to go on record.

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.540]
I want to record.

[00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.960]
I want to record.

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.960]

[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.040]
I want to record.

[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.220]

[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.600]
I want to record.

[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.680]
I want to record.

[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.680]

[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.760]

[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.080]
I want to record.

[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.500]
I want to record.

[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.420]
I want to record.

[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.500]
I want to record.

[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.660]
I want to record.

[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.440]
I want to record.

[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.340]
I want to record.

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.520]
I want to record.

[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.680]
The only thing you have on the side line, is that be considered bad football?

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.220]
Yeah.

[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.900]
No.

[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.060]
What was going on on the field would be considered bad football.

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.600]
Trust me.

[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.560]

[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.460]

[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.620]

[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.900]

[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.720]
Well, I think that Flem is coming back, my IOD allergy.

[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.160]
Oh.

[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.380]
All the while that had been away.

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.620]
Didn't have any problem with that.

[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.640]
And the first day that I come back,

[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.140]
that old w-i-o-d attack is starting to come back again

[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.460]
what are we saving that one-broward line just for mobile is that what that

[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.040]
would is today

[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.720]
well how nice to have a mobile line

[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.460]
okay let's uh... take one from margate hello

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.180]
hi yeah

[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.880]
it's got first-time caller

[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.700]
how you doing scott

[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.840]
well try to show us the best

[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.940]
when it was on because when that other guy was on bed

[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.400]
tony bened

[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.200]
yeah he was making a funny show he was really the first time callers

[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.700]
he was making fun of my show

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.220]
you know that the first thing that impressed me when i got in my car the

[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.760]
airport on thursday i listened to him for fifteen minutes

[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.040]
and i said where is my show you know i mean in other words he comes in here

[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.520]
and maybe it wasn't his fault because maybe the powers that be didn't give

[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.440]
me any idea what the shows all about although i doubt that you know

[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.420]
and i thought to myself what he's doing has about as much relationship to my

[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:38.780]
show

[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.660]
it would be like joey rentals going on channel ten doing some stupid show

[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.860]
uh... uh... uh...

[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.400]
that just didn't fit in with an bishop

[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.800]
you know what i mean

[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.160]
you would probably been better ratings if you just point the best of

[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.940]
there you go

[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.920]
well that's not get carried away i'm gonna tell you glad you mentioned that

[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.780]
too because i heard some of that going to the not going to the track going to

[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.080]
the store i guess on saturday

[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.860]
and the way nick puts that thing together i wouldn't wish that on anybody i

[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.660]
wouldn't wish it on

[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.840]
it's weird isn't it's only matters how it jumps

[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.060]
yeah like jumps all over the place is put together real crappy and it sounds

[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.740]
like hell

[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.340]

[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.100]
and i was up on a chair

[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.960]
and i took a tumble and i usually don't do that even though i'm a big clumsy

[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.840]
clutz

[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.600]
i usually don't do that

[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.280]
i never do that but in this case the chair was just not designed for this big

[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.280]
fat blob to be standing on it

[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.440]
and i took this tremendous tumble and i jammed this finger

[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.600]
the one next to the middle finger this one here

[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.300]
uh... badly

[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.940]

[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.260]

[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.340]
trying to squeeze blood out of it

[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.620]
and i'm going to tell you when the second guy shook my hand i thought i was

[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.960]

he's really doing it

[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.040]
right he's got a new way of catching the ball he crouches down loses the ball in

[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.460]

[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.100]
a program and you just start you start looking at the tote board and looking down in that racing

[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.220]

[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:38.620]
illegal for employees of the track to bet what yes well i'm not saying that's the

[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:45.760]

[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.400]

[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.680]
when he could post about the cases he has one and you're in ladies' lots of fun

[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:51.320]
because her tastes are strange she's quite deranged without seeing the cane where all the triceps go

[00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:01.420]
they would have to find another show to go to today

[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:08.620]
be lost this outsteak came we'd never hear the virgin minister all the things he has to say about

[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:18.160]
the queens how all this sex has been in his dreams and he'll never change very strange

they would have to find another show to go to today be lost how's this going

[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.640]
okay what a way to start the cane show right

[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.340]
to await at w.w. i.e. steve is in limbo he's on his way to san hozey or something right

[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.520]
evidently he's either in town or he got his message the the word is that he's helping his

[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.860]
accomplice i mean his associate oh move in what he's doing his evil twin at a

[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.580]
Louisville is evil twin he's helping him move in but he got his message and he's just up in arms

[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:07.880]
and he's just uh desperate and if steve doesn't show up by 230 he wanted to put on rush limbo

[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:16.040]
tapes good heavens now should we take a poll on that i don't know um

[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.480]

[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.520]
although i heard a rumor that w.l.s. in chicago which went all talk you know

[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.840]

jayda's every Saturday night he's screaming and yelling and just a maniac he's the program director

[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.820]

[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:06.400]
i just i can't believe i can't believe he's on any station much less this one in fact he will be

[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.760]
on tonight from eight to eleven that's right because there's no Yankee game the Yankees are playing

[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:17.800]
this afternoon couldn't we punch up the Yankee game wouldn't that be exciting but uh not oh look

[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.080]
anyway it's two ten at w.i. this so we're gonna kind of hang in and we'll uh if you're really

i'll be i'll see how the uh sounds from the tennis match on the back

[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:57.260]
well we could arrange that we could hook up the audio just from the four not the microphone just

[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.320]
from the court to the transmitter that'd be great yeah programming network give me a break isn't
