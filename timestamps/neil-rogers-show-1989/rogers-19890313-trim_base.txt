[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]
by hot 105 there were one of the uh... stations that was involved in the

[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.080]
promotion per kayocho and steve said well i guess you're not going to be there

[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.340]
right

[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.780]
and the ten is a well i were not going to let the uh...

[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.560]
we're not going to let the little havana kawani and the ruin our thing we've

[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.760]
already planned for this and we've got a big uh... promotional investment about

[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.020]
about

[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.220]
i'll be there

[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.420]
yeah

[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.500]
he hung up on a me ripped him which was great i loved it

[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.440]
because you know the desire to pander to certain ethnic elements in a

[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.200]
community by certain radio stations one of which they are power

[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.280]
uh... i find embarrassing you know i mean you have to have some principal

[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.840]
somewhere

[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.380]
but by the way speaking of tv guess who came out yesterday and what a great

[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.700]
guy to and he's really getting the chef proof that this business is subhuman

[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.760]
bob weaver

[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.020]
oh my

[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.020]
came by to a lot of hollywood yesterday we've had a little chat he's just a

[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.480]
super guy one of my favorite people in this town you know

[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.920]
every time there's a telethon every time there's a charitable thing or an

[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.680]
auction weaver is there being the auctioneer or doing you know his bet he's

[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.820]
on so much for this town

[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.260]
for so many years when i first came down here

[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.100]
i mean to visit

[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.160]
he was here

[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.580]
i mean forever

[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.200]
and over a channel for the really give them the chef he said he's got to get up

[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.560]
but a quarter to three in the morning

[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.000]
to do that morning weather oh my

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.540]
ordered a three in the morning

[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.740]
and of course you know how much he loves the dog track as he used to own a bunch

[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.980]
of racing dogs and he's really into that loves it

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.820]
and that he can't get out there anyway i don't want to you know create a

[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.480]
thing but uh... it's really a shame because it's new guy that they've got

[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.620]
with a weather map on his face

[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.920]
uh... you know it's attempting to be a comedian and he's not he's really

[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.160]
horrendous and weaver has been here forever you think that after you pay

[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.740]
your dues

[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.880]
especially with the same place i realize that station changed ownership a

[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.980]
couple of times but even so he's been over there forever

[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.160]
and you think after you pay your dues

[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500]
that they would show some appreciation you could have a little bit of

[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.240]
confidence that you can work out to your retirement and not be jerked around

[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.560]
you know

[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.620]
but they've done a real number on them over there but he's just a super guy and

[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.100]
i wanted to mention that was nice to see him

[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.660]
yeah

[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.600]
believe he came out so anyway tanner made a real fool out of himself on with

[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.680]
steve on friday and uh... kind of embarrassing but doesn't surprise me

[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.020]
what else

[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.220]
do there a whole bunch of things oh yeah there was a river phoenix movie on

[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.900]
yesterday on the movie channel

[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.340]
jimmy reared in

[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.760]
yeah a night in the life i didn't know what the name of it was that's a great

[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.660]
movie i saw it's a funny movie it is a good movie there's more to it

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.740]
then most teen movies yeah

[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.380]
very funny movie as it is i saw not only mentioned that he's almost naked in

[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.280]
much of the movie and uh... even though he's getting a little bit better he

[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.520]
still looks i don't know there's something about that face

[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.040]
but from the neck down he was okay to me but uh... it was a funny moving

[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.700]
yeah i liked it and probably a lot of our river phoenix freaks out there

[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.480]
who haven't seen it will just be sitting on the edge of their seats

[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.800]
and

[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.680]
that our average is pouring through man this is going to be hell of a day i can

[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.500]
already feel it

[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.160]
these mondays now last monday was like the kiss of death of my but i can

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.980]
well now we already got a few more calls and we had all last monday there's

[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.120]
like four lights lighting up

[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.900]
i'm not concerned about the phone i'm just concerned about uh... everything

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.400]
else

[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.460]
because i could go through a major song of the answer about yesterday about

[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.980]
disorganization

[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.280]
uh... okay

[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.220]
i want to do a major attack on our sales department

[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.640]
but i do want to say that it's like um...

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.700]
i mean they're great that we've got

[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.560]
so much business that we you know they don't know what to do with it they got

[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.300]
money coming in that they haven't even spent yet

[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.720]
which was kind of embarrassing as we had these unbelievable t-shirts

[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.580]
that kind of like maxed the bumper stickers and yesterday at that

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.500]
appearance and they were put out on the table and somebody said to me were

[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.220]
charged in ten bucks a piece for them

[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.820]
i said well if that's the case i don't want anything to do with it okay because i

[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.980]
don't know anything about that

[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.240]
i'm not here to sell things we're here to promote and to give stuff away and sell

[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.380]
cars which they had a big day yesterday again

[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.360]
out including stew and boka by the way congratulate him and his wife they came

[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.160]
all the way down from boka and they drove away in a beautiful toyota

[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.420]
camera it was a sharp car

[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.680]
with burgundy white with burgundy interior god was a beautiful camera

[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.700]
um... but anyway so we want to give away a quantity not all that many i don't

[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.620]
know we have maybe fifteen or twenty of them

[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.440]
t-shirts

[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.860]
mhm good

[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.340]
including our friend joe with five ease

[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.400]
uh... who desperately wants one of your old

[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.400]
one of those business cards that's got the two ends he feels that that you know

[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.080]
it's kind of his thing that he created that if i had yeah if i had been there

[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.300]
would have given him one you still have some yeah i've actually he's gonna come

[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.280]
in wednesday not don't panic now he's not coming in our show he's bringing

[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.700]
Steve a poster of some weird one then yeah uh... he's coming in with me

[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.160]
given a couple of those out people are just amazed you know

[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.100]
anyway ten fourteen and w i do have a lot of other kind of things to catch up

[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.040]
on here uh... including our sales department i don't want to beat up on them

[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.080]
too bad because like i said they've been a great job that they are so incoherent

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.940]
and so uh... spacey man haven't got any idea what planet they're on in fact that

[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.860]
we should have put our sales department in the space shuttle

[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.620]
because wherever it winds up in outer space they would fit out now

[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.460]
they would fit in immediately he knows what you're talking about me i might

[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.820]
can relate to it he uh... he's gone through the same well a lot longer than we have

[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.520]
traumatic tribulations with our sales department executives yeah

[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.660]
who i think i've been hanging around with Henry too long or something

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.320]
yeah one way ticket out of shuttle that sounds good to be

[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.160]
what kind of leave them out there on the substation anyways speaking of

[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.900]
sub how about heading for charade they don't have any subs over the

[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.220]
what do you mean i'm on your own i'm on sharens in here talking about some

[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.700]
important heavy-duty stuff in the uran we don't have time to be on

[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.900]
we gotta get all this mistreatened out from this uh... disorganized bunch of

[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.180]
do you see i don't want to get into a bit well i do i do want to get into a big

[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.900]
thing because i said it before you know what they say about too many chefs spoil the

[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.440]
broth and we got four thousand people running around your ball got titles okay

[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.560]
we've got like upper level middle upper upper lower i mean

[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.400]
every kind of management that's ever been invented everybody works here's got a

[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.000]
title okay except us all the way do have business car at least i got business

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.940]
car jayers are coming back again with four ends on the next but anyway it's

[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.460]
like just chaos i mean it just so much disorganization the right hand doesn't

[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.820]
know what left hand is doing and the last thing i said when i left here

[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.740]
friday are we gonna have all the stuff in the truck in the i would be

[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.380]
thing you know let's be sure because otherwise i'll take stuff with me you know

[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.380]
and it just um

[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.380]
a lot of confusion confusion and contusions

[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.240]
at these things and again a lot of it goes back to our space could it sales

[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.580]
people may not are just so hyper they need some doggy downers up there

[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.440]
and that into the building they really do they need some something or maybe

[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.160]
some of need to something because they're just so out of control they are that's

[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.520]
the operative word they are out of control anyway the rf is just

[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.800]
puking through those speakers on the ceiling again

[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.100]
and it's just another great monday here at wio d we're delighted you could be a

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.480]
part of it okay steve today this afternoon has got and by the way i hope that

[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.580]
box that i brought steve yesterday the dog crate works out well with his

[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.900]
little his new happy i just wanted to say that on the air so everybody knows

[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.160]
what a swell guy and by bringing steve that crate and uh the holocaust holocaust

[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.440]
revisionist david mccaldon who was so extreme that the institute for

[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.600]
historical review which he founded kicked him out

[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.580]
hmm and the other guest in this contrab controversy will be mark harman

[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.620]
now isn't that interesting mark harman but that's with an i

[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.560]
jewish activist concerned about the increase in neo nazism in the us so they're

[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.400]
going to be going at it and uh... painting each other's foreheads with various

[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.460]
symbols david will be paying or mark will be painting a david said with a jewish

[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.220]
star and the david will be painting swastik is on the walls it ought to be a really

[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.080]
exciting four hours on the can show and then speaking of excitement of course

[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.980]
this evening at six oh five well it's too far over there for me to reach

[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.960]
uh... uh...

[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.540]
we have the car

[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.000]
well it's so far to reach all of

[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.060]
she's you think it'll be worth it well we'll find out at six oh five it sports

[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.460]
talk with our favorite sports jok

[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.020]
that's a matter of exciting and josey that it's what it is

[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.820]
it'll be as exciting as ever okay

[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.860]
so i guess we better not dwell on the other stuff because it might create some

[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.800]
unpleasant feeling in the building we certainly wouldn't want to offend anybody

[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.340]
especially our account executive

[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:14.800]
uh...

[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.820]
oh no because there really is sharp as a maca ball

[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.580]
and of course then who was uh... handling the toyota can't let know is out

[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.720]
there yesterday to get everybody crazy she's a wonderful human being but

[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.420]
uh... jay i said to work we had been there about an hour and i said this is great

[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.660]
this is a lot better than the first one we did out there you know and i know i

[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.020]
wasn't counting the people but i just looking at the

[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.960]
nature of the people who are showing up in other words there were people of

[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.420]
all ages but there seem to be like more young family type people and young

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.200]
people and just living and breeding people

[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.940]
and it just seemed it was for me it was a lot more pleasant she's are you kidding

[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.100]
there's only half the people they've only sold freestinking cars about you know

[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.620]
whatever sales and as it turned out by the end of the day they had a super day

[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.620]
especially on a sunday which it was a beautiful day yesterday and people

[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.580]
actually go and do things family type things on sunday

[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.820]
but they did have a great day and she admitted that you were witness in here this

[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.680]
morning but in you know as the thing is going on she's giving you odd

[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.620]

[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.700]
almost speechless at this point i'm just starting to stutter

[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.700]

bandy the two part

[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.920]
what is it the limit stranger yeah which i watched again last night and after

[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.180]
having seen the movie i discovered two things

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.440]
a i appreciated the movie that much more and be i realized how the movie really

[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.020]
sucked okay was really very very uh... superficial it's very superficial

[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.680]
and the last part which to us in florida

[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.760]
is more significant i mean granted he evidently killed hundreds of girls all

[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.380]
over the country

[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.240]

[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.740]
well anyway the twelve year old girl um

[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.240]
that was like they were running out of time

[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.620]
in the end of the second part of the movie so they just like

[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.340]
i mean everything was like on not slanting you know how not slanting is

[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.600]
directed we talked about that before about how they go from one scene to another

[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.540]
thing a real fan and that's intentional on not slanting that's just part of the

[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.780]
way the show is done but that's how this movie was done the um

[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.800]
bundy thing it was really really sucked

[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.660]
