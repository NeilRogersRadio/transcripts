[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]
Let's go back to some more phone calls request for bits here. Got a hold on for a little. Um, be patient. Okay.

[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.420]
Oh me. Uh,

[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.080]
Fort Lauderdale. Oh boy.

[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.400]
But that's not an echo time. These stories could only go on.

[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.060]
You both are the genitals. Yes, let's talk about that story.

[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.860]
Are we allowed to? Well, we can.

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.140]
Yeah, we can allude to it. And look when he gets too dirty to like disco.

[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.420]
Yeah, the strobe like come on.

[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.040]
Well, to the names Herman and beans.

[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.360]
And prime and personal. Some semi famous female radio personality on love 94.

[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.240]
Who does that?

[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.500]
Is it on the woman who does afternoons on love any for your hand back on the button?

[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.240]
So what the allegations are they're not allegations. It's fact.

[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.380]
The allegations were you there for this presentation, Glenn? No, I like to see the video, Glenn.

[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.520]
Then she has personally dubbed portions of her husband's private life show.

[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.920]
You're gonna tell you.

[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.380]
You could do it. Cox.

[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.540]
With a name like Cox, you can say anything. That's true. Hey, remember. Uh, anyway, they were men in the

[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.900]
team. Herman Herman and beans and beans. That's a great idea. Cox, remember when the

[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.640]
now people sued you in Pittsburgh. I remember that. What a great story. We got to

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.640]
Pittsburgh, you know, Cox.

[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.100]
And of course, Pittsburgh is a fairly uptight town. You never missed all that

[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.520]
suit and the cold. I have a favorite. I don't mean interrupt you. I did interrupt you.

[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.100]
But you got to tell them the whole story that the now people sued Cox for using the

[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.080]
name Cox on the radio. Yeah. What? Yeah.

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.540]
So they finally asked him. They said great. But of course, they would you please give us your name. He goes

[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.360]
Donald Walter Cox. And I'm on the radio. And the judge said, can you prove that I said

[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.720]
burst-tip could be alright. He's a case dismissed. I heard that years ago. I heard that

[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.380]
so I forgot about it. That's where these suckers came from because immediately after

[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.080]
that. Now that's a whole other story. Yeah, it is folks. With Tanner and I, February

[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.200]
to fifth, 1975, Tanner and I got on an airplane. We had about four hours notice that we were going to Pittsburgh on a Sunday night.

[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.380]
Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, we got it with a bird. 80 degrees here. And it was like 12 inches of snow on the

[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.560]
ground there. And we'd only been there a few days. And the radio station was on the Mezzanine at a

[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.760]
Cosmin building, which is a right downtown at five points in the corner. And one day, you know,

[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.540]
you heard all these stories about how dirty Pittsburgh was and dut-dut. And I ran, I,

[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.740]
there were everybody was that was crossing the street had black foot on their forehead. And I ran

[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.400]
into Tanner and I said, I'm booking. I'm out of leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. I said, this

[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.560]
town is so dirty. People have put on their forehead. And I said, Tanner, look at me. And he said, it's

[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.200]
ash winds.

[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.780]
I swear.

[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.320]
All right.

[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.340]
Here's the bird.

[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.640]
Land hill.

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.600]
I made the hungry. I made the hungry. I think I've been fine.

[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.500]
You're sitting at home listening to cream of highs. I picked up my phone. I'm frozen.

[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.580]
I can die.

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.780]
Welcome back.

[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.080]

[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.280]
Welcome back.

[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.280]
The King of Knocket the Door.

[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.900]
It was a long, cheap, shallow, rough wish to be in for.

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.660]
Yeah, just open the mics one. They can hear all this chaos going on.

[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.580]
I'm always wearing a team on the radio on, on the Mezzanine.

[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.780]
Yes, well a little tribute to Uncle Neil. Where is Neil?

[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.460]
He's still from Florida. Go there tonight.

[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.340]
I get right tonight because you've been wrong but so long, baby.

[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.020]
That's right. I don't have a new job. He's the valet car theft.

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.620]
At what?

[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.860]
Combination value.

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.800]
I don't look at that boom box y'all got our size.

[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.700]
And how come we don't have a boom box like that?

[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.520]
They don't need a boom box here at W.I.O.D.

[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.300]
I saw his commercial.

[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.580]
Is there any plan to be jammed?

[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.720]
Well, they are now. They were playing me so hungry

[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.600]
the one you did with your former white James John.

[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.320]
There it is.

[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.480]
I'm very sexy too but what I really want right now is a whole lot of food.

[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.100]
But believe it, you're not funny.

[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.220]
He says no point me to the fridge.

[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.020]
Cause me so hungry.

[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.220]
I don't mean so hungry.

[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.020]
Oh me so hungry.

[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.920]
Oh me so hungry.

[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.640]
I eat all the time.

[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.580]
Oh me so hungry.

[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.440]
I mean so hungry.

[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.320]
Well, look who did it.

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.820]
Show now wait a minute.

[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.360]
You can't afford my bill.

[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.280]
You can't ignore me as she opens up a big bag of kiddos.

[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.400]
I don't want to play music here now so they can eat.

[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.580]
Sure, enjoy.

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.000]
Yeah, we are eating by the way from Forrest.

[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.900]
Well, you can't tell, Bird.

[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.420]
No, my mouth is on a bad bowl of food.

[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.680]
Now we've made this famous.

[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.040]
Now come on, this is what we're famous for.

[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160]
I've got to ask the question that I've been longing to ask.

[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.360]
From Forrest by the way.

[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.100]
You off the air.

[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.340]
So I'm going to ask you on the air.

[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.560]
Right.

[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.880]
Uh oh.

[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.100]
What is it like to be on the radio with Neil Rogers for hours a day?

[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.080]
Well Bill, I very honestly tell you, like a test for colon cancer.

[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.380]
How can I improve on that?

[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.500]
How can I improve on that?

[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.700]
Really?

[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.400]
Look at I possibly say to Tom Katz.

[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.120]
It's not painful.

[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.820]
It's not painful.

[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.840]
It's just uncomfortable.

[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.060]
Very seriously Bill, it's something everyone thinks they can do.

[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.640]
And I have encountered in the last few years an extreme amount of jealousy.

[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.500]
Everyone thinks they could do it.

[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.080]
Everyone would love to do it.

[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.520]
Just sit and just hang out with Neil sidekick.

[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.780]
What does he like as a person?

[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.680]
Is he off the air like a teddy bear?

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.260]
No, not at all.

[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.500]
It's teddy bear off the air.

[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.040]
Because I don't know any people think he's going to be there.

[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.740]
Because I call it.

[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.440]
I'm a Neil fan.

[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.980]
I'm a Neely.

[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.580]
I think he's great.

[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.760]
I don't know Neil off the air.

[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.760]
No, he's a wonderful man off the air.

[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.020]
I really like him personally.

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.800]
He's the most fair person I've ever encountered.

[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.880]
I think I was out of town.

[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.380]
That's right.

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.860]
He's also very, very bright.

[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.620]
And I for some reason Bill have the ability to do that.

[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.640]
I know how not to bug him.

[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.200]
I know how to do it.

[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.360]
And you learn over the years.

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.420]
I have a video tape I have to show you.

[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.700]
Of Neil doing a radio talk show on Channel 51 Television.

[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.100]
What?

[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.080]
He now?

[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.320]
Sitting there going, aren't you going to call?

[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.720]
He was doing issues in those days.

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.860]
I remember the old 51 show.

[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:13.400]
I wonder if people listening to the show realize how much guys like Neil Rogers have revolutionized

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.140]
talk radio.

[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.240]
They put emotion and audience back into talk radio.

[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.060]
Remember folks, when I first came to South Florida, which was I believe right after the hurricane

[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.340]
in late 1800s, right?

[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.780]
We're 26.

[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.940]
We came in a long boat.

[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.860]
Yeah, this is it.

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.480]
I was exiled from which I was exiled.

[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.860]
I remember the WKAT.

[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.280]
God bless their souls, whatever they're doing now, was the only talk station in my atmosphere.

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.460]
No one listened to it.

[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.320]
It had very low rating.

[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.900]
And then these guys got on WNWS before it went to sleep.

[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.540]
It was incredible.

[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.360]
And we're just raising our own dick.

[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600]
You know, Dick Casper.

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.780]
In the late 70s, you're asking that for you folks listening was a guy who was the first manager of Y100.

[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.700]
Did you see the guy who picked up that shag carpeting?

[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.520]
Yeah, ugly carpeting.

[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.940]
Oh man, the ugly is carpeting of any radio station in town.

[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.420]
And he personally stained it.

[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.120]
Right in the corners.

[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:21.000]
But it was a pretty dead place for talk radio until these guys came along and started raising hell.

[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.680]
And the latest chapter I guess is what's in the paper today about Neil's been successful in his lawsuit.

[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.700]
Yes, we can talk about that.

[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.600]
We don't talk about that.

[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.640]
No, we don't talk about that.

[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.520]
It says in the paper we can.

[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.800]
Yes, I know it does.

[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.360]
But we're not.

[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:33.960]
Oh, okay.

[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.680]
But we're very happy about it.

[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.940]
And you're right.

[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.420]
And I remember the old WNWS late 70s.

[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.240]
My first came to town.

[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.300]
Everyone in town listened to NWS.

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.920]
You know, they were incredible in the stays.

[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.900]
Well, you were on at night.

[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.440]
The company that owns them now bought them because they couldn't figure out how to get that success themselves.

[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.620]
And as soon as they bought them, they were indedent.

[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.800]
No, it's radio folks.

[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.080]
Well, you know, what better place than South Florida to have talk radios?

[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.340]
You know, because you've got such a tri-ethnic culture going on here and you have animosity.

[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.340]
Speaking many different puns.

[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.380]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.860]
But I think five miles north of Fort Lauderdale is Georgia.

[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:20.100]
So one thing though, I do think that I hear Niel a lot of times racking on radio in South Florida and the area is whole.

[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.880]
I don't know what it's an act.

[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.200]
But South Florida has great radio.

[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.000]
I mean, compared to New York, you talk about dull radio.

[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.460]
New York has dull radio.

[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.160]
You know, they have conservative boring dodgy.

[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:29.460]
Yeah.

[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:35.320]
This is a totally unique environment in the South Florida community with people arriving from all over the world.

[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.800]
And we've got to satisfy the taste of people who've lived everywhere.

[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.120]
It's not like if you're in one community, say, Indy and Appalus, where people are all with that Indy mindset.

[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.340]
Here, we've got a billion different mindsets.

[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.220]
And it's reflected in the way we drive as well.

[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.920]
We all learn how to drive in different places.

[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.240]
You know, and it's madness out on the road.

[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.920]
It's madness here in the radio studio.

[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.820]
Nobody knows how to drive here in the rain.

[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.720]
Here's a pleasure.

[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.200]
I say Joe, now look here.

[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.160]
One man, you can't beat all my child.

[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.140]
He looks up at me.

[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.020]
He's in the North on the cow and said, you got some more these biscuits.

[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.660]
And please pass the honey.

[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.840]
I'm my ever-to-heart.

[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.660]
Because me, so are Chris.

[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.320]
See how we reflect the community?

[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.860]
You know, what I say the one who taught you about is just that.

[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.320]
Because, and I want to be my director of community affairs.

[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.540]
And what else?

[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.480]
And general, nice guy.

[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:22.600]
It is.

[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.520]
It's a high road.

[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.920]
It's a lengthy, I have to take a break.

[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.500]
Oh, well, you go ahead and take your business.

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.600]
And then when you come back.

[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.020]
Because I want to talk about Megan Neal Ryzen's rap star.

[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.200]
That's what I want.

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.960]
The time is right.

[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:34.940]
You need to go with the changes.

[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.420]
The time is right.

[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.700]
I'll do the background.

[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:36.900]
I'll do the background.

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.920]
Now we're getting somewhere.

[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.360]
We'll be.

[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.980]
Oh, me, so hungry.

[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.800]
Oh, me, so hungry.

[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.580]
Oh, me, so hungry.

[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.380]
I keep all the time.

[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.380]
Oh, my.

[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.180]
You can get that at your favorite specs.

[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.320]
What's your favorite specs?

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.300]
No, you can't.

[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.660]
But we're trying to work on that.

[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.120]
It's good.

[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.900]
There's ways to make money.

[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:57.840]
Tyrone's there.

[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.440]
Now, see what I don't think about Neal is.

[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.040]
First of all, he large, kind of like heavy-d in the boys.

[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.220]
Or the half of him.

[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.420]
He Jewish like to beat the boys, right?

[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.760]
And he rich, so he probably got some gold.

[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.200]
You don't got some gold around his neck.

[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:12.500]
Yeah.

[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.760]
So I was thinking, you know, we changed the man named to MC Neal R.

[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.660]
And you can see his DJ, DJ Bird.

[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.800]
What do you think?

[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.380]
I even wrote a little rap song here.

[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.740]
Which I just, uh-huh.

[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.260]
I just have it with me.

[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:25.880]
I just have it with me.

[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.080]
Oh.

[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.980]
Yeah, that's better.

[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.720]
Check it out.

[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.680]
It's a better performance.

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.240]

[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.360]
And I got to be the baddest tall host in all of Miami.

[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.140]
I got bigger ratings than all other talkers.

[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.120]
I won't talk about listening to a using walkers.

[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.340]
From a 10 grand time on the MCC, I got to have a million dollars in free publicity.

[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.000]
I'm going to show that everyone would like to beat and all I had to do to get ratings is E.

[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.520]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.380]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:52.680]
Yeah.

[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.280]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.760]
I can see it.

[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.700]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.740]
Oh, me so long.

[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.860]
I see it all the fun.

[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.700]
Now, this is the way you always play it on your show, right?

[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.460]
Bill, just snip it.

[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.800]
Yeah, we just turn it on.

[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.220]
The background is by sniping the head.

[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.820]
Snip it in.

[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.120]
I mean, this thing is like three and a half minutes.

[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.540]
I mean, where do you think you are?

[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.300]
You know, like a hermitant bean songs that they have on that CD, which I'm going to be.

[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.000]
Some cruel person would get it to a local spec.

[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.380]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.060]
I'm sorry.

[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:22.800]
Some cruel people.

[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:28.520]
The cruel local broadcaster once suggested that Power 96 was actually the same record.

[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.040]
You see, if it's played over and over, we just take time out for our commercials.

[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.280]
We're going to go back to it.

[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.900]
So, there it is.

[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.760]
It's so hungry.

[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.620]
I said, you caught a tapeworm, you at Mangaloid.

[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.560]
Oh, my bed is crokkah.

[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.340]
And popped up on my back.

[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.600]
Yeah, it's good, yeah.

[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:49.920]
That's right.

[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.440]
Play on the wrench.

[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.800]
She goes down on

[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.060]
He's on cancer, Vinnie Winnie's

[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.280]
And even takes a last of that

[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.920]
Fuck your old Ling-Wingy

[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.520]
And as the wall stands for

[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.140]
Some of us still rumbly

[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.200]
She said my appetite is large

[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.160]
Cook me for the own grace

[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.440]
Only so hungry, only so hungry

[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.400]
I'm so hungry, I keep all the time

[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.020]
Now I've been playing this for an hour

[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.280]
And now we're making it here

[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:15.860]
We're still into the end

[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.300]
We're playing to y'all

[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.520]
Listen to who Jane Shallow is

[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.480]
Jane Shallow can actually be one of y'all

[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.540]
Listen because she like this

[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.780]
How can I say this

[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.820]
She used to be a stunt double for Mr. Ed

[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.160]
That's a horse-based woman

[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.620]
Yeah, a horse-based woman

[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.640]
And you had a relationship with her

[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.600]
A lumbering cow

[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.240]
On the woman

[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.420]
She's very large

[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.260]
And what explains your relationship

[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.660]
The kind of woman that she

[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.640]
Desperation

[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.700]
Get a great big bottle of cow-gorn

[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.580]
If you make love to her

[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.220]
It's like being on a water bed

[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.620]
She laid down and takes a while

[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.920]
For the motion to subside

[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.880]
And she's like right out the thigh

[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.620]
On a windy day

[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.580]
You can see white caps on the woman's house

[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.660]
Whatever you need

[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.740]
And there are mile markers

[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.300]
And the woman has speed bumps in her bedroom

[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.860]
If you want a hugger

[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.760]
You've got to use chalk

[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.460]
You start and you mark the end

[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:15.920]
Going around

[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.260]
Tyrone, will you tell us about your call to Larry King

[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.160]
When you call Nancy?

[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.540]
Oh, yeah, this is what Noah believes Tyrone

[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.780]
Yeah, nobody believes this

[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.640]
I couldn't figure out why

[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.940]
Because I always tell the truth

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.900]
A moment of silent prayer for that please

[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.160]
Thank you

[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.000]
Maybe Nancy on the phone over here

[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.420]
I was watching Larry King live

[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.120]
One night and Nancy Reagan was on that

[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.100]
Shamelessly

[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.220]
Hiking her book

[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.960]
He's plugging that book

[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.860]
My burn

[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.140]
Yeah, that's right

[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.420]
My turn to get at me

[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.560]
So that's all Reagan

[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.260]
Or who else is in the blood?

[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.120]
John Reagan, that's right, by half the

[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.940]
Reagan administration doing time

[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.540]
You know, if they ever want to

[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.600]
They ever want to do a reunion to it

[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.120]
She can have to clear it through the parole, boy

[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.040]
The aim material is not so anyway, right?

[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.520]
Tell us what happened

[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.960]
Ryan says, I wonder what Ed's doing these years

[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.020]
10 to 20

[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.420]
Well, I'm sitting in a hole

[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.980]
Tyrone has a little Tana's idea

[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.240]
I can't take credit for it

[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.680]
So Tana was sitting at home and he called up and said

[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.440]
Nancy Reagan going to be on that shamelessly plug in her tacky book

[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.860]
What was you?

[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.400]
Aha, this would be real funny

[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.540]
Why don't you call up and ask her a question

[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.260]
So to put her on a spot, so I call it

[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.240]
A woman on the phone

[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.600]
A king, a king, people said

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.820]
And there, ladies and gentlemen

[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.680]
Before God and the entire nation

[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.760]
Was Nancy Reagan live with Larry King

[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.980]
Speaking of the woman with Tyrone

[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.940]
A king, a woman who said about Ronny's hair

[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.120]
I said what I called up and I said

[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.700]
And the people asked me where I called it from

[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.040]
And I said Liberty City flood

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.600]
That's what they put on the screen

[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.340]
Liberty City flood

[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.180]
Liberty City flood and Larry King goes

[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.760]
Everybody says, all right, I'm going ahead, please

[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.320]
I'm going to have to take it for a Democrat right away

[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.320]
Right, right?

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.480]
So I said, Nancy, I want to answer your question

[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.980]
And I said, first of all, I want to say

[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.060]
I like Ronny's hair like that, that's a good look for him

[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.720]
Nancy laughed and Larry King laughed and

[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.620]
And then I said, you know, the phone call back and forth to Joan Quigley

[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.100]
Like who pays for them phone calls

[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:24.880]
What?

[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.800]
What she going to say to me

[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.800]
The tax pay is paid for me to be babbling off hours about

[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.320]
With my answer

[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.680]
Because Ronny go to the bathroom now, don't you

[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.580]
With her astrologer, right?

[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.800]
Ronny being the background going, I can't hold it anymore, man

[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.660]
And the phone, taking it on the phone

[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.060]
Find out if the stars are lined up

[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.820]
So I'll lined up

[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.000]
And you can hear Tyrone every morning on power 96

[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.420]
That's right, next to 97 GTR

[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.640]
I just Larry King, they don't come any better than Rogers and her payment report

[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.480]
Oh, Lord

[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.840]
We'll be right back to this, don't go away

[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.100]
I need a minute, we're back guys

[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:12.360]
Oh, Larry King, they don't come any better than Neil Rogers

[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.900]
So tradition continues

[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.500]
Doesn't it? That was Tyrone, by the way, we just want to mention that

[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.700]
We have a little party here, I guess you could say

[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.800]
That's kind of like a little party, we're eating, if I'm porous, we're like

[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.820]
I think the radio ducks

[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:30.420]
Yes, we're going to call Cramer and tell him he's going to be late

[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.080]
Yeah, let's do that, let's call Cramer

[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.200]
Give him the dial and I'll dial it

[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.600]
Yeah, okay, you'll have to come over here Carks

[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.580]
And since his neutral system weight loss, that's possible

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.760]
Okay, be given out these numbers on the air

[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.760]
And just dial it

[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.520]
And then put it on hold after it clicks in

[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.260]
And then I can, did it click in

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.380]
And then I can put it on the air

[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.420]
Yeah, and of course Cramer takes him a long time to answer

[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.580]
This is the private line directly too

[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.200]
This is the boss's line

[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.340]
Our guy who's probably the air and our calling to cuss him out for something

[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.280]
Now next door at the TTR, next door by the way, they are when the boss wants to call

[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.260]
This is the hotline

[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.460]
You got a strobe light flash in his eyes taking a picture

[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.360]
No, I've worked at stations that had him

[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.120]
Next door, we're going to get a hand

[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.860]
A Y100 has one, they have the strobe light

[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.760]
Same next door

[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.300]
The boss has to call more there

[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.860]
It makes noise, it goes to Ciel

[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.800]
Hi Cramer, oh Cocks

[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.140]
Hi, and Tanner

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.000]
And Tanner, we're here alive or as live as one can be on the wonderful Isle of Dreams

[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.380]
The WIOD 16 on the AM frequency

[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.080]
And we thought we'd call you three

[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.500]
We've got everyone in town on the radio on one station

[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.080]
If they blow it up, we're in bad

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.220]
No, I think we're better off, don't you

[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.400]
And we'll be here

[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.420]
Just start all over again, get new radio personality

[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.880]
I've heard you tell some of those sleazy Pittsburgh stories

[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.600]
That's how I've been tuning in

[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.600]
He's monitoring us because the EBS test

[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.740]
That's right, EBS Tanner is there

[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.280]
I'm the program director

[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.400]
Oh my god, I'm going to critique

[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.880]
Since you've been listening to that, you have the Rosemary Clooney record

[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.260]
You know that I'm having too much fun to come to work for a while

[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.440]
Well, the L would you

[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.720]
Somehow we knew he'd say that

[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.540]
To a clock, I'm out the door, babe

[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.440]
He doesn't fall and hit the nose

[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.600]
I have some radio

[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.900]
Well, fortunately, Kramer, you have some of those long disco records you can play

[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.600]
One lined up next

[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.580]
We're going on there and serve notice to the public, okay?

[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.620]
Okay, we'll do that

[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.700]
All right, everything okay?

[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.400]
Everything's fine. That's too bad

[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.580]
All right, Kramer, you're in charge

[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.060]
Manager though. That's right

[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.300]
You're in charge, Kramer. That's right, I'm in charge

[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.180]
Now what radio state can you work at again?

[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.800]
What? What state is this?

[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.600]
Power 96

[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.000]
Thank you very much, Kramer

[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.920]
It's up to 97.8TR

[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.100]
Yes, Kramer. Let's get those call letters out there

[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.900]
Somebody has something they want to say to you Kramer

[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.200]
Wait a minute, my song's in

[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.700]
Oh, can we listen?

[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.420]
Never bothered you before

[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.920]
Really?

[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.480]
This is only a segue. This is not important

[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.760]
There's nothing so said in sign-up

[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.820]
Successful segue

[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.940]
Listen to how good this is going to be

[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.700]
Better than sex segue

[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.420]
Listen to this

[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.660]
Oh, I might love a song into a disco tune, hold on

[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.300]
Man broadcasted on two radio states

[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.580]
Oh

[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.500]
It's all right

[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.580]
Was that better than sex frame?

[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.040]
That's like you're enjoying it

[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.920]
Too bad it didn't go into French kiss

[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.320]
That's not French kiss that song we play with all the moaning at the end

[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.620]
The fox came on after yesterday and said

[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.380]
Well, I sure am glad they finally got that tooth bold

[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.520]
You better

[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.340]
Want to cigarette, babe?

[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.740]
Give me a bucket of cold water

[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.440]
You're like four on that woman

[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.440]
Kramer

[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.380]
Yes sir

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.600]
We have a message for someone wants to tell you something

[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.080]
Okay, listen carefully

[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.100]
Give me 15 bucks I'll put in a word for you with the Lord

[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.040]
That was Larry King

[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.000]
Larry King

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.140]
Larry's here with us disembodied in the city

[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.160]
His memory is still floating and a few of his checks are still on the wall

[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.840]
I don't want to ask you a question

[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.520]
Long me 50 bucks

[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.340]
So you're being entrapped

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.480]
You'll be in the track

[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:20.880]
See you Kramer

[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.220]
Well Kramer you threw all your materials so we're going now

[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.020]
Okay good night

[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.380]
I'll try to be there pretty close to time to go to work

[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.460]
You better be here exactly time to go to work

[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.280]
See ya

[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:32.840]
Bye

[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.400]
Let's see what's on these other lines

[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.500]
The phones are lit up

[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.120]
We have other calls these people have been hanging on for 100 pellet collars

[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.760]
Yeah probably all mobiles

[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.800]
Date of Miami

[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.900]
Yeah, bird

[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.240]

Hello with Shower what do you feel with guys

[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.260]
He's on Shower what

[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.280]
I don't want my own

[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.600]
No way

[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.780]
Oh sir be nice

Let me get you all stand in the man just got us

[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.340]
You're supposed to wait till Stan gets here before you start dumping out

[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.040]
You're working to just recently

[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.300]
Yeah be nice to that man

[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.780]
But thanks anyway

[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.000]
I really like to congratulate you on your show

[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.260]
And you're really keeping the ratings good for Neil here

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.560]
That's right thanks a lot

[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.380]
To our show grin by the way

[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.880]
This is incredible

[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:24.740]
Dontons

[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.860]
We are a mile

[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.720]
Phil Tanner and Mark Mosley

[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.680]
Here Mark brought us some stuff

[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:30.940]
Besides this

[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.620]
But you'd never know

[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.620]
We'll get to him as soon as we can

[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.360]
I'm trying to get done with this

[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.200]
Let's go down another verse on it

[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.600]
I could eat and watch it hooters with big wallet

[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.720]
I know

[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.400]
And I had a few beers afterward

[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.440]
And we had big breath

[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.860]
Is it hooters today

[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.060]
Yeah a lot of them commercial right now

[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.820]
Reload these

[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.040]
Oh my god

[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.080]
97 GTR

[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.420]
Which is down the dial from power

[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.640]
Which is at 96.5 on your head

[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.660]
We were neighbors sometime in the early morning

[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.620]
Always used to be though

[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.220]
No we were 96.4

[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.120]
We're talking about radio

[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.720]
You guys started off at 96.3 and now you're 96.5

[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.400]
Here's the go Bill

[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.380]
Here's the go

[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.800]
That is the old 96.6 signal

[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.300]
96.5

[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.560]
Was the original signal

[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.280]
You mean Jerry Clifton's favorite frequency?

[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:23.860]
Yes

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.600]
Jerry is the voice of the

[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.780]
Promotional announcements on power 96

[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.580]
Go where?

[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.860]
How are you?

[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.860]
Jerry come on and say

[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.180]
Power 96

[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.720]
You got to close really

[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.600]
You got to close you got to take a windscreen

[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.700]
You ever see Jerry do this?

[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.740]
You got to take a windscreen off

[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:47.860]
And you have to do it

[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.160]
Left channel and then right

[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.180]
You got to take channels

[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.120]
You can't do

[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:58.260]
I learned how to toss 45s across the programers office

[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.100]
Jerry Clifton is the consultant

[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.040]
That helps me program power 96

[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.940]
And Cox used to work when he actually had a job

[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.900]
Tell him about Jerry in a bar

[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.100]
Clifton you small guy

[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:11.480]
About what?

[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.200]
He has the biggest Napoleonic complex of anybody I've ever met

[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.460]
He used to

[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.200]
After 45 peps blue ribbons

[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200]
With

[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.020]
With

[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.280]
Scale one across the dance floor

[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:27.880]
And somebody

[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.600]
And then when they came over to ask him why he did that

[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.360]
He'd say you want to fight my friend Cox

[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.160]
And finally after three or four of these nights out

[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.480]
I let him do that one night or he did it without my asking me

[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.480]
And the guy this burly human came over

[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.340]
And he said to him

[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.840]
You want to fight my friend Cox

[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.940]
And I said go ahead do anything you want to do

[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.940]
And I said go ahead do anything you want to do

[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.960]
That pretty much cured Jerry

[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.880]
I haven't

[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.300]
That cured Jerry of doing that anymore

[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:04.140]
Now if you notice Don Cox has the BC headache powder lined up in front of him

[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:09.900]
What does the Freudian implications of your line up on BC for honest pain relief headache powder?

[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.000]
Look I figured the show was going to be a pain

[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.100]
But Cox you had said this before

[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.960]
Oh it says for fast-paced pain relief

[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.600]
I thought it said for honest pain relief

[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.780]
Try yourself and see if you don't switch to power and he says

[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.440]
Oh

[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.080]
Well stay majors in the building

[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.900]
Oh yeah

[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.160]
There he is

[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.160]
Okay let's take our hand you've aged well

[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.560]
Oh that's too weak

[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:38.780]
Yeah

[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.640]
We're going to take him in that couple of years off

[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.380]
Friend after the break all right we'll be right

[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.980]
Hi I'm Tom Bovan from Motel Sick

[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.840]
With some fatherly advice for the young newlyweds

[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.400]
Come stay with us at Motel Sick

[00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.620]
We understand a young couple sometimes don't have a lot of money to be spending on one of them fancy Hawaiian honeymoon

[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.040]
Besides your parents don't even know you're married and she's under age so you had to cross state lines

[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.280]
That's all right we won't tell the authorities providing you cooperate

[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.040]
We'll only charge you ten bucks for the room

[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.200]
And you let us make some complimentary video mnemos if you're wedding night

[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.260]
And don't worry you won't even know old Tom is here

[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.640]
I'll just be in the closet

[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.420]
I'm completely harmless so you kids just go at it

[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.180]
I won't be any bother at all

[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.640]
Nobody gets hurt

[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.600]
And nobody has to be dragged off

[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.220]
I've been using authorities for being under the age of consent

[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.000]
Oh, Bovan from Motel Sick

[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.580]
Come stay with us we'll leave the line on for you

[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.320]
That's great that's what a Mark Mosley's bit say he brought a few of these

[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.280]
They I really appreciate this that's great

[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.460]
Mosley is hilarious

[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.220]
Yes, Stan so

[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.640]
The box was just saying thank God you never took drugs

[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.340]
Yeah, it's true we would drop us

[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.100]
No, no we'd rather not

[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.500]
It's very true

[00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.240]
Have a BC

[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.760]
I'll do a BC

[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.340]
Was he on the phone just for the phone?

[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.420]
Why not? My amy

[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:05.980]
Couldn't get worse

[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.360]
Yes, yeah

[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.780]
Yeah, Bill

[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.860]
Oh, well, how you doing?

[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.040]
Well, mine are fine sir yours

[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.440]
Oh, just fine, tell me can you do me a favor Bill?

[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.360]
I'm afraid not sir

[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.500]
Oh, come on, this is my favor

[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.220]
You're under heavy FCC warnings

[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.660]
No more TV commercials

[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.920]
Well, you know, I have to give back some of the pain that the early morning gives me

[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.800]
It's idiot

[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.540]
It's terrible

[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.200]
I agree sir, thank you

[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.220]
Okay, but another thing is

[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.860]
About your morning show

[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.800]
Why do you bother doing issues in the morning?

[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:47.900]
I don't know

[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.980]
I just sometimes we occasionally touch bases with reality but we try to leave as quickly as possible

[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.880]
Yeah, the thing that just touches me about that is

[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.380]
I mean your audience is mostly

[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.180]
Sir, what is your question?

[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.940]
What do you do for a living?

[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.700]
I'm a college student

[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.540]
Uh-huh

[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.040]
What are you going to be when you go on?

[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.440]
Well, possibly an engineer

[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.940]
I see you're on a guest proctologist

[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.960]
What do you translate so that we should never touch base with reality?

[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.000]
Well, especially with your audience

[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.200]
You know, you got basically

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.360]
Why don't you do an ethnic slur for us?

[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.360]
I feel that coming, sir

[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.200]
No, I wasn't going to do an ethnic slur

[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.340]
I was going to come close

[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.640]
I was going to say Castro haters

[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.860]
And teeny hoppers

[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.740]
We have those

[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.360]
We have both subcultures listening, yes

[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.100]
Which one do you fall into, sir?

[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.860]
Well, what do I fall in?

[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:48.700]
I'm from

[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.240]
He's in the academic vacuum

[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.320]
I think he's approaching post-pubescence, but it isn't working

[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:53.940]
Yeah

[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.260]
He's in the academic vacuum

[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.400]
But every time a call comes in, I can predict exactly what they're going to say

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.680]
I can too

[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.660]
Then into the electric chair or

[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.000]
I recall saying that several times, were you listening then?

[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.440]
I must have been out of room at the time

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.540]
You were sitting in the electric chair

[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.400]
Okay

[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.960]
All right, sir, well we will clear

[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.520]
That's okay, that was the opinion

[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.160]
That's right

[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.520]
All right, opinions are like that

[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.240]
And that's fine, man, everybody's got one

[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.460]
That did you like the pizza from Florida?

[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.040]
And would you like to say we're a dress?

[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:28.780]
I'll stand in the rain

[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.920]
The pizza was Florida was great

[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.720]
Would you say who would like to address that?

[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.280]
What the gentleman called him a gentleman?

[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.800]
What did he say?

[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.520]
Turned and I'd like to throw around a lot

[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.600]
He would ask him why do we do that?

[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.240]
Because people are interested in it

[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.720]
You know, comedy is fine

[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.080]
And weather is fine and traffic and all that

[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.740]
But a lot of the people who listen to the morning show like

[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.660]
Particularly we do a commentary, Jim Realey, who is a commentator

[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.880]
This morning was on a Liberty Letterman

[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.220]
Yeah, all about the Latin spin

[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.920]
So that's, you've got some interesting things

[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.980]
There's something that you said are interesting

[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.760]
Jim takes, Jim takes, well, Jim's pretty conservative guy politically

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.100]
And he takes some pretty strong stands

[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.820]
And people call up and fight on it

[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.700]
You know, and a lot of people say

[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.900]
What the hell they want to do that for?

[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.580]
Why don't you just play another Tyrone record?

[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.060]
But we do it because it's our show and it's not nerds

[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.720]
And they're looking forward to careers in talk radio

[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.280]
They are, and that's true, we are

[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.280]
But it's the same with this show

[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.660]
Brunching that age, don't you think?

[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.060]
Uh-oh

[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.640]
But it's not talk about it

[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.880]
And Tanner's birthday is December the 6th

[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.840]
Is it real?

[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.180]
So we're going to play a comment on it

[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.380]
We'll be changing demographic groups once again

[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.160]
Oh, he goes up in the...

[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:37.520]
He goes up in the my demo

[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.640]
Yeah, then goes up to the next demo

[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.380]
Oh, oh my

[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.260]
I'm just worried about going into WLYF's demo or something

[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.800]
Not quite that bad yet

[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.120]
Production's easier though

[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.540]
But I'm heavy in the news talk

[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.000]
Yeah

[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.640]
Okay, let's go to Miami, hello

[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.780]
Well, yeah

[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.540]
Burr, you're doing a great job there on the show

[00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.100]
Oh, thanks

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.940]
I think it's tremendous

[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.240]
I like to congratulate Mark Mosley

[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.380]
With all the work he's doing on Parliament at 96

[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.420]
Thank you

[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:05.880]
Great too

[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.020]
And I like to know if you have a card for GTR

[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.300]
The one about the condom

[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.160]
A card?

[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:13.960]
Yeah

[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.560]
A card

[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.280]
Oh, sure, that one, the one we're no longer permitted to play

[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.740]
Really?

[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.540]
Is it number three?

[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.800]
Yeah, it's right there

[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.680]
I can't even name it

[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.060]
A.M. nor FM is permitted to sign any longer

[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.840]
Thanks to your federal government

[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.880]
Oh, let's see what it is

[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.300]
96

[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.300]
It's a public service

[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.580]
And it tries to stop the spread of the gastro-disease A

[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.860]
And it offers some suggestions on how one might do that

[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.640]
So you have to buy the CD to hear it

[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.580]
But you can't buy it because it's sold out

[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.080]
Hold down

[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.940]
And don't call me for a tape, please

[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.460]
We're becoming more and more conservative here

[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.380]
Sorry

[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.060]
That's that's that stuff that you know

[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.500]
You know exactly what's going on in there

[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.680]
But you're not permitted to hear it any longer because

[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.360]
That's the way the country works

[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.340]
And why is TV exempt?

[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.320]
Well, there's an interesting point about that that's made

[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.420]
Funny that you should ask about that

[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.580]
Yeah, I'm going to bring with me now

[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.640]
A little piece of paper

[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.340]
This is one of the radio trades

[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.440]
Good, they no longer come in the mail, they fax them to you

[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.300]
So what it says here, this is a guy named Jeff Pollock

[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.440]
Who is another one of those radio consultants

[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.560]
Yes, he is apparently Jeff Pollock

[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.920]
And this big thing that says he is further perplexed

[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.560]
At an apparent double standard

[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:25.180]
Yes, the FCC inconsistently find two Miami radio stations

[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.200]
For playing the song P, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, envy

[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.520]
Yet dropped a complaint against the Heraldos show

[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:38.500]
For its discussion of angry, the V word, and angry, the P word

[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.320]
For some of these of their own

[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.380]
So this guy is saying, do you want Al Psyx, who's the FCC chairman

[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.680]
Deciding the artistic value of such songs as Marvin Gaye's sexual healing

[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.420]
The Eagles' life and the Fast Lane

[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.380]
Diastrates money for nothing with its line about very little, the F word

[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.680]
Will the FCC ultimately tell Ted Coppill, Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey, and Dr. Ruth as well as local news editors

[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.580]
What issues they can and cannot talk about over the air, where does this censorship stop?

[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.760]
What do you think, Skip? I mean, you know, I know you have some legal background

[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.500]
Well, you know, there's in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art

[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.300]
There's this big painting by Picasso, a classic musical painting called The Three Musicians

[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.900]
And there's a dog, it's a cubistic painting

[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.720]
And it's a little hard to decipher the figures and the dog's tail

[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.620]
It's kind of between somebody's legs underneath the table

[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.440]
Don't you think we ought to rip that painting off the wall?

[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:33.140]
And you're a bit, anyone to see that because after all, they might get the wrong impression about how to think

[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:37.640]
Well, what this guy is basically urging is the broadcaster stand up and make a united front

[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.480]
And say that this should not happen, that this censorship then it shouldn't happen

[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.980]
Well, the things that are happening in Eastern Europe right now, those people are asking for freedom

[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.240]
They're asking if they want to hear these songs

[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:57.600]
But that's the ironic thing about it here, Europe is now asking for democracy and a little openness in their government

[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.520]
And they're asking a lot of governments to resign and a lot of them are doing it

[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.740]
And in this country, we seem to be going backwards

[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:09.820]
Well, I think the other TV and you watch the world over there, I think the show that's happening is on this lexic lesbian Satanist mother-in-law

[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:18.500]
I think you might just be like, and you wonder how to just sit around and smoke something and come up with these toppings

[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.880]
They've got to run out of ideas

[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:26.120]
Well, I think what they do is cut a bunch of words, just individual words out of the newspaper

[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.000]
And then toss them up and then have a lay land

[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.560]
Let's see the topic for tomorrow

[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:32.940]
Lesbian Denses

[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.860]
Paulie Lovewood, Cowboy Punk Rocker

[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.820]
How about the commercials on TV for the fantasy lines?

[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:50.260]
We call it for like 35 bucks a shot, they run during afternoon sports programming on cable

[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.920]
You can be a nine-year-old kid and tune in

[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:58.280]
The latest one is Mrs. Clause, Mrs. Santa Clause, she's doing what?

[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.960]
Talking about your Christmas fantasy

[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.320]
I bet she is

[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.440]
We can't play 30

[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.340]
Gentlemen, I'm going to have to say goodbye, I have to go do a radio show

[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.340]
As opposed to this?

[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.220]
Keep it clean, cost

[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.380]
I'll try my best

[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.700]
Right when you go do the news, I'll stay till you do the show

[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.560]
Well, yeah, that's right

[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.540]
Well, okay, great. Well then what do we think?

[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.780]
Yeah, we need to take our last break of the hour

[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:23.560]
Okay

[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.360]
From Palm Springs to Palm Beach

[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.860]
She's filled every basement work center in the country

[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.300]
And now get ready, Helen Dale

[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.460]
Today, the sportsman's wealth is good

[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.280]
A stranger calls us to be bad

[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.020]
I love you too

[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:44.840]
This Sunday, one afternoon only, a mercenying blue hair over the regga-door

[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.040]
This will

[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.240]
This will

[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.060]
This right really takes us

[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.620]
I have a falling love

[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.260]
Okay, all day up to noon, in the basement work room of the millenies

[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.360]
Please come to the building of the house

[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.820]
Oh, these little milk, what special guest, put a single on here

[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.760]
Thank you all

[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.820]
Oh, you must wait

[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.680]
I'm in love

[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.640]
I'm a popular prince, Finn Blackner

[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.380]
Who is Finn?

[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:22.640]
Oh, it makes me so warm

[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.700]
I am claiming claim

[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.440]
The whole night rule

[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.700]
Adventure is unsealed now, it won't go in birth

[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.480]
One is done, cafeteria liberation

[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.500]
Online, I don't feel secure, remember

[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.960]
What you probably want

[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.380]
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.640]
It's the law, it's the perfect way

[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.100]
It's the law, it's the perfect way

[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.580]
You can say that on my cut

[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.040]
God, yes, I can say it

[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.120]
Cox, when did taste ever matters here?

[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.500]
Yes, I just going to say it's a discount for Alzheimer's face

[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.680]
But he forgot what he was going to say

[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.340]
And now a pun

[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:11.380]
Welcome to a radio party, except this one is not behind the scenes, it's on the air

[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.400]
Don Cox is here for a few moments, you got to go, you got to go to the radio

[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.460]
I actually do a real show

[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.640]
Cramer is going to walk in

[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:16.840]
You did

[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.820]
You never know whether you're talking to Mark or Tyrone

[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.940]
Some of the adventures of being on the radio with most

[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.300]
Yeah, I can't imagine

[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:34.700]
And in addition to Tyrone, we brought with us a gentleman who for a number of years earned his living as a professional beer taster in Davy Ford

[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.000]
Here is ladies and gentlemen, Red Wood

[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.960]
Thank you very much

[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.140]
Oh yeah, go ahead

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.040]
Red married to a woman with a substantial growth of back hair

[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.800]
He actually has her name spelled out in it

[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.460]
It's why his name is Balza

[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.000]
My wife's name is Balza Wood

[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.920]
And she's a pretty large woman

[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.020]
It would turn out to this woman

[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.220]
Well, the other day I was a...

[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.440]
Yeah, the other day I was a...

[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.420]
Son's name is Drift

[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.740]
Yeah, my son's name is Drift, he's 13

[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.300]
And I got a daughter 15, her name is Ply

[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.800]
And she's Plyable

[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.140]
She is in love with as many young girls as she is with Ernest Borgnine

[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.060]
He has actual beef cake posters of Ernest Borgnine

[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.520]
On the wall

[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.240]
And lining the trailer park at 95

[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.260]
At 95?

[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.140]
Not at 95

[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.360]
Not at 95 trailer park

[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.820]
You know what happened to me the other day

[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.180]
You don't have to meet the other day

[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:41.760]
You know what happened to me the other day

[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.880]
I know you don't I?

[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.080]
Well, the whole family

[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.360]
I was going to say the other day over naughty pines

[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.480]
Just the other day we had a terrible thing happen to me

[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.000]
I was out in my front yard

[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.280]
Or what I call my front yard

[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.820]
And this is for it

[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.800]
And concrete slab

[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.540]
I yelled out to my next door neighbor

[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.640]
And this young Latin youths having me driving by

[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.520]
And they heard me call out to my neighbor

[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.200]
And they jumped out of their car and beat the living son

[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.980]
That was a love call that you actually had

[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.780]
Was my next...

[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.000]
...discudement issued from your mouth

[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.800]
My next door neighbor Sue Maudray

[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.560]
Sue Maudray

[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:32.560]
I jumped out of the car unprovoked and beat the hell out of him

[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.120]
I jumped believing

[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.300]
We'll get some more false stuff in here

[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.240]
We have a collect call from Christmas Florida here

[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.100]
Hello

[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.460]
Hello Christmas Florida on the farm

[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:48.940]
Hey

[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.980]
Hey, you know where Christmas is?

[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.420]
I know where it is

[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.560]
Well this is the busiest post office in the United States

[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.080]
For Christmas just so you'll know

[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.560]
You guys moved by any fast and then regular place?

[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.140]
That's what Florida is for me

[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.820]
It's located between Orlando and Titusville

[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.620]
And I moved out of Miami

[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.920]
I lived down there six years

[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.380]
I moved out about six months ago

[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:11.720]
Yeah

[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.080]
And had changed jobs and moved up to Orlando

[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.460]
Yeah, it's hard to find violence

[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.180]
The greatest part is I'm going to tie...

[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.460]
I'm sending such dire desire for big city radio with you

[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.420]
You guys come close

[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:24.840]
Yeah

[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.840]
That is what you're going to get

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.600]
And you can hear us, right?

[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.780]
I know, I'll send you in

[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.700]
I listen to the end of the rendering and I heard the bird come on

[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.820]
And I can't believe I got the entire radio market of South Florida on the farm

[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.920]
Yeah, it was kind of polluting the entire peninsula

[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.340]
Florida

[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.220]
I told you they can hear us all over this state

[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.840]
Oh yeah, absolutely I'm an enemy

[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.180]
Number of sheep are grazing, listening to us happily and incredibly now

[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:47.500]
Correct

[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.240]
So did they ever finish I-95?

[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.580]
Did they radio station or a highway?

[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.060]
The radio station version is definitely finished

[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.560]
Yeah, I think he's easily finished it off and moved on to highway 105

[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.800]
Take a fork and it's done

[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.680]
Anyway, I just say I think it's great

[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.260]
I thought I'd stop in Christmas

[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:12.060]
And I knew you'd be interested in who is in Christmas and why are they calling?

[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.460]
Yeah

[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.160]
Well this is great because I was just telling them earlier that you can hear us all over the state

[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.220]
God knows who's listening to us

[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:23.320]
Just think about how many people is getting this radiated frequency and what it's doing to their brain now

[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.340]
It's great, it's fulfilling

[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.100]
I've found the spirit again

[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.800]
Oh okay

[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.120]
I have a good pleasure to the coast though

[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.440]
Yeah

[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.160]
Well I'm really a doctor and get rid of it, sir

[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:33.960]
Get a prescription

[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.880]
Yeah, my car is

[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:41.000]
I took my old job back at the beginning of the week but they decided they'd let me do it up here in Orlando

[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.240]
And I just found it

[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:48.520]
It's sort of the heartwarming moment where I started back at my old job who's based in Miami and

[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.920]
and gosh, there you guys are on the radio

[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.280]
And phone caller or biographer

[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.140]
It's a travel law

[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.840]
It almost brings a tear to my eyes

[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.960]
Well I'm sorry to hear that, sir

[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.560]
Thank you for calling

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.500]
Hey, I appreciate you guys being on and it's great showbird

[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.420]
Tell Neil that you're definitely stiff competition if he knows what I mean

[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.380]
Can we go now?

[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.680]
Is it time for the news?

[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.220]
Debra is going to do the news

[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.360]
Debra Martinez, a guy that's going to say look, I had a great time these three hours

[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.460]
Thanks for coming back

[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.640]
And I'm sure you will treat Tanner well

[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.180]
Well I'm going

[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.700]
Only for more hours to go

[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.920]
But we'll be back in a few minutes

[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.780]
Hey boy, girls, it's Tyrone

[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.780]
Tyrone's steel is a really cool dude

[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.220]
And now you can have fun playing with Tyrone

[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.860]
Yes, it's the Tyrone steel talking doll

[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.860]
Full of real gold chain and he says 14 different chill things like

[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.060]
I'll be a hubcat

[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.960]
Or, oh, look out, it's the police

[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.660]
And you can have fun pretending that Tyrone is stolen all the furniture from Barbie's dream house

[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.380]
This is a right stereo

[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.160]
And Tyrone comes with accessories

[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.200]
Six watches, a real gold chain and this crowbar

[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.520]
And he's a real gold chain

[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.620]
The Tyrone steel talking doll

[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.540]
Just in time for Christmas kids

[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.960]
Talking Tyrone doll comes with everything you see here with me Houston doll sold separately from Scamo

[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.220]
I'll see you to ease that city because with me Houston has my girlfriend

[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.160]
And just for here it goes this again

[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.600]
Now I asked him my girlfriend's name is Jenny Taylor

[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.280]
Yeah, now that's the trick

[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.400]
Jenny's a big woman

[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.840]
Let's put that delay on Barbie, what do you think?

[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.980]
I think it might be a spilping

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.520]
We're waiting for it to build

[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.120]
I feel much better when that light comes up

[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.860]
Well, it takes a while

[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.840]
You know one of the things that we do on a 10 in the morning show

[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.980]
This would be okay for the senses and stuff

[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.860]
He said the lights are on really Tyrone

[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.080]
All right, well one of the things that we do

[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.640]
We do a thing called a street math lesson

[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.680]
And yeah, all right, you were very popular with that one

[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:50.000]
This would be good because this is a very erudite doll party

[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.580]
You did an example of a one of Tyrone street math lessons

[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.840]
You have to solve the math problem

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.480]
Here it is

[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.460]
A trial rail train leads downtown Miami at 6.22

[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.340]
Now listen carefully

[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.840]
Racing North not stop along a congested I-95 at 50 miles an hour

[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.720]
It arrives in Fort Lauderdale at 6.27 now

[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.700]
What are the odds that the two people on the train know each other?

[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.500]
People are applauding

[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.480]
Now that's an issue that's the problem

[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.560]
My people are Negro

[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.560]
They host the People Dole Want issues

[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.860]
Oh, oh my

[00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.200]
Apparently we don't want the train either

[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.480]
There's no issues, no answers

[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.300]
Okay, let's go to the phone

[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.760]

[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:55.740]
years and years and years ago back when you and Jim and were on the the why and the

[00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:03.080]
former Y 100 right the old Y 102 I used to give away remember the mugs used to

[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:07.420]
give away oh yeah yeah mug people you know we talked about people getting mugged

[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:12.460]
so we had a promotion where we people got mugged in the morning oh yeah I came up there

[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.580]
I think I came up twice oh and the booty you stay boy booty that's right

[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.200]
loose we had a we actually have a book for the station whose name was loose booty

[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:26.640]
duty it was really a lot of fun it is the only time I've really ever gotten to

[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.900]
do it go into a studio and everything and oh you came up and visited so I did all the

[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:37.080]
all the time yeah you told me come on up and yeah right and and the wall paper at the

[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:42.160]
old at the former Y 100 was really something to admire all I remember is that that

[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:48.960]
that felt like a holiday in bathroom yeah yeah it was it is that it is that one time I was up

[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.360]
there though I I didn't know how because the only person that was in there was the person I think

[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.340]
they came on after you because I called by call like early in the morning when you were on

[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:02.300]
mm-hmm and I don't was it Kramer that came on after you Kramer the midday man

[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:08.840]
right even then Kramer even a while out of a rather mediocre career and it was like he was the

[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:14.940]
only person in in the room and I couldn't tell him he meant I got to go and I was like stuck in

[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:20.240]
there one time because it took him like about 40 minutes for him to to like take a break or whatever

[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.540]
one time so you were imprisoned in the I was imprisoned there I mean I enjoyed it but

[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:35.040]
well let's not get into this so I mean that we've gone far enough with that story um she's stuck in

[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.120]
the thing with Kramer it kind of boggles the mind like Cox when Cox sped out on and played the

[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.220]
locomotion he really did do that yeah I know that he locked himself in the studio forever and it

[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:49.280]
was something that you know really affected many people's lives towards them where they live

[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.840]
they're still talking about it uh we're having a really you don't really want to tell stories

[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.940]
bill about tell your engineer and me uh going to crazy I'm not a engineer Greg the stick

[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:07.800]
the looper the looper the looper and the interloper as he's known the engineer Greg Stryckman and

[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:15.960]
the bird here are friends and they visit various taudry joints how did you see you know the kind of

[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:22.400]
places that you see lots of footage of tonight on slime keg under the guys that it's real news

[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.200]
that people want to see that's right and not a cheap ploy to get rating that's right I went out

[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.940]
uh next door to the television station you're doing the news and watched them preview some of that

[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:37.440]
some boys in the back room were running over some footage for the news tonight now it was research

[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:45.320]
bill yeah research in the place anyway the story is so bubbles is back bubbles called me a few

[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:50.220]
weeks ago she's back you're that Stryckman bubbles is back but we'll never get in

[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:55.800]
oh engineering work done now I alerted him you know well let's see what was the story let's see

[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:03.440]
he tries to remain calm but he gives himself well you know I need to go with the most perverted friend

[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:12.480]
I have and uh he took the bill you Greg you know I get love so now we had a great time actually we

[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.500]
had a good time we we were on our best behavior he was trying to lie about where he was going

[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:23.580]
actually and we busted him you know what was so funny was the day I went up to pick him up that day

[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:30.580]
he went after work and Cox told it on the radio where we were he told the world you know where we

[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:37.260]
were going that's our man yeah sure is boy it was fun having him here today Cox is a radio veteran

[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:44.480]
probably he should be mr. disc jockey of some year of perhaps a century they could give away

[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:50.240]
you know for for radio awards little statues of Cox naked they would be called did you get your

[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:58.700]

[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.400]
it would interfere sometimes you get him close to a radio tower

[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:27.380]
his hair goes like hey why then make this nation walk there because he got so many

[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.200]
you know what I think is an incredible story bill is geno latino who used to do I get

[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.960]
the weekends at your station it's now at the brie yeah yes that's just hard to imagine

[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.880]
geno is a good disc jockey and he's versatile uh when he first came to uh I first knew him he was

[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:53.780]
working the overnight show at the former y100 and and then uh then uh he we hired him to do weekends

[00:53:53.780 --> 00:54:01.500]
at um the former hot 105 you've been at a lot of four places boy have I we got road burn on this

[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:06.580]

[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:22.940]
hey one that's uh herman there uh hey what happened uh when he left she for uh there why did

[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:30.380]
he come off the air for while oh big lawsuit lawyers are big lawsuit lawyers uh how you'll

[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:39.460]
commotion dancing like rash money money pain in the neck yeah why because they liked

[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:44.940]
that a lot of great publicity oh that was a lot of commotion I don't know if I

[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:49.060]
I don't know if I'd like to go back for a while I'm not sure you know we make our

[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.060]
living on the radio working in the morning and this is this idea putting suits on

[00:54:52.060 --> 00:55:00.360]
and ties these guys who were ties here and they also don't understand we're in

[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:06.220]
a good court you try to play this Perry Mason bit you try to answer all the

[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.940]
questions truthfully people trying to intimidate you but you have a lifetime of

[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:14.920]
lying sir because of being on the radio you see and you know today they

[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.900]
even have to wear suspenders so you know oh and they practice the phrase I do

[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:27.260]
not recall it was just a big hassle because how do I describe this succinctly

[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:35.620]
and and without too much venom and without using the delay something like

[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:38.380]
something like they didn't want us to go but they wanted us to go and then when

[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.620]
we went they didn't want us to go but they wanted us to go even more and we'll

[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:46.100]
see in court that's pretty much how it wound up you know this delay appeals to

[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:49.840]
Tyrone have you noticed it like this idea now that means that you I hope it's

[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.080]
well hidden the process will be gone to park you get

[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:59.140]
the land and Harry talk a lot and tell a deal all right we're gonna continue with

[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.400]
Mark Mosley skip herman and Bill Tanner here on the Neil Roger show right

[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:03.280]
after this

[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:12.820]
was the night before Christmas five Tyrone was the night before Christmas and all

[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:18.020]
through the house not a creature was throwing except for me Tyrone I was in the

[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:22.660]
house the people did not know I was in the house because I was being quiet as a

[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:27.800]
mouse the stockings was hung by the chimney with care to what none of them so I

[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:32.500]
left them down the people was nestled all snug and they beds looking for them

[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.340]
otherwise I might have had to break their head when out on the lawn there were

[00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:40.180]
roads such a clatter it scared me so much almost dropped the silver serving

[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:45.900]
clatter I ran to the window and what did I see a man in the red suit staring at me

[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:50.260]
I did not know that it was jolly Saint Nick so I grabbed from my knife really damn

[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.220]
quick then as I heard him coming down the chimney I knew that it had to be either

[00:56:55.220 --> 00:57:00.740]
him or me a bundle of goodies he had on his back with at least 20th upon shop run by

[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:05.320]
my friend Jack he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he

[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.780]
laughed like a bowl full of preserved he was chubby and plump a big man standing

[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:13.860]
there he was so big almost in the heaven of robbers I tied him to the chair I

[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:18.280]
could tell he was mad his cheeks began to glow his eyes burned like flames as I

[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.940]
grabbed his terry old I finished my work quite as a mouse then turned to my

[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.260]
told him man you picked the wrong house I opened the window and then not to be

[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:32.300]
rude I way goodbye to the old dude and I heard him explain as I drove through

[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.400]

they pay you know we got the million dollar music guarantee you give us a million

[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:39.080]
dollars and we'll put you in yes yes no I think they most mostly run heads on

[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.880]
radio stations that have people with a lot of uninsured drivers oh I see our

[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.420]
entire audience is totally covered but Jimmy Michael does work at power 96

[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.960]
yeah yes he does so you're very close they're actually dumbed yum dumb yeah

[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.260]
they know but no the reason why I was asking was because I there used to be very

[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:02.440]
funny yes very funny used to be yeah there used to be and I noticed a difference

[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:09.740]
of them now they've gotten kind of uh dumb you know oh no no no no jeez

[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:15.500]
and uh maybe they just uh you know hitting the bottom of the material doing

[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.420]
them for years yeah he's still the one doing it maybe you know you can't get

[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.900]
everything you know a perfect that's right they can't all be gems yeah well

[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:29.160]
anyway yeah yeah they did used to be hysterical that's true I'm

[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:34.860]
cleaned up that act too maybe we are taking phone calls for Mark

[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:40.080]

[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.940]
Coral Springs yeah oh gladden I hope you're going on vacation next week you're

going to be in a lot of trouble uh oh for what oh for this show you put out

[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:57.460]
why he was going to rip it for at least the most why why why yeah because I

[01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:01.020]
think if they divide up Neil Sauer you could have paid all these guys to show up

[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:08.120]
on your show every day for the rest of your life that's true are we splitting

[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.420]
Neil Sauer you were really expecting us to take a fan to that statement oh no

[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:19.740]
all right now I want you to take a fan I haven't got any insurance they're not

[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:27.140]
only would I take your fan but I would take your dog and he was dancing yeah

[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:34.200]
yeah yeah this is a great show oh good thank I mean I you know I'm listening

[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.140]
you do a lot of your own shows when when Neil's gone but this has got to be at

[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:42.580]
the top of the list good I'm glad you enjoyed it and I like I said when Neil gets

[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:46.580]
back you're in trouble you're in trouble you know this shows a lot like what it's

[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:50.020]
like in a hotel room when somebody that we all know flies down from up north and

[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.420]
you just hang around in party and just BS all right that's right it's just a radio

[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.900]
okay we play that cuz that's one of morsley classics

[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.880]
take account

[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:24.980]
and

[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:24.980]

[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.120]
and

[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.900]
wrote you a letter to

[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.460]
while you guys wound up with the somehow through the

[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:34.760]
and

[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.380]
and

[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.720]
broke

[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.360]
and

[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.140]
nice letter and it said thank you for sending it to me she says I listened to it one night

[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.580]
after the eleven o'clock news on the way home.

[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.500]
I almost drove off the road.

[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.520]
I almost drove off.

[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.840]
Do you imagine?

[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:54.800]
No.

[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:55.540]
I'm mostly.

[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.700]
Kills and mishaps.

[01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.380]
Of the potato.

[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.360]
So and she very complimentary letter.

[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.560]
She said whoever did the impression was very good and everything and she even signed

[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.700]
it and bowed bishop.

[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:09.220]
Yes, she did.

[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:09.780]

[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.040]
She's a very nice person.

[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:12.780]
She really is.

[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.840]
And she is and she's the dean.

[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:15.760]
I'll tell you a little bit.

[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.420]
Up sounds like a very good story on an ambitious but you know you sit there and you

[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:22.520]
watch the various television anchors and some of them do a superb job at reading the

[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:23.340]
teleprompter.

[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.740]
But I saw an bishop doing a story doing one of these a challenge and prime time new

[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:32.620]
specials that they did on the eastern strike and you talk about a lady who was totally

[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:33.160]
prepared.

[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.780]
She had a difficult situation in that she had studio guests with her that she had to

[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.120]
interview.

[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.880]
She had people on the television monitor at a remote location she had to interview and

[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.580]
she kept her distance from all of it and asked exactly the right questions and you could

[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:51.240]
tell they weren't all scripted and prepared because the people in those situations would

[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.920]
throw her into ad lib situations.

[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:58.880]
But she had her facts so totally together and she was so quick that she just jumped up

[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.840]
in my estimation all kinds of points right there.

[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.440]
She is a real credit to the television industry.

[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.100]
And Bill I honestly believe and I'm serious when I say that that it is not just a

[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.600]
good night without an end to white.

[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:11.040]
Yeah.

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.740]
And the rest of the channel to I witness he was here.

[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.400]
And what is here?

[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.460]
What does Don know by the way?

[01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.320]
Not very much.

[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.540]
Bill look at the phones.

[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.060]
They are blazing.

[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.900]
The blazing phones are the one-of-hour.

[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.420]
The phone is for Ann Bishop from Channel 10 I witness he would like to take a call.

[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:33.480]
Let's take a call.

[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.540]
Let's go to Pompano.

[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:34.880]
Hello.

[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.000]
Hi.

[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.560]
I'm the first time caller.

[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.160]
Oh my.

[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:44.040]
I listen all the time but if I had to listen to a show like this every day I would not mind

[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.400]
being at work because my day has flown by.

[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.740]
Oh that's really nice.

[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.100]
It's all I have been great.

[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.380]
Very entertaining.

[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:51.560]
Great.

[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:52.060]
Thanks.

[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280]
Thank you and we'll see you tonight.

[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:53.780]
Hi.

[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.520]
Five six months.

[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.620]
I can't wait to watch.

[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.920]
Don does not know.

[01:08:59.180 --> 01:08:59.940]
I don't know.

[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:00.780]
Thanks for calling.

[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.480]
Thank you.

[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:01.900]
Bye bye.

[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:02.680]
Okay.

[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.380]
Let's go to Miami.

[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:03.780]
Hello.

[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:04.720]
I don't go in.

[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.020]
Hi.

[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:05.020]

[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:05.300]
Good.

[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.360]
I'm going to ask you a question and let the other people in the studio maybe get ideas.

[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:15.720]
Since you seem to be such good personal friends with these guys, what about a professional

[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.340]
friendship?

[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.400]
I mean more than you ever think about leaving Neil and going with these guys somewhere?

[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:20.760]
No.

[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.000]
You wouldn't do it?

[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:22.780]
No.

[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.140]
Just why?

[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.600]
You wouldn't want to risk your friendship as friends?

[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:27.500]
No.

[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.680]
It's because you know what has like been around us everything.

[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.320]
You're a bad breath in the morning.

[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.920]
Besides he doesn't have to get up early on that and I got to tell you you know being Neil

[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.240]
Rogers sidekick ain't cheesy.

[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:40.680]
No.

[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.500]
No, I'm very happy with what I'm doing.

[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.600]
I very much enjoy working with Neil.

[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:53.020]
He's like the truly seriously like the smartest man I've ever met in this business.

[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:58.020]
I'm very happy and I'm very thankful, very grateful for my position here.

[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:01.240]
And Neil is presently able to keep his visa card paid off.

[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.300]
Yeah, because I got the pleasure of working with you and Neil.

[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.400]
I was an intern at your old old old station a few years ago.

[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.980]
I was a great working with you guys.

[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.300]
I'm going to have a great time and Neil was you know Neil's the hell of a nice guy.

[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.080]
Yes he is.

[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.820]
And so whatever people think about him it's probably not true.

[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:21.520]
Yeah.

[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.400]
And you know you yourself were pretty damn nice to us.

[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:24.980]
I can't complain.

[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:25.460]
Good.

[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.320]
All right so you know great talking to you.

[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:27.680]
Thanks.

[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.160]
All right, the like.

[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.580]
That is funny Bill because Neil is a pit bull often on the air you know.

[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.480]
Yes, I know.

[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.780]
A mad man.

[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.160]
I know.

[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:40.140]
And off the air he said normal and he's great and it's hard to be able to believe that.

[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.520]
But everybody says that because it is absolutely the truth.

[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:43.760]
Yeah.

[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.660]
But it's hard to believe if you listen to this show.

[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:53.000]
If you know enough radio personalities anybody in the business would say yeah that's probably right.

[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.700]
A lot of people are completely different on and off the air.

[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.600]
It's not McBean.

[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:57.020]
I'm happy.

[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.200]
McBean is the same on the air as he is on the air.

[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.280]
Well you know Skip there's exceptions to every rule.

[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:04.920]
He's falling down drunk out in the hole.

[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.920]
We're never going to forgive him for bringing in that smoking popcorn.

[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:11.680]
That's what he's going to offer.

[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.980]
Some people bring a smoking gun.

[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:13.860]
McBean brings a smoking popcorn.

[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.540]
I never smelled anything like that in my life.

[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.020]
You were looking for that on the watergate.

[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.280]
You were smoking popcorn.

[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.280]
Here's a call from Miami now.

[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.320]
Hey Glenn.

[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:23.760]
Hi.

[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.860]
I hate to burst your bubble but I'm going to need to get a show.

[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.220]
Get a life.

[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.740]
Get a show Glenn.

[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.340]
Come on this is getting pre-boring.

[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.220]
What are you going to play tomorrow all the bits?

[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:36.020]
No.

[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:42.140]
I know you're going to be here though from the first second until the closing.

[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.860]
I'm going to play some more tapes Glenn.

[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.260]
Don't get this real bad.

[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.840]
Not only do you have the freedom to talk for as long as you want until the commercial comes up.

[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.120]
You don't have to worry about playing tune.

[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.780]
You're all the original listeners.

[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.740]
You have constructed criticism.

[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.280]
That's right.

[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.320]
You're all the radio audience.

[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.480]
So here's Mr. Constructive.

[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.780]
Are you sure that was constructive?

[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:01.980]
Destructive.

[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.480]
You sounded like somebody looking for problems.

[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.620]
I used to work for this guy.

[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:06.700]
Yeah, I think you do.

[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:09.660]
Was that Bob or you shot?

[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:10.920]
Was that Bob or you shot?

[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.180]
Yeah.

[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.260]
You're my mind worked exactly the same.

[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.060]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:16.980]
With different people.

[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.640]
Let's not make it too inside.

[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:19.920]
Oakland Park.

[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.240]
I don't worry about that guy.

[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.980]
Look, you're all swell guys.

[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:23.780]
You're all right.

[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.520]
Four hours.

[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.680]
We give one a crank.

[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.780]
It's for four SOBs, but we're here doing this.

[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.120]
So you're going to live with it for another 40 minutes or whatever.

[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.680]
I hope you all get big packages for Christmas.

[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.160]
15 minutes.

[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:35.480]
Why good?

[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.160]
I'm talking about the end of the truth.

[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.980]
And that guy didn't turn his radio off yet?

[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:39.940]
He'll be there.

[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.600]
15 minutes more to make it work.

[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:42.580]
It's so loud.

[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.620]
You have no idea.

[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.260]
He's going to be so upset when it's over.

[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.800]
And by the way, you did not burst my bubble, sir.

[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.340]
Now, yes, sir.

[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:49.900]
Yes.

[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.020]
Hi, all you guys.

[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:51.540]
You want today?

[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:52.220]
Good.

[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:52.800]
How are you?

[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:53.580]
Good, not too bad.

[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.540]
What do you think about the commercial?

[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.340]
Don't you buy no ugly trick?

[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.220]
I think it's ridiculous.

[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.900]
But the most commercials are, and people go out and buy the ugly drugs, and the nice ones do,

[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.360]
and the people buy some more commercials, and here we are.

[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.420]
I've all done them.

[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.440]
I don't know that spot.

[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.240]
Don't you buy no ugly trick?

[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.120]
Is that a radio spot?

[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.300]
I think Cox does that.

[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.460]
When you don't know that spot.

[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.000]
I honestly don't know that spot.

[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:17.900]
I've actually done take-offs with that spot.

[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.140]
You know when a spot, you know when it's good.

[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.860]
It's going to do take-offs of it.

[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:27.880]
What it is is everybody searches for memorable lines for commercials, and whether you like that one or not, it's like you know.

[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.060]
It's back in your head, sir.

[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.120]
You have to play the old commercial game.

[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:35.640]
You've got a spot that you enjoy, and then you do the punchline, and then you say, OK, well, who's the client?

[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.080]
OK, you know, I'm going to drive well some car, but which one?

[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:41.840]
Then you start to have to water if it's effective or not.

[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.180]
Somebody should put up one ugly cars.

[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.140]
Well, Marvin put it on the screen.

[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.780]
He knew the client's name.

[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.640]
He wrote it on the screen.

[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.660]
Yeah, see? He knew it.

[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.200]
It works.

[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:54.480]
Never say no.

[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.600]
You didn't do the marketing.

[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.100]
You don't want to check to the mail.

[01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.680]
So that's the reason it works.

[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:00.940]
People will remember.

[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:02.160]
It's true.

[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.180]
It's weird, but it's true.

[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:04.960]
OK, I'll get it.

[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:05.420]
OK.

[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.280]
All right.

[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.260]
Fort Lauderdale next.

[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:09.620]
Hello.

[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:10.360]
Glenn!

[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:10.900]
Yeah.

[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.440]
It says Croc.

[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.040]
It's Croc and I'll dummy.

[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.260]
That's right.

[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.060]
It's got it right.

[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.600]
That time I don't believe it.

[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.520]
You guys aren't getting paid for this, are you?

[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.140]
Oh, yes, we are.

[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:27.120]
Actually, they don't know we're getting paid for it.

[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.340]
They're paying us off in hubcap.

[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.380]
We believe.

[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.320]
They don't even notice.

[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.420]
But when we leave, and they go out to their cars,

[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.540]
later on this afternoon, after putting it at 9 to 5, you know,

[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.200]
then they do here.

[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.520]
By the way, Tyrone, who is Edmund Anson?

[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.240]
Ed Anson?

[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:42.700]
Yeah.

[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.080]
You parked in his spot.

[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.300]
All right.

[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.600]
Oh, what I guess the joke's on me.

[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.060]
Pick up my car down at the compound underneath I-95.

[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.280]
I actually see him sometimes when I'm in the parking lot.

[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.240]
If you don't know Ed Anson, owns Channel 7.

[01:14:59.400 --> 01:14:59.580]
Yeah.

[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:00.900]
I see him.

[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:01.760]
He waves at me.

[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:02.520]
He's very nice.

[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.520]
Now you got to the end of the 1 to 2 hour, I guess,

[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.680]
with our gang today.

[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:10.380]
Yeah.

[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.900]
It's been okay with that crime.

[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.320]
Hey, it's been a great show.

[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.260]
Really great.

[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.520]
Well, that's good to hear.

[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:18.560]
I'm afraid that you guys are going to bump Neil out of a jar.

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:19.840]
Don't worry.

[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.620]
I don't think all of you know.

[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.740]
Yeah, it would.

[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:22.960]
That's for sure.

[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.080]
Well, chronic crocs, find it all.

[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.020]
Okay, crocs.

[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.160]
Good, I really, Australian.

[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:28.120]
Been a croc, yeah.

[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:28.840]
Is he really?

[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:29.760]
Yeah.

[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:30.840]
You're a mate.

[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:31.980]
20 years.

[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:32.520]
Been a black.

[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.740]
20 years from now.

[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.660]
Basketball grade Jerry West is going to look just like Ed.

[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.700]
Hanson looks today.

[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.400]
Really?

[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:41.660]
Yeah.

[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.560]
There are pictures.

[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.440]
This is a little inside look here.

[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:49.140]
I know it's about as exciting as the drummer of the Rolling Stones being David Brinkley in

[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:49.360]
the end.

[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.360]
That would be dumb started with the third leg of Metro-Ao.

[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:53.680]
You know.

[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.520]
Oh, show it in Trinkley.

[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.900]
The world's oldest living endeavor.

[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.700]
So show it at the orange bone last week?

[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.260]
No, I didn't.

[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:00.400]
I'm sure there was David Brinkley on the phone.

[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:00.700]
No.

[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:01.340]
Really?

[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.580]
Have people been wondering how Bill Wymne can be 53 years old and married a 19-year-old woman?

[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.320]
It's because he hasn't moved since the first year.

[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.040]
It's got a lot of energy left.

[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.000]
Brinkley.

[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:10.920]
Andrum.

[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:12.860]
There you go.

[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.180]
I can't get no.

[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.300]
Santa Fe.

[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:16.060]
Yeah.

[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.240]
Figured me.

[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.540]
I got off of my club.

[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:28.200]
Okay.

[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.080]
That's Mark Mosley, Skip Hermons here, Bill Tanna.

[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.580]
We have our last break of the show.

[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.700]
Our last break.

[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.340]
And then we're going to finish it off here.

[01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:36.560]
That's right.

[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.240]
I'll be back to sing Brown Sugar.

[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.800]
How come you face so good?

[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:43.880]
We'll be right back.

[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.760]
We'll be right back.

[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.720]
A news talk radio 610-W-I-O-D.

[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.140]
If you missed the last show, you missed this.

[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.820]
Mill Drudd.

[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:53.100]
Yes.

[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.720]
And I'm a Canadian.

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.780]
And I'm an elderly person.

[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.700]
And I'm ashamed of you because my son's name is Stan.

[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:03.700]
And I'm a lot of...

[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:04.280]
Wait a minute.

[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.260]
You're ashamed of me because I speak out, right?

[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.480]
I say something.

[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.920]
I say something that nobody else is...

[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.600]
Just one moment, mister.

[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:13.140]
Hey.

[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.480]
You give me a time.

[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:15.240]
Yeah.

[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:15.700]
Why?

[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.180]
Why should I give you any time?

[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.040]
You're just going to compound the problems the elderly.

[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:21.720]
Okay.

[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.460]
Here, the next Stan major show.

[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:29.080]
This afternoon at two on News Talk Radio 610-W-I-O-D.

[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:30.840]
Now this, I didn't...

[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.300]
What is that?

[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.420]
Oh, okay.

[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.760]
I didn't think I would can live to hear this.

[01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:40.640]
But during the commercial break, Mark Mosley is sitting over here discussing Phoebe Cates.

[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.500]
Well, I know of your obsession.

[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.320]
I was an incredible discussion.

[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.420]
This man has researched this...

[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.300]
This man knows what he's talking about.

[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:55.320]
He's researched Phoebe Cates frame by frame by frame by frame by frame.

[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:55.760]
No, I just...

[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.580]
What you're trying to say is he's looked up Phoebe Cates.

[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:57.760]
Yeah.

[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:58.700]
Your wife listening?

[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:00.240]
That's hope not.

[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.780]
A caller asked what or who made these guys get into radio.

[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.180]
Why did you get into the business, Bill?

[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:08.360]
Hmm.

[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:11.120]
I always have some dumb line.

[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.800]
You know, somebody I was reading the other day said,

[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.400]
it's the women.

[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.260]
I got in the room.

[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.240]
The women were actually...

[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.720]
When I was a kid, I lived in Mississippi,

[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.660]
and my grandmother was rather poor,

[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.240]
and she took in rumors...

[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.340]
What was called a boarding house.

[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.640]
And he's not one of the rumors.

[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:30.940]
It was a disc jockey.

[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.660]
And he used to let me go to the radio station with him

[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.040]
and occasionally watch.

[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.420]
Well, he did his thing.

[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:38.160]
You were like eight.

[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.100]
I was probably younger than that.

[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.300]
I was about six or seven, I guess.

[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.880]
And so then I have my first job.

[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.580]
I actually applied for and got a job in a radio station.

[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.040]
I was 13 years old.

[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.740]
In other words, you said like me.

[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.840]
I was always fascinated by not only the...

[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.720]
I was like, what came across the radio in terms of the program,

[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:00.560]
but the way the radio sounded, the technical sound of it,

[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.440]
and all that sort of thing.

[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.340]
And so I've been interested in it all along.

[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.820]
And because I was basically impossible to deal with,

[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.900]
I figured out that I had to be the program director

[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.220]
and figure it out for myself.

[01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:13.360]
So I've always been on the air.

[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.640]
The Tanner in the morning person,

[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.140]
but I guess really what I think of myself more personally

[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:19.240]
is the program director.

[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.680]
How many years have you been Tanner in the morning

[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.520]
in this market since 1974?

[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.500]
There's an interesting story about that.

[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.200]
Cox and I were talking about it just yesterday.

[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.180]
When I first came to Y100, it was a disaster.

[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.200]
It was three months after I had gone on the air.

[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.860]
They came on the air giving away all this money,

[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.920]
and they'd blown the whole thing, and everyone got fired.

[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:38.320]
That really happened.

[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:42.620]
That's how they started in August 3rd of 1973.

[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.000]
I came here on the 3rd of 4th of 1973.

[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.060]
And between August, 1st of August, 73,

[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.820]
and the end of December, middle of December,

[01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:53.000]
when I finally got hired,

[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.480]
these people took put the station on the air,

[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.640]
had gone through mountains of money,

[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.920]
and given away every bit of money the station was dead broke.

[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:03.480]
And when I came to work here,

[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.980]
it was such a disaster that they brought me in

[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:07.720]
to be the program director,

[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.680]
and I wasn't, didn't get to be the program director.

[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:11.820]
It was always political infighting that was going on

[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.200]
at the beginning of the station in 1974.

[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.800]
And I had been both a morning man,

[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.840]
the morning guy on the radio,

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.040]
and the program director for,

[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:18.900]
for quite a while,

[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.680]
we were going to tell that story of how I got fired

[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.240]
and Mississippi and everybody walked on the disc jockey's walked out.

[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:26.540]
And eventually we all wound up here at what was then

[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.700]
Y-100 and worked at Y-100 for nine years,

[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.780]
Kramer for 10 years.

[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.340]
And, but Cox, that's where Cox and Kramer and Robert Walker,

[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.640]
who has not been mentioned in this day's show,

[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.540]
but we couldn't let it go by with that Robert Yovian.

[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.840]
He's one of the absolute great Miami radio men,

[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.400]
and he's been the program director of Y-100,

[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.420]
not once but twice.

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.460]
See between 1974 and 1980,

[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.080]
and then the year 2006,

[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.380]
only two people were program director of Y-100,

[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:55.100]
either me or Rob.

[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:59.140]
And so we all wound up here,

[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.160]
and it was somehow rather the station got straightened out,

[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:05.080]
and the morning man that was at Y-100

[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.660]
got offered to go to the legendary radio station, K-HJ,

[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.820]
in Los Angeles, and he left and went,

[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.660]
and they put me on in the morning,

[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.220]
and I was calling myself Bill Tanner at the time,

[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.280]
but for some reason I just said,

[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.640]
this Bill Tanner in the morning,

[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.060]
and then manager got in Bill Cunningham,

[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:20.620]
came in and said,

[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.500]
Tanner in the morning, that's it, Tanner in the morning,

[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.440]
and I thought it was stupid.

[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.460]
So of course it worked, it's radio.

[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:29.000]
How about you, Scott?

[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.820]
You know, radio is really magical for us.

[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.860]
It was before we were involved in it.

[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.700]
The same as it is for your listeners,

[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.140]
the guys who like to call in every day.

[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.000]
There's something special about the unknown.

[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:41.080]
You're unaware of exactly how it's all put together,

[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.100]
and I think the same holds true for television,

[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.640]
because there's so much that you don't see.

[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:45.020]
That's true.

[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.720]
And there's a fascination there,

[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.640]
and when you find out a little bit about it,

[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.460]
then you learn different aspects of the business

[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.060]
that you become either enamored of or not.

[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.060]
The music for me is one of the big lures that it had early on.

[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.240]
I can recall sitting there doing homework

[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.180]
in my bedroom, going to high school,

[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.600]
thinking, gee, I'd rather be this guy on the radio,

[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.300]
playing this music,

[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.940]
that's sitting here with these Tyrone Roadmaths.

[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.740]
Because they made about as much sense.

[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.520]
You know, gee, the radio.

[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:14.580]
What's that we need?

[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.660]
Now I remember going to visit WABC watching

[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:17.280]
Cousin Brucey's show.

[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.240]
Oh, yeah, I did that too.

[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:21.120]
You know, and I'll never forget Cousin Brucey's saying,

[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.100]
I don't listen to this music.

[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.660]
I go home and listen to classical music.

[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:23.980]
Whoa.

[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:24.480]
And I win.

[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:25.100]
You did.

[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:28.060]
We gotta go, guys.

[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:28.840]
We're out of time.

[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:29.640]
Thanks for having us.

[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:29.980]
It was fun.

[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.480]
I'm real glad everybody can we drink Don Cox.

[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:33.480]
Sure will.

[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.480]
So glad you stopped by.

[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.480]
We really appreciate it.

[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:38.060]
And of course, Mark, it's always a classic.

[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.180]
This is the man who made Ambo.

[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:42.760]
Herman and McBean.

[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.100]
Glad you guys finally came over.

[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:46.060]
Thanks for entering into this studio.

[01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.000]
Bill, good to see you.

[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:47.800]
You too, Skip.

[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:48.800]
Come see us in the...

[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.400]
Mark, take it.

[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.800]
We'll be listening to you in Neil.

[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:51.240]
Great.

[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.620]
All right, we'll be back tomorrow.

[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.100]
Tom Jekka will be our guest tomorrow.

[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:55.340]
That'll be great.

[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.000]
You're bringing food?

[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:57.980]
We'll be, Tom.

[01:22:58.700 --> 01:22:59.840]
He's always an excellent guest.

[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.000]
I just now, Neil Rogers only guests.

[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:02.340]
Yep.

[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.360]
And he loves to come by and visit when Neil's not here.

[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.540]
Marvin, make sure he brings food.

[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:07.540]
That's it.

[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:07.920]
Food.

[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:08.960]
So we'll see you tomorrow at the time.

[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.820]
Bye.
