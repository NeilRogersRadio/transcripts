the bottom of the cage and I wouldn't even line them with the mindy arrow well really that's

[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.020]
pretty strong language you seem very emotional about this is there something that's pressing

that the quality of the singing is right it's so close now do you think it would have made

[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.160]
a janie merrick is j black I think that the vocals on it are so close j black do you think it

[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.100]
would have made it it would have come out any different it's like the people could have sung

[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.960]
you know if they could sing no you know no would have made any difference I didn't think so

oh oh

[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.560]
it was in the area i think

[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.460]
there's nobody in the audience who remembers this

[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.260]
now but i like it because that was a big fat domino

[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.680]
i want to tell like that

[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.100]
boy

[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.500]
in fact i remember i was sick one time i had a cold and i was home from school

[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.520]
and um i'm walking by fat stomino came out on imperial

[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.560]
records and i knew it was coming in a record store that day on a Wednesday

[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.560]
because the Miller record store in canondagin

[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.760]
New York the new records used to come in every Wednesday

[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.820]
and i made my mother go down to the record store and buy it

[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.340]
hmm so i'd be like the first kid in canondag would have

[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.760]
i'm walking by fat stomino i don't know why that was important

[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.420]
but i wanted it interesting and i had one of those little 45 rpm

[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.600]
with just the spindle you know there's a little um

[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.800]
to the stack them on and then every third record would stick you know

[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.040]
and it wouldn't drop down and it was great yeah very simple you know there's

[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.120]
no like multi thousand dollar stereo systems back then i was just a

[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.040]
a little record player that's all you need it right um

[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.980]
once in a while you'd get an ep an extended play and it would have four cuts

[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.620]
on it to one each side and you'd be in heaven yeah great what did you think just

[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.400]
talking about that period of when pat boon used to record i like pat boon i hate

[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.600]
to admit that fat i'm embarrassed that he would record like fat says cover fat

[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.500]
yeah record and i didn't like that yeah and also a little richer he did

[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.760]
duty fruity which for pat boon i thought was very appropriate

[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.780]
and the difference which is incredible i love pat boon i didn't like pat boon i

[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.440]
loved it that way oh i was obsessed

[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.620]
it's twelve forty two well it's one of those things i must confess i mean he

[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.580]

[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.220]

[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.160]
The bat line.

[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.440]
It's a good time for the great pace.

[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.640]
Her noodles junior.

[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.420]
From inside to building the idea.

[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.920]
No, why everybody's got the bat line?

[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.440]
Why do you assume they're coming from the inside?

[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:28.160]
I don't.

[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.720]
Everybody's got that's asking.

[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.180]
Sure.

[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:30.740]
I don't know.

[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.600]
Dave County, hello.

[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.020]
Mommy, she's not dead.

[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:33.760]
Kill her again.

[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.800]
Dave County.

[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:38.060]
He said, hello.

[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.480]
Terry was Mary, man.

[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.660]

[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:41.140]
Yeah.

[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:41.680]
Wow.

[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:42.720]
Palm Beach.

[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.480]
Broward, Mary, can you watch it back to the office?

[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.240]
Boka.

[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.640]
I'm a Neil Finn and a butt plug man.

[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:50.680]
Can I do it?

[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.420]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.160]
Broward, hello.

[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.860]
A little better contender.

[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.380]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.260]

[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.380]
Dave County, hello.

[00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:03.000]
I was there with you as an asshole.

[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:03.380]
I'm a door.

[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.740]
I was there.

[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.000]
I did.

[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:05.620]
I was there.

[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:05.900]

[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:05.980]

[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:06.280]
I was there.

[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:07.020]
I was there.

[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.040]
I was there.

[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.520]
I'm going to get my finger in the thing there.

[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.020]
Dave County, hello.

[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.620]
I don't need a damn history, right?

[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:13.460]
I need a damn history.

[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.060]
I need a damn history.

[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.660]
Palm Beach.

[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.100]
No, Broward, standing, just police.

[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:19.860]
Boka.

[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.260]
Hey, Vanna, what's up with the name of the day?

[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.080]
Broward.

[00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.160]
You're still struggling.

[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:25.980]
You're struggling.

[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.200]
Broward County, hello.

[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.760]

Dave County, hello.

[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.440]
There's a guy with no arms, no legs on your front porch.

[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:34.980]
I think it's me.

[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:37.040]
Broward, hello.

[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.160]
This is Rudy Blot.

[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.260]
How are you, Neil?

[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.720]
Dr. Blot, you're here.

[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:44.000]
Palm Beach.

[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:44.860]
Broward, we're here.

[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.860]
It's time to get hold of you.

[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.420]
The bat line.

[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.820]

[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.880]
Boy, get a lot of practice on a junior.

[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.820]
He's just not warm up for the Steve King.

[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.400]
Yeah, he worked.

[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.340]

Hey, Doug out.

[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.180]

[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.340]
Palm Beach.

[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.200]
You're all they place too much with his cow.

Broward County, hello.

[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.400]
What's he to take care of?

[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.720]
That's a proposal right away.

[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.960]

That's a bad line.

[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:45.280]
Hello.

[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:46.800]
It's a shock radio.

[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:48.980]
Boka.

[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.340]

Well, let's see.

[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:23.700]
I'm putting all my carts away here real quick, because I'm going to make a B line, a B high.

[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.480]
A B something for the door.

[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.920]
And then the meantime, stick around.

[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.980]
