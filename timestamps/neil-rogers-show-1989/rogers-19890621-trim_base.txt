[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.220]
1.35 at WIOD. We've had some real brain surgeons here today. Those of you who are really listening

[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.600]
because you want to learn something, you've learned it today.

[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.020]
Boka! Yeah, Neil. Listen, I looked at it in the morning. Thought he sounds very sexy.

[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.040]
What does she look like?

[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880]
136 at WIOD. Let's go to Miami. Hello.

[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.900]
Neil. Yeah. How you doing, Neil?

[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.980]
Okay. Just calling in the... How you doing?

[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.460]
I'm doing okay. Well, that's good. I'm doing especially good if you're looking at the...

[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.060]
I'm not going to... I'm not going to dwell on the fourth, too long bird. I just want to make a...

[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.540]
Too much spore, it's pal. Just one comment for the med fans out there before the cups get rolling again.

[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.560]
Just looking at how I want them well went over for.

[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.900]
Yeah, he's sitting about 2.30. Can I leave?

[00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.820]
No. He's in about 2.30.

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.340]
Just two more quick stats for it.

[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.500]
I wonder who you'd rather have leading off to.

[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.160]
Rome Walton or Wonsamwell?

[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.920]
Not a ball game. Maybe a bank with a first answer, something on it.

[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.480]
So Wonsamwell is going to speed.

[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160]
So thanks for going to three for five and Roger McDowell says again.

[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.880]
So I think the med organization ought to be listening and maybe they can learn something new.

[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.700]
Yeah, well they got David Con pitch in the night so...

[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.140]
Montreal shouldn't score more than 12 or 13 runs.

[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760]
Well they're the team that's being the first inning. They're the team that beat.

[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.500]
You're right.

[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.320]
All right, so still guys.

[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.400]
Okay, too much sports.

[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.080]
Sorry.

[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.420]
137 at WID. At least he's sorry, okay. He didn't mean it, but he's sorry.

[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.700]
What do we got? Everybody for lightning round? I guess that means we got to play something, right?

[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.080]
What could we play that would take up some good time while we can sit back and relax and you're ready to go home?

[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.900]
Oh, here's a good thing for the guy with the penis problem he called you for.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.460]
Well, there's sure a lot of stuff that we haven't played in a long time.

[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.500]
That I used to hear that on I&Z years ago used to play that all the time.

[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.620]
I&Z?

[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.880]
Members say and see?

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.580]
Who played it?

[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.080]
You did.

[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.540]
Kick an ass when you were kicking ass over there midday?

[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.100]
Yeah.

[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.660]
Yeah, I've forgotten that, haven't I?

[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.860]
Yeah.

[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.100]
No, the only thing I haven't forgotten is all the great colors we used to have over there.

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.400]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.460]
Never had an hour like we've had.

[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.780]
No.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.880]
We had some real, you know, some people who were with it.

[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.860]
We just weren't fixated.

[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.260]
It seems like this station has got a bunch of guys who are like fixated on like between their legs.

[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.100]
It seems to be about the only thing they can think about.

[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.100]
Which was the same at wins, but they were thinking about it in a positive way.

[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.000]
These people are all like wishful thinking over here, you know?

[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.720]
Yeah.

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.460]
We haven't played this in a long time.

[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.400]
The American cowboy.

[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.820]
Tough, different, smelly.

[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.060]
We settled the west with just a horse.

[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.240]
A gun and a whole bunch of beer.

[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.320]
Our beer.

[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.040]
Zeldin Schlock beer.

[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.940]
When Pat Garrett gunned down Billy the Kid, they were both filled with our beer.

[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.160]
When Kuster confidently rode into the worst ambush in US military history,

[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.580]
he just finished a case of Zeldin Schlock bongies.

[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.620]
Now you can enjoy the time-honored recipe of our founder, Papa Zeldin Schlock.

[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.760]
Yes, even though it's harder to make beer this way,

[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.620]
out of the back of a chuck wagon from ingredients we find in the cow pasture,

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.800]
we still do it because, well, we're stubborn.

[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.140]
Stubborn and backward and like Papa, just a little bit local.

[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.820]
But that's how you get them around on the prairie, all alone.

[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.180]
It's just a horse and a gun and a whole bunch of beer.

[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.340]
Our beer.

[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.060]
Zeldin Schlock beer.

[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.380]
Enjoy a great tradition of the old west.

[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.900]
Get them drunk and shooting up the place.

[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.700]
Get Zeldin Schlock beer.

[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.100]
Here's another cart that I'd forgotten that we should have been using all along,

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.040]
especially the sound.

[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.920]
Now let's do the car.

[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.920]
Boy, yeah, talk about fitting in like a wild.

[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.220]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, what are you doing?

[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.380]
Don't take, what is he doing?

[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.400]
Taking my H trying to eat, cleaning out.

[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.180]
You know, I can, you know, it's one thing to get a little carried away

[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.280]
like you notice he took my celery out of here when I wasn't finished with it yet.

[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.940]
Man is just out of control.

[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.080]
You know, I can't hear it a restaurant and the waiters are too comfortable.

[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.340]
It's like my grandmother used to do.

[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.660]
She'd go make it out of your hand.

[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.480]
You'd like you to have a bowl of soup in front of you

[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.300]
and then whatever she was making for dinner.

[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.140]
When it was done, she was coming to shock him.

[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.440]
Okay.

[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.100]
Or the prom beat.

[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.740]
That was amazing.

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.740]
Broward.

[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.280]
I'm sorry I was gonna ask you about that penis, but I'll spray it over here.

[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.880]
Broward.

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.440]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.780]
Broward.

[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.900]
Blank, your magic twanger frog.

[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.680]
It's Buster Brown.

[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.480]
There it is.

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.100]
I'll be damned.

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.100]

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.700]
Dave County, hello.

[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.240]
That really, really crossed my ass a little.

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.500]
Broward.

[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.680]
That you're in swoon.

[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.520]
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.580]
We'll see what happens tomorrow, okay.

[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.480]
We'll be cut into pieces and see what happens.

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.320]
Was it David Cone again?

[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.060]
Dave County, hello.

[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.720]
Oh.

[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.080]
Yeah.

[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.400]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.580]
Oh.

[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.120]
Oh.

[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.900]
The bell, my face.

[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.820]
I might even call in because I get the sports champs

[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.740]
on a satellite, you know, and I can realize most of the med fans won't be able to see their team lose tonight.

[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.320]
So if it gets really bad, I might even call in and interrupt the draptio on the air and give a little report.

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.240]
Thank you for doing that.

[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.900]
Well, I'll try.

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.840]
Dave County, hello.

[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.860]
You're a bad man.

[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.140]
Palm Beach.

[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.280]
It's too late, Bird.

[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.540]
You're already a dickhead.

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.320]
Broward.

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.620]
Radio personalities are ugly.

[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.320]
So tell us something we don't know, John.

[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.920]
Broward.

[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.440]
Rolls-folder E.B.A.L.A.

[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.200]
Dave, it's not only to see King Suck, East Wallows.

[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.280]
Boca.

[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.040]
Same Beth time, same Beth channel.

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.800]
Broward.

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.620]
Oh, that's a problem.

[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.300]
I'm Jada.

[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.220]
Too bad we couldn't play a little bit more of that, but we can't re-broadcast their signal.

[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.860]
Okay, sorry.

[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.520]
Broward.

[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.500]
They only got eight inches.

[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.620]
That must be the cone on top of his head that he's talking about.

[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.360]
Oh, of course.

[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.580]
The match is Sheets.

[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.220]
Dave.

[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.060]
I'm a cheater.

[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.640]
Palm Beach.

[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.380]
Get there.

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.280]
Oh, God, are they good?

[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.040]
They're great.

[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.220]
They're not just good, they're great.

[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.580]
We got more of those today than usual.

[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.080]
Dave.

[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.280]
Coxhead, please.

[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.840]
Broward.

[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.340]
Hey, these are got new rogues on the ball.

[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.420]
Broward.

[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.120]
I'm the clearest cup fan in town.

[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.640]
Broward.

[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:10.060]
I'm the clearest cup fan in town.

[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.380]
I'm the clearest cup fan in town.

[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.640]
Dave County.

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.940]
Hello.

[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.920]
For those who missed it, that was a good one.

[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.500]
Yeah, of course.

[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.660]
Volca.

[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.600]
The Volca figure is an asshole.

[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.680]
Palm Beach.

[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.560]
Yeah, with the Witts, McCluffie, at the age of American League.

[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.760]
No, but Greg Maddox for it.

[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.500]
Broward.

[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.000]
They need like one my money back.

[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.000]
Dave.

[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.460]
And the heaps number one pick is Eric Kumaron.

[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.620]
All right, little draft preview.

[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.800]
Now we're finally getting something top of the Volca.

[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.820]
Volca.

[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.240]
There's a line guy who's dated, is that a...

[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.760]
Bob Murphy, Jr., I recognize that voice anywhere.

[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.400]
Broward.

[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.860]
I can rap, be a sick.

[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:58.760]
Dave.

[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.640]
French players with douche bags.

[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.720]
Palm Beach.

[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.920]
I got a little profit.

[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.580]
I got a little profit.

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.120]
Broward.

[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.320]
The meth and the Yankees.

[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.380]
Also stuff.

[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:11.780]
Dave.

[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.040]
Palm Beach.

[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.260]
Dave County.

[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:22.520]
Thella.

[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.760]

[00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.270]
purpose they got some kind of a device it makes everybody go inside and gamble

[00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.890]
their brains out well I had to laugh the guys on a radio were saying but it's

[00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.070]

[00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:34.710]
the freek mower accident injures man you're not gonna be but I think there

[00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.130]
could be some pain involved in listening to this this from the Milwaukee Gazette

[00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:45.710]
from from the AP a man who lost part of his penis in a lawnmower accident

[00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.970]
out was in satisfactory condition after the organ was attached to his arm

[00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:56.110]
until it can be reattached the hospital spokesman said it was attached to his

[00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:04.870]
arm until it can be reattached and he said gee dad it was a warlet's sir the

[00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.430]
details of Saturday's accident are sketchy but apparently the man in his mid

[00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.730]
30s was making repairs underneath the tractor-type mower when he was injured

[00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.750]
said James King a spokesman for free dirt memorial Lutheran Hospital in

[00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:23.110]
Wawa tosa the tractor was on blocks at the time of the accident attaching the

[00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:28.070]
organ to the man's arm allows it to receive blood so the tissue will not

[00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.570]
die King said the reattached an operation could take place within a week so

[00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.710]
a lot of you old guys up there like in sunrise and tamarack this could be a

[00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:41.490]
real boon for you if we can say that just to kind of like cut it off and attach

[00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.910]
it to your arm the tissue will not die okay good and then when you get the

[00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.830]
opportunity to use it just kind of like going to the nearest bar and tie
