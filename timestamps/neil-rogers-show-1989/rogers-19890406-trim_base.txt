[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]
Now, more with Neil Rogers on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.260]
It's 1038 at WIOD.

[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.000]
I want to tell you something.

[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.860]
If they don't turn that down next door, we're going to just sit here and be silent for

[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.660]
the next three and a half months.

[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.460]
It's incredible.

[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.440]
I mean, I've heard it bad.

[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.340]
And again, my ears are, you know, how they get when they're terminally plugged up, when

[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.760]
you've got to go.

[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.740]
That's how they are now.

[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.360]
In the ultimate stages of plugged up, and it still sounds like they're just slamming

[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.980]
on the wall in there like they're doing the NBA slam dunk contest against the wall

[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.680]
in there or something.

[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.960]
Man, his nuts.

[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.800]
I swear, I feel like I'm staying at the holiday in and downtown Bay Roost.

[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.280]
I'm serious with it.

[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.580]
It sounds like explosions off in the background.

[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.680]
It's just unbelievable.

[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.780]
Now, should we take Johnny Dark is on 6th?

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.860]
Will you hold on one second now?

[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.280]
Sure.

[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.080]
He has nothing to do.

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.880]
Don't worry about him.

[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.180]
You're not going anywhere, right?

[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.300]
Nothing.

[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.720]
Hold on.

[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.080]
Because we got a mobile on here.

[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.520]
And I don't want this kind of spin-lot of money.

[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.780]
Hello.

[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.360]
Hi, Neil.

[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.040]
How you doing?

[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.600]
How you doing?

[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600]
I don't know.

[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.120]
I just tuned in for, I was teaching a cry of nervous classer, I'm 30 to 30, but it was

[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.220]
on the news last night about Gold Tosh and Mile.

[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.560]
Did you see that?

[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.360]
About what?

[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.600]
Gold Tosh and Mile what?

[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840]
The entrance to that Gold Tosh and Mile rule of condos.

[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.820]
They put up a blockade there to keep up the spring breakers.

[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.720]
And then spring breakers over and they opted to leave the barricade up.

[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.120]
Good.

[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.940]
I think what they ought to do is just build a big wall around them over there and just stay

[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.240]
in.

[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.340]
That sounds about right.

[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.900]
Mostly you got a bunch of pseudo-intellectual snobbs over there in that part of town anyway,

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.740]
so to how with them.

[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.440]
They're like a lot of people, you know, those islands off Los Olas.

[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.840]
Yeah.

[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.460]
Well, most of the people who live on those little islands are of the same genre of the same

[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.840]
kind of pseudo-intellectual elite of snobbs.

[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.200]
Do you stack?

[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.080]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.080]
Okay, I just want to let you know.

[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.360]
Okay, maybe Mayor Cox.

[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.020]
Maybe Mayor Cox can move in over there on the Gold Oceans and Mile and I have to be

[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.960]
accosted by all those people under 100.

[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.400]
I think he's already there because they shot to him after they showed the thing and he said,

[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.980]
oh, this is a good thing for the city and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.060]
Now, I think he was just, I think he was just there getting a haircut.

[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.640]
Well, I just want you to enjoy your conversation with Chai Dark.

[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.620]
I'm getting the honor of this dish bag down this weekend.

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.680]
Okay, good luck to you, pal.

[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.020]
Bye.

[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.840]
Okay, now you don't mind holding one more minute, do you?

[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.160]
No.

[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.400]
Are you losing your voice?

[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.860]
No.

[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.660]
Boy.

[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.460]
Hold on now.

[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.920]
All right.

[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.960]
I'm telling you, I can't, I've got this is all I got, huh?

[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.820]
You should be home in bed.

[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.880]
No, I don't feel bad.

[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.740]
That's why I'm here today because I don't really feel that bad, but I just can't tell.

[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.700]
I've got the care for your voice.

[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.440]
What's that?

[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.720]
Huh?

[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.280]
What?

[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.080]
Go get another call.

[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.820]
Hold on then.

[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.960]
You're not going away, are you?

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.120]
No.

[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.500]
All right.

[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.360]
No, he usually hangs up on us.

[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.200]
Here's old Pete, my old board op on a mobile phone.

[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.440]
We had to get Pete on because he had never made a lot of money over there.

[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.900]
No, I still don't make a lot of money.

[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.540]
How are you doing?

[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.120]
Well, listen, many isn't everything.

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.680]
Believe me.

[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.340]
You feel a better?

[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.160]
No.

[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.780]
No, I feel all right.

[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.960]
I got three things I want to tell you.

[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.600]
First of all, a couple weeks ago, I went out to a Yankee game and I got next, I sent me and my young son, sent next to Mr. Gregory.

[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.000]
Oh, another Gregory Benjamin, who does firey for a booby-dobby?

[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.220]
Oh, it's incredible.

[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.040]
I was sitting there.

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.580]
So I got up to leave and I was going to say, oh, hi, Greg.

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.100]
See you later.

[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.920]
And he didn't say nothing so I walked away and said, you are a douchebag.

[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.220]
Ah!

[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.220]
I can't fire a laughing.

[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.180]
Just if you want to say, Monday night.

[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.720]
What do you do?

[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.820]
What did he do?

[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.340]
He did do nothing.

[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.580]
I mean, he didn't even acknowledge me.

[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.080]
I mean, not that I'm someone to be acknowledged, but, you know, anyway, I was listening to that great WQAM Sports Line the other night.

[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.920]
Monday and they had Harry carry on and he, his ass was frosted, Neil.

[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.160]
Really?

[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.580]
They started talking about Moynihan Watt that talked about the P-Rose allegations and Harry was telling them, they're just allegations and want you to be positive.

[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.900]
And if you're not going to talk about being positive, then I'm not going to talk, you know more.

[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.780]
And the interview was about a minute and a half.

[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.360]
Really?

[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.100]
And he just, he read him the riot act and he hung up on him.

[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.580]
That really revolved.

[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.920]
That's my ass, a little bit.

[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.160]
It did.

[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.880]
It really did frosted as he was.

[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.240]
I wish I had it on tape because I've been tape in every game.

[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.820]
Well, I've been two games, but I don't know why it's late last night's game.

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.760]
I should have stopped it.

[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.340]
But in the seventh inning stretch where Harry does the take me out to the ballgame, he was so incoherent by that time.

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.920]
He started, oh, one, two and a crowd's get all excited and there was a long, long, long pause.

[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.820]
And he was clearing his throat and puking and choking.

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.780]
I want up to, and then he started out, take.

[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.120]
I mean, like way off, Harry was in good shape last time, believe me.

[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.480]
Well, he was, he, he, most of the time, he just stopped singing because he couldn't get it under control, you know.

[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.860]
Does he have an abut every inning?

[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.800]
I think so.

[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.600]
And last night's game, he was having a couple of extras because it was deadly, man.

[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.340]
That fourth inning was a killer.

[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.020]
Okay, one other thing you'll be do feel better, but I want to tell Matt get to work because you are a douchebag.

[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.640]
Okay, Pete.

[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.000]
Bye-bye.

[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.360]
Hi, Adios. Okay, finally, ladies and gentlemen, after waiting through all of these super sillious calls,

[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.000]
Harry comes, former star of stage screen and broadcasting.

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.620]
Johnny Dark.

[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.700]
Now, this is not the Johnny Dark from WMCA in New York.

[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.400]
I heard about that call, yeah.

[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.020]
Now, does your call have anything to do with Johnny Tago cups?

[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.700]
Johnny's doing his radio voice today, by the way, so look out.

[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.680]
That's right. Yeah. Well, so what's going on, John?

[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.760]
Talk with Floyd Glycecreme at Beth and Robin.

[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.180]
Have you tried it yet?

[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.740]
The one on.

[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.380]
I'm not eating ice cream yet.

[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.940]
I eat that low in the luscious and all that stuff.

[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.280]
Now, it'll fix your voice.

[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.600]
It'll make you see God.

[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.340]
It is the best ice cream.

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.880]
Really?

[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.780]
Ah. Okay.

[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.880]
Check it out.

[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.180]
Well, that was nice.

[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.920]
That's all of our sponsors, Johnny's doing a little plug for Beth and Robin.

[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.620]
That's good, John.

[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.300]
Yeah, the brand new one.

[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.860]
However, that will not get you any more food the next time you come in.

[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.640]
Somebody left me an empty can of Holy Calcola in my box and it's got Harry's autograph picture on a can.

[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.980]
That's exciting stuff.

[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.560]
And it looks, it doesn't look like Harry though.

[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.120]
It looks like Martin Nagransky.

[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.280]
Next to Glycecreme.

[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.620]
Look at him.

[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.480]
No, seriously, look at him.

[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.720]
Doesn't that look like Martin Nagransky?

[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.160]
Next to Glycecreme, I am the biggest sports fan in the world right now.

[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.580]
No, you could ask me anything about sports.

[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.760]
I want you to see River Phoenix's wife.

[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.320]
You got to get the new star, John.

[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.860]
Yeah.

[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.120]
When you see this picture, you're going to just, you're going to have to wear

[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.140]
a different undergarment when you look at it.

[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.660]
Boyish and not even boyish.

[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.420]
I mean, I don't understand.

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.080]
That's right.

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.520]
This looks like one of those little boys that was in standby.

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.180]
It does.

[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.160]
April 11th star.

[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.100]
You can pick up WIOD in South Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.

[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.860]
You can.

[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.460]
Yeah.

[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.260]
Did the call a few minutes ago say his friend listened to us in North Carolina?

[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.520]
I want to tell you, you know, when you've been in this business as long as Johnny Darken,

[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.980]
it's hard.

[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.220]
No, seriously, it starts affecting your mind.

[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.080]
And you start having these wild hallucinations and palpitations and you wake up in a cold sweat

[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.400]
at two in the morning, dreaming that you're driving through like Wiltsboro, Pennsylvania,

[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.720]
and listening to the micronary show.

[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.520]
No, actually, it was antique time I heard it.

[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.100]
I think it was Sunday.

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.020]
I was driving up a road.

[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.260]
Well, when I hear that show, I break out into a cold sweat right while it's on.

[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.860]
Now, could you imagine being in Newburn, North Carolina, and listening to antique time?

[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.140]
Listen, I can't imagine being in Miami and looking at the tea time.

[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.380]
But you can't pick it up around Charlotte because there's a station big waves in Charlotte on the same freedom.

[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.140]
That antique time, that's part of our power weekend on WIOD.

[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.460]
Yeah, it's power.

[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.780]
But seriously, you can pick it up on 95 all the way up to Walter Barrow, South Carolina.

[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.940]
Now, if you're traveling on Route 17 along the coast, Route 17 goes from Charleston to up to Newburn along the coastline of South Carolina.

[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.100]
Here's Johnny reading us the map of North Carolina.

[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.600]
Really? Let's go back to the ballgame, OK?

[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.900]
You can get it all along the coast.

[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.400]
Yeah.

[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.080]
You can get it all along the coast, huh?

[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.460]
Somebody will call from South Carolina and North Carolina one of these days in surprise you.

[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.980]
By the way, I bet you're looking forward to that Shirley Peters guest appearance on the Steve Cain Show today.

[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.780]
I can't wait.

[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.560]
I can't. I really, I don't know what's happened to Steve, OK?

[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.500]
I think he's going into post-menopausal depression or something.

[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.860]
I don't know what's going on with that child.

[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.560]
Anyway, when I drove, when I drove out of town, it was March 31st.

[00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.060]
And you would not believe how many blue hairs run the highway heading out of the state.

[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.000]
Oh, thank God.

[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.560]
I feel better already now.

[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.600]
Every single license plate was from out of state.

[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.840]
That's what I noticed first.

[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.560]
Well, that must be why Palm Beach County is so quiet now, like any of those calls anymore.

[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.560]
And then I looked inside the car and I couldn't believe all the old people and I started getting very nervous driving up there.

[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.660]
Well, I want to tell you, John, this has been a call that will live in the, in my memory for a very long time, OK?

[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.020]
One other thing, Neil.

[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.460]
Yes.

[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.140]
I had a slight argument with the bird man this morning.

[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:28.880]
Did you?

[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.260]
Yeah.

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.860]
Well, he's getting a little arrogant and cocky now.

[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:32.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.780]
I'll show this week and now right away he's like, he's like, Mort Downey Jr.

[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.020]
Tell him what it was about.

[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.120]
Yeah, about Joan Love It and Terry Marum.

[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.700]
That's right.

[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.520]
John Love It?

[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.160]
Is Joan Love It, right?

[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.920]
What's her name?

[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.800]
Joan Love It.

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.000]
Yeah.

[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.980]
Oh, Terry Marum was on with the current one.

[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.160]
Yeah.

[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.480]
And Johnny thinks, and nobody, or people all laughing at the same time, it was great.

[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.380]
Johnny thinks nobody in town watches Channel 7 or knows who Joan Love It or Denise White is.

[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.300]
I think I'll be wrong about that.

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.420]
I think you should take a poll and see who is more popular in a town.

[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.380]
Marum and her love it and I think Marum would win hands up.

[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.500]
He thinks everybody watches 10.

[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.940]
Nobody watches 7.

[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.020]
And when in reality everybody watches.

[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.980]
And he certainly gave us a great subject for today, John.

[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.040]
Anyway, I was amazed that Marum and his mind this morning.

[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.660]
And her what?

[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.440]
Her mind.

[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.580]
What do you mean?

[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.980]
Did he listen to that at all?

[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.340]
No.

[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.300]
I mean, I know it's difficult.

[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.700]
I heard about five minutes coming to work.

[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.060]
Yeah.

[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.920]
She's got an incredible mind.

[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.380]
What does that mean?

[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.860]
She's got a, how do I put this?

[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.940]
Just blurred it on.

[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.320]
I just, just say it.

[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.660]
She's got a dirty mind.

[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.600]
Well, what's wrong with that?

[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.720]
I mean, it was surprising.

[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.580]
Good. I'm going to start watching Channel 10.

[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.860]
She has this clean cut wholesome image on TV and she's just a real hell-rather.

[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.760]
Yeah. Well, that's why she hangs around with Ann a lot.

[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.760]
Well, listen, have a great day.

[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.760]
And this is one of your greatest calls of all time.

[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.160]
This is probably the worst, right?

[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.820]
Which I think I think that says it all.

[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:55.620]
Okay.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.760]
It's 1048 at WIOD.

[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.140]
We have an open line in Broward now.

[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.120]
If you move very fast, we want to keep up with the bird's pace from yesterday.

[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.260]
I want to keep these there.

[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:05.600]
There it goes.

[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.500]
Look at that now.

[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.440]
But I hope you're impressed.

[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.360]
One thing I don't understand.

[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.080]
Okay.

[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.900]
I've been out two days this week.

[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.840]
Now, how can we have a break here like this, like the one we're going to do?

[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.660]
How is that possible?

[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.460]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.680]
Wouldn't you think they'd be making up?

[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.760]
Oh, boy.

[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.720]
All of a sudden, I feel like I'm having a relapse.

[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.520]
And then when I saw that fourth page from Denonbury.

[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.920]
Well, I told the Morrow.

[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.420]
What is wrong with that child anyway?

[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:31.780]
Seriously.

[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.240]
We got to send him to San Diego for a lobotomy, okay?

[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.020]
Yeah, him too.

[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:35.860]
Oh, okay.

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.300]
Man, they'd have to have very tiny little pieces of equipment to get in that very small

[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.020]
cranium of his, you know, as a bird brain.

[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.440]
It's 11-11 at WIOD.

[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.920]
Now, more with Neil Rogers, a new stock radio 610 WIOD.

[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:52.840]
It is shocking.

[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.360]
And at 10-52 at WIOD, Miami.

[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:55.800]
Hello.

[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.960]
Combine over here.

[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.300]
Yep.

[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.400]
I know what you're saying.

[00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.200]
Hey, Neil, welcome back.

[00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.720]
Yeah.

[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.480]
The birds did a great job with you, away from them.

[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.300]
We know a question about factoring the 11 o'clock hour.

[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.860]
We're going to be doing a poll on just how great a job he did, okay?

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.420]
Like, when I go on vacation, every time I go on vacation, and he does the show, I come back.

[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.760]
And then there, you know, we have to go through this like three days.

[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.000]
He was great.

[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:14.820]
He was horrible.

[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.900]
I mean, why don't those people grow up already, okay?

[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.980]
Listen, I got the perfect spot for you to go on vacation too.

[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:20.420]
Yes.

[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.620]
Charleston, South Carolina.

[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:22.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.920]
The weekend you can listen to WIOD.

[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.680]
I can hear you in a peak time on the weekend.

[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.080]
Yeah, the landscape is showing.

[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.840]
Yeah.

[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.340]
And then of course, I can listen to Meg on Sunday.

[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.120]
Find out how much money I'm going to bring back.

[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.780]
It's just that you know, Meg, don't get uptight.

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.880]
She is so sensitive.

[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.080]
Oh, she is just hysterical.

[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:40.860]
Listen.

[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.440]
How about the coaches here, huh?

[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.900]
Yeah, they're really looking great, man.

[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.140]
Last night, I want to tell you about Don Zimmer.

[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.160]
I liked Don Zimmer.

[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:54.240]
But last night, this kid, Ken Howell, who used to be with the Dodgers, who started for the Phillies last night,

[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.380]
he was throwing everything in the dirt he was behind in every batter.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.440]
The Cubs are ahead, too, nothing.

[00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.920]
There's still nobody out in the first inning.

[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.740]
And he's got him's healing, okay?

[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.880]
And in the first two winnings, getting thrown out and just busting up potential beginning.

[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.040]
Cubs could have had 10 runs in the first two winnings and Zimmer ran him out of it, okay?

[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.680]
Listen, Neil.

[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.440]
But anyway, it's going to be great.

[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.900]
Do you think there's any way that you can do some of the gains thanks here for you on?

[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:18.360]
No.

[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.020]
Really?

[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.080]
You don't want to get into that again?

[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.360]
I'm not going to go through this hole.

[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.540]
I mean, it's like somebody's doing me a favor to get involved with that.

[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.760]
And I'm just not going to do it.

[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.600]
We got too many, first of all, we got some paranoid people in the sports department who, you know,

[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.720]
you think that they're not busy doing enough other things.

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.380]
And secondly, it's just not worth a hassle.

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.580]
I mean, I think a pretty good job for six years over there.

[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.160]
I think I'm understating it.

[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.360]
And if they're happy with what's going on, then I'm happy, okay?

[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.620]
I don't need the extra work, believe me.

[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.660]
Well, you were so much fun.

[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.280]
I mean, now it's so fun.

[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.420]
I did have a lot of fun, huh?

[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.100]
No, it's so dry, you know, everything.

[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.520]
Well, I don't let's not get into that, okay?

[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.820]
I mean, you know, whatever it is it is, but they got some problems over there.

[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.140]
It's just as dull as the ganking.

[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.460]
Be nice now.

[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.940]
Would you please don't start ripping Joe?

[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.740]
I mean, it's true, but don't start ripping.

[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.120]
Listen, have a good day, and I want to call my friend Margaret Duschback.

[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.860]
Okay, pal.

[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.460]
Have a good one.

[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.460]
10.54 at WIOD.

[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.080]
Now we got two open lines in Dave County, but both in Palm Beach or a lit, I want you to do.

[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.420]
Okay.

[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.560]
I don't want you to start feeling, you know.

[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.380]
751 WIOD in Dave County.

[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.080]
No, they like it when I can barely speak at all.

[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.340]
They like that a lot, and probably a lot of lines will start dropping off.

[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.380]
Couldn't they think I'll have to talk a lot.

[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.900]
But talking like this, it's not no problem.

[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.360]
Oh, good.

[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.440]
No pain.

[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:32.900]
Yeah.

[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.460]
No strain.

[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.840]
And this is all you're getting today.

[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.380]
In fact, you notice it's kind of like in a lower register.

[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.000]
Here's a mobile in the Palm Beach line.

[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:41.300]
Hello.

[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.340]
Hi, Neil, I'm glad.

[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:42.780]
Yeah.

[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040]
Sorry, not feeling too well there.

[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.260]
Yeah.

[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.100]
I'm just going to go.

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.460]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:45.960]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:46.380]

[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.460]
And a pleasure meeting you said today.

[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:49.620]
Very exciting.

[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.100]
The thrill of my day.

[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:51.680]
What is it?

[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.060]
Actually, that night I had the pleasure of meeting the mouse.

[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.220]
He was in Miami.

[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.460]
Morton Downey, your buddy.

[00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:00.820]
Come on, Neil.

[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.400]
Talk to me.

[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.180]
Well, what do you want me to say?

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.300]
Well, I don't tell you.

[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.600]
I brought up your name with Mort.

[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.580]
Yeah, what do you say?

[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.240]
It goes, uh, well, he just nodded.

[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.940]
It was a nice evening.

[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.100]
He didn't want a evening bed.

[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.740]
He tried to behave himself the whole evening.

[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.640]
It was a charity event.

[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.500]
So, uh, he behaved himself.

[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.280]
He's the ugliest man I've ever met in my life.

[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.320]
And I think he had those warts removed, didn't he?

[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.160]
Oh.

[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.760]
What was it?

[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.980]
I say I think he's looking pretty good these days.

[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.480]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.080]
His warts.

[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.180]
No, he did.

[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.040]
What do you laugh at about it?

[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.500]
He had all these grotesque warts all over his neck in his face.

[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.460]
Did he really?

[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:34.980]
Yeah.

[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.840]
And he finally, after he made the first 40 million,

[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.300]
I guess he decided to have him removed.

[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.400]
I don't know why it took so long.

[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.700]
Well, he's got problems with it.

[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.620]
He's got one big eye and, uh, in the middle of his forehead.

[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.980]
Right in the middle of his forehead.

[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.940]
Anyway, just called it, I hope you feel better.

[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.560]
Okay.

[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.200]
And it was fun meeting you on Saturday.

[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.800]
Bob, it was exciting for me.

[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.880]
Next time I'm going to dress a lot better though.

[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.260]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.660]
Bye now.

[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:56.880]
See ya.

[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.840]
Next time I'm going to borrow a, um, very large dress from Shirley.

[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:01.700]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.480]
I don't believe that.

[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.300]
Is that a joke, Nick?

[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.740]
Is that, is that really happening today?

[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.240]
Surely, tweeter, you betcha.

[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:08.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.740]
No, you can't come close.

[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.540]
I mean, if you had a, I don't want to say it.

[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.920]
I mean, Shirley's, Shirley's, um, I don't know.

[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.960]
What's the word I'm looking for?

[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.200]
Oh, be careful now.

[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.500]
No.

[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.140]
I can't wait to meet her.

[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.100]
You never met Shirley?

[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.500]
No.

[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.440]
Never.

[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.220]
I don't think so.

[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.620]
Is this going to be a day that I'm going to remember for a while?

[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.820]
It'd better be nice to her, okay?

[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:30.480]
Of course.

[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.840]
She'll give you a left to the neck.

[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:32.740]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.120]
I'm not going to go up against her.

[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.000]
And you'll be on the moon in about 10 seconds.

[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.400]
I'm over here at this.

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.060]
Shirley is, I think the one word I would use to describe Shirley is militant, okay?

[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:43.860]
Militant.

[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:44.900]
Okay.

[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.460]
That's probably fair.

[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.460]
I mean, she has her moment.

[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:53.880]
It'd be a really nice person, but she just is obsessed with this militant thing.

[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.380]
I don't know.

[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.380]
I'm not really sure I know exactly what it is, but it's militant.

[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.820]
She's going to come in probably in the last few minutes of the show to say hi to you.

[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.480]
Oh, she's not.

[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.920]
Oh, maybe she will.

[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.280]
I don't know.

[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.520]
I haven't said she's in a long time.

[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:04.720]
Yeah.

[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.600]
We used to work together.

[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600]
Well, not closely.

[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.920]
Well, 1057 at the UIOD.

[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.280]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:12.960]
655WID.

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.320]
Tamarack.

[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:14.540]
Hello.

[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.300]
Hey, Neil.

[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.400]
Hey, do you want to hear it?

[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.340]
Is it sure that you're from Rochester?

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:17.960]
Yes.

[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.840]
Let me ask you something.

[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.020]
How come you're a Maple Leafs fan?

[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.080]
Why didn't you become a Sabre fan when they got there?

[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:22.560]
Or were you gone?

[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.380]
Because when I was there, Buffalo was in the American League.

[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.600]
And obviously, you know, being from Rochester, I don't think I would be a Buffalo fan.

[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.360]
You are an Amherst fan?

[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:30.900]
Yeah.

[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.020]
How about them Amherst?

[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.240]
They're the ones that I've ever year.

[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:33.700]
Are they?

[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.140]
Yeah.

[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.980]
I don't, I never, we don't, where do you find that out?

[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.220]
USA Today has the knock-and-hacky league recall.

[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:41.300]

[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.960]
Did you ever go to Letchworth State Park?

[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:43.500]
Yes.

[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.120]
Yeah, I went to Brockport State.

[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.880]
We used to go there like that.

[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.320]
All right.

[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.320]
Yeah, man.

[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.140]
I hear my guy, here's a guy.

[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.980]
Now, you should be taking notes on this because the birds going to upstate New York

[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.820]
to summer on vacation.

[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:53.500]
Where's he going?

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.700]
I don't know.

[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.400]
That's a pretty big place.

[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:55.840]
I mean, up here.

[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.260]
Well, he's going, he's going to make the whole tree.

[00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.640]
He's going to start in Fredonia.

[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.560]
And work his way up to Dunkirk and Tana Wanda and she to walk up.

[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.840]
She's going to go to the Bill's training camp.

[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.560]
He's going to spend a couple of days in Leroy.

[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.080]
And boy, it's a shame worth the end of the hour, isn't it?

[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.000]
Miller's port hangout and Ronda Koy for a few days.

[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.900]
And Fricks wrap it up with an eating fest to Don and Bob.

[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.620]
Hey, Neil, give me your predictions for the NHL finals.

[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.020]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:21.740]
I don't know.

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.700]
What's the Maple Leafs got to blue that game on Sunday?

[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:24.940]
Yeah.

[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.120]
I just kind of lost my enthusiasm.

[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.380]
I'm afraid the Canadians are going to do it this year.

[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.320]
I tell you, it's going to be the Canadians and the Oilers without Karevki

[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.700]
and I'm telling you, man, they're still awesome.

[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.260]
Yeah.

[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.080]
Alright.

[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.060]
They are awesome.

[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.500]
OK.

[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.760]
How about those Maple Leafs, huh?

[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.620]
Who did I got?

[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.680]
Your owner has your owner about 110 years old.

[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.300]
Harold Baller.

[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.080]
You're going to get me living Tama.

[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.460]
He died 70 years ago and I forgot to tell him.

[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.500]
Melissa and have a great life back.

[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.760]
OK, Neil.

[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.400]
I'll see you.

[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:46.980]
See it?

[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.260]
Maple Leaf Gardens in the gondola with Foster and Bill Hewitt.

[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.660]
Foster died a year ago but Hitt didn't stop him.

[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.540]
He's still doing the games.

[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.700]
Uh, we got an open line in Broward 524, WIOD.

[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.340]
And at Vocalign is open.

[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.640]
I bet you'll call him today.

[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.200]
He'll never let me down.

[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.200]
278 W.I.O.D. I don't think he showed up by the way on Saturday and he didn't call me yesterday

[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.320]
I'll be hung up on me Monday. What a douchebag you betcha come on veg just get it together

[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:19.520]

Now he's even getting calls off the air from Atlanta

[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.440]
How do you like that? You wouldn't go on the air. I don't know. What was that all about?

[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.700]
Um, remember that picture I got last week a Jasmine guy. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's a person who's

[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.680]
Saga me. Ugly Jasmine guy from a different world. And she just I'd called her to thank her

[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:45.260]
Mr. And she just called and she she works at one of the TV stations. Do you think that River Phoenix is going to be caught?

[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:51.120]
Now they got married. Is that right? That's the room. You think he's going to be calling Martha Plimpton. That's his new wife Marty

[00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:01.120]
That's a good idea. I'm serious. This picture is shocking. You ripped that picture. You were so in shock if Henry could see this picture

[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.280]
He go out and see grandma boon for about ten hours. I want you to take a look at this Henry

[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.240]
I want you to come in here and look at this. We'll get Henry's

[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:15.640]
Yeah, well Henry's been through it all. He's seen everything. He's heard it all just hallucinations, but Henry's seen it all.

[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:23.160]
There's River Phoenix on the right and his new wife his new bride Martha Plimpton and we want you to reach which? Yeah.

[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:31.680]
That's what I said. We want you to reaction. Now what's the story which is which I guarantee it will be on heralda within two months.

[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.560]
Whoa. Yeah.

[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:43.960]
Shocking Henry looks like he just saw I better go have a drink. Yeah. Now I have a story. I'd lean off out of the new store.

[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.840]
Henry you should hear this because this this will interest you now. The headline says

[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:58.160]
Ed McMahon was so blitzed he couldn't remember Johnny Carson's guests claim ex-Nanny. Okay now he's a bud man. Yeah like Harry

[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.040]
Ed McMahon sometimes got so drunk he had to be carried up the stairs of his Beverly Hills mansion.

[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.260]
Some nights he was so sourced he couldn't remember who had been Johnny's guests that night.

[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:17.400]
McMahon's yeah is shocking isn't it. McMahon's fondness for drink has been revealed by a former nanny who tells of her four months with the

[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:25.440]
McMahon's. The man best known as Carson Sidekick spends his spare time drinking bottles of high-priced wine and watching TV

[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.380]
especially his own shows the tonight show in star cert says the nanny. That Ed.

[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:36.440]
She says Ed's drinking usually began when he got up around noon. There would be more to drink in the

[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.960]
stretch limo that took him to the tonight show studios about 3 30 in the afternoon. Then any claims

[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:48.200]
66 year old McMahon would start drinking again when he slipped into his limo after he did the tonight show.

[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.980]
He had sipped his way home arriving back at the mansion about seven and then he would continue drinking

[00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:01.460]
through the evening. He'd get pretty drunk two or three times a week she says sometimes I'd ask him

[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:08.260]
who was on that night show and he couldn't remember eventually his wife Victoria told me to stop asking him

[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:15.620]
it was obviously embarrassing for her Henry can relate to a little story for Henry this morning.

[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:23.780]
He was that you were talking about. Oh boy eight minutes after 11 at WIOD. Oh look at this we got the

[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.460]
we better run that break a little early we got five pages of copy.

[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:34.200]
Open line in date county 751 WIOD. In fact we got three stinking open lines on here every time I got

[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.400]
this problem and they do the same crap this audience. I'm serious I'll start at the top of the rack

[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.000]
alphabetically and we'll play every you know we must have 300 cards at least easy in this rack

[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.680]
and play every stinking one of them. I really will. Miami hello sounds good to me. Yeah.

[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.120]
How are you doing guys well I know how you're doing. Sorry to hear your voices in at the park.

[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.320]
First thing I wanted to send to antique kind we really get a kick of that out of that show every Saturday.

[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.140]
Oh yeah it's it's a wonderful guessing game which is which is older the thing they're calling

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.140]
about at the color. Wait a minute he's going nuts here next door again well somebody put him in a

[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.620]
straight jacket this guy is just out of control here next door and we already simply be sitting here

[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.080]
and feeling the whole room is vibrating it's like the end of the where the guy is nuts today he's

[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.400]
out of his mind probably rent that room out of the figure. He's got those speakers are vibrating on a

[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.400]
wall to the point where they're going to just like bounce off and go into orbit. They charge for

[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.940]
that at this keyboard. They can they can forget about the the cap up there they can just give

[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:40.700]
everything a Scott and he can bounce it off the wall right into space okay guys nuts. Oh there

[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:45.880]
it went again okay go ahead I'm sorry. Anyway the original reason I was calling was that

[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:51.760]
River Phoenix Martha Clinton story. Yeah. To show you how wonderfully. What is she?

[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.220]
Well that's that's neither here nor there but to show you how wonderfully accurate those

[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:04.840]
those newspapers are they said that her father is George Clinton. Her father is Keith Kerrney.

[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.660]
Oh. Clinton is her mother's name. Well there seems to be a lot of confusion there you know.

[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.220]
You can imagine a lot of gender identity crisis in this. So you can imagine how how much

[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.260]
the rest of that story is true. Yeah. But yeah I agree with you when she was 15 or so yeah that

[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:26.520]
was that look was cute but she's getting older and it's questionable now okay anyway you take

[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:33.200]
care of yourself. I'm trying. Good show. Bye bye. Now intermittently here I thought he had stopped

[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:39.120]
here next to her. Intermittent really. He's going crazy. I mean that I how long we've been here now

[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:45.380]
tomorrow be five months. Mm-hmm. Am I right? Yeah. Mars are five month anniversary by the way so send

[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:52.340]
a lot of presents. And you know there have been days when it's been allowed but he's just he's

[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:59.940]
gone through the nut house today. Is he on doggy uppers? He must be listening to the promos they

[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.100]
do on GTR where they turn it up and piss off the neighbors. Did they really say that? You never

[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.920]
heard that? No never they play that all the time. Do they? Turn it up loud and piss off the neighbors.

[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.040]
Sure that's one of their big ideas over there on pottymouth radio next story. He must have

[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:20.560]
boisted. He did. Yeah. Well I don't know if he's pissing off the neighbors but he sure you're doing a

[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.220]
real good job on us I know that. We're the neighbors. Yeah. Yeah. Where's GTR? Mr. Rogers neighbor.

[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.540]

[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:56.460]
you can figure out which one is the guy we will pay you serious money okay if you can figure out

[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.120]
which one is the guy i wish i guess if i got the right spot out now we'd be in good shape right

[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.400]
it's 11 23 at w i on day i don't i don't know if my voice is going to get any worse today i hope not

[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.120]
because this is about them you know about as low as it can go and we've only got these one thing

[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.560]
i like about our continuity now we got these 45 minute spots for every account now this is what i

[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.220]
like anyway i think we can condense it right oh good by saying if you've been watching tv you

[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.060]
noticing all the specials for seafood restaurants lately um all i have been you know very limited

[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:32.040]
hours on certain days when the french canadiens are looking east and all these other restrictive

[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.660]
kind of thing this does on for three minutes before you get to the spot exactly but we don't have

[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.720]
to mess around with all the preliminary is because we can tell you there's one seafood restaurant

[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.940]
that doesn't try to lure you in with limited offers that are only good you know between suckers

[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:50.160]
and poor them and stuff like that and of course we're talking about shells shells serve the same

[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.680]
great seafood day after day week after week at the same grade prices that have made them Miami

[00:34:54.680 --> 00:35:00.200]
and Fort Lauderdale's favorite seafood restaurant for the past two years running so you stop in soon

[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.420]
at any of the five stop floor to shells and find out how great a true floor to seafood experience can

[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.860]
be and how much more enjoyable it can be when it's served up at dockside prices anytime you want it

[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.820]
every stinkin out of the week okay that shells and there's one near you in sunrise on university

[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:20.180]
drive just north of sunrise boulevard and in north Miami Beach on 163rds reaches a quarter mile west

[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:25.900]
of this cana in the closing line they say shells is a nightly shell abrasion and I was wondering

[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:32.280]

[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:35.640]
these two two of these local local sports writers from the newspapers on and it was after the opening

[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.920]
game on it was Tuesday night and i had watched the game and it was one of the most exciting opening day

[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.900]
games ever seen my life and michauliam is pitching for the first time ever for the cubs had the

[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.500]

going on talking about how michauliam sucks and how bad he is and how i'll never get anybody else out

[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.640]

[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.920]
for anything yeah that's unless they're on the yankees of course yeah you're absolutely right
