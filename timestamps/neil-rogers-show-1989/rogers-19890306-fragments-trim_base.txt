[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]
Hey Mel, I am the recipient of a no-fills breast implant.

[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.040]
The left one is nearly twice the size of the right.

[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.940]
The left one is hard as a bowling ball and the right one has consistency of cheese whizz.

[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.540]
If you touch it, it actually dents.

[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.380]
The first time I was home, my husband was the first to notice.

[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.980]
And when he asked me to turn sideways, I knocked him cold with a big one.

[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.240]
I just got a letter saying the clinic refused all responsibility.

[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.880]
Help me Mel, sign me. That's the large and the small of it and the Rockies.

[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.140]
You know, our staff physician advises me to tell you that whatever you do,

[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.860]
avoid trampling is at all costs.

[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.940]
Mel keeps an attorney on retainer just for these very situations and he assures me

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.840]
that as soon as he stops laughing, he'll be back to me.

[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.040]
For the life of me, I'll never be able to understand a woman's preoccupation

[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.600]
with trying to change a god-given appearance.

[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.040]
Hey, a little makeup to cover those ugly wrinkles,

[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.220]
a little rouge to put some life into that dead-looking pus, but babe,

[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.180]
if the Lord had won you to have big basomes, they would have sprouted back in high school.

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.680]
If you really want me to pursue this thing legally, we'll be needing some photographs.

[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.800]
Well, we guys, then again, I could be wrong. They call me Mel.

[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.340]
You gotta be kidding me. Callers said, don't forget him.

[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:36.220]
Mel is a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's been a man who's

[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.500]
Jumping your ride down 95 behind Canadians and all that job.

[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.400]
Why was it to get to work? Why'd you rush to get there and your boss is a jerk?

[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.420]
Manad平 i pi u

[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.680]
Yeah, it's only there a few bird droppings in it along the way.

[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.160]
It says 10.27, and you're wondering, I can't hang up on him and I can't hang up on him, I can't put him on him, I can't put him on.

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.640]
Do you care?

[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.800]
In the best.

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.620]
Well there are all a bunch of winners over there, okay?

[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.100]
I don't want to hear about Jeff.

[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.620]
We're I mean is that boring or what what happened all the living and breathing people that we had out there in this show just as a Friday?

[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.660]
Did they all die over the weekend they all go up to Daytona?

[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.560]
My God well, of course it is spring break somewhere that we haven't any do we talk about spring break here anymore?

[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:57.040]
Do we don't even dignified by but now it's like starts the 17th I think that's all so but I'm saying do we discuss it in this part of the state

[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.640]
Because doesn't exist it is an totally extinct side of fact like an extinct species out of factor in this part of the day

[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.480]
This is anymore now remember to go on redneck Yahoo's up there in Fort Lauderdale

[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.300]
Let's say hey, we don't want your money here

[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.000]
You're just too young and too much problems and get lost okay along with those fasciates big cops up there all right

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.920]
All the brown shirts

[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.440]
But you can't cross the street. What is it in Fort Lauderdale? You can't cross the street if you're under 30

[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.960]
Whether without a cup. I mean you just can't cross the street period

[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.080]
You can't be driving with a cup even if it's like coffee. You can't have it

[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.400]
You can't park at the beach after 6 p.m. You can't park at the beach before 6 p.m. I mean you can't do anything over there right?

[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.000]
Can you remember the old days when the college kids used to come in and take over for a motor to

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.800]
I can remember when you couldn't drive on a one a it was great because you would just you would you would just kind of go in neutral

[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:00.300]
And just rule along and it would take about an hour and a half to go from one end of the strip to the other and you see all of these incredible people in there

[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.000]
We just it was like body watching okay. We're going into the mall big. It was a great better than the malls

[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.540]
Yeah, it was amazing biggest people watching there was yeah, and most everybody seemed to be having a good time

[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.260]
Then they started passing all these stupid laws and they drove them back into the hotels and the high rises

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.600]
Because they wouldn't let them do anything outside and some of the kids would get drunk because when you're in college drinking is your major generally

[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.300]
And then they start like you know doing things out in the balcony and jumping off and falling off and things like that

[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.840]
They couldn't figure out why you know, and they're infinite wisdom up there in Fort Lauderdale

[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.280]
I mean you you pop movers and shakers up there in Fort Lauderdale you have got to be the dumbest group in the history mankind

[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.260]
I mean the people on the beach at least some of them are trying okay, they're not succeeding, but they're trying

[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.180]
Even Barbara is trying over there. Okay in her own

[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.360]
Neanderthal way, okay in her own archaic manner

[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.340]
But in Fort Lauderdale they don't even make a pretense of it

[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.320]
They just want to turn it into an outdoor nursing home

[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:03.080]
So Bob Cox considering it with a you know in a wheelchair out there on a one-a eventually and just sit there rocking back and forth with his silly hair cut

[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.440]
Just look around and have it like it was 50 years ago and even the alligators wouldn't come near

[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.860]
What a pathetic I don't know it's not even worth talking about is it 1046 at W.I.O.D

[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.560]
Let's talk to more food. Okay, if we can't eat it we talk about it. That's our slogan at W.I.O.D

[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.840]
If you can't eat it talk about it

[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:32.180]
This is sergeant whip good on the metro street patrol with a traffic safety reminder

[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.620]
It may be little, but it can still cause a lot of trouble before you pull it out and stick it in take a close look at it

[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.700]
If you abuse it it gets crooked and bent out of shape and you'll find this time goes by

[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.840]
It doesn't quite fit in which case you might as well just leave it in your pants

[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.660]
I'm talking of course about your car team treat it right and always carry a spare

[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.640]
This is sergeant whip good in the metro street patrol

[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.720]

[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:55.440]
Hey, Mel I'm a sophomore in high school and I fell in love with my science teacher. I live every day for third period

[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.620]
I can't get my mind off it. She's beautiful. Mel everything about her is wonderful

[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.180]
She has softful lips her body is the curvy and all the right places and our glass figure

[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.980]
I can't work on my homework for 10 minutes without daydreaming about her

[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.720]
I know if I told her how I feel she just laughs at me. It's on me infatuated but shy and Charlotte North Carolina

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.140]
Hey, you know, there's a number of ways to get a retention

[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.620]
Maybe your science project could be models of the male and female genitalia

[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.420]
When you present the project give her a wink and wiggle your tongue at her

[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.760]
Life get who sits in front of you in the back of the head with a closed fist

[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.900]
Which keeps you after school for detention or will be just you and her

[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:34.500]
I'd love to see the look of her face when you're reaching to your backpack and break out a couple of candles and a six pack

[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.220]
Center of porerite of you and your BVDs

[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.780]
Stuff up there are socks in there for effect over to buy her underwear

[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.920]
Tell her she needs a spanking shake hands with her and tell her she's got a good grip

[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.360]
Offer her money for sex then again. I could be wrong. They call me Mel

[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.720]
Oh

[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.240]
It's a 55

[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.780]
The glow my bright head lights

[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:14.840]
Is that the neighbor can I see up ahead in the wash of a corner street life

[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:26.520]
I'm not even they just never see me coming and I guess that's why they say every car has a hole

[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.400]
And I wonder if I'll remember more

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.580]
Just like every road you

[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.800]
Just leave that the little four door

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.420]
Every car has a more

[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.480]
Funny past noon at w1ity we're gonna hit him with a really big city

[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.800]
The trough 38 at w at least they hope you'll settle for it anyways, too

[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.420]
All right now listen those of you who were out there

[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.500]
Be 137 I will be

[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:15.820]
153

[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:25.460]
So we apologize for the buzz in the background of this tube but nothing's perfect

[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.340]
Okay, that's enough of those I old D. Hi everybody. This is safety officer Mike Tyson heavyweight champion

[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.480]
The world you baddest dude around the baddest driver around too with your driving tip of the day a few months ago

[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.860]
I was in the K-Mart with my ex-wife Robin Givens. I can't believe it

[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.640]
Maybe you read about her in the papers anyway

[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:52.060]
She buys me one of these two little graphio the cats with suction cup feet which they stuck on the window in my car when we left the store

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.360]
And the way home I drove into a tree. I can't believe it. Maybe you read about it in the papers

[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.160]
I couldn't see the tree because the damn cat was in my way robin said said I was stupid to stick gargled on the windshield

[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.520]
I mean that's really bitchy to me. I mean call the heavyweight champion the world stupid now that's stupid

[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.000]
So I say I say robin are left and took her out with a clean right hand knocked the right down completely first

[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.180]
Extending a count. I can't believe it

[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.700]
Maybe you read about that in the papers anyway my attitude toward gargled through the cat has really been affected greatly

[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.340]
I mean in fact if I see you driving around with gargled through the cat in your car

[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.700]
I mean you can complete control. I don't know what will happen

[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:31.600]
Maybe you'll read about that in the papers too. Could be 1054 at W-1. I have as much experience in the Congress

[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.300]
As Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency

[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.380]
That serve with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy

[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.420]
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine

[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.640]
Senator you know Jack Kennedy now you're probably wondering why

[00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.110]
Oh

[00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.910]
We just cut up the next one okay, it's 1017 at W-1

[00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.190]
This is Sergeant Whitwood in the Metro Street Patrol with a traffic safety reminder

[00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.150]
If you're a hard driver, what should you be most concerned about?

[00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:17.110]
That's right the rubber on your cars tires

[00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.110]
It gets a lot of abuse if you cruise a lot

[00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.590]
Always check your rubber before you get in the driver's seat

[00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:29.050]
If it's getting thin you're asking for big trouble maybe a blowout at high speed

[00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.290]
Yes, when it comes to rubber safety

[00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.550]
I always say if it's worn and thin then trade it in

[00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.870]
But if it's thick and wide then you won't slide

[00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.710]
This is Sergeant Whitwood go to the Metro Street Patrol

[00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.970]

Well mic mill be hey, Mal I was born with a silver spoon on my mouth

[00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.250]
And I feel guilty that I have all this money most people have to slave all their lives to make ends meet

[00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.690]
I want to do good deeds and share the wealth as they say my friends think I'm crazy

[00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.650]
But I know I'm right what good or wealth enriches if a person chooses not to reject

[00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.650]

Now let's deal with a little problem with yours

[00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.890]
There are funds for the homeless funds for the hungry even funds for the sick

[00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:34.430]
But to the best of my knowledge there's only one fund that covers all of the above

[00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.850]
It's called the movement for elevated living or Mel

[00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.270]
There are open-minded bunches in the respect that they accept cash checks charges

[00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.390]

Yes, even though it's harder to make beer this way out of the back of a chuck wagon from ingredients we find in the cow pasture

[00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:59.130]
We still do it because well we're stubborn stubborn and backward and like papa just a little bit local

[00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:05.990]
But that's how you get when you're out on the prairie all alone for just a horse and a gun and a whole bunch of beer

[00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.690]
Our beer Zeldin Schlock beer

Enjoy a great tradition of the old west getting drunk and shooting up the place with Zeldin Schlock beer

[00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.790]
Well, you don't look at those ball player spaces anyway. Do you we don't want to ruin your image and get your new wife?

[00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.910]
I've said just the numbers. Okay

[00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.270]
Looking at those numbers. Yeah, I hear that um, so that's all I wanted to know is that it?

No, no yet. What is it? There's no rush. There's no shotgun, you know, okay?

[00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.310]
Oh, in other words, they're still hope for Donald right?

[00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.310]
There's only a hope for Donald and everybody else in a bit. Okay. All right. Okay. It's yeah

Okay, well if they don't want those collaters we'll take

[00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:45.110]
I don't care what anybody else says they're just too good to throw out. Oh, no, but they didn't throw them out

[00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.170]
They're like you can't do that. I

[00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.150]
More of a ball player. Okay, you can do that. You can retire a uniform

[00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:56.030]
But whoever heard a retiring collater never been done. I bet you they retire Zeta when they change format

[00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:01.350]
I'm serious when they start playing those Chinese melody. I bet you they change the call

[00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.150]
Nobody else will pick up Zeta cuz VTA

[00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.150]
Well, didn't we say at the time? Remember when what's your name?

[00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.490]
Kathy Wild West came in and she blew that story on the year and then I'm

[00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.390]
Wanda coming in and swearing on a year a couple of times about it

[00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:20.130]
But anyway, uh, I couldn't believe it because those that got to be the worst collaters and of course i95 was just such a natural

[00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:25.410]
It was too good right and the first time that was they to for the original they to for it was w i n z fm

[00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.850]
Yeah, that makes too much sense. It's too easy. You remember

[00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.930]
Anyways 1026 and w i d and we're real like

[00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:39.510]
We're up to our long distance dedication and this one is about kids and pets and the situation that we can all understand

[00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:45.430]
Whether we have kids or pets or neither it's from a man and Cincinnati, Ohio and here's what he writes

[00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:49.630]
Dear Casey this may seem to be a strange dedication request

[00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.910]
But i'm quite sincere and it'll need a lot if he played

[00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.530]
Recently there was a death in our family

[00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.110]
He was a little dog named snuggles, but he was most certainly a part of let's come start again

[00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.930]
From coming out of the record play the record, okay

[00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:06.610]
Please

[00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.670]
You see when you come out of those uptempo damn numbers man is impossible to make those transitions

[00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.030]
And then you got to go into somebody dying you know they do this to me all the time

[00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.690]
I don't know what the hell they do it for but damn it if we can't come out of a slow record

[00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.930]
I don't understand it is down on the phone

[00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:33.850]
Okay, I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a f**king uptempo record every time I do a damn death

[00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.630]
dedication

[00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.510]
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week

[00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:47.210]
It's a god last damn time. I want somebody use this in brain to not come out of a damn record

[00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.930]
That is that's uptempo and I got to talk about a can draw dying

[00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.190]
What is it and Honduras man?

[00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.490]

[00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.990]
Okay, it's 12 minutes after 11 at WIO days. So we give him kind of like a quenilla

[00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.950]
You

[00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.390]
This is on gen with good in the metro street patrol with a traffic safety reminder

[00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.450]
If you're a hard driver, what should you be most concerned about?

[00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.610]
That's right the rubber on your cars tires

[00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.630]
It gets a lot of abuse if you've cruised a lot

[00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.250]
Always check your rubber before you get in the driver's seat

[00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:36.910]
If it's getting thin you're asking for big trouble maybe a blow out at high speed

[00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.190]
Yes, when it comes to rubber safety

[00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:46.930]
I always say if it's worn and thin then trade it in but if it's thick and wide then you won't slide

[00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.930]
This is on gen with good in the metro street patrol

[00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.510]
Oh, yeah one more thing

[00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.470]
job

[00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.830]
That's about as exciting as Georgia's gaffee

[00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.810]
Okay, it's one of those stuff I feel

[00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.510]
Sounds a little like Willards
