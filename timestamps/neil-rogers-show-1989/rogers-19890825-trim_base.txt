[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.180]
Okay, that was great.

[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.640]
5.60 WQAM, I'm Bill Calder and nice to be with you this morning.

[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.420]
Hope everybody's okay and we're going to go right to the phones.

[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.480]
I got some calls on hold.

[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.160]
I can't believe it.

[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.600]
It's wonderful.

[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.620]
I'm online one.

[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.160]
What do we have a surprise, Calder?

[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.020]
Is that what they said?

[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.940]
Oh boy.

[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.600]
Keep your hand on the dump button.

[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.380]
Steve, Steve, read my lips.

[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.660]
Keep your hand on the dump button.

[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.080]
Good boy.

[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.340]
Hello.

[00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.100]
Hello.

[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.100]
Good morning, Bill.

[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.460]
Good morning.

[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.060]
How are you?

[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.420]
Fine, thank you.

[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.040]
Bill?

[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.980]
Yes.

[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.760]
How's New Orleans?

[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.180]
How is it?

[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.440]
How much New Orleans?

[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.780]
How is New Orleans?

[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.100]
Yes.

[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.320]
Phil Kabase.

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.040]
Oh?

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.660]
Hello.

[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.900]
Phil Kabase.

[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.080]
What's that?

[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.940]
Okay.

[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.240]
Well, I just take it a guess.

[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.880]
Okay.

[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.800]
Could you put me in hold?

[00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.200]
Would you want hold?

[00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.580]
Yes.

[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.000]
What do you want to hear the show?

[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.900]
No, no.

[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.500]
I have a radio.

[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.240]
That's what it's for.

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.280]
Who is this?

[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.460]
Oh, come on, go wake up.

[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.040]
Do you know who it is, Steve?

[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.620]
You don't know.

[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.980]
Okay.

[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.400]
I'll wait for you while you play a song.

[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.740]
You wait for me while I play a song?

[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.260]
I'll wait for you when I play a song.

[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.960]
Please, I'll sing one.

[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.600]
No, I can't.

[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.800]
I won't be able to talk.

[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.600]
You mean off the air?

[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.100]
Yes.

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.660]
No, I can't do that.

[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.540]
Oh, yes, you can.

[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.000]
Phil.

[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.360]
What?

[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.800]
Well, Bill, Bill.

[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.720]
Yes, you.

[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.460]
Bill, Bill.

[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.220]
I wrote you a letter while you were up there in New Orleans.

[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.040]
You wrote me a letter while I was in New Orleans?

[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.460]
Yes.

[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.400]
I'm on work.

[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.720]
I'm on, I'm on leave.

[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.920]
Intent.

[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.060]
You're on leave?

[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.640]
Yes.

[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.480]
What, like a work release program?

[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.420]
No, no, no.

[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.840]
No, a vacation.

[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.020]
From where?

[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.400]
Oh, from the middle east.

[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.320]
There you go.

[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.580]
Ah.

[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.420]
Boy, I am really, um...

[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.240]
Are you still don't know?

[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.920]
No, I do.

[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.420]
Oh, come on, call the...

[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.280]
Hey, listen, I'm just...

[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.980]
Okay, I'll give you a clue and you'll get it, okay?

[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.680]
Ready?

[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.180]
Hello?

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.640]
Yes.

[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.960]
Hello, Neil.

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.700]
Okay, now have you got it?

[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.380]
No.

[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.160]
You still don't know, G-d.

[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.620]
I have no idea who it is.

[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.760]
No, you're kidding me, of course.

[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.460]
Yeah, give you a clue.

[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.740]
You already give you another clue,

[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.240]
because I'm sure we're boring your...

[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.880]
Your...

[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.600]
Your many listeners all...

[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.820]
That...

[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.300]
Seven of them?

[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.120]
Hello?

[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.540]
I'm gonna hang up on you if you're gonna do that to me.

[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.940]
If you don't embarrass me.

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.380]
Oh, because you...

[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.640]
No, I'm not trying to embarrass you.

[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.960]
Oh, my God, I don't believe this.

[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.520]
There you go.

[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.780]
Oh, I hope Neil isn't listening.

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.700]
No, he's not listening.

[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.780]
Where's he at?

[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.960]
He's been here as they came to talk to me.

[00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.800]
Oh, my God.

[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.060]
He doesn't know I'm reformed.

[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.860]
See, that's the whole thing I called him up yesterday

[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.620]
and he was totally out of it.

[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.680]
Did he hang up on you?

[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.820]
No, he didn't hang up on me.

[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.040]
I said, what am I coming to visit?

[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.860]
Does that plant to visit him?

[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.980]
Whether he likes it or not.

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.760]
Oh, my God.

[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.380]
How do I get to QAM to sing a little before I leave?

[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.540]
Where are you going?

[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.420]
I'm leaving on the 12th of September.

[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.740]
Well, we can't have any visitor.

[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.540]
We're not set up for visitors till after the 13th.

[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.500]
Ah, that's funny. That's a good one.

[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.740]
How do I sound?

[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.020]
You sound wonderful and the music is even better.

[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.940]
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.220]
This is...

[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.000]
Isn't this weird? Don't give your name.

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.120]
No, I don't. Please don't say who this is either.

[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.980]
I wouldn't...

[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.540]
I wouldn't even attempt to...

[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.220]
That's right.

[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.080]
I've backed up.

[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.460]
Well, that's incredible.

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.640]
Are you going to come by and see me someday?

[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.240]
Yes, I want to do that.

[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.040]
I want to have a chance to, because I haven't.

[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.820]
How long have I been...

[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.780]
been abusing your show for?

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.680]
Yes, and yet...

[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.760]
Yes, and yet...

[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.380]
Unbelievably...

[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.080]
Yes, and yet, ever since you were...

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.200]
All over the place.

[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.660]
Did you get on NEO show?

[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.300]
Yes, but it took too long.

[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.540]
And what did he do? Hang up on you?

[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.800]
No, he didn't hang up on me.

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.660]
I said hello, NEO.

[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.820]
I want you to...

[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.300]
Did he recognize your voice?

[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.100]
Yes, after... after...

[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.560]
Well, it started out like...

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.800]
Manana said hello, NEO.

[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.460]
It's like how are you?

[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.400]
And he says, well, by the sound of this car's getting kind of boring.

[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.820]
Well, that's because you don't know, you don't recognize the voice.

[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.800]
He says, oh, it sounds like somebody from Kendall.

[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.920]
Oh.

[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.720]
I said, right.

[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.780]
It says, one, can I visit?

[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.780]
And he says, never.

[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.240]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.080]
I said, why not?

[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.040]
And he goes, the voice has changed.

[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.600]
What have they done?

[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.100]
Has it made giving you an operation?

[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.220]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.440]
That's what I was going to say, then.

[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.320]
And...

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.280]
No, you want to say that?

[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.780]
No, he's already said it.

[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.440]
I don't want to write on his cotail.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.080]
All right, listen, I got to run.

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.060]
Call me now, okay?

[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.580]
I will.

[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.680]
Okay, there he goes.

[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.680]
Mystery caller.

[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.120]
Well, if Rogers hears that, I'm going to be in so much trouble.

[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.220]
But he put them on the air.

[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.860]
What the hell?

[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.160]
Um... Chris.

[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.820]
Okay, you're on WQAM.

[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.200]
Chris.

[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.340]
Yes, good morning, Bill.

[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.780]
QAM welcomes you with open arms.

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.480]
Oh, well, that's so nice of you, huh?

[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.120]
Well, we... we go a step further.

[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.700]
As a matter of fact, um...

[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.840]
Wait, I have to cough here.

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.660]
Thank you.

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.500]
Oh, okay.

[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.480]
All right, all right.

[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.480]

[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.300]
Uh, listen, Bill, what time are you going to be at, uh, uh, baseite tomorrow?

[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.220]
Well, the guy who has been booked to sing,

[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.680]
oh, promise me, in Lithuanian,

[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.840]
at Larry King's wedding.

[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.440]
And the guy called us from West Palm Beach.

[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.180]
His name is Larry Barronoff.

[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.160]
Well, who keep football?

[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.880]
That was an incredible call.

[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.120]
I wish everybody could have heard it.

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.940]
But, listen, you can't...

[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.220]
You just have to go with what you have, right?

[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.320]
Okay.

[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.540]
Now, Bob Harnes, you're standing by.

[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.180]
Now, I'm, you know, I'm putting this stuff in there.

[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.360]
I'm taking my life in my hands.

[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.360]
I'm putting this in a machine without having heard it.

[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.140]
The bird's the wire.

[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.000]
Okay, 10.07 at W.I.D.

[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.800]
Yeah, the bird is, uh, really making noise.

[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.360]
I'll tell you that.

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.980]
I got a couple of calls at home yesterday.

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.580]
A couple of frantic calls with some more bird spottings and sightings.

[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.020]
And, uh, what can I say?

[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.780]
What can I tell you?

[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.080]
Anyway, Alex Bennett is going to be here next week to do this show.

[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.100]
I have no idea who that is.

[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.380]
Everybody else in the business seems to know who that is.

[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.940]
Okay, so he must be very famous and really great.

[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.000]
And, uh, he got fired at KITS in San Francisco.

[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.960]
And, it says, uh, his sudden departure from kids is caused quite a stir in the market, et cetera, et cetera.

[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.320]
So, he's going to be here next week with the bird.

[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.280]
I understand.

[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.420]
And then, of course, when I come back the following week, then we'll take care of that problem, okay?

[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.820]
Anyway, it's 10.07 at W.I.O.D., a Michael Putney of Channel 4.

[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.900]
We certainly want to wish a good luck to.

[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.880]
Heidi Overpaid, a great guy, but evidently very much overpaid.

[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.720]
I want to say, they didn't give any numbers in here.

[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.140]
Well, Steve will probably come on and tell you how much Michael's going to make.

[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.560]
Because Steve likes to talk about how much people in the business are making.

[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.720]
But, Michael Putney is going to Channel 10.

[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.200]
And it's kind of like, uh, it's kind of like what they do over at W.S. News.

[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.800]
I'm not trying to relate the talent because that would be a shot at Michael.

[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.400]
But I'm just talking to these revolving shares that they've got in the market.

[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.720]
How, you know, one day, one guy's at one station and one anchor woman is another.

[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.040]
And they just keep revolving around and around like a deck of cards, you know?

[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.660]
So, Michael's going over to be an anchor, I guess, at Channel 10 in February, no less.

[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.200]
Steve, this is only August still. He's going there in February.

[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.760]
I wonder what that means.

[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.920]
Is he still going to be on four between now and then?

[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.620]
And every time you look on there, you're going to think you're watching Channel 10.

[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.300]
I heard all about Larry Barron office morning on the Bill Calder show.

[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.040]
And I was just driving off the road. Nobody understands what that means except me.

[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.440]
So I'm glad that the Bill has got somebody in the audience who's understanding

[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.700]
some of that bizarre humor that was, I just, just about when I also heard a call on that show this morning.

[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.820]
You know, it takes more than just changing your voice.

[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.720]
Okay? This is a little message to one of our friends in Kendall who called here yesterday.

[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.620]
And he's back briefly. We hope it takes more than just changing your voice to show, you know,

[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.600]
a certain degree of maturity. One of the things that certainly would help would be kind of diminishing your obsession with radio

[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.020]
and with radio personalities and with being a groupie and call.

[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.400]
I mean, that was such a boring call this morning that I can't, it was almost as bad as Bob Martin.

[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.740]
Okay? Same genre, I think. But what can I say?

[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.900]
Okay, nine minutes after 10. We're here to kill four hours before I go on vacation again.

[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.600]
And then Steve has got open phones this afternoon.

[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.780]
And we have, oh, I didn't even realize we got the game tonight.

[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.780]
This is really bizarre. I didn't even realize that.

[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.760]
We must not have done a great job of promoting it this week because I didn't know about that.

[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.960]
The Dolphin Express had six. And the special multi-hour NFL edition of Sports Talk following the game.

[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.560]
The Dolphins at the Redskins with kickoff at eight o'clock.

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.480]
Hello?

[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.240]
This is not. Hello?

[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.160]
Um, hi.

[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.300]
What a look. Oh, man, sometimes you really want television.

[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.680]
Um, yes.

[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.940]
I'm on my way to the track.

[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.940]
So I just, you're on your way to the track?

[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.980]
Yeah. So I just thought it stopped by in chat for a moment.

[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.300]
Well, it's sure nice seeing you. Well, yeah, I bet.

[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.520]
There's a reason Alex Bennett's going to be here next week to work with you.

[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.280]
Yes, I know. But that's not what I came by to talk about.

[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.120]
Oh, what can I do a break now first?

[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:05.740]
Of course.

[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.340]
Because I'm sure this is going to take three of us time.

[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.220]
Yes, a great deal.

[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.640]
This is called the All of By portion of the show. And it ought to be very exciting.

[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.120]
Yes.

[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.000]
And I've been re-getting just all these emergency calls at the house.

[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.400]
Me too.

[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.580]
Even Capri to call from out of town yesterday from Seattle again.

[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.540]
And I said, hey, I'm on the other line with an important call.

[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.500]
Although he's threatened to call here today.

[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.860]
I'm not threatened, but he promised to call on the bat line.

[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.040]
I have no idea what he wants.

[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.580]
Well, good. I have something to tell him.

[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.100]
Well, it may not be while you're here if you have to go to the track.

[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.320]
Anyway, it's 11 past 10.

[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.120]
Boy, what a great surprise, huh?

[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.020]
Boy, this ought to be the beginning of a really 12-day.

[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.220]
Okay, let's take that first break, Roger.

[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.640]
When we come back at our start, really heating up to my...

[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.860]
In other words, these people didn't tell you what we were talking about.

[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.040]
Well, they said, yeah, they told me one thing.

[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.640]
Now, who were these people? Anybody out there?

[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.180]
Well, no.

[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:56.940]
No.

[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.900]
It's a good friend of yours called on the show the other day.

[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:00.740]
Well, who is that?

[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.540]
Just a minute. I want to get the card out.

[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.120]
Oh, yes. I know about this.

[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.780]
I was told about this, too, during the day.

[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.080]
Were you?

[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.460]
Yeah.

[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.560]
Boy, those Yantas really were out there.

[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.300]
Unbelievable. I guess it's really...

[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.660]
I was really talking.

[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.600]
Yeah, people are really talking.

[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.780]
I don't know about what.

[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.960]
It's, I don't understand what I have done.

[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.300]
And I would like to address the issues.

[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.020]
I notice nothing has changed.

[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.420]
You still can't find any cards.

[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.540]
Well, I'll find it all right.

[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.580]
You're really searching.

[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.600]
Trust me.

[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.360]
Oh, uh, uh, uh.

[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.600]
Okay. All right. Here we go.

[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.260]
It really is, Irene Richards.

[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.520]
Mm-hmm. One of the legends in the market.

[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.400]
That's correct.

[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.120]
Now, they said that one of your complaints,

[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.900]
maybe the biggest complaint,

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.600]
but this is what the main thrust of what they finally told me,

[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.980]
was that I did not attend the remote on Wednesday.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.200]
Is this the...

[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.860]
Well, I like part of it because this was the week

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.720]
that you were going to be gone

[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.120]
and you had made these specific plans.

[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:03.540]
Remember that?

[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.640]
Yes, they...

[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.700]
They planned the change that you used as usual to do with it.

[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.800]
No, excuse me.

[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.640]
This is my vacation.

[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.020]
Well, yeah.

[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.860]
So I know Marco has booked up for you heavily this time of year.

[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.700]
Then this week, what are you trying?

[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.840]
This is the week they told me to go on vacation.

[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:17.760]
They told you?

[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.400]
Oh, now wait a minute, boy.

[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.620]
It's no, no, no, wait.

[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.080]

[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.160]
Steve came shovel, please.

[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.260]
No. I have said to you to go on vacation this week.

[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.020]
Let me clarify.

[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.060]
This boy Gary was just a smoking at the ears.

[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:30.820]
About what?

[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.220]
About what?

[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.160]
About the fact that you first of all,

[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.000]
when we went to Chicago,

[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.580]
you gave him a lot of crap about that.

[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.720]
And then this week when we had that big thing at the bizarre,

[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.820]
where we had a great turnout,

[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.100]
even without you, it was shocking.

[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.700]
We had a great turnout,

[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.260]
and you pulled the same trick again.

[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.220]
It's not that you want to give you advanced notice

[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.600]
on the 13th of September.

[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.680]
Listen, we're doing a...

[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.800]
I should say I'm doing a remote at specs in North Miami

[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.200]
at a hundred twenty-fourth in this game,

[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.640]
which is only up the road away.

[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.000]
No problem.

[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.940]
Over, in fact, it's not far from Arnold's.

[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.760]
I'm no problem.

[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.700]
That's in Miami.

[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.800]
Let me say this, and I've said this...

[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800]
No, it's in North Miami.

[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.640]
Okay, I've said this over and over and over,

[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.820]
and I'm going to continue to say it until it finally...

[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.040]
I guess registered.

[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.800]
I've said this on...

[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.760]
And then what many times?

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.140]
I know we had all these sightings,

[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.520]
these bird sightings coming in.

[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.600]
I've been in and out of town.

[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:18.360]
Jimmies?

[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.140]
Yeah, I've been in and out of town.

[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.860]
And the Magic 102.7.

[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.980]
I've visited some friends.

[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.040]
And on Tuesday, no less,

[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.880]
Power 96, I think it was.

[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.660]
I stopped by to have dinner with a friend of mine.

[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.460]
Is that okay?

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.560]
Well, I guess,

[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.700]
while I was sitting over there doing that remote,

[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.760]
all by myself,

[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.640]
with Johnny Dark filling his fat face on one side,

[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.240]
in that rich filling,

[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.440]
his even a fatter face.

[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.000]
Let me say this again.

[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.920]
I've said this on and off the air.

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.940]
I'm going to say it again.

[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:46.980]
In March,

[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.040]
Bill Wise pushed and pushed and pushed me

[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.560]
to get my vacation weeks

[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.400]
to register them with Yolanda.

[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.960]
Remember her?

[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.780]
In March, I picked...

[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.380]
I remember Yolanda that got squeezed out

[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.860]
so that boy Gary could bring his body.

[00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.200]

[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.320]
In March,

[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.240]
and also who had had the memos in them.

[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.160]
Two weeks,

[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.240]
which could have been one of the fact that things

[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.660]
in the history of broadcast are really tacky.

[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.400]
In March,

[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.320]
I picked two weeks out of a hat

[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.700]
at random.

[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.240]
You picked him out of a hat virtually wrong.

[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.840]
Would you like me to tell the true story about this?

[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.420]
I picked the weeks that I was going.

[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.120]
As usual, the week following when I go.

[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.060]
That's correct.

[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.760]
In two of my three vacations,

[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.780]
thanks in part to the sales department,

[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.540]
and also thanks in part to the lawyers

[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.440]
and the courts and all this ongoing insanity

[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.740]
with the friend.

[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.700]
I changed two of the three weeks.

[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.740]
My week stayed.

[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.920]
The weeks I picked in March stayed.

[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.560]
Now, the first week...

[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.600]
So in other words, you can't change.

[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.260]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.340]
Don't say that.

[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.560]
There was no reason to change.

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.540]
I mean, if you can't change.

[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.240]
No one asked me to change.

[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.820]
They didn't ask you about going to Chicago.

[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.420]
No.

[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.800]
They asked, well, he told me about the remote.

[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.480]
The birds of a liar.

[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.660]
I went home, I checked the dates,

[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.560]
I went back and I said,

[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.720]
I'm going to be with a gone on vacation, they said fine.

[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.860]
Now, that Chicago remote was decided to date on while you were in Europe.

[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.300]
I picked this week in March.

[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.560]
Now, this week, they said,

[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.660]
they came to me and they said,

[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.400]
we have a remote,

[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.680]
August, whatever it was.

[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.200]
I went home, I checked.

[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:17.960]
Yes, 23rd.

[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:18.960]
Yes, 23rd.

[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.100]
I went home, I checked the dates,

[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.480]
and I should have brought the papers.

[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.640]
They did you were over at magic,

[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.020]
schmuzing around with Joe Johnson?

[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:24.400]
No.

[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.560]
It was not that day.

[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.320]
It was the day before I was at magic.

[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.220]
Oh, the day you were at power 96.

[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:30.980]
Same day.

[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:31.720]
Schmuzing around.

[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.420]
To some radio yentos over there, yeah.

[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.880]
I stopped by to visit some friends.

[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.860]
I thought it was okay.

[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.620]
I thought it was allowed.

[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.760]
It would have been in this station.

[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.560]
You were on another station,

[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.520]
which even made it like...

[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.120]
I'm working.

[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.440]
Rubbing salt into the wound.

[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.320]
No, it isn't.

[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.200]
It was something...

[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.420]
It was my vacation.

[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.000]
Related to.

[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.480]
I wasn't working.

[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.400]
It was my vacation.

[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:48.860]
I was.

[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.660]
Now, you told me something in June.

[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.240]
And if you rack your memory,

[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.920]
you may remember, you told me,

[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.300]
the birds of Lyre,

[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.520]
that when I go on vacation,

[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.380]
I should go,

[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.120]
and I should forget about work,

[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.600]
and I should have a wonderful time,

[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.180]
and I shouldn't worry about anything.

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.240]
So that's what I did this week.

[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.800]
I went.

[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.500]
I had a wonderful time.

[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.940]
I totally forgot about WIOD,

[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.500]
which is what you told me to do.

[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.740]
I did not even realize it was Wednesday.

[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.020]
If you want to know the truth,

[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.520]
I did not think anything about work.

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.900]
You didn't realize what was Wednesday.

[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.460]
I didn't even realize it was Wednesday,

[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.400]
or there was any...

[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.920]
I didn't think about this place.

[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.660]
I did not listen to the show.

[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.400]
I've been out of touch.

[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.900]
I did what you told me to do.

[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.340]
I went on my vacation.

[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.600]
And now,

[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.340]
because I did what you do,

[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.920]
I hear that you're on your side,

[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.020]
and you're saying horrible things about it.

[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.860]
No, not horrible things, truth things.

[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.100]
What are you saying?

[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.780]
That you shine this again.

[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.320]
And we desperately needed you to be there.

[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.180]
We'll be a part of the show.

[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.360]
You shine this and shows rather...

[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.340]
I mean, if you had been over in Marco

[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.960]
enjoying the sunshine and relaxing

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.540]
and being oblivious to what's going on,

[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.040]
anybody could understand that.

[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.460]
Anybody could relate to that.

[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.920]
I did not...

[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.060]
But being here,

[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.060]
like within a stone's throw,

[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:12.920]
I was in Kendall's...

[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.580]
I was in Kendall, I'm going to go...

[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.580]
Oh, I'm going to go to Fort Lauderdale and work.

[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.060]
On my vacation week?

[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.700]
Do you do that kind of thing though?

[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.540]
On your vacation week?

[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.960]
But sometimes, for example,

[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.100]
the reason I didn't take two weeks to go off

[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.620]
was because of the litigation that's going on to go to court.

[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.780]
The reason I didn't take this week off

[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.100]
was because we had the remote...

[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.220]
No, the bizarre.

[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.900]
Nobody said anything to me about that.

[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.460]
Let me say it again.

[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.840]
Now, could I have taken this week off?

[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.240]
Well, we had a remote that we had signed up weeks and weeks ago.

[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.060]
Could we have done that?

[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.080]
We?

[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.380]
Could I have done that?

[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.900]
Sure show.

[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.300]
So, why could it just shine those nice people over there at the bizarre?

[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.220]
We had a great turnout.

[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.920]
The people who run the place are great.

[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.620]
And little Tommy Denenberg,

[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.720]
we sure wouldn't want to ruffle his feathers.

[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.060]
Isn't the conference saying you were going to do your show

[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.760]
from the bizarre?

[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.400]
And it said not one word about me.

[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.560]
Not one word about me.

[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:01.560]

[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:08.900]
Because you'd already planned this insidious act in subordination.

[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.140]
There's a trocity of insidious nature.

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:12.580]
Yeah.

[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.220]
But I want to talk more about it.

[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.580]
Well, after we talked about Toyota of Hollywood,

[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.120]
where he also was insidious,

[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.120]
and I was treated...

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.320]
Many of the people in our wonderful,

[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.380]
proud, as tied,

[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.880]
like some kind of subhuman...

[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.860]
Kind of the same way he treated Jim Scholar,

[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.600]
who used to be at Hot 105.

[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.220]
You're right about that.

[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.520]
He two summers ago.

[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.180]
Oh, that's correct.

[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.780]
And the shine...

[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.500]
The turning is back and treating him just like some kind of sewer rat.

[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.200]
But anyway, one thing about the bird,

[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.340]
at least he's consistent.

[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.960]
It may not be good, but he's consistent.

[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.040]
And they're consistent at Toyota of Hollywood

[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.560]
and giving you the best deals in town.

[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.780]
And this weekend,

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.960]
be a good time for you to get your little fanny over there

[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.120]
and check out the incredibly low prices

[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.380]
on those beautiful new 89 Toyota.

[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.160]
You know that every dealer in the country right now

[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.940]
is telling folks, and honestly,

[00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.800]
in fact, some of the dealers,

[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.760]
it's the first honest thing they've said for years,

[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.740]
but with Toyota of Hollywood,

[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.880]
they don't play those kind of games.

[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.500]
But the bottom line is they all have to move out the 89's

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.500]
that they have on the lot to make room for the 1990's

[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.540]
that are coming in a just a matter of weeks.

[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.580]
So you're going to find prices slashed.

[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.960]
You'll find the same great service in the same great folks

[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.780]
to do business with.

[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.040]
And right across the street,

[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.900]
a course over on the west side of 441,

[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.200]
you'll find a tremendous selection of really great

[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.760]
reconditioned use cars too.

[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.180]
It's all waiting for you at Toyota of Hollywood,

[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.900]
the southeast number one Toyota dealer.

[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.360]
And you'll find them at 1841 North State Road 7 in Hollywood.

[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.300]
What is this from? Is this from the,

[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.580]
oh, it's from the Sun Sentinel?

[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.120]
Does somebody just fact to us?

[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.780]
Oh, look at this.

[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.820]
Here's another great fact.

[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.700]
It says the donut guy is not one person, but two.

[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.920]
David, ex-manager of the Bird Road donut store

[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.800]
and Tom fired from the Tammy Amy Trail store.

[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.380]
Did you know that blanks has gone out,

[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.240]
I'm not going to mention your name.

[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.100]
They've gone out of business a few months now.

[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:01.980]
They've been out of business.

[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:02.460]
Huh.

[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.480]
Fascinating.

[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.920]
It said so to other places that were owned by the same company.

[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.660]
David is from Iowa and Tom from Miami.

[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.580]
And if they didn't spend all day trying to call you,

[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.440]
their stores might still be in business.

[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.140]
Anyway, they're both douchebags.

[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.840]
Tom once called the Steve King show and said,

[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.040]
oh, geez, I'm not going to repeat that.

[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.220]
The donut stores are auctioned off today

[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.960]
by a company appointed by the court.

[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.340]
Isn't that fascinating?

[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.300]
Now I know why we never, didn't fact reach

[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.200]
though one time go into that donut plane?

[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.380]
I saw the guy calling.

[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.060]
Remember?

[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.600]
And how long does it say that they've been out of business?

[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.840]
For a few months, you know.

[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.900]
It's like it's like it's possible.

[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:45.600]
Sure.

[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.320]
The other thing is a wanted, a personal from the Sun Sentinel.

[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.200]
This is incredible.

[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.320]
It doesn't have any names.

[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.380]
Broadcasting male executive.

[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.020]
Divorced 65, 45, I think that says,

[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.500]
or six college graduate.

[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.800]
Excellent above average income.

[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.600]
Likes rainy nights, beautiful sunsets, travel,

[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.320]
kids, dogs, Disney World, Epcot.

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.420]
Long weekends in San Francisco, late night talks,

[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.760]
jazz, old movies, new ideas, museums, zoos, and cheers.

[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.460]
There's something I can't, uh, family activities

[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.880]
and much more would like to meet a young woman, 30 to 40,

[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.760]
who is sincere, kind, honest, genuine,

[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.760]
and tired of being alone.

[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:28.720]
Children welcome.

[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.420]
If you're interested in meeting a down-to-worth man

[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.700]
with big shoulders to lean on during good times in bed,

[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.140]
and you'd like to be cherished, loved, pampered, and spoiled,

[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.260]
we should chat sometime soon.

[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.100]
Please, no drugs, heavy alcohol use for those

[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.740]
with emotional baggage from previous relationships,

[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.380]
replies to box, et cetera.

[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.100]
Think it's someone we know?

[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.540]
I don't know. Well, six, five.

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.000]
Sounds like a monster in the business.

[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.700]
Oh, my God, speaking of a monster in the business,

[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.840]
isn't this an incredible coincidence on the bat line

[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.920]
from Seattle, Washington, ladies, and gentlemen?

[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.200]
Good morning.

[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.100]
Or is it afternoon over there?

[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.200]
Well, it's funny you should call right at this moment

[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.340]
because we have a surprise visitor in the studio

[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.180]
who came in to visit us on the last day of his vacation this week

[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.120]
on his way to the track.

[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.180]
Who's that?

[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.160]
Well, somebody that you know and love.

[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.400]
Ah.

[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.340]
A good friend of Irene Richard.

[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.400]
George Boy.

[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:25.820]
Ah.

[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.620]
Is that the any clue?

[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.860]
I haven't had, oh, not at all.

[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:32.340]
No.

[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.620]
A good friend of Irene Richard?

[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.180]
Yeah, well, I've just been a little sarcastic.

[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.800]
Oh, glam?

[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:38.640]
Yeah.

[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:39.600]
Ah.

[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.880]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.860]
Against the latest accusation.

[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.040]
And yours also.

[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.200]
One yours too, isn't it?

[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.500]
Well, it's not going to be great.

[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.140]
I was just sitting here just trying to kill four hours.

[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.420]
Little did I realize that we were going to have this kind of level of intensity today.

[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.060]
This is great.

[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.000]
It is intense.

[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.860]
I'm confused.

[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.620]
You might even have to skip the track today and just stay here.

[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.100]
No, no.

[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.720]
Take you on for the whole four hours.

[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:08.880]
Oh, what's left of it?

[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.200]
Well, we'll go over to Keenshow.

[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.500]
But that could be.

[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.660]
Uncle Neil told me...

[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.360]
Uncle Neil told me, related to me, a tie-rate you threw against me about a week ago.

[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:22.400]
A pretty short story.

[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.420]
That rich said that the birds are liar.

[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.040]
A tie-rate about what?

[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:26.620]
About me.

[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.440]
I'm a tie-rate.

[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.380]
That's what he said.

[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.160]
And you tore into me.

[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.060]
I thought to start backing off here.

[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.480]
I'm not, but I'm trying to remember what you're talking about.

[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.380]
What that I was pissed at you because you're telling people I got fired and I rape little children.

[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:40.880]
No?

[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.460]
Well, he didn't say you got fired.

[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.480]
Oh, he did?

[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:54.700]
Dave, I have never, to my knowledge, said anything negative concerning you that I know of.

[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.080]
Well, that's it.

[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.700]
Now I can tell you right now, that's the lie.

[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.120]
I mean, that's incredible.

[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.540]
Well, you have said right in that chair over there, what you don't dare to sit in today and said that.

[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.780]
And ripped this man an ass to lunch, which I have still to eat.

[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.400]
I don't just a lot of garbage.

[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.360]
No, I have not.

[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.560]
Oh, trust me.

[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:20.000]
When he was on that morning show at that unmechanable station, about stealing ideas and, oh, just on.

[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.300]
Oh, didn't we ever resolve that?

[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.420]
Doing those talk-ups that Johnny Dark invented the idea.

[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.440]
Come on, let's cut the crap.

[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.060]
But let's have a little bit of honesty here, at least for a moment.

[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.740]
Yeah, really?

[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.640]
I'm an honest person.

[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.600]
I don't lie.

[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.780]
I've reached said that the birds are liar.

[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.520]
I just say you were actually lying just that you get a lot of misinformation in you.

[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.580]
In other words, the old thing about if you say something often enough, you start to believe it.

[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.320]
No.

[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:47.580]

[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:48.900]
That's the ad.

[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.420]
You start believing your own BS.

[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.620]
That's true.

[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:52.260]
Yeah.

[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.020]
Well, no.

[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.140]
I don't know what it is.

[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.100]
It's just that it's not a matter of lying.

[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.000]
It's just that you say something and then you start to believe it's true and you start to talk about it on the air.

[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.620]
It's not a false of you.

[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.080]
You just can't control himself, I think.

[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.580]
I mean, you know, the bottom line is who cares.

[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.120]
Exactly.

[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.460]
A hundred years from now, nobody will give a damn, right?

[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:17.340]
Well, I mean, the fact that he was in town, he was supposed to be at Marko Island on vacation this week and he left me to do a remote at the Bizarre up in Fort Lauderdale all by myself on Wednesday,

[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.240]
which somehow I managed to squeak through.

[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.740]
And the meantime, he was in town here, smoothing around with his buddies over at Magic.

[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.740]
I was on vacation.

[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.220]
I was on vacation making a tour of the local radio station.

[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.620]
No, I visited a couple of friends.

[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.420]
Kind of like Johnny Stark, you know, these people.

[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.660]
I visited a couple of friends with Mobile Alana Bama and they visit broadcasting studios, you know.

[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.200]
No, I had to talk about it this evening.

[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.340]
I had to take Joe Johnson a videotape.

[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.060]
Oh, boy.

[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.220]
And Rick Peters was there and Yelton was there.

[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.500]
Oh, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy.

[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.800]
What does that say?

[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.220]
It says pluck the bird.

[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.060]
Oh, anyway, I thought it was a glad you asked for it.

[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:57.560]
Allowable.

[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.120]
I thought it was allowable on vacation when I had some time, Dave, because I was in and out of town.

[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.400]
I wasn't in Marcos long as I planned to be and I thought it was allowable to visit some friends when I had some time.

[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.780]
It's course night. It's not when you're in radio.

[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.920]
And I did not think I had to go to work while I was on vacation.

[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.520]
This is my big crime, Dave.

[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.300]
Now, there's the fact that you're calling from Seattle boat well.

[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.560]
Does this mean that you're working?

[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.160]
Oh, yes, yes.

[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.440]
Oh, well, thank because I never heard from you again.

[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.360]
Now, I was at home a few nights ago.

[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.660]
I was actually what happened just a minute now.

[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.020]
I was here in the daytime and Nick gave me a message that the manager of the station in Seattle had called,

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.400]
and said if Caprita calls you, meaning me, give him this message.

[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:44.660]
And just by coincidence, like some kind of a psychic vibration, that night I was watching the Cubs game or something and the low and behold,

[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.880]
here's Caprita on the phone and I gave him the message.

[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.760]
He sounded depressed.

[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.540]
He was hundreds of miles in the middle of nowhere, driving around aimlessly in the middle of the night,

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.420]
wondering what the hell was life was going to be.

[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.760]
And one in the middle of the night.

[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.180]
It was afternoon and Oregon.

[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.100]
Well, like I said, I can lie with the best of them too.

[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.820]
And anyway, it's so weird to hear you guys on the radio.

[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:04.860]
Doesn't it sound better though?

[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.020]
You're driving around the middle of the night.

[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.320]
It's raining and your windshield wipers are broken.

[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.920]
And you don't know whether to scream or eat a banana.

[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.240]
And all of a sudden, you get this message from me and you call a guy and he gave you the job.

[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:15.140]
Right?

[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.760]
It was a real crazy.

[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.960]
I must admit that I am touchlessly left pretty quickly.

[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.060]
And what was that?

[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.440]
That's my traffic person.

[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.940]
Oh, are you on the air?

[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.240]
Yeah, it's 730 here.

[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.700]
But you're not on the air.

[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.840]
So anyway, it's...

[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.640]
Are you on the air?

[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.700]
Yeah, I'm on the air.

[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.060]
I got to put you on hold for a second.

[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.060]
Well, we got to do a break.

[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.300]
Okay, well, I do too.

[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:36.880]
Hold on.

[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.780]
Okay, hold on.

[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.060]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.620]
Now, see, he won't put us on the air.

[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.480]
They're not ready for this show.

[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:44.900]
I'm Seattle.

[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.280]
Okay, we have an open-line in Palm Beach.

[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.640]
I have no idea why I'm saying that because we're never going to get you on the air.

[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.480]
But I wanted to look good for our visitor in the studio.

[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.220]
655WYOD.

[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.620]
And we'll come right back.

[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.960]
Okay, it's 1038 at WID's.

[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.160]
Our celebrity caller back.

[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.060]
He's not back.

[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.880]
Is he on the air really, to think?

[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.020]
Or is he just probably calling in a phone booth?

[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.660]
He's got a couple of friends standing outside.

[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.100]
You know, making guttural sounds and making sounds of a helicopter

[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.120]
for the traffic.

[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.680]
You know, trying to make it sound like he's working again.

[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.440]
I don't think he's working.

[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.220]
Anyway, Caprito, be back on the line any second.

[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.440]
We want to remind you, of course, so we don't want to forget about that ballgame that I cheesed.

[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.160]
I wasn't even aware.

[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.440]
We know that the bird will be listening.

[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.180]
Ha ha ha.

[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.600]
Hang on.

[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.500]
Hair-free words.

[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.900]
The Dolphins ad Washington.

[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.300]
Oh.

[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.760]
And the boy, am I glad I'm not going to be here next week, so I don't have to listen to all the

[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.100]
effecting and carrying on.

[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.840]
Okay, it's just an exhibition game, all right?

[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.340]
Oh, good.

[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.360]
So after the Redskins score their fourth or fifth touchdown in the first quarter,

[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.420]
I don't want you to start getting all upset and sorely.

[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.660]
You just stick right with it, okay?

[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.700]
Just hanging there and be a real fan as only people in this town can do.

[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.420]
Well, I don't know if he's ever coming back.

[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.740]
Well, these districts.

[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.060]
Because we had a three minute...

[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:01.640]
Oh, there he is.

[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.720]
So what's going on?

[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.220]
I heard him breathing on the other end of the phone, which is a good sign.

[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.020]
Now, are you really on the air?

[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.080]
Yeah.

[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.060]
What are you doing?

[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.740]
You playing music?

[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.660]
Yeah, it's kind of like the wave, the breeze, the wind, whatever they call themselves now.

[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.440]
The breeze?

[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.380]
You know, like, what's the station down there that does that?

[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.300]
The stiff breeze.

[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.160]
Yeah.

[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.120]
Mostly stiff.

[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.880]
They were the breeze and they were the wave, not in the breeze again.

[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.900]
Yeah, now they're the white tornado.

[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.540]
The hurricane.

[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.460]
Where the one that Jim Kelly works on.

[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.580]
Oh, is he over there?

[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.180]
Yeah, does he?

[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.380]
Well, did you stop by and see him?

[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:32.760]
No.

[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.760]
Oh, well, today would be a good day to stop by and see Jim Kelly.

[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.140]
See if he's still wearing that leather jacket.

[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.660]
At motorcycle jacket.

[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.900]
Well, that's not brought back from Amsterdam.

[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.300]
I heard a bunch of talk radio driving out here and up through California.

[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.240]
How better it was great.

[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:59.960]
I heard maybe one or two that was listenable and the rest was just, it just reminds me how we used to make fun of the people that talked about, you know, what's the matter with your train or plumbing or, you know, really pertinent topics like that.

[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.540]
Yeah, or like the Maggreenshow.

[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.280]
Yeah.

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.800]
But KGO and San Francisco sounded good.

[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.360]
They had a couple of guys that sounded pretty good.

[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.060]
No, they don't.

[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.500]
I've heard KGO and San Francisco own span and all those other really boring guys.

[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.540]
They don't say too much.

[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.600]
They're not pretty exciting.

[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.260]
Well, that was the point I was getting at.

[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:18.740]
Is that...

[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.240]
It sound good, but they don't say anything.

[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:28.140]
I just can't, I mean, you living in Miami, it seems like a big city like San Francisco would really use a talk show.

[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.780]
I don't want anything to do with San Francisco.

[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.440]
It's just, just in a road test, the weather is awful.

[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.400]
It's cold as hell.

[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.420]
Kind of like Seattle.

[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:35.920]
Oh, it's beautiful here.

[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.980]
There are rains every day and it's really cold and it never gets over 65.

[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.700]
I don't go for that kind of stuff.

[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.080]
What do you get?

[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:47.320]
I get up about 5 and it's kind of foggy and about 50 something and then by the afternoon it's beautiful over here.

[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.360]
And 62.

[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.560]
If you say it'll be about 72 today.

[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.680]
72, holy Toledo.

[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.460]
Yes, they're having a heat wave in Seattle.

[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.440]
I've never been in Seattle, but everybody says it's a great place.

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.420]
Of course, they said the same thing about this place too.

[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.780]
I guess that, by the way, I have the September Money Magazine out today.

[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.220]
Hold on, hold on.

[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.680]
Kill some time with this.

[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.360]
Well, we can, we can't hold on.

[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.200]
You can hold on, but we have a show to do here.

[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:10.940]
Okay, Caprita?

[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.440]
Seattle's the number one study.

[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:12.860]
Amazing.

[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.360]
The number one, yeah, it's just by there.

[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.260]
That's why I brought this out.

[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.160]
This is the top 300 places to live compared with last year.

[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:18.560]
Yeah.

[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:19.600]
By their name.

[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.640]
And number one, this is the Readers of Money Magazine.

[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.540]
Number one is Seattle.

[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.000]
Right.

[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.080]
Last year, number 11.

[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.620]
And the Danbury, Connecticut last year was number one.

[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.660]
This year dropped to number two and wouldn't you know it?

[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.600]
San Francisco last year was number five and this way up to number three on the hit parade.

[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.920]
So I guess that tells what kind of people they talked to for the survey.

[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.060]
What, what now?

[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.940]
Now this is the survey in Money Magazine and it's got Seattle listed as the number one place to live in a country.

[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.820]
This is a survey of their readers.

[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.880]
It's supposed to be the best place to have a hard attack.

[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.980]
Up from number 11 last year, number one on the hit parade with a bullet.

[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.620]
They got like about a dozen Northwest cities on that list.

[00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:02.520]
Miami is number 75 down or up from 111 last year right behind Rochester, New York is a matter of fact.

[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:08.080]
I got up the other day I was really getting homesick thinking about everybody and about Miami.

[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.240]
How much I missed it.

[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:13.820]
And then I did this news break and the first story was about that about Seattle being number one.

[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.060]
And the last story was about South Florida being the number one place where toilets break down.

[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.780]
And all of a sudden things started falling into perspective and I felt a little better.

[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.920]
Number 187 is West Palm Beach.

[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.040]
Wow.

[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.480]
Number 120 is Fort Walton Beach.

[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.800]
I'm looking for Fort Lauderdale.

[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.360]
I had the thing on there yesterday but it's way down the list.

[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.200]
Fort Walton's world as fat people live.

[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:34.560]
Yeah.

[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.440]
No that's Tamarack.

[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.200]
That's Dick Gregory and all of the fat people live there.

[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.320]
Dick Gregory?

[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.180]
Yeah the guy he's making the comedian who helps people lose weight.

[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.560]
Oh I thought you meant he was fat.

[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.840]
He weighs about 40 pounds.

[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:54.320]
Bradenton is 172 and where the hell is Fort Lauderdale?

[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.040]
I know it's on here somewhere but it's way way way down the list.

[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.700]
286 is Pokipsi, New York.

[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.340]
Wow.

[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.900]
And 289 is Jackson Michigan.

[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.460]
Isn't there some place near Detroit is the last one?

[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.020]
No he's Detroit did very well this time.

[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.840]
47 up from 71 so I know this is full of baloney.

[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.880]
No the very last one number 300 is a city that's near Detroit.

[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.640]
Oh the last one?

[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.560]
Oh Benton Harbor.

[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.000]
No that's on a West Coast of Michigan.

[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.680]
That's way across.

[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.380]
Yeah that's a horrible place.

[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.220]
Everybody's got to work.

[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.880]
It's like a city that's out of business.

[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.160]
It is.

[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:33.700]
But anyway enough of this small talk let's get back to the real purpose of this call and let's get right back to the nitty gritty.

[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.440]
Well I'm looking out this window this is great.

[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:43.020]
If it's kind of foggy in the morning I'm overlooking the Puget Sound and way off in the distance in the mist of these mountains.

[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.640]
And then it clears up and it's really beautiful here in the afternoon.

[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.260]
Great.

[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.180]
But I did get kind of homesick and all but it's working here.

[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:55.120]
No you don't get homesick for the colon and for that insipid morning show.

[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.740]
You know that nobody's even talking about that station anymore.

[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.520]
They don't even rip it anymore.

[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.180]
That's how obscurity's now.

[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.740]
Nobody even remembers that it's on the air.

[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:04.920]
Oh God.

[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.920]
Just give them a break.

[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.100]
The colonel is a great guy.

[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.180]
I'd like to work with him.

[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.440]
Oh man okay you try to get into the same league with the bird now is that it?

[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:13.880]
What is that?

[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.460]
Birds of Lyre.

[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.060]
What is it?

[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:15.740]
Oh I see.

[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.140]
Yeah.

[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.280]
We'll draw you a map.

[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.040]
I see.

[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.600]
So is there any parting words that you want for your friend here?

[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:28.380]
No just a party back in town in a few weeks I've still got all my stuff there and my pussy cat is still down there.

[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.000]
Magic.

[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.740]
Yeah magic still down there.

[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.800]
It seems like you've mellowed against me Dave which is good.

[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.720]
I don't think so.

[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:37.880]
I think he hates you with a passion.

[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.160]
I just needed to put on a good act.

[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.180]
I just don't understand you sometimes some of the things that you have.

[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:46.520]
Some of the vicious low shots, some of the cheap shots and the vicious behavior.

[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.280]
You know I don't have any animosity toy.

[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.420]
Well you know it's funny you should say that because somebody called yesterday when he wasn't here and said the same thing.

[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.280]
It really is I reenriched.

[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.900]
Is that an incredible?

[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.760]
I'm sorry I missed that.

[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.100]
Yeah.

[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.100]
It's really sorry you weren't here to chat with her for a while.

[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.020]
I miss them.

[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.620]
I want to play that on the radio.

[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.260]
Yeah.

[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.520]
I'll be happy to send you your own copy when I come back from vacation and a week after next.

[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.240]
Okay well I'll see you guys hopefully in a few weeks then.

[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.280]
You'll see us?

[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.120]
I'm going to be down there for a few days.

[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:17.880]
Really?

[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.600]
You're going to come in here on the show?

[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.080]
Well I'll cause these stills and Nash.

[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.340]
The show is going to be there.

[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:29.400]
Wouldn't that be something Boy, Captain Dave came in on the show live in the studio and will feed him like old times.

[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.420]
Boy it would be great.

[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.760]
I missed all that food.

[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.120]
Yeah.

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.620]
You missed the food didn't miss us.

[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.360]
We know what it's all about.

[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.000]
It's great.

[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.120]
Okay say hi to all our pals up there in Seattle and all those big market radio people and.

[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.700]
There was someone I was going to tell you about I forgot what it was.

[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.560]
Well it had to be real.

[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.140]
You're probably right.

[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:45.660]
Is on a letter.

[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.200]
You know on a post.

[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.580]
My grandmother said it must have been a lie if I forgot.

[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.240]
That's correct and don't forget and close the birds of liar.

[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.820]
Okay we'll talk to you soon.

[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.200]
Okay.

[00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:00.760]
Isn't that something Dave Caprita on the bad line to expose you for the douchebag that we all know you are.

[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.240]
What are you talking about?

[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.760]
You realize that I could kill the entire show after you go to the track.

[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:11.100]
Look at that 285 Lyma Ohio down from 284 last year.

[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.380]
Melbourne Florida from 247 all the way to 236.

[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.160]
How do you like that?

[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.880]
Now what is this?

[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.580]
I don't uh...

[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.220]
Sold my dog.

[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.200]
That's cute.

[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.360]
Oh sold me my dog.

[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.340]
Okay I thought she was and oh a call from Captain Jimmy's.

[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.160]
You think we ought to call him on the air?

[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:32.800]
Why not?

[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:40.460]
Okay let's do our last break of the hour for neutral system here and then when we come back we're going to talk to the people of Captain Jimmy's and get it right from the horses.

[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.320]
I have nothing to hide.

[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.140]
Were you in there this week?

[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:44.480]

[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:49.740]
Anyway I thought about neutral system like so many people...

[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.520]
What was that?

[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.280]
Did you hear that?

[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.200]
No I don't know what the hell that was.

[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.940]
Anyway Becky has lost 20 you know Becky she lost 20 pounds already on neutral system.

[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:07.160]
It's just amazing that this building which when we came to work here was like leaning like the tower of pizza from all the weight and it was about ready to tilt.

[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.520]
And now it's kind of leveled off a little bit because there's so many people who have lost so much weight.

[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:17.080]
Sonny Hersh is down 30 pounds on neutral system and Fat Rich believe it or not is over the 70 pound mark.

[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:30.040]
He looks like a shadow of his former selves and you can do it too and the good news you better do it today because this is the last day today to take advantage of the unheard of discount that they're offering a neutral system this week only 50% off.

[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:37.620]
On your new neutral system program but you got to do it now because once the beginning and next week comes it's going to be back to the regular price.

[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:44.880]
So call them right now and start shedding those disgusting unwanted grotesque ugly pounds of flab and flim and garbage.

[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:52.040]
Okay call 1-800-344-thin you call neutral system right now 1-800-344-thin.

[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:02.040]
You know I really can't find for a lot of day on this list it's got the 300 cities here wouldn't that be embarrassing?

[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.280]
Start at the bottom.

[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:15.000]
Look at that the bottom three are all in Michigan Benton Harbor Flint and Jackson Michigan and Battle Creek is 295 so of the last six cities for them are in Michigan.

[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.500]
You'll ever guess what number 294 is Atlantic City.

[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:30.680]
Wow a horrendous place and I told me oh man what a toilet that I told me I don't buy this though boy Elvis would Elvis be upset if he saw this number 275 down 30 points from last year.

[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.440]
Kalamazoo.

[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.540]
They're nuts Kalamazoo is a great town.

[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.380]
Okay let's give this a try now just a second fine.

[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:46.960]
Wait a minute I have to dial one I'm in Dave County and it's pretty exciting I try to forget that I'm in Dave County when I come to work every day.

[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.080]
It's 1051 at WIOD we're going to get to the bottom of this mystery if it kills us.

[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.060]
Yeah what a nice keep there please.

[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.700]
A neo-Rajas at WIOD we're on the air.

[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:58.780]
Sure.

[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.400]
There you go.

[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.640]
Touch this up here.

[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.760]
I'm not quoting my source on this because it could create a lot of problems.

[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.440]
I know but somebody was told not to say anything about it.

[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.120]
Really?

[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.020]
Somebody you know let the proverbial cat out of the bag.

[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.260]
Okay now is this a crime keep there?

[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.680]
Is this a crime?

[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.680]
Right could I just talk to the cat again?

[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.940]
Let's not start with all of this you know butt licking here.

[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.000]
Let's try to get to the bottom.

[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.100]
In other words while he was supposed to be at Marco Island vacationing.

[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.300]
So the whole thing wasn't a huge thing.

[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:38.180]
While he was leaving me in the lurch at that remote on the Wednesday while Nick was putting all those crank calls on one after the other.

[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.640]
You see Mark didn't even know he was on vacation.

[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.360]
Mark had less than a few days and he didn't know bird was away.

[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:44.800]
Mark.

[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.180]
No he just didn't think anything over.

[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:46.680]
Right.

[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.940]
So well yeah nothing was he sneaked into places where people wouldn't realize that he was shining us.

[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.340]
Yeah.

[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:54.320]
Shining you.

[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.580]
Now let me have...

[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.240]
Yeah thank you easy for you to say.

[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.580]
Okay ten fifty five at WI.

[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.220]
Yeah I wonder.

[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.540]
I think we've gotten to it finally.

[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.280]
Not a lot.

[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:14.040]
Well there seems to have been something said to you by management that is about what?

[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.020]
About this vacation week.

[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.680]
Not true.

[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.540]
Well then what are you talking about?

[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.000]
They came to me and they said there's a remote.

[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.420]
How long did I say that I don't want to go do that remote alone.

[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.800]
I said it in Denver on Monday and I said it again on Tuesday and I said it in previous weeks.

[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:36.140]
It would be much better if there's something set up over there so that either you're going to be here or there's somebody there.

[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.640]
Because all these people were coming up to the table to sign pictures.

[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.100]
Yes.

[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.480]
And as I tried to explain it.

[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:42.400]
What do you mean yes?

[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:43.120]
How do you know that?

[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.600]
I thought you said you weren't listening.

[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:45.820]
I wasn't listening.

[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.900]
Oh well anyway I believe you.

[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.440]
Oh okay.

[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.260]
That's good.

[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.240]
All these people were coming up for me to sign pictures and then the jingle would play and the break would end.

[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.100]
We come back on the air and all of a sudden they all had emergencies and they all had to go home.

[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.560]
So I'm writing good luck.

[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.660]
I'm your uncle best wishes near Raj.

[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:14.100]
He's all these other stupid messages and there's like lulls and of course your friend Johnny dark who was sitting there in front of a microphone pretending that he was in who would Jonesy for your job.

[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.460]
He wasn't adding anything.

[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.220]
All he was doing was filling his fat face every time I turned my head.

[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.940]
He was eating pizza which I never even got to taste the pizza.

[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:29.260]
And he was eating hot dogs and cookies and everything that was in sight because we were right in the food court there at the bizarre.

[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:29.660]
Okay.

[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.160]
I understand what you said.

[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:36.540]
I mean I do want you to understand that we had a tremendous turn out of the show and find so they tell me I didn't like all the dead air.

[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.740]
I didn't like that part of it.

[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.340]
Now it seems.

[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.360]
Although that wasn't your fault.

[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.700]
That was Tom Denenberg's fault.

[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.220]
They because generally speaking he's a moron.

[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.940]
But they never I'm telling them.

[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:51.460]
And when I came in this morning he or somebody had a big thing up there on the wall under the clock that said the cubs suck.

[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.880]
It was not this that isn't enough to make you speechless.

[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.300]
I would.

[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:57.600]
It was.

[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:04.300]
Yeah. It was not discussed with me about postponing my vacation which I probably would have been open to.

[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.860]
If it had been brought up to me.

[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:16.360]
How am I supposed to know this if it was well you have a lot of people who are a lot of a vultures out there who are just gathering around preparing for your demise.

[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.460]
I'll tell you that right now because.

[00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:22.750]
Well I don't know because they hate your guts or something I don't have any I don't have any knowledge of this.

[00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:29.690]
I've been done anything you out you must have done something because you have a lot of people that are just ready to dance on your proverbial grave.

[00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:34.170]
Why I don't know you'd have to ask fat rate I mean have to ask some of these people who are.

[00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:40.930]
Just the apoplectic with you just the second tired of your people you know like fat like people you know.

[00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:46.770]
He's upset with everybody's up to build call to his upset with you.

[00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:55.270]
I didn't do anything to that riches upset with you like like like worse than management I think management of course is upset with you.

[00:42:55.410 --> 00:43:02.510]
They think that you're just some kind of a total waste of space but other than that everybody's okay.

[00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.550]
You know what it seemed at the remote where you talk about the would have been cheering.

[00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:12.470]
Sharon thinks that you ought to be boiled in oil is no question about that as he just walked in there so I made it up.

[00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:21.730]
I know I could have been there to help at the remote it seems like Alex Bennett boy is just foaming at the mouth wait till next week I'm sure glad I'm not going to be here for that.

[00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:34.890]
Do you know who Alex Bennett is no I don't either everybody else seems to have no idea he just got fired in San Francisco and he evidently does a real filthy show which is just exactly what we need I think so.

[00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:40.910]
I don't know what he does I really don't have to got any idea what he does he's old he's about 182.

[00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:43.970]
Good so you can relate to him.

[00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:52.170]
It seems like I would have been there you got a lot of calls here when we come back because I made a lot of comments.

[00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.730]

[00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:57.810]
He's got the bad one so if he wants to call in after the news and see what I would certainly be about.

[00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:09.590]
Well I don't want to expose his confidentiality at all because he's a good guy but he's also getting a little carried away and he's becoming a divisive and creating a lot of animosity and having the upset and hysterical.

[00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:26.690]
Yeah I think I just saw Fort Lauderdale on the list here somewhere there is 113 up from 123 so it's not so bad Henry Barrow standing by the great expert on the dolphins of course Henry is not going to be permitted to go with the team on the bus or even the shower with the guys after the game.

[00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:37.550]
And he's going to tell you why along with the 11 o'clock news and then we'll come back at 11.05 Steve with open phones and don't forget the dolphin express in the pregame festivity start many many hours before the game.

never got near the microphone before Cortotta arrived Ciderman

[00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.030]
listened intently to Richmond solo interview with Hostied Cain

[00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:25.010]
in case something has said that is totally erroneous in the

[00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:29.410]
building this is he was here in the building Mr. Ciderman Ciderman

[00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.930]
state put despite repeated demands from W.I.O.D. executive

[00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:36.510]
producer Sharon Mahoney that he leave the premises she finally

[00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:39.790]
pleaded to several people in a hallway someone helped me get rid of

[00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:43.830]
Ciderman please after a tense confrontation before reporters

[00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:48.310]
Ciderman finally left he wasn't pleased and by the way Sharon

[00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:51.750]
don't call me again he growled on route to the exit what a

[00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:56.530]
douchebag okay comes in here a points himself as the monitor of

[00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.090]
that debate and of Steve show yesterday this is Steve's good

[00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:02.950]
ex-friend okay who comes in here as no business in this building who's a

[00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:08.550]
just piece of mong and the Ciderman stay out of this building okay all

[00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.930]
right that takes care of that piece of business now let's get right

[00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:14.370]
down to the nitty gritty of the show I guess Glenn wants to know why I hate

[00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:20.950]
him so I'm curious I don't it doesn't hate but is very upset I have a

[00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:24.470]
clue you know during the show Wednesday there was a guy who called in

[00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:29.410]
Neil if you recall and asking about Glenn's car about what color you know

[00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:34.870]
the color right ever and I think that may have been the guy oh that was the

[00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.090]
bubbles guy I was I who it was the bubbles they were hanging out with bubbles

[00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:43.910]
over it to have a bill boy people are talking boy I've been on vacation you

[00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:47.430]
have been excited everywhere I've been with friends better watch you to

[00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:52.110]
Jack's gonna start following you around you know I haven't done anything could

[00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:55.310]
you imagine what do you like if I had done all this I think the bone of

[00:47:55.310 --> 00:48:00.250]
contention is that it was it was under the impression that there you know that

[00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:04.890]
you were gonna be away and I plan to be things change this is real life there's

[00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:09.210]
no script things change for personal reasons I was back early and it was just a

[00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:13.830]
coincidence that both times that you're away with the less to remote no kidding

[00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:18.750]
and I think this is your fault now I think about it you mentioned earlier that I

[00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:23.410]
picked these weeks you know by the way I have some incredible affidavits here I

[00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.850]
just mentioned in passing it turns out that the a week ago today we had a

[00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:31.290]
hearing in court and a lot of people thought that was the end of this whole

[00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.630]
business with Jack Thompson which it certainly unfortunately wasn't but it was a

[00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.450]
very narrow thing the judge was ruling on to keep him away from me and away

[00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:43.350]
from this building while I'm here and etc because there was a psychologist who

[00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:47.410]
testified as many of us also believe that the mr. Thompson could be dangerous and

[00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.510]
represent a threat to some of us and that we have affidavits from two of the

[00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:54.210]
people over here channel seven next to her they don't want him here either on

[00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:58.510]
the property and he has no legitimate business over there in fact after our

[00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.830]
hearing last week the people of channel seven called the judge and said that

[00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:06.290]
we're very upset that you made an exception to allow him after 3 p.m. to come

[00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.770]
on a property to come over to channel seven because he has no legitimate

[00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.190]
business here and we don't want him here so I find that fascinating I just

[00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.690]
mentioned that in passing okay now let's get back to the real important matters

[00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:20.170]
at hand what it's my fault that what that I picked these particular weeks because

[00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:24.390]
you mentioned about an hour ago that I picked them you know in conjunction with

[00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:27.530]
your vacations yeah but see I changed my vacations so you could have also changed

[00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.690]
yours very easily in other words the fact that I'm going next week you could

[00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:34.890]
go on the following week very you're right but no one mentioned anything to me

[00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:38.990]
about that a logical thing to do but no one brought it up to me on Wednesday at

[00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:43.030]
the bizarre where no it's true plan that you're gonna be out the week of

[00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:50.450]
September 13th is it you see that was a shot I noted that was a shot a

[00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:54.310]
real really smiling but it was a shot you people are saying very upset about you

[00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:59.910]
about what a piece of just mung I think is the word I could use I shaking his

[00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:06.370]
head no yes that's my track buddy come on you guys are going to the track with me

[00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:14.550]
today sure we're gonna go now this is tell the audience anything it tells me a

[00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:18.350]
lot boy I'm telling you people are so fickle and so wishy washy it's just

[00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:23.370]
incredible you just can't I don't know what it is for this is sad this is really

[00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:28.310]
sad you're not well don't joke around the audience doesn't know that

[00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:31.470]
they think that you're sucking around now by the way can I have some more that

[00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:34.570]

[00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:44.990]
be here yes I want to straighten I want to defend myself I feel like what I feel

[00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:49.290]
like is I have been tried and convicted and I haven't had a chance I think there's a

[00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.830]
fair assessment that's what I feel like I've gotten to one straight now it seems with

[00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:58.070]
Caprita he seemed very melatoid me yes if he does come down here y'all can really

[00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:03.570]
get a show where y'all three sit need it be like all time I tell you it's he was the only

[00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:08.590]
reason I'd listen to Vave after y'all left and when he left I just can't stand

[00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:12.750]
hearing the Colonel's laugh one left from him and you know I have to turn the

[00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:17.910]

[00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:29.610]
time that was mentioned but no one had ever come to me now it's me no one had asked me anything

[00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:36.290]
common sense would dictate not necessarily part of the show you don't just shine when there's a special

[00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:44.330]
thing coming up that you would have gotten paid extra for speaking to getting paid extra for by

[00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:50.810]
the way where is uh Tommy Denny bird is Denny bird in the building well I forgot about that where's

[00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:55.630]
my check Denny bird okay well I forgot all about this you may get either you may let off the hook

[00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:59.890]
I got mine did you get paid Johnny dark on his check right there in the spot

[00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:08.970]
well now this this could be why it came in just like on Perry Mason and all of the trial all of

[00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:16.010]
the little sidebar that comes in yes this just dawned on me uh huh because I was going to say you

[00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:23.190]
would have gotten paid extra for it just like I did and now it dawns on me I didn't get paid anything

[00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:28.270]
that you see why I'm here that's supposed to be part of these deals is supposed to be big bucks

[00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:34.030]
when the big celebrities go out on the road man's supposed to be some serious serious dollars

[00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:39.430]
and it's just and you know me man I've just like Steve when I go out and do these things I want

[00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:44.590]
that check now oh look at that I want it right now because I'm broke man I haven't got two

[00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:49.550]
nickels to rub together like Steve you know that seems to be next year in temperate behavior that

[00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:56.310]
seems to be the number one on a hit parade question everybody is asking now because Steve keeps coming

[00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:02.170]
on here and um flaunting the audience well Denny bird's on the road but he's got a phone in his

[01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:06.030]
car and he knows the bad line he knew it enough to call in to be a pest on the lightning round he

[01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:12.410]
can call in now okay on the bat line but uh where's Steve's money all going why is he always

[01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:18.510]
broken why does he owe Nick money and Bill Mullin and Sharon that's an incredible guy that washes

[01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:23.370]
the cars out here and Spencer how come at it what is that all about I mean it's his business obviously

[01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:28.470]
but when he chooses to come on the air and uh beat his breast about how much money he's making

[01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:35.650]
he does make a lot and he does make a far too much for him um one has to wonder and everybody is

[01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:41.050]
talking about that now that's a new mystery oh so you're you fallen number two excellent well this

[01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:46.210]

[01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:52.930]
of the most consternating shows in the history that I've been on a year here it's intense and they

[01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:57.350]
don't they couldn't care less in Palm Beach they do want to talk about Rick Ciderman getting his

[01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:18.050]
near the building man poor patty over there boy that's that's shocking okay is what that is

[01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:23.750]

[01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:35.350]
we take a couple of calls to you with the audience makes out of all this so far Del Ray hey Neil how

[01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:39.850]
you doing okay this is when the reason you're not on by yourself is because you're not that

[01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:44.570]
entertaining man well that is a good point and now that's the reason in fact that's what they told me

[01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:49.050]
and I said well now you're nitpicking I think uh Neil you're the greatest man well we know that

[01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:53.870]
about yourself I know that I will say we know this is getting to be though when Glenn came back today

[01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:58.730]
it reminded me of that jerk that used to come on at one thirty or so you know used to barge in there

[01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:04.350]
I don't start ripping him again will you I mean I didn't I he's getting all paranoid and secure and

[01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.930]
he thinks I'm trying to ruin his life and ruin his show and I don't have any uh we're here

[01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:12.590]
ruin his show now he's got that worst rated show up and no he does not have the worst rated show

[01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:06.010]
care man get out of here what a you know what I'm 33 at wio did a pleasant call to that New York drop

[01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:11.270]
from number 19 last year to number 50 no wonder all the New Yorkers are here boys dropping like a rock

[01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:17.590]
it's like dropping a penny from the top of the world trade center anyway Palm Beach is now

[01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:25.950]
there must be a broken line huh no it sounds like it's working fine to me 655 9463 655 WIOD I guess

[01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:33.010]
Debbie's got that Palm Beach audience sewn up doesn't she I don't know cheat why he's upset he is

[01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:38.830]
really upset the last caller I think was the final straw straw that broke the birds back well

[01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:44.050]
that call it didn't say he was hung over here yeah well he considered the source sounded fine to

[01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:49.310]
me yeah sounded like a good guy to me hmm anyway let's continue I'm sure that they're going to come

[01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.950]
to your rescue here because you know that all the bird suckers are going to get on here real quick

[01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:57.110]
now and start kissing and kissing well I haven't Palm Beach show was a fault well wait a minute let me

[01:08:57.110 --> 01:09:03.890]
handle this hello protect the bird he's all right okay see just brief comments from Palm Beach I

[01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:10.450]
haven't done anything I don't protect you like in my mind I have in my heart I have done anything

[01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:14.850]
all right let's take a survey now who'd you rather have in the building Rick Siderman or the bird

[01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:22.310]
my only crime seems to be that I didn't go to work while I was on vacation that seems to be my

[01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:25.610]
big plan well I like the way you've twisted around I would probably put it in a different way that

[01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:30.810]
you took your vacation when we needed you the most no one asked me no one said anything to me need

[01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:37.390]
you like you know marginally but I was missed so when we go you were missed and it's I was missed

[01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:42.090]
and instead of you were missed and we were missed yeah and instead of appreciating me and saying oh well

[01:09:42.090 --> 01:09:46.570]
maybe you know he does serve a purpose maybe he doesn't know it's not because we had a chance to

[01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:51.990]
serve a purpose then you shine this nobody asked you're kind of twisting it around your body invited

[01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:56.330]
you remind me of somebody I know who listens every day to this show and likes to take the obvious and

[01:09:56.330 --> 01:10:02.590]
twisted around to suit his own distorted warped purposes where am I wrong then where am I wrong

[01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:08.890]
everywhere what do you think if anyone had asked me to postpone my vacation Miami hello yes

[01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:15.310]
okay sir listen but I'm glad it came into the fin to yourself because Neil had a hard time on

[01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:19.710]
Monday trying to find trying to run the show he made that issue I know question about that

[01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:25.430]
Monday was it a disaster well Neil missed you and his show has been kind of iffy since then

[01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:31.790]
yeah the Wednesday he realized that the show really didn't go without the bird so bird no that's

[01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:37.970]
not now let's start the career show on Wednesday went fine but instead of being missed I'm just

[01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:42.510]
ripped because I didn't go to work while I was on the place yeah yesterday he ripped you so much but

[01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:47.290]
you could tell in his in his the way he was talking that he really missed you and he needed you back

[01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:53.850]
for the show so it's good that you came in the day to think yourself and keep it up man like you're

[01:10:53.850 --> 01:11:01.050]
doing a good job and uncle nearly really missed you okay finally uncle nellie to use finally a

[01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:07.930]
coherent car ah huh fine easy for you to say yeah eleven thirty six at w i o d let's do a little

[01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:16.430]

after this wow eleven thirty nine at w i o d and the mark to dino who used to be a channel six

[01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:41.710]
uh news right here in town fact um mark was involved in our last uh big fiasco when we had Marlon

[01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:47.250]
Bailey and the Miami vice jackets sure a couple of years ago and uh mark did get his though he said

[01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.750]
that some of the piping came off and now it says Miami ice so that's mine so mark I would save it

[01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:55.330]
on it could be worth a lot of money someday okay Marlon will buy it back for a buck and a half

[01:11:56.090 --> 01:12:00.210]
but uh sure good to see mark I'll tell you boy he's one of the few people that was ever on the

[01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:04.850]
year in this town who looked good twenty till noon at w i o d and let's go now we don't want

[01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:08.870]
Michael putty to get up sick as Michael just has this big exciting new chapter of his life that's

[01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:12.370]
only going to happen in what six months or something it's really similar to over in our every

[01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:16.230]
summer January February six months going to ten do you understand that I don't get it

[01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:21.170]
is he still going to be on four and then everybody's going to know he's going to be a channel ten

[01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:25.210]
that's a little tacky isn't it I guess I didn't read that that would have been like being on

[01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:31.370]
Zeta for six more months oh everybody knowing we were coming here down with a head oh no joke about that
