[00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.720]
Great wine.

[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.200]
Okay, evidently some wild stuff is going to be breaking between now and six o'clock

[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.820]
and to give you a clue of some of the stuff that's going on. Here's Uncle Neil.

[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.180]
Well, we're not going to do until 3.30 but Norm Kent, who's our attorney, is on his way here

[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.760]
and we have an affidavit, which we'll be talking about at 3.30 and sharing his

[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.760]
process of inviting the media in here. I mentioned this morning when I came on

[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.600]
here about the Hollywood Police Department and they can, you know, pretend in their own

[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.460]
self-righteous way that they're in the right and that they're not doing anything wrong

[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.820]
et cetera and so on. But I have a copy of the affidavit right in my hot little hand

[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.860]
and the essence of it is that there is at least one individual and perhaps it

[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.600]
goes deeper than that within the Hollywood Police Department Vice Section

[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.240]
who are out to Neil Rogers. In other words, try to catch me in some

[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.340]
compromising situation even at the extent that they were willing to pay off or

[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.240]
bribe somebody to allow them to put me in that kind of situation.

[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.520]
You know, again, like I said this morning, there are people who think that all of this

[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.820]
is like some kind of a game or it's a joke or it's, you know, lots of fun or

[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.760]
whatever. This is like something out of Nazi Germany. This is

[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.980]
fascism, this whole witch hunt that's going on and this is just another component

[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.860]
of it. You know, again, whether the all of the items are related or unrelated

[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.900]
to the game, it doesn't make any difference because I'm still a target of it. And your name is

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.560]
mentioned interestingly about in this, but just kind of in passing.

[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.520]
And I have a feeling that you could have also possibly been the target of the witch hunt

[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.920]
if it would have applied. And I just don't think the audience out there are the people in this

[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.180]
community are taking it seriously enough and understand what's going on. I think after

[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.960]
330 they'll begin to understand. Well, it'll be good to get this stuff out, but I have,

[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.780]
you know, where I come from on this. I really believe that no matter what breaks

[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.920]
in them at a wedding, in the center you pointed it at yourself and it breaks out in

[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.100]
hell and hell. But you put it well. You said we put out one pair.

[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.500]
Breastfires. Yeah. Another brushback has to me, as I see it, I suspect that behind

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.920]
all the brushfires there is one. Well, you don't want to remind me of all the

[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.840]
weapons. It reminds me of the boy who cried Wolfsendrome because, you know, after

[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.480]
you've been caught with your hand and the cookie jar enough times, even if your hand

[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260]
isn't the one and even if you didn't feel the cookies on a Wednesday afternoon,

[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.940]
people still are going to assume that you're the one because you've done it so

[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.660]
many times before that you don't have any credibility left, okay?

[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.660]
Because the question that comes into my mind is why would the, you know,

[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.500]
Hollywood Police Department on their own are betrarily just decide we're going to get

[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.280]
neo-rodgers and as you mentioned. Well, I can't read their mind, but of course there are

[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.760]
a lot of homophobes and of course there's witch on Hasman a campaign of homophobia

[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.820]
and that's why I resent very bitterly anybody calling me a bigot. I mean, that's again

[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.540]
like somebody who said in this chair week ago, said here and called me a bigot.

[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.880]
That's one of the greatest insults in a history of mankind, okay?

[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.280]
That would be like, that would be like Adolf Hitler calling somebody an anti-Semite.

[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.380]
I think the other tip off to what I'm saying is in other words as to, you know,

[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.080]
who is behind this whole thing is the very fact and that it's more than just what you call a homophobic,

[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.880]
you know, an exercise in homophobia is the fact that evidently they were interested

[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.800]
as to whether I had gone there too. And of course the only link between you and I

[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.020]
happens to be our common candidate in Korok, who is out to discredit both of us.

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.220]
See, that's a good point. That's a good point.

[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.920]
Why the hell would the Hollywood police were for whatever reasons homophobic and

[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.860]
how to get you, why would the question come up with Steve Cain? You know, I mean,

[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.040]
that's, I think there's your answer. Now, that's a very good point.

[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.740]
Well, anyway, Norm is on his way here as we speak and I think see the good thing

[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.780]
about I think what's happening is that it's all becoming public now and it's all

[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.540]
getting out there for people to see. Yeah, and we had a choice. I mean, Norm, you know,

[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.800]
told me obviously we could have just gone ahead and passed this on to the state attorney

[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.100]
and Broward and done it very quietly. And I don't choose to do it that way because quite frankly,

[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.920]
I think, you know, you have to stand up for something sooner or later and today couldn't

[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.440]
have been a better day for it, you know, us to get this affidavit and to break it today because,

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.620]
like I said in the year this morning, I've had it. I'm not taking any more abuse from anybody.

[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.680]
And this is the end of it as of today. I mean, from now on, it's going to be completely

[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.480]
on the offensive. And if there are people like this detective who think that they can play games

[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.040]
with my life or your life or anybody else's life and try to, you know,

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.700]
and trap people into what could be a horrendous situation that could destroy their lives,

[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.700]
that just isn't going to happen. And I'm not going to allow it to happen.

[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.000]
Well, I'm a big believer in the light of day and I think plus I think the public has a right to know.

[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.960]
Well, I personally believe that, as I said over the last two weeks, that the thing which is aimed at you

[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.960]
and which is aimed at me is basically aimed at getting us off the air, which is basically aimed at our audience.

[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.440]
And if they're trying to take away shows that our audience like our audience have a right to know about that,

[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.280]
because- Well, in my case, it goes beyond just getting me off the air because when people in my neighborhood get letters,

[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.260]
people who are my neighbors in plantation are getting letters from someone who lives not even in the same county

[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.520]
down in Coral Gables, giving them my real name and telling them that they could be in a compromising situation on the air

[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.360]
and I'm going to have my way. And just generally trying to create a friction between me and my neighbors in my own neighborhood

[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.480]
where I live. So it's not obviously disconnected with something that's on the air.

[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.900]
It's connected with the desire to ruin my life, okay?

[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.820]
And also to get you out of here. And to give me out of time.

[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:35.580]
I mean, I do believe that- I mean, and as I've said and testified to the fact that the overall objective is to remove you from TACO,

[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.400]
there's quite frankly, I think if you move to Seattle tomorrow, I think your problems with that individual would end.

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.460]
It has- Well, I got new and I ain't going anywhere, okay?

[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.320]
I've got real news for him. I'm not going any place.

[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.480]
All right.

[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.840]
It's real cool in Seattle.

[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.460]
It gives you a real cold in Miami over the weekend.

[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.100]
Well, it gives you an idea of what's in store. 330 Norman Kent will be here and along with the rest of the press,

[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.100]
I was going to stand exciting and that's not really exciting, a horrific announcement.

[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.220]
And you'll want to stay tuned for that.

[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.340]
You're listening to the Steve Cain Show 610-WIOD. We'll be back after the news.

[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.860]
We're just going to turn the mic over to you.

[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.280]
Okay.

[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.080]
Well, first I have to tell you I have to do one little little plug.

[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.820]
I have to thank Aaron C. Renekar for getting me a vehicle on absolutely no notice.

[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:25.060]
I said I was coming down here. I was on my way down and as I got off the elevator,

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.980]
it kicked in and I had left my car for somebody work,

[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.780]
and I was just warning up in Papano Beach and they were able to come through.

[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.220]
So I thank them for it.

[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.640]
I want to say at the outset, we're not here for hike,

[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.500]
we're not here to publicize something unjustly.

[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.680]
This has nothing to do with the city of Halondale and it has nothing to do with an attorney

[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.600]
who individuals are embroiled in grievances with.

[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.440]
That's your opinion.

[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.080]
No, we know of.

[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.340]
That we know of.

[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.280]
That we know of.

[00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:04.260]
We are here and I am on the air sharing with you a revelation concerning an alleged impropriety

[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.280]
by the city of Hollywood Police Department.

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:17.180]
Perhaps the broader and greater issue that this addresses is one of freedom of sexual belief

[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.780]
and freedom of sexual practices.

[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:26.240]
An individual who we will refer to as John Doe because there's no reason to broadcast his name

[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.260]
unnecessarily at this point was acting as a clerk in the Hollywood cinema theater.

[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.820]
I don't I think it's called the CNA twin theater last Friday night.

[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.820]
At that time, the Vini unit, the Vice Intelligence and Narcotics Unit of the Hollywood Police Department

[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:52.680]
executed search warrant of that premises and effectuated and arrest of this individual.

[00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:00.500]
Earlier this morning, Neil went on the air saying he believed he was being harassed by a number of people

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:08.200]
and this individual on his own contacted the station and then the station advised him to contact me.

[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:15.280]
He relayed the following statement to me which my office prepared into an affidavit.

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.200]
I want to say at the outset that we have turned this affidavit over to the proper authorities

[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.040]
for their appropriate review before I even arrived here.

[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.560]
The Hollywood Police Department has been given a copy of this affidavit as has the state attorney.

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:38.180]
It will be their determination as to whether or not it should be taken with the appropriate

[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.080]
credence that I believe it should and they will have to make the determination of how to proceed.

[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.060]
That's not for us.

[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:53.060]
But because it is so revealing, it felt it necessary and I'm sorry, Neil felt it necessary.

[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.500]
Neil was given a choice and as he said on the air, I was listening in the car on the way down.

[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.860]
He was given a choice of going on the air with this or not going on the air with this.

[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:07.820]
I'll tell you a consequence of it later on because just going on the air with this,

[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.660]
some police agencies would have you believe there's a violation of flour or statute.

[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.900]
Because there is a statute that suggests if you go on the air with any internal investigation of a police agency

[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.660]
or something to that effect that's in this demeanor.

[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.320]
However, that statute is now being challenged and courted by myself, the American Civil Liberties Union,

[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.760]
and has already been declared on Constitutional.

[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.200]
And without any other hesitation, this individual who was arrested during the course of this search,

[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.320]
I'll say what?

[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.400]
Let's do this because that's a good kind of intro.

[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.720]
We have to take a short break.

[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.740]
When we attack, you can just get into this affidavit, which is really the gist of what we're here to talk about today.

[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.140]
You're listening to the Steve Tank, New South Radio, a 610WI, a DIA, Norm needs five full minutes.

[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.620]
So I'm just going to give this thing right back to him.

[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.420]
If you want to take about 30 seconds to kind of sum up and lead in to what you're doing here.

[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:10.260]
And as I said, we're here to share with the public information provided to me in an affidavit from an all-canon ladies and gentlemen in RESTD,

[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:16.700]
somebody who working in the SIN-A Twin Theatre in Hollywood, Florida on Friday night was arrested.

[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.480]
He called me this morning when I was working on other legal issues.

[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.040]
And this is the affidavit.

[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.520]
Yes, this is the affidavit.

[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.140]
I cut right to this. We're up on the...

[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:32.380]
He called me to say that after the offices came in to the premises, the bookstore,

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:39.500]
they began harassing him as offices with vice-intelligent and narcotics often do by saying,

[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.560]
how could you work here? What kind of establishment is there?

[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.700]
Can't you get a better job?

[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.500]
I can't. It's not a bookstore. It's a movie theater. There are no P-chows.

[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.100]
There are no quarter movies. It's a movie theater.

[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.980]
Okay. It's... I'm unaware of that. It's a movie theater.

[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.900]
And they went in there asking this person, how could he work there?

[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.420]
And they were executed as search warrant.

[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.260]
A lawful apparently a lawful search warrant at that time to seize two or three different films.

[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.440]
They said, look what kind of people come in here.

[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.660]
How can you work here? And the response from the individual who was arrested said,

[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.420]
we get many tourists in here. We get elderly people. We get professionals.

[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.180]
We get engineers. We get other people from all walks of life.

[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.400]
In fact, he said, we even have nail Rogers sometimes comes in here.

[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.100]
The Athian says that at the moment they mention nail Rogers name,

[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.720]
everybody seemed to turn their head that they were fascinated by it.

[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.140]
Once he mentioned the name of Mr. Rogers, the Athian goes on to say that the attitude

[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.000]
of all the offices dramatically changed.

[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.620]
He indicated that they went from being nasty to being friendly.

[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.900]
He indicated in his affidavit then they asked whether or not Steve came.

[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.820]
Whether or not Steve came, also patronizes that establishment.

[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.280]
He answered no and then they did not ask any further questions about Steve came.

[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.100]
The police, mostly one singular detective, then asked how often Mr. Rogers came in.

[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.420]
How many nights Mr. Rogers came in? What he did when he was there.

[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.160]
And commented according to the Athian that Niel is there probably trying to pick up young boys.

[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.340]
He stated this was pretty much the extent of the conversation at that time.

[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:20.700]
After being booked and jailed in Hollywood, the Athian then advised me that he was taken out of his cell

[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.540]
by a singular detective and the detective represented to him that he was out to nail Mr. Rogers

[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:33.000]
and advised him, advised the Athian to call the detective, the next time Niel Rogers came into that theater.

[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.320]
If he did so, he was promised money.

[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.180]
He said there would be quote dollars in it for me.

[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.000]
While the detective failed to say specifically how much he would be paid,

[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.960]
he indicated that the office to imply if you were to call the theater when Mr. Rogers was there,

[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.540]
they would take the necessary steps to eventually effectuate and arrest against Mr. Rogers

[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.080]
for engaging in illegal sexual activity.

[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.180]
The Athian indicates that he never saw Mr. Rogers engage in any illegal sexual activity.

[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.660]
The Athian indicates that he never saw anything other than Niel Rogers being a normal customer.

[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.120]
But the officer from the Hollywood Police Department is alleged to have quote said

[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.500]
he wanted to nail Mr. Rogers.

[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]
The officer then told the Athian that he should not tell anybody else about this

[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.560]
or that life might become miserable for him.

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.180]
But the Athian decided to have the courage, the tenacity, and the honor.

[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.920]
The honor, ladies and gentlemen, to call my law office this morning to relay this scenario to me.

[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.680]
I asked him to come in to sign a statement to that effect and he has done something.

[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.680]
We are at the top of the hour, we are only about 30 seconds left to end this.

[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.720]
If these allegations against the Hollywood Police Department are true,

[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.860]
against this officer are true, does this break a number of laws?

[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.100]
And could you just in like 20 seconds tell us which ones it would be breaking?

[00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.720]
Well, let's face it, officers are allowed to pay informants for interrupting criminal activity.

[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.340]
But they cannot solicit that criminal activity to occur.

[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.360]
They cannot engage one to induce another to engage in criminal activity.

[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.100]
And it would appear to be a major impropriety by the Hollywood Police Department.

[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.520]
We are going to break for the news of the top of the hour.

[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:22.040]
Better when so on and your response was, well, if other people were saying it, they might just be kidding.

[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.380]
But I know Neil and Maniel says that he means it in reference to this alleged trolling for boys.

[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.460]
Whatever, whatever boys is, I'm not sure I know what boys is.

[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.880]
Because boys, I mean 18-year-olds can be boys, but by the definition of law, in fact 17-year-olds by definition of law

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.140]
are at the age of consent in the state of Florida.

[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.280]
How do you recognize statements?

[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.840]
Well, I'm aware it's come up. Let's just deal with it.

[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.100]
Yeah, I don't know anything that I've ever done or said.

[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.000]
Let's just deal with it and put it to bed once and for all, okay?

[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.060]
Excuse me, are you going to shut your mouth, sir?

[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.400]
We seem to have touched the speaking line.

[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.480]
Are you going to shut your mouth and let me reply to what you're saying?

[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.700]
Or are you not?

[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.500]
Just let me know, because if you're not, I'll just hit the button and now reply with you off the air.

[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.560]
And rather you have you on there, right?

[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.100]
Sure it is.

[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.680]
I have said that in the show I did with Jack Thompson.

[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:21.260]
I found, I was very uncomfortable with what Neil was doing on the air with Zeta in that particular area.

[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.580]
So, you're really going to go into it?

[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.280]
Yeah, absolutely.

[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.820]
Well, when the guys would come into the studio and you're talking about them sitting on your lap and done tummy and cheek,

[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.180]
but quite frankly, in my opinion, I didn't know how much of it was.

[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.860]
How about when Glenn was talking about the young girls who came in and literally sat on his lap?

[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.640]
Now, how about that?

[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.400]
Did that bother you?

[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:41.600]
No.

[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:47.680]
Oh, I mean, why the separate, because first of all, now you know that there were no guys sitting on my lap.

[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.160]
I, okay?

[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.880]
Are you really believe that?

[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.440]
You're asking me a question and I'm going to answer it.

[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.120]
I'm not right.

[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.120]
I'm not saying I'm right.

[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.720]
You're asking me to be honest and to be honest.

[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.120]
I mean, I wish that perhaps they would have been, but you really believe they were saying you're my right answer.

[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:00.260]

[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.080]
You want a straight answer?

[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.940]
Sure, I'll give you a straight answer.

[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.140]
Now, I'm not saying you're straight as I am.

[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:09.380]
When I listen part in the poem, part in the plan words, when I listen to that show to be very honest with you,

[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.000]
I was uncertain in my mind as to how, I know when you're kidding and there are times when I don't know if you're kidding or not.

[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.280]
But do you think that is what I plan?

[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:15.740]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.440]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.780]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:26.780]

[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:26.780]

[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:26.780]

[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:26.780]

[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:26.780]

[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.320]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:28.360]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.460]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.580]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.280]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.560]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.240]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:35.820]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.180]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:37.260]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:37.320]

[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.120]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.540]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:39.540]

[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:39.540]

[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:39.540]

[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.920]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.460]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.520]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.500]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.280]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.420]
Wait a minute.

[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.940]
Excuse me, sir.

[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:49.420]
They're quite frankly.

[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.060]
Now that I know you better, I don't believe that at the time I did.

[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.300]
That's what I know.

[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.480]
Can we go back to the chapter David one second because Detective Murray says, according to the Athian,

[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.100]
here he says, Neil is probably there, meaning in the adult theater to pick up some young boys.

[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:10.500]
Now, I could be mistaken, but it seems to me that the law in all of the states in this country says that

[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.320]
ex-rated theaters don't allow anyone of the age of 18.

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:20.920]
In fact, many of them don't permit anyone on the age of 21 to enter the theater under a penalty of losing their license to operate et cetera.

[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.460]
So again, this term, young boys, I'm not sure exactly what that means.

[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.980]
Well, I understand what you're saying, but I want to get back to what this caller is talking about.

[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.660]
Now, I want it between you and I, I want it to get back to the original purpose of your call.

[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.160]
So what is your point, sir, because I want to deal with it.

[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:43.560]
The original purpose of my call is how less moral, my legal, on a moral basis, are you guilty of doing the same thing?

[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.200]
What is the same thing?

[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.420]
I have no idea what you're talking about.

[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.500]
Well, obviously you've made the same statement about Neil that being Detective has said to me here.

[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.140]
Well, I think I can answer that, sir.

[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.980]
I certainly think we can make a distinction.

[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.440]
The issue here is that the detective has a badge.

[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.540]
I haven't had a gun.

[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.420]
I'm not talking to the police.

[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:00.880]
We have to talk about that.

[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.740]
Yeah, but I'm telling you the difference, and it's not illegal.

[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.400]
You're just just absorb it for a second.

[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.420]
The issue is that the detective, if the affinist, you know, if we're taking the statement is true,

[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.940]
the detective has a badge.

[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.000]
He has a gun.

[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.580]
He has the power to arrest.

[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.140]
He has the ability to initiate a prosecution.

[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.880]
He has the ability to start a process that could ruin somebody's career, destroy their reputation,

[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.960]
and perhaps take away their absolute livelihood.

[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.240]
I want to understand exactly what I did that you're objecting to.

[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:40.240]
What I did was state my opinion to what Neil was doing in my opinion, which I made very clear in no way,

[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.800]
you know, should be definitive as to what Neil should be allowed to do whatever management permitted him to do,

[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.080]
that I found it in bad taste, and I didn't know when he was kidding or when he was.

[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.240]
Now, what the hell is wrong with that?

[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.160]
So that was my opinion.

[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.060]
You have a problem with that?

[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.580]
Yes, I do.

[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.860]
Well, take it.

[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.840]
Let's go to Miami, you're on WIO, Dan.

[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.340]
I hope that clears the air between us, because I'm not your enemy, and we were enemies,

[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.460]
and there was an old saying that goes, I'm not saying I acted in me.

[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.980]
No, I'm glad we can clear that here, because we're not here.

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.140]
Let's go to another show.

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.640]
Let's go to this one.

[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.120]
Let me say this, and then you reply.

[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.320]
I'm not saying that everything I did, if I had it to do over again, I would do again.

[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.940]
But there is an old saying that is an old saying because it has a lot of validity,

[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.780]
and that is, in life, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:32.660]
And I think it was that dynamic that basically created whatever report existed between Jack Thompson and me.

[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.120]
You had said in those days some horrendous terrible things about me, and they were not personally, not personally know.

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.120]
No, I don't really want to relive it.

[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.920]
And they come at you, why?

[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.840]
They come at you, they come at you, they come at you, they attribute it to me that I allegedly made about Rachel.

[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.000]
I never made that come in here.

[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.560]
I heard it with my own ears, but you said, what was the comment?

[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.260]
I want to say this, and then I'll get into it.

[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.760]
No, the reason I wanted to avoid this is one reason, because what we are doing now is exactly what we are doing.

[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.900]
And then I think we are going to be playing into the hands of an individual when Coral Gables and Normandy is together.

[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.320]
Oh, I think we ought to clear the ear.

[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.040]
I think that there are some problems there.

[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.180]
Let's make a reference to the ear.

[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.400]
I heard you with my own ears, okay.

[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.880]
Say, you know, something about a show I've done on a child raising whatever it was,

[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.140]
who is he to give advice to other people on a show when his child is in an institution talking about Rachel.

[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.460]
I think it was an institution.

[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.300]
In an institution, I heard it with my ears.

[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.620]
How could I have said that?

[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.460]
I don't have any such things.

[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.620]
I don't know how the hell you said it, but you did.

[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.400]
You were talking about DeSisto, okay.

[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.180]
I said he's in an institution, or I said that you said who?

[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:39.620]
You said who is Steve Cain to give his advice to parents when his kid is in an institution.

[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.400]
I don't remember saying who I am.

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.540]
I can remember saying who I am.

[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.500]
You have advice when his daughter has had as many problems or whatever it was.

[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.980]
I can accept the fact that you don't remember it.

[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.580]
I sure don't.

[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.960]
But you can bet your bippy that I remember it, because it's not the kind of thing that you don't like.

[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.100]
Let's forget it one more reason.

[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.580]
But I don't, if I said that, then I apologize, because I have no knowledge to base that on.

[00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.720]
But let me just clear the air.

[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.480]
One other thing, okay, we'll get it all out of the way.

[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.260]
There was a show you did.

[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:08.740]
One of them, one of the most notches to me personally, with Rick Siderman and Bob Kunst.

[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.220]
They made them booze and buddies, and they were embracing each other, so to speak.

[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.080]
And for some reason, out of nowhere, my name, as it so often did in those days,

[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:18.960]
came into the conversation.

[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.140]
Not of nowhere, has really had nothing to do with the topic conversation.

[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.960]
And Mr. Siderman's comment, being the great humanitarian that he is, said,

[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.700]
well, you know, I guess Bob, you're not so bad.

[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.120]
I don't really hit all homosexuals.

[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:34.580]
But let's face it, Neil Rogers isn't really a homosexual.

[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.540]
You know, that horrible lifestyle in his, he's terrible, and you're lying about he's so unhappy,

[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.880]
and he hates his mother, he hates himself.

[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.200]
He's a faggot.

[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.940]
Not just a homosexual, he's a faggot.

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.000]
I found that to be so personally offensive that I can't absolutely word.

[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.620]
Absolutely.

[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.740]
So what is your problem with me?

[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.220]
When Siderman was on my show last week, he started with that crap.

[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.100]
I'm not talking about that.

[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.300]
Well, the way that I came to work, I am not responsible for what my guests say.

[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.760]
Nor are you responsible for it.

[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.860]
You were participating over the...

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.600]
We were involved.

[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.940]
Have you...

[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:06.760]
The lost out?

[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.280]
Have you blocked out and forgotten the horrendously horrible things that we said about each other

[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.120]
before we were colleagues here at this station?

[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.540]
Surely you tell me you only remember the terrible things that I said about you,

[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.520]
and that were, of course, totally unregunted at all.

[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.260]
Unprovoked.

[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.680]
It's a great deal of difference between talking about somebody's performance on air,

[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.880]
or their ratings, rating that's professional, as opposed to this low level of personal he hates his mother.

[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.260]
I understand all of that.

[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:34.720]
I understand.

[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:41.320]
I understand that you have blocked out the personal things that have gone down between us and the past on your end,

[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.300]
but you have made statements about my mental health and about my compassion, about my family and about my...

[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.020]
Come on, Neil.

[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.980]
I mean, I own what I do.

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.860]
You start...

[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.280]
I mean, the same people out there listening.

[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.140]
I think you're listening to you when you sit here.

[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.000]
Oh, right.

[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:54.960]
I'm a loosening man.

[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.220]
Let me just for a moment, and immediate.

[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:59.000]
Is that fun? Why don't you, your clients, fight?

[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.440]
Just for a moment.

[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:06.400]
Let me respectfully suggest that while I'll leave two of you, probably have some grievances that can be on air.

[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.180]
Are you so glum?

[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:15.420]
Or some situations that you can discuss that what happened with the Hollywood Police Department Friday,

[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.600]
probably goes beyond the essence of that.

[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.140]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.020]
No, it doesn't go.

[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.240]
It hides in with it, okay?

[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.340]
Because this homophobic crap is going to stop.

[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:25.840]
All right?

[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.580]
Now, the idea that you can go on the air and you can attack just about anybody else who's ever been invented,

[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:31.780]
and you're immediately attacked.

[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.560]
You can attack blacks in the NAACP, comes down on your ass.

[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.000]
You attack Jews and right away, here's our title bomb coming.

[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.280]
As they should, okay?

[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.380]
As they should, if indeed you're making an attack.

[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.200]
I mean, if it's species, that's another story.

[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.740]
But, you know, if you come down and you call gay people, faggots, or anything out of the sun,

[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:53.840]
nobody comes down on your ass because in this society, it's still acceptable to call gay people every kind of name out of the sun.

[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.760]
And to call them faggots.

[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.420]
I agree with that.

[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.740]
I agree with that.

[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.040]
But that's one of the good news.

[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:58.640]
What's going on?

[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.600]
No, I'm just going to break.

[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.060]
We've got a break.

[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.020]
Trying to make a connection between the rich side of the world

[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.360]
and the situation we're talking about now.

[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.280]
We have to break.

[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:06.540]
Okay.

[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.420]
Because we're about two minutes over on our break.

[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.440]
And we'll pick up where we left off when we get back.

[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.420]
But I've got to clarify something in my mind.

[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:18.080]
We've known each other on and off in a different degrees of closeness over a period of seven years.

[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.460]
Do you think I'm homophobic?

[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.080]
Subconsciously, yeah.

[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.720]
We'll talk more about that.

[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.480]
Subconsciously.

[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.780]
We'll talk about that.

[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.320]
You're listening to the Steve Kane show, six tan my convinced that I'm not homophobic.

[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.000]
Subconsciously.

[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.300]
Because of a single act.

[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.320]
Because of a single act.

[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:42.320]
You basically, you basically condemn me because of my friends with people that I believe are homophobic.

[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.480]
I'm just perplexed by that.

[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.460]
That's all I don't understand.

[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.400]
Well, I'll explain.

[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.580]
You do all, let me ask you this.

[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.840]
I don't have a friend who aren't all living rules or progressive.

[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.000]
No, far from it.

[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.800]
But they also, I don't associate with anybody who I consider would be a right-wing bigot.

[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.660]
I couldn't do it.

[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.920]
I would have nothing in common with them.

[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.300]
I would find them to be totally distasteful.

[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:00.300]

[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:00.300]

[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:00.300]

[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.500]
I'm not all excuses for human beings.

[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.680]
And I just couldn't spend any time with them.

[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.300]
Well, I mean, one thing to be, I'm not talking about, I have friends who are conservative,

[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.280]
but not ultra-right-wing.

[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.500]
We will not see.

[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.600]
We will be back with the quote.

[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.800]
Before people at this dying for us to get into it.

[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.200]
You're listening to the Steve Kane show, six tan WI-O-G in our left.

[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.060]
We are back with you, six minutes after five o'clock, Uncle Neil Rogers, Norm Kent,

[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.620]
our mutual attorney, and I am Steve Kane, in case you've forgotten who I am.

[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.880]
Now, let's just, let's go.

[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.800]
We have an hour left.

[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.520]
If we resolve our differences, or what, where are we?

[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.140]
As far as I know, I think we cleared it out.

[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:36.820]
Okay.

[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:37.980]
Mr. Kent.

[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:38.320]
Sure.

[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:43.440]
I think, you know, the Abraham Lincoln once said the best way to defeat an enemy is to make him a friend.

[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.080]
What's really at stake here, one of the best points that Neil's making.

[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:54.240]
And let's just go back and reflect upon some of the things that have happened here at the station over the past few months.

[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:02.600]
You did something that antagonized the group of black people and the NAACP is suddenly a voice to be heard from and dealt with.

[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:09.640]
If you do something that offends Jewish people before, you know, at the Anti-Defamation League is here in force.

[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:18.340]
When people go ahead and say something about eating animals, the next thing, you know, my good friend Lonnie Wiggins is here with the Animal Rights Actimists.

[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:39.620]
And if you say something about how and how, and why the gray caucus is here in force, the senior citizens, what Neil is saying, and I think it's true, I see this professionally, I see this personally, is that it gave people our targets for everybody without having a force to speak for them.

[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:51.520]
They are repeatedly slanted on the air, they are liable, they are humiliated and exposed to public ridicule without having somebody speak up for them as a force.

[00:26:51.640 --> 00:27:00.460]
I like to think that I speak up as a professional, I think we all ought to speak up as persons to prevent that kind of gay bashing on the air.

[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.820]
And that's probably what this is about, and that's why this allegation is so disturbing.

[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:13.720]
It doesn't suggest that they're out to get Steve King because he decided to go do something with his wife on a beach.

[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:26.540]
You know, I've represented in 10 years of being a criminal defense lawyer in Broward County, I have probably represented 200 to 300 or more individuals that get picked up for soliciting other gay people.

[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:39.280]
I agree with you, I mean, I agree with everything you're saying. However, I think there's more involved here because if it's a homophobic thing, what I want to know is why did the vice squad, Steve fit to ask where the Steve Cain attended this movie there?

[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.000]
Well, because it wasn't just a homophobic thing.

[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.180]
But that's the point that I'm trying to make here.

[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.300]
There's more to it that means you, I think we can all agree with that point.

[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:57.420]
One might want to ask where the vice squad to begin with chose to raise the issue of Steve and Neil.

[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.700]
And where did they get the names from? Who created the kind of conditions that permitted?

[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.200]
And no doubt at the appropriate time you will ask Detective Murray that very question.

[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.320]
I'm sure. Will that occur at some point?

[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.600]
I'm sure whoever winds up representing Mr. Hill will engage in that kind of inquiry.

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.420]
Okay, let's go to Miami, you're on WIOD. Hello.
