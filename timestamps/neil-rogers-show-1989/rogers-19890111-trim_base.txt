Newstalk Radio 610 W I O D where is Williams Island you know Williams Island Tampa

[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.220]
on Tampa's new shop because wore down he just bought a two-bedroom condo there for 300 and a

[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:42.200]
quarter very nice yeah I kind of thought it would be around here north by me beach according to

[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.500]
Roger you say off Tampa off Tampa this game both are this game well there's the way in

[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:55.280]
Island and Tampa yeah that's what it says here so feel a rent ready valley with a

[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.020]
Houston Billy Cunningham and now work down a junior I was hoping Tampa well you're wrong

[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.780]
work is gonna be living in town his I hate to say this because you know the guys made millions

[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.960]
and millions of dollars and I begrudge you absolutely nothing but it's wearing pretty thin now

[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.960]
it's getting pretty ponderous yeah now of course he's run out of people that are willing to

[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.320]
beat each other up and the guests are really terminal last night I turned on for a couple of minutes

[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.720]
and he had some weird political guy with freaky hair you know looked like one of those 60s rejects

[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.300]
with a long hair and aging it was pretty ponderous correct and the audience was going

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.760]
you know like that and they hadn't even said hello yet they were doing that so it's getting a little

[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.280]
desperate anyway it's 1006 and WIOD yes we do have Virginia all the ratings but we have several

[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.360]
things I mean just several little things that I got to do here first of all I have to correct

[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.300]
my mistake first one I've made since I came in yesterday morning about the Armadillo Cafe

[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.540]
because I went by there yesterday in a way home from my mother's house yeah and it's on

[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.660]
Davy Road extension and it's in a little it looks like kind of a little country in western

[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.540]
shopping center see the shops of Davy is what threw me because I've always thought that shops of

[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.580]
Davy was on university at Griffin Road and that's why kept saying the little public shopping center

[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.680]
that's where that barber is remember the barber our friend who used to come in a company JT

[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.700]
he's in there oh I think what a shopping center and I thought that said the shops of Davy

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.040]
there now somebody will call in and tell us what the name of that shopping center is that is not

[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.740]
even close to where the Armadillo Cafe is the Armadillo Cafe is on the southeast corner

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.500]
of the intersection of Davy Road and Griffin which is just what it says in my copy and of course

[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.840]
luckily I haven't had to go over there because they brought the food here yeah when you're on the

[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.440]
diet you don't go over there and have a sit down me because having a sit down meals what the

[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.100]
real killer is oh so I just wanted to correct that and point out where it is because I've got a lot

[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.540]
of people confused somebody will let us know trust me I forgot my little sandwich today speaking

[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.500]
of food can we beg for something salad or something easy and simple and I don't know my right

[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.580]
it on Monday in the response was absolutely zippo and like I said I think we've lost the magic

[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.920]
touch I don't think they care no they don't they don't care about us anymore and I know I said we

[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.000]
didn't want a lot of food in here but the salad you know anytime the salad's coming there's no

[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.720]
problem for me and a little sandwich for you something you know weighing less than seven pounds

[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.500]
salad you know secondly Mike Spindell called me at home yesterday and Mike of course overly sensitive

[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.940]
because he used to be in his business or close to it and he went through a thing about people

[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.040]
told him I ripped him yesterday I didn't rip him at all he's a great guy we all love Mike it's

[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.800]
just that the tape showed up late and he gave me the story about how he didn't put enough

[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.800]
postage on it rang a bell because remember that fat rich told us he sent us a tape with not

[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.760]
enough postage and it was embarrassing and it went to the dead letter file and finally we had

[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.460]
big song of dance and we finally got it and I said to him don't worry about it because we got a

[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.220]
whole box full of quality tapes now including some more that came in today some real good guys too

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.480]
I'm excited about that the rest of your stuff is in a waistband and now if it was one that you got

[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.860]
that you're reset that was blank that you got back blank a few of those happened don't panic we're

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.400]
not throwing those out we'll redo them but if it was just like the one guy sends me a check for

[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.380]
the most out which is great and he says I heard you say that it was too late and he sends a tape

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.660]
anyway my favorite which is nice I appreciate it very much believe me I'm going to have a collection

[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.020]
at home and it's going to be fantastic I can record my own best in Neil or something because I

[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.680]
got enough cassettes to choke a horse so don't worry Michael get it straightened out I'm sure

[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.300]
rich has got your address or if not you know we'll do something we'll have him deliver it personally

[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.740]
that was number two number three I didn't see the story because we just were busy doing some things

[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.680]
about the uniforms that they want kids to wear any elementary schools in date county I heard

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.640]
the story this morning on our news and I got to tell you that to me is one of the most grotesque one

[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.020]
of the most frightening things I've ever heard in my life it reminds me of the Hitler youth all over again

[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.820]
they do it in private school that's bad enough but I guess we can't control what they do in private

[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.260]
schools but the idea that we're going to have all these little kids dressed up in these little

[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.800]
uniforms almost said brown uniforms I'm not sure I know what color they're going to be but it

[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.460]
doesn't make any difference but I can just envision them go stepping you know while

[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.940]
El Presidente is leading them in the pledge of allegiance uh boy that conjures up some really sick

[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.100]
images in my mind and speaking of sick Oprah yesterday hit rock bottom sick rock bottom

[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.040]
she had a show about autistic savants

[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.820]
because of the movie Rain Man is created so much interest and they sure a fairly lengthy clip from

[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.480]
Rain Man at the beginning and they had on two and I was at my mother's having lunch and of course

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.300]
lunch was starting to come back up again it's one thing to look at it in a movie and to

[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.160]
understand it appreciated but know that in the movie it's only acting it's only makefully

[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.180]
it's another thing for people and she made a comment about a third of the way into the show which

[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.460]
was the tip off she said oh we're not exploiting Robert or whatever his name was uh we want you

[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.640]
to understand that we're not exploiting him we just want people to understand this and uh and

[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.120]
what a crocka crap that was all they were doing was exploiting these two poor guys who both were

[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.620]
autistic savants the second one who played the piano and who allegedly could listen to any

[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.920]
piece of music played and then repeat it on the piano and they played some show pen thing and

[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.920]
look at that the phone works now Mitch is a magician there's no question about if that that's

[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.540]
where we went wrong we should have got Mitch in here right off the bat in a in a flute swell as we

[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.380]
were known to say he just got that thing they're all flashing at the same time anyway she brought and

[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.840]
and he listened to the thing and then he started bumbling on the piano and you know it was it was

[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.280]
tragic it's sad it was sad and the thing that bothered me the most is that here is this miserable

[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.780]
bitch exploiting and yet i shouldn't put her alone because all these talk shows now it's nothing but

[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.000]
exploitation exploiting these two poor guys and putting them on display do you remember how in the

[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.060]
carnival there used to be side shows free shows and there was the fat lady and there were the midget

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.440]
and there were the i'm sure autistic people or whatever people who were bizarre were put on display

[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.360]
and people used to pay to look at him and laugh and gawk and that's like what it was i don't give

[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.360]
a damn how many disclaimers she did that was what it was and it made me sick it was nauseating

[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.760]
Oprah you are a slime ball okay honey a true slime ball and all of those tv talk shows man that's

[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.980]
that's what it's gotten to that's it just gets worse and worse your horse won yesterday my horse

[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:56.080]
came in stolen rolls stolen rolls with micens dollars absolutely one what did pay six thirty no

[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.420]
not let me see that six thirty where do you get it six thirty is a time it's not a price

[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.380]
that's when it came in yeah that's probably the time it came in no say oh my god

[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.820]
six and a half to one a horse paid fourteen sixty one by a length with micens dollars i gave

[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.540]
you this horse ladies and gentlemen what was the one you gave out well turn the channel did not

[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.900]
come in what race was that intent in the tenth grade a desperate turn the channel was a desperate

[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.740]
six went off at four and a half to one what is that so you're still cold but i'm right on top of

[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.660]
it man and look at that the trifecta in at race paid three hundred forty four forty and the

[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.700]
bet three that was the third leg of the bet three all look at that but you couldn't have had the

[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.340]
the middle one the horse in the middle was ninety nine to one paid two hundred and one sixty

[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.240]
and the bet three paid four thousand four eighty seven twenty correct the Gulf Stream so my first

[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.160]
picket Gulf Stream ladies and gentlemen is a winner man i'm a stounder or fourteen sixty with

[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:00.500]
micens dollars and the chalk ran second so that was an easy perfect for forty eight eighty but that's

[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:08.280]
the way it goes so anyway we did all pro we did the armadillo cafe did Mike spindell and i

[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.860]
mentioned the thing about the uniforms which i just can't you can't find a story i can't find

[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.720]
local i can't find uh while i was kind of hectic this morning sunny did a tremendous job under

[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.220]
very difficult under derest five twenty this morning i understand Roger had a call from Bob

[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.780]
soper that he was under the weather if you part of that expression would you say that about

[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.560]
also where were we hearing yesterday did was it well we're in here or did somebody tell me

[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.400]
that Dan Rather came in eighth all uh Sanchez was talking about it yeah

[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.120]
the cbs evening news which ordinarily i'm sure is one or two at the worst is number two

[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.740]
talking locally yeah in the market came in eighth the first week on channel six yeah beaten by such

[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.800]
powerhouses as channel thirty three and thirty nine so when i tell you the channel six has got

[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.240]
signal problems and cbs bought themselves some real headaches and of course he brought out a good

[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.920]
point and that is what's going to happen nationally because this is one of the major markets

[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.200]
and that's going to have a little bit of an effect on the national picture because you know those

[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.320]
tense of a point and hundreds of a point and that's right and they're so close the three yeah

[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.740]
uh even news that's correct so good luck to you Dan because you're going to need to talk louder Dan

[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.980]
that's all i can tell you baby because i worked on stations like that where they could barely hear

[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.400]
you and on tv it's the additional problem not only can the audio be all of the audio is fine

[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.900]
it's just a picture that sucks okay all right now we have all of the ratings that anybody in the

[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.680]
world could ever want to see and i'm sure that we have all the people in the business are tuned in

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.040]
right now because most of them work for a very paranoid management who doesn't want to tell them

[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.120]
too much information in fact sometimes if the book is bad enough they give them no information

[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.760]
they just give them a pink slip about three weeks later so we've got it all here and knock on

[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.620]
woodboy we did miraculously well here for just having many or five weeks i mean astonishingly

[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:03.340]
well reneary had a giant book and the station overall a four eight twelve plus that's the entire

[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:09.580]
week that's the second highest number for w i o d in the modern history of the market i say modern

[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.360]
history because back in the old days when they're only wear a handful of stations q a m and f u a

[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:19.480]
and in this one all of the stations had enormous numbers because there were only a few stations four eight

[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.840]
four eight which is uh the biggest in ten years and in the next one in the winter book in the

[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:33.120]
next trend we'll go over five mark my words on it depend on it as they say and of course um

[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.360]
our friends over at that other station where we used to work well i got if they're going to be singing

[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.000]
uh they got a couple of little numbers in there in some very narrow demographics i think men 25 to

[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.940]
34 in the afternoon they had a big number and uh one other one but other than that man and especially

[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.940]
in the morning they they took a dive seldom seen in the history so quickly in six weeks i've never

[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.800]
seen seldom seen in the history of this business that's how fast they are diving over at uh

[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.000]
zeta where they allegedly turned the corner it could be a history and you know something it couldn't

[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.040]
happen to more deserving people and i do there are some exceptions like caprito who's sick i wonder

[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.800]
why davis under the weather and um and gonson is a good guy i mean not much of a talent but he's a good guy

[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.060]
not any talent but a good guy they love him and uh john ford's a good guy but again he's not on the air

[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.160]
but uh as far as the rest of them over there and i know i shouldn't say that case he's a good guy

[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:29.920]
mm-hmm mm-hmm we never got to know uh my mind so we should talk about the well my clients i'm sure is

[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.300]
terrific talent but can't miss a wonderful human being no question about that but she doesn't

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.820]
to figure in the numbers because she's on overnight there are no numbers so anyway we'll go

[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.080]
i'll try not to do two ponderous okay because i know some of you get real upset

[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.720]
when we get into a long draw you don't understand these and they don't mean anything to you and you

[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.820]
don't care but please understand that there are a lot of people in the business whose livelihoods

[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.640]
depend on this godforsaken business and these numbers and they're they're out they're very nervous

[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.840]
and they want to hear any little uh tidbit of information they can get okay mm-hmm so that's the

[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.240]
name of that tune it's i can't believe the phone man it's just like a real normal phone today

[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:11.980]
it's shocking shocking ten eighteen at w-i-o-d and i want to tell you about d ten twenty two at w-i-o-d

[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.380]
now just before we get into the range we should take some of these calls because some of these

[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:20.980]
we don't want these people waiting on here forever do we do we Miami hello hello yes

[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:26.600]

[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.320]
cassette back from uh you know for the new bits when i had to check right i got that to you personally

[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:48.420]
by the way i did that uh you know yeah well the only thing is uh i've only recorded on one channel

[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.360]
because i've got i've got the your program on one speaker and the bits coming out of the other

[00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:00.580]
but that's that's okay yeah well that saves a lot of time well anyhow well see that's what happens

[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.200]
when you send us cassettes that i got other junk on it um that's no problem that's no idea what kind

[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.540]
of machines rich was using the dub those but that's no problem not you're not going to get out that

[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:15.220]
he said that did happen memory so yeah but i was wondering if i could get the uh the cassette back

[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:21.420]
no chance no chance no of course you can get the cassette back of course i just uh it's at the house

[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:47.020]
made things so complicated i know well you know i i i if you would have said there send this back to me

[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.600]
i explained that in the note when i don't read i don't have time to read notes you read it on

[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.840]
when you've got a thousand the tapes coming in you don't have time for notes you read it on the air

[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.740]
and you were confused because i i've listed yes you didn't understand it okay if you put me on hold

[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.560]
i give my name and address and if you know where did you buy that you buy it at keymart and

[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.960]
since then at ease that were you bought that tape no i bought it here in florida okay because i want

[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.200]
to make sure if we send you the tape bag it's the right one okay it's on oak street i think

[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:18.820]
on okay hold on sir that's correct all right all right i have no idea where he has broaders

[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:25.100]
of broaders on top of that okay it's ten twenty five at wio d see that that and by the way as far

[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.060]
as the tapes are concerned that's it if you got one that was blank if you got one that was had 87

[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:36.200]
channels good luck to you okay have a wonderful life with it fondle it caress it do whatever you

[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.260]
want with it that's it okay and rich did most of the work but i'm exhausted it was a wonderful thing

[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.860]
it went on for a good long time and we grazed over over thirty seven grand for the chameleus house

[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.020]
marvelous okay we entertain a lot of people with all those bits and all the stuff and great okay

[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:58.300]
but it's all over trust me when i tell you it's all over and any tape i'm not even going to waste the

[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.620]
time out the only two things that we'll look for is to see if there's a check somewhere in the envelope

[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.120]
for chameleus house which you know we got a couple here today and then throw the blank the tape

[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.720]
whatever it is blank or otherwise in this new box that i've got here soon as i got a new carton

[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:20.100]
back here look at that good ones in there too by the way some real expensive mac cells and sonies

[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.600]
thank you so much for writing to my collection okay oh you get more there'll be more i'm sure they'll

[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.280]
be trickling in but oh sure but i want to say it is emphatically as i know how this is it okay

[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:37.480]
no more if your tape had pornographic messages on it no matter what was on there in fact probably

[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.800]
you want to keep that right but i mean whatever it is just you're stuck with it that's it okay

[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:48.300]
because we've given ample time now right in this include and place including blanks or whatever it is

[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:54.080]
okay let's go to hollywood hello good morning Neil hi how are you great i haven't had a chance to call

[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.060]
but you mentioned a couple things in the last few days i want to take some time and call you

[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.920]
first of all what you mentioned this morning about the uniforms yeah just for a second take

[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:09.220]
another look at it because i know my two girls go to private school and i wish that they did put

[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.360]
i have them put uniforms only because i have a six and a half and a seven and a half year old

[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.920]
daughters and you have no idea what we go through in the morning getting dressed for school

[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:25.640]
without fits and having bows matching and things like that so that the girls can stay in fashion with

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:31.820]
everyone else's ball i would like it only because it would make life a little easier i don't think

[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:38.300]
it would take away their individualism because they both are pretty strong individuals and i think

[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.860]
it would make it a lot it will make it a lot easier even on the family but i know of one

[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.980]
private school in particular what they do is the kids wear uniforms Monday through Thursday

[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.580]
and Friday is a free day you can dress anyway you'd like well let me let me just say it to you

[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.000]
and of course it's a free country or in title to your opinion it it offends me so deeply

[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.740]
and everything that it symbolizes is so disgusting the idea that we're taking kids and putting

[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.580]
them in little uniforms like they all came out of a cookie cutter and they all have to look the

[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.040]
same and go step the same and i'm sorry i can't i don't i don't buy it i don't buy it i think

[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.140]
it's disgusting wait but i think you're talking about the old prokial school uniforms have you

[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.180]
seen some of them lately no i mean some of them are colored little i've had sure i don't i don't

[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.760]
hear what they are i really don't care what they are i don't i don't want the state

[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.900]
yeah or in this case the local school board deciding what kids are going to be wearing

[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.680]
to school i mean having a dress code is one thing and that's fine if it's reasonable you know

[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.180]
if it makes sense but you know what i felt the same way that you did until i had children

[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.940]
and started dressing them for school no i mean really you probably i don't i don't agree

[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.200]
i think you're making much a do about nothing i don't think it have to go through a big song

[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.220]
of dance to dress kids for school however as long as it's within the dress code and they're comfortable

[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.300]
and you're comfortable keeping up with the jones is they're worrying about what everybody else is

[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.800]
looking like i don't think that is significant i think uh you know school is a place for learning

[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.640]
not for a fashion show i realize that but today's generation is a lot different as you go visit

[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.960]
some of the elementary schools you wouldn't believe it you would see what we're talking about anyway

[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:12.360]
well but like what it's not even that they're keeping up with the jones is just that every little

[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.100]
girl isn't today it's not ever people are into fashion now whether across the lot or it doesn't

[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.740]
cross the lot but yeah but you see if you want to send your kids to school for the purpose of

[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.440]
getting good education they don't have to worry about what anybody else is wearing as long as

[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.300]
they're dressed neatly and within whatever the coat dress code is right but when you were a little

[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.160]
that complicated well but when you were little didn't you want with everybody else no

[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.560]
no not when i went to school everybody dressed basically the same and there wasn't any dress code

[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.640]
nor weren't any uniforms and everybody basically within certain parameters were informal

[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:49.600]
sports shirts and pants and skirts and blouses and whatever and that was it it was no nobody cared

[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.000]
about when anybody else was wearing in school but but i think the fashion trends then were a lot

[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.860]
simpler than they are now well then then maybe the parents of this country auto would decide that

[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.440]
you know fashion trends are less important than good education okay well no i don't i look i'm

[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.760]
not saying that i'm saying that you know my children are there to learn and to study but i'm just

[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.420]
saying that all the rest is but but i mean as far as the the school board of the state making

[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.160]
uniforms don't you understand how disgusting that is i mean every place that's that that that

[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.400]
happens it represents a certain authoritarian kind of mentality and i just i can't buy into what

[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:29.120]
it's disgusting okay but what about let's say in some of the public schools where some children

[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.440]
where it's a it's a mixed community where some children are a little bit more fortunate than the

[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.620]
others i think what they're trying to do is make everyone be judged as an individual instead of

[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:43.180]
the material things that they're wearing well i don't know when i went to school i think there

[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.280]
were more emphasis placed on you know who was getting 90s and who was in the top 10 or 15

[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.420]
students in the in the class as opposed to who was wearing designer jeans you know and if that

[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.760]
and if that's something that the that the peddlers of clothing have have conned the parents into

[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.500]
the nets of parents fall okay not anybody else's okay anyway second thing yeah um doesn't

[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.660]
know that you might pass on to comellia south um you know that i was in a public class week and i

[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:14.280]
found out that whatever is not sold in public that that day is trashed yeah they're aware of that

[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.700]
they are aware okay all righty then okay okay you have a good day you two five ten thirty one

[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.800]
she's a nice lady and she's entitled to her opinion but i just uh i don't know it's even worth

[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.080]
having a discussion on this show be a good topic for Steve mm-hmm it's a good contrived debate

[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:35.120]
and it's a real hot topic evidently but i just uh oh god does that rub me the wrong way the idea

[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.340]
in a public school of having the state or the school board decide little uniforms that all the kids

[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.880]
are going to wear mm-hmm have them all look the same pretty soon we'll have them all think the same

[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.880]
and we'll have instead of individual names they'll just be like uh letters you know a bcd or numbers

[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.020]
wouldn't that be good i wonder if george orwell would like this okay we got an open line in brown i

[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.980]
don't know whether to take i don't know whether the screen reader but anna to be honest with you

[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.320]
because i started with all these calls now the phones are filling up and i want to give these numbers

[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.380]
out what should we do got a real crisis right you said it was so much to do and so little time in

[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.160]
which to do you know you said it was vital that we take these calls first well i was a good call

[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.440]
yeah that he was a good call and the birthday call even though you didn't like it that was that was

[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:26.980]
nice well creative ratings i vote what was that what is he trying to say i don't know

[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:32.300]
Roger what are you trying to say i would like to do the ratings oh you want to hear about the ratings

[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.740]
sure okay so those of you are on hold i don't want you to get it well let's take one or two

[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.720]
more because we've got a break coming now seriously and then we'll get into the ratings we'll do

[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:46.060]
it at length candle hello hi Neil how are you Glenn how are you fine good hey uh uh the guy would

[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:52.380]
take you should have stolen can't be done yeah that's right no i don't want to be redundant on this

[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:58.540]
but i had the same opinion as you do here come to brown shirts oh yeah until what a discuss

[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:05.020]
on a way they changed the line i well my daughter 13 years old yeah i said in this church she

[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.660]
listens to the show they won't let her play the i95 uh song in school i don't understand it

[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:20.960]
anyway she said but it would eliminate a lot of peer pressure uh certain classic kids they

[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.620]
dress better they look down on the kids at home so that's the only comment i don't want to

[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.960]
um yeah but you see i know i know i know it's hard to be an individualist and even in the 60s

[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.260]
everybody claimed to be an individualist but they all looked and smelled like each other you know

[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.640]
they all wound up emulating each other but uh one of the very difficult things they like to be

[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.880]
a real individualist do not give it damn about what other people think that that's such an important

[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.340]
thing to teach kids instead of trying to have them all looking the same and keeping up with everybody

[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:53.760]
uh it's not important that's those are not the kinds of artificial things don't mean anything they

[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.820]
don't count they rely don't like you said they are there to get an education that's correct

[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:05.280]
so let's eliminate a little bit of the friction possibly i'm not i'm not addressing them all up

[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:13.060]
the same well oh jeez i i hate it too but then when my daughter said what she did well your daughter

[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.340]
isn't i'm sure she's a bright young girl or all that or hopefully she is hopefully but she's not

[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.160]
the mature enough to make that kind of a decision that's something you was the parent half to

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.480]
decide and you understand the implications of it a lot more clearly than she does that's true trust

[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:31.400]
hope so okay have a good one youtube 1034 at w i o d i want to tell you about siam's dub

[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.420]

[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:08.340]
are steve yeah i thought that that was the straight show anyway let's get to these numbers now

[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.860]

want out of there and maybe a way to get even with them while they're picking in the food maybe

[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.280]

[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.660]

[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.180]
Oh, Sandy went from a point six to a point four there she is

[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.040]
I know if we look long and hard enough we'd find Sandy's number somewhere we got to get a magnum

[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.620]
Let's get one of those magnum visions that night cells in the morning. Okay, let's go down to the drugstore and get one of those

[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:52.260]
Three to seven in the afternoon GTR was number one with the nine seven Zeta from a three five to a seven two

[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.540]
That was the big number. Oh that Mike lions man. He's eating them up and spitting them out. They're doing it

[00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:02.060]
They are doing it and Steve went from a four two up to a four eight in men 18 to 30 40 afternoon

[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.880]
tied for eighth where was Alice?

[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.020]
Oh big pickup point three to a one three

[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:14.020]
You're doing an Alice man. They got we're better watch them. I'm telling you they're on the move. They are moving it

[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.520]
So that's enough and if there's anybody in a business who wants to know anything else we've got everything

[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.720]
That's everything except the book which hasn't been mailed yet. All right. I'm sorry to bore all the rest of you with that

[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.320]
But it's uh, it's compulsory. You know, everybody in a business tunes in critical

[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.080]
I'm getting choked up about it crucial

[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.060]
Feel like Stan

[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:42.220]
Talking to that with no Stogie by the way, you think lunch is gonna show today. I hope so is a little salad or spring would be more desperate

[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:47.620]
We are not listening. I don't think karma and I gave stolen rolls at Gulfstream yesterday our first pick of the season

[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.420]
It comes in and pays 14. What was it?

[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.060]

[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.100]
And I'm so thank you so much. I'm just for my information

[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:02.460]
Oh, that's good for my information the tapestry rotisserie is gonna be providing food at the remote at Toyota Hollywood this weekend

[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.500]
Wow, or incredible

[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.720]
So if you come by early enough, there might be some goodies here from our friend Joe

[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:13.740]
Right now speaking of Toyota of Hollywood what timing that Laura's got a sheen

[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.800]
We want to invite you to come by this Saturday

[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.320]
Steven I are gonna be there from with Neil Rogers on news talk radio six 10

[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:29.500]
It's 1123 at WIOD can we just look at men 18 plus because the station was number one iod with a seven one

[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.020]
Hmm

[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:32.740]
Great and incredible

[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.500]
And in midday let me just take a look at that. Do we do anything

[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.160]
Life was number one with a seven three iod number two from a five one to a six seven

[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:47.740]
In many teen plus, but we haven't turned any corners over here. No, we're not turning any corners

[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:52.120]
We're trying to drive if you pardon the expression on these straight and narrow path and over its data

[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.460]
They're busy turning corners and I think it's very fortuitous

[00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:01.200]
That they had those real good those little uh, you know, big numbers and arrow demographics

[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.860]
A couple of them for Mike lines and one or two for Gonser and they're gonna say oh man

[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.400]
This is it man. Look at each giant numbers and we're really doing it

[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.860]
What they don't understand of course is that the rest of the place is going to hell on a hand basket

[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.040]
But that's good. We hope that they stick with that for a long that classic crock

[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.080]
I've tuned in this morning for the first time in weeks and

[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:23.240]
Campon Dave was out sick again. I think that's three days in a row. He probably saw the book

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:24.100]
and

[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.240]
They're pumping out the same crap that they always pump right, you know

[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.460]
They were talking about their big facts machine and

[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:33.840]
Facts us this and fax us that and um, etc

[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.740]
It was great. It's the closest thing to unlistable. I've heard in a

[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.860]
25.511 and w.w.w.w.w.d. Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, how you doing now? Okay. Hey listen

[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:48.780]
I heard you talking about that um that first ball yesterday around Jeremy. Oh, yeah

[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.180]
Listen when he's gonna be on Steve show. He's an interesting day. Trevor you're

[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.360]
He uh wait a minute. Who said he was gonna be on Steve show? That's what I heard

[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.640]
No, no, I heard Jeff Stryker's gonna be on not Ron Jeremy. Oh

[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:03.020]
Well anyway, you know, he has the ability to feelate himself

[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:07.860]
Yes, I'm aware of that. Oh, okay. I didn't know if he knew that and what you're trying to tell us is that you're jealous, right

[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:12.820]
Now there was one flick that uh, he was in and which he did accomplish that feat as a matter of fact

[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:13.920]
Yeah, I remember seeing you

[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:17.300]
Remember vaguely from sometime in my wayward youth having seen that that is

[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:21.100]
And I told somebody that the other day when he was on with her auto and they didn't believe me

[00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.200]
Yeah, I told a couple of people out there and believe me

[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.040]
They don't believe it is hard to believe, you know

[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:29.020]
But when you're double-jointed, I guess the Lord means for you to do some pretty exciting things

[00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:30.280]
I'd say okay

[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.260]
All right, we'll listen to you. We have a good one now. I hear that jealousy in your voice sir

[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.640]
Okay, five

[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.100]
26 past 11 and W I O D we have an open line and brown

[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:40.660]
I like the way he feelate that was very

[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.360]
Sudo intellectual, wasn't it?

[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:43.820]
That was excellent

[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:50.020]
Great colors. I'm serious. That was that was so delicately and tastefully done if I can if you put that expression

[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:55.980]
Okay, let's see five two four W I O D is an open line and brown and also Palm Beach six five five W I O D

[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.580]
So we got a couple of open lines in the board

[00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.980]
We're all through with the ratings. I realize we probably put most of the audience in a coma

[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:06.860]
But uh tough, you know, that's the brakes. I mean we are that's part of our heavy responsibility in this community

[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:11.240]
And not only that but the phone is fixed it works like a reliving and breathing normal phone

[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:16.340]
So even if you have nothing to say call on those two lines and make us feel good. Okay, because it really looks great

[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.500]
Yeah, especially in Palm Beach, okay

[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.800]
Because we got another 34 minutes that were of course Mike Miller, you know

[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.820]
I never thought about that we can't compete there either

[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.600]
So I were probably finished in Palm Beach through

[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.020]
Margate hello

[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:38.120]
Hi, Neil. Yeah, hi, it's Kim. How you doing Kim? Good. I wanted to call and say thank you for what last week my boyfriend called you

[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.620]
And he asked you

[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.100]
What would be a good place to take his girlfriend for her birthday? Right?

[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.480]
He suggested by Tavarnetta. Yeah, and we went Saturday night. Oh boy. It's great, isn't it? Yes, it was so good

[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.000]
And the service is just so perfect man as soon as you put your water glass down

[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.980]
They fill it up again. I know it's great. Yeah, yeah, I had to feel it was delicious

[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.460]
Mm-hmm that baby cow boy. It's fantastic

[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:08.060]
It was so good. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Oh good. Well, I just wanted to come say thank you. Good. How old were you?

[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.000]
16 16. Yeah, boy. That's a wonderful age now. You don't want to wear uniforms to school do you? No

[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.460]
I didn't think so. It's only these douchebag parents that want their kids to wear uniforms, right? Yeah, I know

[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.860]
Okay, I'm glad you enjoyed it. All right. Bye. Bye. That's great

[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:29.260]
27 patched 11 to W. I. O. D. And we have an opening in Broward if you move quickly now that the phones are gonna work

[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:33.420]
They're not gonna call I mean we do have a lot of calls on there, but it just would be it would be so exciting

[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.540]
Okay, let's do it this way everybody who'd like to have Alan Burke back

[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:45.520]
Oh, seriously everybody that wants the Dean back. Let's get those left, okay? Or if you want Paul Harvey back come on

[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.280]
524 W. I. O. D. in Broward we won't even take the call

[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.480]
We just want to see them flash all right and 655 W. I. O. D. and Palm Beach. Okay, there goes four

[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.400]
There goes six, okay

[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.320]
See we have to go through a retraining process now now that the phone actually works like this

[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.900]
There's years work like that in their two-nown Nick in other words it works normal. Oh my god

[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.500]
This is a day that will live in infamy ladies and gentlemen

[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.160]
Which we and I told you he was the best in the business and here we were mucking around with all these

[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.820]
I mean these other guys are wonderful guys, but they're a little confused

[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:23.480]
You know they've been under a lot of pressure for a long time and mid said no problem

[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:30.520]
And he walked in here no equipment or no screwdriver just waved his hand and immediately liked an active god the phone straightened itself out

[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.300]
He gave it a dirty look as if to say if you don't straighten out you've had it okay

[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:40.980]
We're gonna call in some two-bit private phone company and right away AT&T got the message, okay? It's it's shocking. It really is

[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:48.640]
Uh, hi, Alia. Hello. Hi. What am I being punished about good morning, Neil? I hope I'm not out of line

[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:54.060]
Out of line, Mary Lou. No, not really because you said the 16 year-old

[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:59.540]
You asked her the question about the uniforms and this is what I call the unicorns. Yeah

[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:06.740]
Neil maybe the unicorn will send over lunch today. Boy, that would be fantastic. What that would read. Oh god

[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:10.280]
I would go crazy. I lived too far. I would bring you lunch

[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.060]
No, no, that's okay. Sorry

[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.680]
Neil I'm sorry, but I have to give my response on the uniform

[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:24.480]
Remember the young lady who unicorns? Yeah, the unicorn the young lady who called shortly before 1035

[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.280]
If you say so yes, you don't recall oh yes, I do yeah, okay

[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.720]
She likes the uniforms. Yeah, because she has three kids to dress up in the morning and so on

[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.180]
Well, Neil I do feel the same way you do and I'm not just saying this just about a year

[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:46.420]
No, no, I'm not I've always been this way when I discuss with my friends about how parents

[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:54.580]
Nowadays mainly I just feel that most parents not all but most parents are putting this pressure on our children

[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:58.480]
You realize that since Oprah lost the way she looks worse now than she did before

[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.280]
Not worse, but not too good. Yeah, she looks bad. Yes, you don't I'm not trying to change the subject

[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:09.680]
No, I wanted but I was just thinking of that exploitative show that she did yesterday with those

[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:15.860]
Autistic savants that it was I swear to you and she and she comes out and she's got the gall the hoots bud

[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:20.940]
To look in a camera and say oh, we're not exploiting Robert here. We want you to understand it. No, it's like a freak show honey

[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:27.280]
It was it was tragic. It was so sad. You know and all the all she's doing is a milking it for every dime

[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.780]
She can milk out of it, you know

[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:34.940]
And my mother looks at me and she says in her own naive way. Oh, she has no control over who's on the program

[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.120]
I said to her she owns the company for right out loud

[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:46.000]
It's her production company. She picks the producers. She hires. She fires. She sits down with these douchebags and picks all of these horrible topics

[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:55.060]
Yes, my mother man. He lives in such a naive dream world, you know what I just left a part of it because I was visiting my aunt and

[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:59.920]
Oh, wait a minute. Hold on a second. Okay. No seriously. Oh wait a minute. They already hung up anyway

[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.740]
I was gonna go it says Davie and a hurry and they hung up so don't worry about

[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.780]
They were in such a big hurry. They disappeared

[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:06.600]
But I agree with you

[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.540]
Neil aren't really on this

[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.740]
Uniform in our parents to allow the state to come in and tell our

[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:19.760]
And you don't know the name of that shopping center and the Griffin in university. Do you know? Probably the sheet center

[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:24.500]
The sheet center that could be it because I thought that was the shops of Davie now already did this correction

[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.220]
Because I've been giving people a bum steer about where the armadillo cafe is and it's so good

[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.420]
I don't want people going to the wrong place. It's on Davie Road

[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.560]
In his little hillbilly kind of looking you would relate to it because you know over there in Highlyah you got a lot of

[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.640]
Good Billy Stone. I like to visit that day. You might even find Bill Anderson over there

[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.120]
Bill Anderson is coming out with his own autobiography

[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.700]
An autobiography yeah

[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:50.340]
But when you live in South Florida, you always write an autobiography

[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:56.360]
In fact, I hear that Joe Cocker is writing an autobiography. It's called the Alta Cocker story

[01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.940]
Yeah, I have a free

[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.220]

absolutely not really yeah that means it's true huh probably you know what they

[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.240]
said when anybody in his business is absolutely not that should be the first

[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.740]
clue it can't be done

[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:15.780]
but they said that you guys always talk about everybody else on the radio

[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.820]
and you never talk about them so that must mean that you like them

[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.700]
um personally they're good guys because they love this show so i can't

[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.140]

[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.140]
which i'm going to be opening during the course of the new news

[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.320]
and i'm eagerly i'm hoping

[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.400]
that they're real good ones

[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.280]
yeah i'm not just looking one on a year

[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.700]
i like those maxel ones

[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.780]
and let me say it again

[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:55.560]
if you're tape

[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:57.900]
in other words if you don't have it by now

[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:00.880]
we do have a couple of boxes that rich still has to dump small boxes

[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.260]
don't panic small boxes

[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:05.740]
but if it doesn't come in the next couple of days

[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.460]
oh look at this a key and a brand new still in the wrapper

[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.160]
could i need these will be coming in for the next couple of weeks

[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.920]
keep them on away now don't forget you'll never see it again

[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.060]
okay don't say that we misrepresented it or we did this

[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:21.560]
we did you will never ever see the tape again

[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.580]
because the deadline has long since passed okay

[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:28.000]
long since passed i mean what was it last Thursday

[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.940]
yeah almost a week now if you didn't if you got a blank tape

[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:32.800]
let's see and don't understand recording yourself

[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.140]
but what is this

[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:36.360]
boy they think of it

[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:39.400]
wait a minute what is this this tape is essentially

[01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:43.740]
inaudible half your recording is drowned out by the existing music

[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:46.860]
well when you send us a tape that's got stuff on it

[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:50.280]
that's not going to start a bulker racing all the cassettes

[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.600]
they don't have time for that

[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.060]
so i guess that's another one that i'm going to know that

[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.020]
well i'll leave it up to rich you can do whatever because it's a cheap

[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.460]
it's a crappy tape look at that and profile

[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.060]
come on pal don't be sending us a bunch of cheap crappy tape

[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.280]
who is this from

[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.020]
b r

[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.000]
oh this is the one that don't even look at this

[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000]
it's got insufficient potenton i'm not giving this to it out

[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.360]
when in doubt throw it out

[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.460]
i don't even know if i want to keep the cassette

[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.040]
although it might be interesting to hear what's on it

[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:23.220]
fat ritt says he's sending out about a hundred tapes on Thursday

[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.480]
okay that's what he says

[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:27.380]
that's a message we just got on our hot little screen

[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:29.340]
we got a couple of open lines in brown

[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.880]
if you want to get online for the big 12 to 1 hour

[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:36.960]
the number is 524 wio d 524 9463

[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:39.560]
and i'm going to open these last one and if they like i said

[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.820]
if you continue if you're dumb enough to keep sending them in

[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.960]
you know we love all of checks for the Camilo sounds

[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.760]
that's great terrific they are much appreciated they can

[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.080]
continue using the money but as far as you're ever ever

[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.700]
seeing these tapes again on a scale of zero your chances

[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.700]
double minus infinity okay if they're such a thing

[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.660]
you're getting a good collection of new tape

[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.520]

Sony is not really that's not the high class

[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.240]
okay we like max cells and tdk's but Sony will do

[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.820]
and of course the rest of this is going straight in the old

[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:15.740]
