[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260]
okay no time for foolishness today boy we really got to some heavy duty

[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.500]
stuff to do today right

[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.300]
uh... like what

[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.420]
now we do we have a lot of things talk about first of all the uh... bottom

[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.960]
editorial in the heraldous morning howl and a little versus nea rogers i guess

[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.880]
is a backhanded the piece of support very backhanded very much him

[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.000]
it's interesting the thing where it says the attacks on the city and it's

[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.240]
older people escalated and became uglier

[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.320]
which is an outright lie because they didn't escalate they didn't become

[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.220]
uglier and that we haven't even talked about howl and a little for the last

[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.540]
uh... year and a half basically other than the little stuff that we play the

[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.880]
stick

[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.240]
but nonetheless the bottom line is they've got a right to change stations

[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.600]
are turned

[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.900]
off and i guess uh... you know

[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.400]
for the heraldous really great

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.720]
uh... also there's a letter to the editor and at other famous on campus paper

[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.360]
which we won't even mention anymore eric

[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.200]
who is a junior dm we thank eric for his thoughtful and sensible letter

[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.680]
good letter light a long in the uh... sunset will has an article

[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.000]
halem dale seeks crosswalk to curb jaywalkers

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.100]
which i think is really uh... the commission agreed to spend thirteen thousand

[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.900]
dollars to erect a four-foot high wooden fence

[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.720]
and three cross walks between northeast fourteen to have an inlaying bullivard

[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.280]
there were installed in april of eighty eight

[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.660]
after six pedestrians were killed as they tried to jaywalk across east

[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.920]
allen they'll be full of art

[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.980]
two more killed in jenuary eighty seven

[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.020]
and two more in june

[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.900]
but i guess that was just a big joke that we were talking about people getting

[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.260]
killed jaywalking and howl

[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.480]
we were hallucinating again

[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.380]
also i've got a letter here from martin from bcc whose handwriting is just

[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.920]
like adam from hollywood

[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.060]
this is the letter talks about my poor grammar

[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.360]
i was going to read it and then i'm sitting here and i thought to myself for

[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.780]
that handwriting looks so familiar

[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.940]
and then adam from hollywood who keeps writing to tell me that i say grotesque

[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.500]
too often

[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.720]
and then on alternate days rights that i don't say it often enough

[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.620]
so martin

[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.020]
slash adam thank you so much for your thoughtful letter

[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.980]
but we just don't have time to get into it

[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.660]
today

[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.600]
also yesterday one of the true radio slime balls in the history of this

[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.860]
industry was appearing on the steve keenshow

[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.180]
and i was listening to it

[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.300]
on my way home and then in the house i turned it on until he left just to see

[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.980]
how all you know how often the attacks would occur

[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.600]
there's some people if you could be talking about

[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.040]
brain surgery inside beryl

[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.860]
and so they would somehow manage to drag me into the conversation rick citer

[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.140]
minne is one of those people

[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.020]
uh... the word through the grapevine is that i'm not saying this to promote him

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.760]
i'm saying it because i have some comments to make about it

[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.980]
word through the grapevine is that w j n o which is losing and i don't know

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.920]
whether i should use that word losing their afternoon drive guy

[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.200]
uh... jeff

[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.260]
charles who

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680]
it stays about four or five weeks at every stage that he works at any their

[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.520]
leaves of his own accord or is asked to leave

[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.600]
uh... the word is that mr. citer minne allegedly is going to be replacing him

[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.220]
up there released that's uh... the rumor

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.320]
what is true

[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.520]
uh... it's going to be great for us because he'll give me more publicity in

[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.280]
pombi chanye than i've ever had because i'm sure that he'll never be able to

[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.460]
allow a day to go by uh... without doing his usual personal vitriolic attack

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.360]
against me

[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.400]
of course was interesting with bob quen's terrier today had the two of them

[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.240]
kind of become a solebrothers he's to take all of these unrelated douche bags

[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.440]
these uh... chronic uh... regulars

[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.460]
and kind of ties them all together

[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.500]
and so really doesn't get into different and making difference what the

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.780]
principle is anymore it's just the the common thread that they all have is that

[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.920]
they hate me with a passion

[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.400]
which is why steve once upon a time was so friendly with a certain attorney of

[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.900]
ours who

[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.020]
uh... isn't too fond of me

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.220]
and now that i'm here is uh... finding himself on the other side of the fence

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.980]
but at any rate uh...

[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.560]
citerman made his usual obnoxious attacks yesterday and i'm not going to

[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.540]
dignified by defending or responding

[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.740]
but i will just say this for rick citerman to call me or anyone else a big it

[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.000]
is one of the most

[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.800]
incredible jokes in the history of the human race okay here is one of the most

[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.820]
home of virulent homophobic people

[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.560]
i have ever met in my life and of course now with mister cunstier who's his new

[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.480]
found pal his male bonding buddy if you pardon that expression uh... he denies

[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.240]
that he's homophobic it's just that having met niel roger suddenly made him

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.960]
like this well i got news for you uh... i've spent about a total of five

[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.600]
minutes of my lifetime in the presence of mr citerman other than one show

[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.420]
that he appeared on his a guest at w i n z i think he was a guest if i can recall

[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.740]
oh yes he came as a guest representing the republican party of date county

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.120]
but other than that outside of that program i've spent a total of five

[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.420]
minutes in his presence i think that time was when he walked into the studio here

[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.820]
when um... were you on with me that day or time jica

[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.240]
when i was on with steve before we came on the air here yeah i wasn't and i came

[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.320]
in and picked up the microphone on that and tried to himself to be on the show

[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.760]
yeah i miss that but other than that uh... rick citerman didn't know a damn thing

[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.080]
about me i've never spent any time with him thank god i have no intention of

[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.820]
doing it um even though when i first came here i was being pressured by a certain

[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.860]
a party to uh... become part of that little

[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.460]
could a re of uh... miss it and uh... you know

[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.780]
here's a guy who is a and out it out homophobic i think he even challenges

[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.180]
mike topsin in that category that's really saying a lot

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.200]
white topsin in this community is one of the real champions there are some

[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.060]
others but uh... i think citerman is right in there

[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.520]
and back in the days when surely speller berg was on w k t and then with the late

[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.080]
john broward on uh... two or three different stations uh... he continued his

[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.620]
vitriola comophobic attacks against me and against a gays in particular

[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.920]
but now of course he uh... just discovered that it's only against me uh... since

[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.900]
he's found a good buddy and mr. kunst uh... mr. kunst of course never

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.380]
defends anyone if they don't happen to be one of his um... underlings and since

[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.760]
he only has about three or four underlings obviously uh... they are the only

[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.260]
people who are involved in so-called gay rights etc but it's not worth going

[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.400]
into a long thing about but i did hear it

[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.540]
and i was not surprised okay because the man is just unable to um... control

[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.340]
himself and evidently the reason steve steve was unable to control himself

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.860]
yesterday because with these rumors spreading that this individual very

[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.640]
shortly is going to be having his own show and we know the people of jano

[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.660]
certainly wouldn't allow him to even call in because they're so paranoid up

[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.580]
there they won't even let me call him nisho

[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.520]
uh... so that was his last

[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.840]
gas of having mr. x on the show and believe me

[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.820]
fifty cents of by a real cool cup of coffee okay

[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.200]
it's a problem it's past ten at w i o d also craig was here yesterday with a

[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.460]
great day and uh... really hope that he lands something very soon i hope he

[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.200]
doesn't want up on a street for a long period of time like some other

[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.700]
friends of mine in the business because he just

[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.140]
he's too nice of a guy and too good of a talent to deserve being out on a

[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.840]
street and the reason i mentioned that is because here allegedly they're

[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.900]
gonna hire they got an opening a jano and they're gonna hire a guy who at best

[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.200]
has been a weekend and fill in person uh... ultra right wing virulently homophobic

[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.440]
and i guess he fits in with a jano mentality up there with a pattern of what they

[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.000]
want to appeal to but here stand majors out of a job

[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.520]
craig warthing's now available and they're going to put a guy like that and so it

[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.440]
goes to show you what kind of uh... typical folks there up there and what this

[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.300]
business is all about okay but you're right he will do entire series about you

[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.800]
on a question about it because he is obsessed yeah he is obsessed with a

[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.680]
hatred toward me that is just a beyond belief just as some of steves other

[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.220]
friends and guests are obsessed with that same hatred as i said that seems to

[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.920]
be the common thread that ties them together i don't want to mention ellis because

[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.780]
uh...

[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.060]
well no it's obvious i mean there was a show about a year and a half ago at least i

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.540]
got room wind of it when we were on uh...

[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.440]
they were on zeta

[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.480]
maybe an i and z and my name came up of course is it so often used to on that show

[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.620]
as it even did again yesterday in the conversation and uh... ellis became allegedly

[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.340]
this is what we were told became so uh... emotional and apoplectic of what

[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.080]
discussing me that he had a walk out in the hall

[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.680]
take a little breather because he was so uh... hysterical about me i have no idea why

[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.740]
although the common thread again seems to be homophobia

[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.980]
and uh... i don't think he would deny that because his track record on that in this

[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.380]
community is legendary

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.420]
anyway it's ten thirteen we're going to be on that uh... channel seven thing

[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.360]
inside story at seven o'clock tonight for probably about thirty seconds

[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.480]
right now if your car is looking old

[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:09.660]
and

[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:09.660]

[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.360]
and the

[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.680]
right

[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.000]
and i thought this car now if these people are going to keep giving us these

[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.640]
cards that are so loose

[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.520]
this is from our friends chronic productions which is the board of two of

[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.000]
them better to play little games and we just appreciate it so much but i mean

[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.380]
well if it's right in with this week this has been a technical week of

[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.040]
the station

[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.460]
that's like an ongoing nightmare i mean i just uh... can't believe that all

[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.840]
of us been going on and i love the uh... have you noticed in the news now that

[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.760]
bob sopare is like in a little box member senior wedges

[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.140]
he's got a little head in the box

[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.960]
yeah and every time anybody starts to the news sopars starts talking except when

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.260]
they call for him then he's not there but when they're doing the news all of

[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.840]
a sudden sopare mostly uh... freezing today and all that stuff it's just one

[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.700]
a week this has been more incredible

[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.700]
anyway before we get to anything else we have uh... something monumental here

[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.940]
ladies and gentlemen doesn't happen too often but you have probably we won't

[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.460]
get any calls today because our whole audience is retired now

[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.740]
and they're off to spend their riches but yesterday we continue plug it away

[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.700]
in spite of our bad racing luck at Gulfstream and uh... the bird in the fifth

[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.080]
race gave you heavy chalk nine to five eight to five of the fanaties but he won

[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.740]
wire to wire basically yeah that's all that man one by two lengths paid five

[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.860]
twenty and then if you would have been a hundred let's see if you figure out a

[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.040]
parlay is anybody got a pen now we don't have a pen well let me try to do it

[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.440]

[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.180]
hundred and sixty if you would have parlay let's say just bet two hundred of

[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.360]

[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.120]
one up with almost two grand for your two hundred if you would have parlayed

[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.760]

[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.260]

[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.520]
race anyway what was i starting to do before we got sidetracked there i was going to talk of

[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.000]
chorus at length about the a channel seven piece which i'm ecstatic about was on last night

[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.800]
somebody is not too happy because his face kept getting blocked out totally well see what you're

[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.980]
forgetting is that the guy who did the pieces from upstate new york so he didn't like me with you

[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.080]
that's correct you're getting even with you for all the nasty things that you've done to upstate

[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.900]
new york people and uh... you were just every once in a while you'd see like a little piece of the

[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:02.780]
bird act background yeah fat rich was there prominently in the foreground over and over and over again

[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.540]
so you're just jealous is what it was not a sensational piece it wasn't good it was sensational

[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.960]
i agree they didn't rip anybody to be honest with him which is so unusual rc's pieces go this good but

[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:19.260]
no great one all viny's back yeah what do you want

[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.660]
i miss that i'm a man of the day yeah i'm a fan of the seventh race today going on six to one

[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.280]
fabulous fan he with mic and zalas that's it to maryle horse you're going to win a lot of money i

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:38.040]
got to go i got people here to buy bivini fabulous fanny in the seven but my point is that you

[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.500]
would have thought a minute aren't you impressed you just gave us a horse at six to one in the

[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.300]
morning line with mic and zalas no less i'm impressed with his first tip yeah i like the first one a

[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.540]
lot better yeah it's still it's still making a desperate drive in a stretch bany but i don't think

[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.260]
he's going to quite get there okay we got to do a little break here let's do things on time and try

[00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.600]
to run i now let me just see something okay all the people that saw the piece on channel seven last

[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.620]
night and we see a little emotion on the phone here because yesterday i needed that piece last night

[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.160]
to be honest with you because the show yesterday was the colors were so bad that i think we said

[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.240]
new look at this look at this the three lines in date were already lit there's one one person saw

[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.280]
there's a bokeh i'm not going to give you the numbers you know what the numbers were already okay

[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.040]
don't play this hard to get there's uh seven oh there they go yeah for you people you're there

[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.720]
sharp as a matsu ball today let me tell you that it's eleven past ten at w i b if i have to

[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.220]
earn more james taylor and johnny rivers records man i mean enough is enough anyway we're just

[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.980]
talking about the business here johnny dark is here not to be on the air just to eat of course

[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:43.760]
because uh well look we feed unemployed radio people on this show we have a long standing record

[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.300]
doing that we believe in that by the way if you've got some blankets and sweaters the committals

[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:52.160]
haha i'm not joking about this they need them desperately they ran out of blankets last night at

[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.200]
there and tonight's going to be even colder than last night which i think should be illegal in this

[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.560]
state but um so if you've got some blankets and the sweaters either of the above or both take them

[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.600]
on down call a committals house make arrangements to get them down there before tonight because

[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.980]
they desperately need them okay okay it's ten fifteen i can't believe this all the lines you'll let

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.300]
as soon as i mentioned johnny dark's name like a hot i got blushed because they were afraid that we

[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.140]
were going to talk to johnny on the air it was kind of like the old forever the mike spindle syndrome

[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.500]
mike was tremendous for that you could be sitting here dying not have a call on the board and

[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.920]
mention that mike spindle just came in and every line would light up not to talk to mike but just

[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.820]
to avoid that mike will get on the air okay just to make sure that we would take calls true that's

[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.020]
the anyway channel seven i thanked them profusely that was a good segment on inside story is that

[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.060]
the right name of the show or that story it was on last night and it was the longest piece it was

[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:47.240]
the last piece but it was a long segment four or five minutes on are you out of your mind it was

[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.220]
about much longer than that one of the five seven or eight minutes holy to tell our business all

[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:57.860]
yeah amazing guaranteed and and they had sunny rose and bergona sunny would you like to see my

[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.060]
hate mail i'd be more than happy to show you it gets one anonymous card there which was a horrendous

[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.260]
thing with swastik is on it and right away the suggestion as well the comedy has gone too far how

[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.620]
how'd you like to see my hate mail sunny from last thirteen years see the problem with sunny is

[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:18.980]
like typical a hellendale no sense of humor none zero taking himself too seriously and of course if

[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.980]
you get ever did you see those bifocals anywhere there is thick is the mont Palamart telescope so maybe

[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:29.280]
that's part of the problem okay i i agree it was a good piece but i do want to say what just one

[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.440]
all here we go another try are you going to embarrass and humiliate yourself in front of the entire

[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.740]
audience and be childish and juvenile because you didn't get on it wasn't a piece about you or

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.720]
i really have a piece about the show was about me i understand that and it wasn't your way into

[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.760]
a lot of other things and you were and when they showed the thing at i and z not only were you on

[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.060]
there but even mark kiln was on there well which was my only complaint about the piece the fact

[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.880]
that we had to see mark kiln and did you notice how fat i was in that thing at i and z did you

[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.580]
see that yeah boy i had a puppet the size of my rush more the size of our lean rosses but

[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.480]
go ahead go ahead and do it i'm not going to interrupt

[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:15.480]
well i'll i'll sound like it's sour grapes oh well see i've been trying to avoid you doing that

[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.120]
you're part of the show so if we get some free publicity when we work for this station you got

[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.880]
any publicity you get as a bonus by the way john thank you so much for the beautiful business card

[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.500]
this is one of steves listeners by the way this is the guy who was in here with the space queen

[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:35.720]
and dean or whatever he has sent me business cards that are so shocking now when we go let's see a

[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.280]
week from tomorrow i think or sunday we're going to be a Toyota Hollywood steven i'm going to

[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.860]
sign these just to get rid of them we got a thousand pink cards and what they say is nil that's

[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:50.420]
all it says in little tiny print it looks like the the size of the w n n audience on there that's how

[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.180]
small that john thank you so much they're beautiful and the pink of course adds a little

[00:16:55.180 --> 00:17:00.620]
touch that i couldn't do myself we got a mobile and bokeh hello oh nil yes sir oh i just

[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.200]
wanted to tell you so that piece last night and you were terrific wasn't either i thought it was

[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:12.040]
very fair uh i thought it was up front didn't knock you or just all things the way it was and uh only

[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.420]
thing the birds should have sent himself a little more maybe it'll give them a little more coverage

[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:20.080]
you know exactly if he would have just stood up and said hey you jackass i'm over here too why don't

[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.740]
you take a you know a couple of shots of me but he just sat there early as you were just being

[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:31.580]
oblivious we saw him cacol and that was uh fine back by accident yeah yeah also if you see boon

[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:37.520]
today uh tell him i ate there again last Friday after uh i heard you talk about it it was a second

[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.120]
time there and it was terrific science dog correct answer all the only thing is uh every time i'm

[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.920]
there everybody's there for the first time because they heard about it on your show well there's no

[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.720]
problem with that that's the idea that's what it's all about it's running out of curry pop oh that's

[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.820]
great stuff boy well we got uh past week coming into the day joe is going to bring a little feast

[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.340]
is more causing we had all day yesterday isn't it well yesterday was just today not to be here

[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.140]
yeah really how do you know they're legitimate well you're right one that's correct that's more

[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.120]
than we had all day yesterday in fact once we should have left after my neighbor right in the

[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.140]
beginning of the show oh also i'm not can't disclose it today because it was off the record but i

[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.900]
was just told some very interesting and positive news from the University of Miami really some

[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.400]
information that'll be coming on a couple of days huh 20 minutes after 10 at w i o d we got a

[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:51.720]
mobile in Palm Beach hello and i told you we had some good calls there and i want to ask you

[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:58.440]
some i'd be a friend's mom will see a party you don't know i have his mobile phone yeah how can

[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.000]
they say you know brothers are out of talk so like what i mean i'd be tired listening to your

[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:12.880]
y that you know the need you cool dude oh okay nipsy have it i stay 20 past 10 at w i o d the

[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.740]
Palm Beach Line is open. That's one of the best calls we've had on the Palm Beach Line

[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.960]
in a long time by the way, which should really tell you a lot.

[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.000]
655-9463-655-WIOD. I bet you the people at JNO are really pissed too, the fact that

[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.140]
we were on Channel 7 actually penetrates it a little bit into Palm Beach County.

[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.220]
And if anybody up there saw it in Palm Beach, they're really going to be paranoid over there.

[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.660]
Because at JNO, they want to be the only station on the air.

[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.500]
They want to be the only guests on the air. They're just, they don't, you know, they're

[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.860]
not selfish or anything. They just want everybody else to go away.

[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.040]
And then they still only have a 10 share, which I don't understand.

[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.540]
If they were the only station, they would have a 10 share.

[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.140]
Which means the other 90% of the people would just go on protest.

[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.560]
Hey, listen, talking about a great, great restaurant.

[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.400]
I don't know if you've ever eaten. I mean, you talk about unglued.

[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.940]
Anyways, 23 past 10 at WIOD. Johnny Dark is here.

[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.100]
And look at this. Now, what is this? If this is what I think it is, I'm going to be very excited.

[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.240]
It is. Oh boy, Bob Savage. You're a wonderful American, a great guy.

[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.440]
And here it is. It's my past two. Highly.

[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.500]
Boy, am I excited about that. Let's see. Highly opens on March the fifth that

[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:30.060]
should be. Shouldn't it? No, it's March 8th March 8th and runs through May 28th.

[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.780]
And I can't wait for that. I was going to say, I love, you know, I love Gulf

[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.560]
Stream, which I do. And I love, um, highly and not the city so much, but I love the

[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.500]
track and the flamingos and the racing. Beautiful. And it is beautiful.

[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.420]
It's breathtaking, magnificent. And well, look at that.

[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.380]
Actually, two passes for the price of one. Well, I'll sell one here on the show's

[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.380]
over. Okay, it's 1024 at WIOD Miami. Hello. Neil. Yeah.

[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.500]
You look really good on TV last night. Yeah. I'm sure.

[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.980]
But I tell you that lady she had it in for you. What lady is that?

[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.340]
The one who wrapped the story. Oh, yeah. She seemed to think that you were going

[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.960]
to spend some time in jail or she wanted you to spend time in jail.

[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.100]
No, that wasn't her. That was somebody else we know in radio land, not her.

[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.940]
Well, I just thought I'd show you some support and give Helen Dale held that old man.

[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.320]
I tell you that old man, Sonny boy, just keeps rolling along, doesn't he?

[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.180]
He was all right. Yeah, he's a panic. Well, it's nice to know. You know, I think he's

[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.460]
appropriate for Helen Dale. I mean, let's face it, if they had a teenager for mayor

[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.480]
in Helen Dale, it wouldn't quite fit, you know? Okay, keep it up now.

[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.460]
Okay, I'm trying by. Now look at that. We've had three calls in a row.

[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.340]
And another second one was good for a couple of laughs.

[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.260]
This guy sounded young and human and fairly rational. I can't believe this.

[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.640]
Well, seriously, have you ever been able to figure out all the years you've been in the

[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.100]
picture? You don't do talk shows. You play music. So you don't have to depend on the

[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.840]
callers, but you've seen the way it happens. It comes in waves. Now, here we got four

[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.820]
million people within the sound of our voice. No, no two of whom have anything in common,

[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.820]
whatsoever. They don't speak to each other. They hate each other. But when it comes to

[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.960]
the way they respond and this from the first month, I was at KT, of course, in the

[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.600]
beginning, there's the honeymoon period. Oh, you're a breath of fresh air.

[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.640]
But after a couple of weeks, surely, you know, then there were those days when nobody

[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.680]
on the station could buy many calls. Now, does there anything logical that explains

[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.840]
that to you? No, but it's true. It's true. It comes and goes in in streaks. And I

[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.540]
noticed yesterday it was a very, very bizarre day. And you know, Monday and Tuesday, we sat

[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.580]
down here and never had to give the numbers out. And again, today, for whatever reason,

[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.720]
they're making a gigantic comeback. Like they're getting their last wind. Oh, yes, Dave,

[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:48.460]
it's like the worst since we've been here. Like I said, their last wind. Is his mic

[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.920]
gone, by the way, I don't it is. It is. He's speaking into the mic. No, he talks real

[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.440]
way in a minute. Yes, what? Yeah, I'm there. Oh, you're there. I'm just like off in the

[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.300]
background. Yeah, but you know, those, uh, disjockey types, you know, they like, um, in

[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.920]
tone way off in the background because they want to hear the voice bouncing off the mic.

[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.440]
I didn't you say yesterday it was going to be a, uh, just a very short piece on Channel

[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.200]
7. I thought so. And so I didn't watch it because you said it was going to be real short.

[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.680]
You didn't watch it. Well, I do happen to have it on videotape. Okay. Five bucks of seating.

[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.980]
I'll be more than. Well, I'll you to watch. Well, you don't watch seven. You have this

[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.480]
like strange. Oh, KT is in a control room again. Now Marvin, don't, don't speak to him.

[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.160]
Dispretending he's not there. Ignoring him. Don't tell him what time any spots are

[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.740]
on the log because sometimes we have to move him around a little bit and he gets these,

[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.460]
he gets his clients all emotional and all their lives. It was not in the right time. We

[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.560]
give him a three minute spot. Okay. And right away, I was not on the right time. You

[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.020]
to see, we don't do the spots, KT for you or the client. We do them for the audience so

[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.540]
they can go in there and spend their money and have all those delicious meals and whatever

[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.980]
else it is. They're buying. Don't tell them anything, Marvin. I got the time. Tom, we

[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.440]
already did it. Tell them we already did the spot. Don't tell them anything. Okay.

[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.240]
There he comes. The pick a time out of a hat. Good. That's what we got rid of him. Okay.

[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.660]
It's 1028 at W.I.O.D. and we want to welcome Dennis Collins over at WNWS. We're sure he's

[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.920]
monitoring today. We want to welcome all of people over at the Winds and Zeta. We heard

[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.900]
that they're listening. Say hi to Stan and Laurie who are on their way up the coast for

[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.960]
little trip today. Who else do we want to speak to? Certainly all the people at the big

[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:24.640]
stations like the Motivation Station, WKT, all of the people who sit inside the automation

[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.400]
machines on some of the famous stations. We want to say hi to them because we know as

[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.180]
soon as we have some numbers here, man, we're going to just puke them out on the year

[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.980]
all through the show. Yeah. Bill Wise is here. He's actually going to say hi to Rose

[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.460]
Folger because I know that he gets the numbers second hand from Arquil and he'll probably

[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:46.100]
get him faster from us. Okay. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Miami. Yeah. Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.720]
Yeah. I'm calling up here from Franklin Aviation out here next to the Miami International Airport.

[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.820]
Yeah. Yeah. What I'm calling about is we're trying to put a chalk down, take them off

[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.480]
a watch. Now I'm in chalk airlines. They've been there since 1930. I know. It's ridiculous.

[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.820]
Yeah. Don't you think? Yeah. Are you a bummer? Yeah. We make all the parts for them

[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:10.400]
is what we're doing up here. I don't think they ought to do that. I'm with you, pal. Yeah.

[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:17.260]
All right. Thanks for having me. Okay, man. Bye. Great call. Good one. It was. It was. It was good.

[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.840]
He's got a point. I agree with him. They're really trying to screw up this town. And by the way,

[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.240]
Bryant Gumbel, get out of town already. Will you and take that big fat Willard Scott with you too.

[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.780]
Much of douchebags are they come in here. They bring all the cold weather from the north. That's

[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.200]
why we got this cold snap because of the day show. That's right. Don't play my pals over at CBS.

[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:39.400]
They're good folks. Okay. It came down for derailleur. Great folks. It's NBC and the peacock fluid

[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.980]
down here with a molecule weather. So take it back where you came from Jane and Bryant. And

[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:49.760]
especially Willard. That willard. I've got to tell you she did it. They did a piece this morning.

[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.280]
Jane Paulie did it on the keys and they had an environmentalist on and some developer.

[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.180]
They were on and hear these poor guys that get all dressed up in their suits and they come all

[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.200]
the way up here and all of this but they were on a matter of seconds TV and like in the middle,

[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.620]
but the point is before they came on, they had Willard Scott outside with the Cliff. What's his name

[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:15.680]
from Channel 4? The guy with the roadmap on his face. And they're yucking it up and laughing and

[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.720]
bouncing around and they're using Willard's head as a bowling ball and just you know and all kinds

[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.980]
of time. Nothing about the weather of course because Willard doesn't really do the weather. He's just

[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.820]
at the clown and they must have done three or four minutes of that crap and then these poor guys

[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.580]
come on and they're trying to do an intelligent piece and they each said maybe 20 seconds worth

[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:39.220]
or whatever and Jane says well and of course we thank you so much for sharing that with us and

[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.840]
we'll be back in 844 on today on NBC. They weren't on for a minute between the two of them okay

[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.940]
I'm not exaggerating not for a minute and their priorities on that show are so screwed up man. I

[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.780]
mean who the hell are who the people producing that crap? She doesn't listen to what the guest says

[00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:00.340]
either. Well then I have time to listen to what the guest think because they're all goosing her like

[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.520]
hey it's time to get off man the peacock is goosing her which is why she always looks under

[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.060]
duress. If you're being goosed for an hour and a half you'd be under duress too it's 1031

[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:16.860]
at WIOD is a Bryant 1037 at WIOD so those are the first numbers off the computer WIOD

[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:22.360]
48 to a 47 so that's basically flat. Yeah we don't know what we didn't this day part yet we'll

[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:28.120]
find out shortly and GTR over there went from what did you say a 28 to a 39? Something like that.

[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.720]
So they evidently straightened out that flutant that they had when they interviewed only people

[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.020]
under the age of three. Anyway we have an open line in Broward 524 well it does happen you

[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:42.520]
know those diary fallouts that's what the Rose has been saying for two years now but somehow

[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:51.240]
they just aren't buying it. Open line in Broward 5249463 524WIOD West Palm Beach hello. Yeah this

[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:56.360]
is right from Forstay and Lucy and I got my wife hooked on your show she's probably listening

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:02.080]
right now. What's your name? Lynn she's a visiting nurse. Lynn? Lynn she loved you. How you doing Lynn?

[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:09.080]
Anyway you know you're talking about Bryant Gumbo and them and I call him Bryant Gumby and they

[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:15.120]
got such a corny set update they always start the show with a real serious conversation for about a

[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.920]
few seconds and then what you're saying like one day they said well we're going to have this

[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.000]
thing about crayons being poisonous you know and so I got kids and I was thinking oh I can't

[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.180]
wait to hear this but they started to talk about a bull on there and they never even got to it

[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:37.040]
and this day I don't know. Well that's because Willard was doing a six-minute routine. Yeah but anyway

[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.420]
that they ought to replace those people I don't know. Well the show is doing very well don't you?

[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.460]
Yes number one great in the morning for whatever well first of all part of the reason they do

[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:50.020]
great is because Kathleen Sullivan is busy getting ready to cry on CBS and when you get up in the

[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:53.420]
morning you don't want to look at somebody who looks like she's been crying for half hour. Yeah

[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.720]
she always looks like she's been crying or she's about to cry she's got that sad look and of

[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:04.560]
course the guy who's with her Harry Smith or whatever his name is. He has the typical CBS

[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.400]
pseudo intellectual look that most of America can't relate to it all he looks like a college professor

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.400]
or something America doesn't want to see that they want to see a a a wacko like Willard Scott. Yeah

[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.640]
most of the TV stuff is just trash anyway you know it's because they're way better. You love every

[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.200]
minute of it. But anyway you got a great show and you know keep keep up the good work.

[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.660]
Okay so I had all my pals in Port St. Lucie and tell them there's a big sheet sale this weekend.

[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:33.080]
See you later. 1040 at WIOD we have an opening in Palm Beach which has been pretty damn active

[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:38.860]
already 655 WIOD don't you think we ought to be getting something tangible now?

[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.380]
What do you mean? I mean Mike Disney just came in and he smiled and puked and made

[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.480]
a little tap dance there but shouldn't we be getting like a copy of something should we have like

[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.980]
Sharon or somebody running up and down the hall so that we can have this breaking news

[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.140]
it'll break it'll break just be patient it'll be it'll not try to be pushy or anything but I just

[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.220]
we like to have it as it's coming off the computer well this will be of interest to you John

[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:09.140]
in the USA today this morning the title is the Vio thing and it says the Cincinnati Vio Rogers

[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.520]
the Cincinnati Clary on Hotel announced yesterday it has removed Vio from its menu because of the

[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.180]
conditions under which calves are raised according to people for the ethical treatment of animals

[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:27.400]
many Vio calves are chained by the neck in 22 by 56 inch crates um Robert Hobie the manager says

[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.240]
I'm sure if I get new how the calf spin we have a bulletin they would want the you're not going

[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:36.880]
to want to continue with that when you hear that when you hear this do you want to hear it

[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:44.060]
Sharon just brought in a bulletin from the computer oh 12 plus numbers WIOD overall 4.8 to

[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:49.220]
a 4.7 probably part of the area where we went down was on a weekend with the dolphins going on

[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.840]
although I don't know with that antique show we ought to be pretty strong

[00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:00.400]
WNWS overall went from a 36 to a 32 so we beat him by a point and a half they're dropping

[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:08.760]
like a rock Paul Simon is singing like a rock mid days on WIOD we went from a 4.6 to a 5.8

[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:19.120]
oh my that's a nice good WNWS midday Sandy oh Sandy's dropping like a not like a rock like a

[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:25.100]
what do you call a meteorite okay that's how heavily she's dropping from a 39 to a 32

[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.420]
everyone Sandy was doing fours and fives in midday because she was unopposed virtually

[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.500]
she was unopposed by the way you hear my story about the dean in Philadelphia is doing so poorly that

[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.400]
the GM and the sales manager were both fired at WCAU because they were the ones that brought

[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.820]
him up there doing that bad the dean can't understand it either and now the news that you've all

[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:46.900]
been waiting for ladies and gentlemen you do have a lot of that I was too tense of a point off by

[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:53.040]
the way in my prediction I was a little high little high oh oh oh oh I wish we had you know

[00:31:53.040 --> 00:32:00.100]
what we need that dramatic uh we don't have the dramatic organ music but we do have this okay the

[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:08.460]
kernel ladies and gentlemen on WZTA we left there we left them a 5.5 share in just one book the

[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.860]
kernel cut it in half to a two eight but now that he lost our last month there here it is I don't

[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:22.360]
even bring myself to say it a one six in the morning on Zeta from a 5.5 in one book and one

[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.880]
trend to a one six I think unprecedented in the enoles of radio history ladies never seen

[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:35.540]
like it incredible shocking and they turned the corner red Zeta yeah one six God from a five four

[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.020]
and that was a group there was a special group at U Totem that they had the diaries for the

[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:44.380]
kernel show that they couldn't find anybody that one one six that could be well it's right in

[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.900]
there with the all-time records we'd have to go back and check them out I would the kernel what you

[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.540]
know bill wise was crying in the halls when we lost the kernel to Zeta and he said to me I don't

[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.400]
think we can ever bounce back on GTR they got to really be dancing in kazanski next door here

[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.040]
because they went from a two eight they got screwed in that one month which happens one and one

[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:07.600]
but they're back up to a three nine they're knocking everybody dead over on GTR and the kernel from a

[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:14.200]
a one six God that's remember when I made Joey you see you should have stuck it out Joey at

[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.660]
she they should have you on now Joey be in the ballpark okay because Joey is doing one five one six

[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:23.460]
and I think Joey could beat the kernel okay I really I mean pretty close but I think Joey could do

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.340]
it wait do you remember when we went to Zeta or we we started with a one had a lot to say about

[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:33.760]
you by the way no it's just a joke we started with a one with a one seven which we thought

[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.620]
was as low as it possibly yeah one seven we in in a year we got it up to a five five we're a number

[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:46.520]
one yeah incredible demographics and now they have a one point six here we started out here with a

[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:51.380]
three and in one book well minus two weeks we were not here the first two weeks of this

[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:58.640]
correct okay it still has two weeks of the dean carried over on it so from by three to a five eight

[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.180]
just about doubling the audience but don't worry you lost Paul Harvey in there but we did lose Paul

[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:15.440]
discussed on that show let me tell you that they'll never mention this even in passing trust me

[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:27.760]
it will not be mentioned on that radio station but we'll mention it one six one six

[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.620]
do you think I'm reveling wait a minute wait a minute you don't understand that's the

[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:39.740]
morning show I know now you must understand that they had gone from a two four to a two zero in the

[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.560]
fall book including when the morning was still doing a two eight yeah now that the morning is

[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:50.880]
doing a one six that means overall I bet you she beats him in this round okay me too now when she

[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.820]
beats you that's like a heartbeat away from being off the air okay good Lord we turned the

[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.120]
car he just didn't have the right 25 to 54 yeah the big audience but they want the people we want

[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:07.360]
and now they have done it it's incredible out the kernel is listing I'm sure I don't even know

[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:14.100]
the guy I'm sure he's a wonderful guy don't buy a house that's my secret I've heard the show don't

[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.900]
buy a house it's a god that you know I like the fact we did the five eight that's a great number

[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.420]
and we thank the audience again you're incredible and we're well on our way to God only know six

[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:28.320]
and seven's and who knows what else especially if they leave us the hell alone but I don't know

[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.480]
somehow that that number at the bottom of this page they're unzada that that even it's not

[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:39.260]
out of vengeance or hostility or bitterness well now that I think of it it probably is okay but

[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.120]
God anybody in the world deserves it and there's some very nice people over there at least two or

[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:49.860]
three okay but God if anybody deserves it what goes around comes around Tim Williams that's

[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.060]
all I can say to you that's not a bad guy if you take them out of it if you were like like I said if

[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:58.360]
you were shelling she was a Jordan Marsh you think God this is a nice guy okay in the business

[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.700]
a disaster yeah no but out of the business a super guy but it's Tim Williams and that whole

[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.220]
group of fakers over there the other ones who really deserve everything they can get okay so

[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.860]
again I guess they can thank our mutual buddy down there we don't want to mention his name on the

[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.940]
ear but the governor yourself accordingly but for the fact that created that hostile situation

[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:21.680]
and we got out of there oh jade oh more look at more ladies and gentlemen before we go into our

[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.240]
we're doing like election night see the elections used to be fun in the old days now they got the

[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:23.600]
computers and dan rather comes on in five minutes and says they bush one here and here in du

[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:27.580]
caucuses a jerk and it's all over in good night and good luck and then they analyze it for six

[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.100]
hours you know and that's no fun i'd like the old days when he used to you know like have the each

[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:36.780]
state they have a thing up there and you'd see the numbers of votes changing and humbly and brinkly

[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.560]
would look at each other with that stupid look like what the hell does it all mean and it was fun

[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:45.300]
we'd go under the wee hours of the morning but uh so i kind of feel like we've returned to those days

[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:51.600]
of yesterday year with a lone ranger at wxyz Detroit so for those of you who tended late

[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:58.180]
they'd got a one six in the morning with the kernel from our five five that he's now taking it

[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:02.360]
into a one six and then you should have an apple once the difference between silver apples

[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.960]
well regular apples see i tell you what now the reason i played that is that when

[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.620]
and even made the conversion when they don't even have it over there to kick around anymore that

[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:14.560]
should tell you they are really desperate god in fact they could use it at this point they can

[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.960]
use anybody who's breathing and even even if they're not breathing at this point they could

[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:24.560]
use all the help they can get god that makes me just see i don't usually for example w snooze

[00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:30.160]
when i was at wins i you know it was nice to beat them mm-hmm well especially at night during

[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:34.080]
the radio wars when lichis was trying to be mr hot shot and we've used beat to crap out of them

[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:39.260]
like seven to a three one two times in a row or seven one to a three but uh during the rest of

[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.580]
the time i was there i would never even pay any attention to them because they weren't really a

[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:48.320]
factor when i would whatever time period i was on it weren't a factor but now you know the zeta

[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:54.140]
thing it just because we were forced to leave there in such an unpleasant situation after we had

[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.540]
done such a great job for them and now and you know they give everybody the usual rationalization oh

[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:02.800]
yeah well don't worry i mean nia was okay but uh we turned the corner we're gonna be and not only

[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.260]
that but they're not even doing what they said they said one of the reasons they wanted us

[01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:10.280]
you know they were pleased we were leaving or they didn't put it that way but that would be okay

[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:15.240]
better was because now they could be classic rock 24 hours yeah well they're not playing any more

[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.400]
music now than they were when we were there in fact sometime they're playing less from what i

[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.560]
from what i've heard when i was listening remember some days we get real music intensive once in a

[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:29.760]
while and uh and of course they just keep playing the birds over and over again which um got kind

[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.600]
of limited appear you know they're like four burned out stone out here from the sixties one

[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.640]
last night that we were on inside story was about another one of these guys now that was a really

[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.980]
bizarre story because they weren't really quite sure uh huh this is a guy who everybody thought was

[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.320]
a woman but was really a guy or something like that i'm the new thing on these shows pretty

[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.520]
sure they're gonna start showing evidence on those shows but tie in right in with that moral

[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.360]
Hoffman known as the female bill beard oh i see it's not oh it's not what i thought it was

[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.780]
moral runs the largest abortion clinic in the country and is speaking out on what an anti-abortion

[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:30.780]
ruling would mean for ordinary women she's also a major organizer of counter demonstrations against

[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:37.340]
operation rescue and also there will be a pro-life guest tba oh yeah to be announced he's a little

[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:43.280]
obsessed with that time abortion yeah well he used to work for wol d since most of what's going

[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.020]

[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:09.220]

[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:14.460]
zeta has in the morning is it lower than the number gene cashman got when she was the

[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:19.320]

[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:29.060]
and Scott and Colonel got lower than that one six one six well that's a statistical fluke it's

[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:52.300]
like going to sleep time uh tmi 48 wins a four two down from a four seven and before that a five

[01:04:52.300 --> 01:05:00.720]

[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.240]
to 64 would you ought to be part of there i mean 65 plus they got a lock but 35 to 64 ought to be

[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:10.340]
beginning to be pretty good for them but at night time they drop from a listen to this going back

[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:18.320]
four trends six one five five five four and this time a three seven uh wow i'm going up the whole

[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:26.180]
cheer man trail take care of some of these douche bags okay wild seven midnight not too exciting either

[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:30.420]
four six to a three four now maybe if we put somebody live on there tonight i want to start pushing

[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.640]
you know but we got these great numbers the rest of the day can you imagine if we had big numbers

[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:39.080]
at night mm-hmm like if we had craygon at night for example or stand major or any of our other

[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:46.780]
unemployed friends i would say johnny but he just somehow a m is just not his bag okay um all

[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:53.220]
we still haven't figured out what is bag is yes is that mic on by the way it doesn't make any

[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:58.320]
difference do you want just the circled ones or do you want all the circle ones just the circle

[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.840]
ones yeah for now i don't want to create tremendous amount of work for you in there important

[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.400]
question that was good although the exercise will be good uh let's see seven of midnight well

[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.500]
the fm's don't really count in that thirty five to sixty four so we're still kind of in limbo here we

[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:16.460]
have um all of these wild bizarre demographics okay let's take another couple of calls to kill

[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.340]
some time while we're waiting for the good stuff for lottery hello good morning ill how are you

[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:25.860]
morning bird hi uh you've had good ratings and you had great tv exposure but you got something

[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:32.280]
better than match you got a less handed accolade from Alice yesterday no i slipped over there on

[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:39.260]
scan and this old geezer was calling to complain about the language that you were using on your show

[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:45.100]
even listed the words and how many times you said them really in other words he was counting them

[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:49.740]
huh he doesn't like the show but he sits there counting the words boy that's that's a rich full

[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:56.220]
life he couldn't turn it off hmm well uh Alice said that eventually after the shock

[01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:04.520]
um sad war off you'd have to start working your show yeah he said the fad may last either a couple

[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:11.300]
of weeks a couple of years or decades but it will finally fade yeah just like what Al's been doing

[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:16.040]
faded a lot but he never never stopped him from continuing well the funny part is if you were

[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:20.900]
writing this it's for saturday and that live you couldn't have done a better job because he compared

[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:28.720]
your show to john home penis he said at first it's shocking but after you've seen it a hundred times

[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.220]
and then he backed down he said about ten or twelve times yeah well i'm sure i'm sure

[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:37.400]
Al has never seen john home's penis a hundred times maybe eighty or ninety well you know Ted

[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:42.960]
Bundy might have been right his his ratings are taking a swan dive is because he's concentrating too

[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:51.840]
money so much on that john home's penis shocking sir shocking what what could i possibly say to

[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.560]
that anything to that that Alice wouldn't get apoplectic about well you're compared to just a one

[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:03.180]
else mother calling and getting okay have a wonderful day pal yeah keep going enough said yeah

[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.920]
that was it was shocking wasn't it wasn't it it's eleven thirty two at w i never really thought

[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.300]
about our show like in relationship with john homes penis now that he mentions that we have an

[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:17.800]
open-line and groward five two four w i would be five two four nine four six three what are these now

[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:23.520]
these uh... i got so many pages here it's maybe we could play my back pages by the birds for those

[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:28.300]
for the days weren't they we used to play that yeah great record yeah it's a great record and i

[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:32.280]
had to go out and buy it they don't have it remember that i had to go out and buy it for uh Zeta

[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:36.140]
that's right in fact uh... when they decide to change format over there which i have a feeling this

[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:41.040]
could be the end of this trend here today i had just i could be wrong but i have a feeling this is it

[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.820]
uh... please keep in mind rose and david all the other people over there that the collection of

[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:50.960]
CDs that i left behind at my name on them i mean a tremendous number of them i just for all time

[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.460]
sake i'd like to have some of those back when you start playing on here we have to be listening

[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:59.900]
you ladies out there if you're gonna start doing the m who is desperate to know i wanted to find out

[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:05.800]
the nighttime sports numbers let's take a look okay yeah seven and nine now boy we just got so

[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.560]
many pages here it's a mess oh this is traditionally when they have done the best in the numbers

[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.940]
and it's been at night with qa m and i've brought all these seven of them in night thirty five to

[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:20.480]
sixty four nobody wants that i think if i can find them many teen plus at night that would probably

[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:26.760]
be what that poison wants but i just uh... here's many teen plus but i've only got one page of it

[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.660]
boy this is so i hope they're not going to have to put this back together again i only got the last

[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:38.940]
page of it with ocean and our rock and big daddy i thought i had many teen plus at night i don't

[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.820]
have oh here it is for crow plus here's even better okay this is everybody hot is number one

[01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:50.200]
at night with a ten seven power six three life w snooze a four seven down from a five that's the

[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.160]
lowest number they've had their dropping like a rock six five down to a four seven and five in six

[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:01.540]
trends wins a five one to a four six that's a drop of a half a point wax ecm qe d r q b a

[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:09.520]
y one hundred love god q b a wacky t mi w i o d three two two two two six at night twelve plus

[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.340]
so that's where we had part of that well we only dropped a ten to the point overall but that's

[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:19.680]
where it was right plus on a weekend gtr two five up from a one nine at night i'm still looking

[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.900]
forward let's see kiss had a two so your f m beat you i can't find the cute who am i looking for qa m

[01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:33.200]
the quam oh here it is a one one four down to a one tied for twenty fourth oh boy out of twenty nine

[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:42.420]
or thirty thirty qa m just didn't do it this time well see they were doing well in the summertime

[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:47.120]
with the mets look at this they had a three six back in august september october's trend i remember

[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.900]
and they had a three four then down to a three or one four now down to a one they do have the

[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.420]
heat but i just can't imagine the heater that big of a draw in the addition to which a lot of

[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:58.200]
their games are on tv uh... one

[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:00.180]
hmm

[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.900]
zeta by the way at night from a one to a one three so there's another big success

[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:08.440]
to that that that that that that that that that that that little tickle in their

[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.940]
somewhere okay we have an open line and brown or five two four w i o d we got a

[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.160]
mobile in my amy hello how you doing hey we're doing great today i will use this

[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.280]
morning i i want to relate a story that happened to the over the weekend on the

[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.960]
sunny weekend last week it's about the cable company

[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:31.520]
i was sitting in my pool relaxed with my wife and uh... this guy jumps over to

[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.580]
friends and uh... and i said you know i looked over there and i said can i help you and uh...

[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:41.300]
the gentleman said uh... i'm from the cable company and i said oh you are uh... don't you

[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:47.580]
knock and he said no uh... we we're here to uh... fix somebody else you know next door to my

[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:53.440]
house problem with the cable car boxes in the middle and is easier for me to get through my house

[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:59.420]
because of the dog next door so i call the cable company and uh... i don't have cable i have a

[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:03.660]
satellite dish and i have a desk rambler so i have a congratulations well thank you i've

[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:07.720]
had it for a while but anyways i call the cable company and i say to them i say well

[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.440]
this gentleman jumps over the the thing he's like a track you know i mean this guy

[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:17.700]
i could have brought anybody the way he left you know shirt on and he says well now they could

[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:22.100]
jump over you know they they can i don't have to they don't have to ask any permission

[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.560]
whatsoever and it's that i think that's weird yeah that is weird because if they're in the

[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.560]
backyard they don't tell you some people might circ in a little nerve i imagine if you were

[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:38.200]

[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:54.520]
i'm a salesman and i'm out on the road and i don't put on the fm while i'm working so uh...

[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:58.840]
well listen have a great day and say hi to the cable people for me oh yes sure well okay take care

[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.640]
20 till noon at w i o d we have an opening indeed kind of like amount visuvius at six seven five

[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:09.220]
one w i o d seven five one nine four six three we do have a couple of pages these are

[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.660]
mourning um

[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:17.940]
eighteen plus people this is adults men and women and a qba number one with a six six a q i

[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:22.520]
wacky six six so that's two Spanish language which which nobody counts and i o d

[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.480]
micronary with a six not from a six five but still a number one of all the english language stations

[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.160]
of that's all accounts okay because the stations that are we throw out our life and the

[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.940]
Spanish stations okay i mean life is i mean what's what's the point of even talking about it's not

[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:42.100]
a radio station it's just music that's all it just slush music in a background that nobody pays

[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.980]
any attention to if you're an advertiser you'd have to be off your rocker to be on life because

[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:51.540]
it's nobody there's no concentration nobody hears your message i mean they could they could have

[01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.020]

this from a seven six to a two from first to nineteen not everybody can do that i think

[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:22.500]

[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:33.080]

the zeta he said that we want twenty five to fifty four that's our target audience and there

[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:43.500]
we were number one in that demographic month after month trend after trend and in just three

[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:47.720]

there twenty five to fifty four this is man and women just in men we got to be doing over a ten

[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:57.300]

So Steve just squeak, more than double the 25 to 54 audience of Alice. And of course,

[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:31.740]

W snooze audience, okay?

[01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:38.340]

[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.860]
We have an open line indeed 751 WID. I can understand why because we're not taking any calls.

[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:48.900]
Delray. Hello. Delray's gone. I don't blame him. I would too. For Lauderdale. Hello.

Nobody there. A pompado. Hello. Hey, a voice. Yeah. Sounds like a radio voice to me.

[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.840]
Number two on all these. Who's number one? In what? I don't know. All these various different ratings.

[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.400]
Life WLYF, the elevator music's number one overall in 25 to 54's magic.

over there in Carroll City are a little upset now. 524 9463 Miami. Hello.

[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.360]
Hello. Hi. Hi. I saw you last night on Channel 7.

[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:41.520]
Wasn't it amazing? It was amazing and I am so proud of you. You look so thin.

[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:46.480]
I know. Compared to you see the old shot from I.N.Z. I'm glad they put that in there. That's like a before and after.

[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.560]
Yeah. I work next door to you. So I'll pass you sometimes. And you know, when you see somebody off in it,

[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.720]
it's hard to tell how they're losing it. You work at the big seven? Yeah.

[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.200]
Well, thank everybody over there for the nice piece on us last night. I was always expect the worst.

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:03.360]
You know, you get used to it. We've had so many hatchet jobs, but it was really, uh, it was nice.

[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.960]
Yeah. He did a nice job. Dan's a good guy. Yeah. And he's from upstate New York to top it off. That's right.

[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:13.120]
That's why he's a good guy. That's right. That was my problem. Yeah. See, that's why I knew I shouldn't know it would be a great piece.

[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:17.160]
If he was some like Mark Fisher, wherever he's from or John DeGrewd, it would have been a hatchet job.

[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.020]
But anybody from upstate New York isn't out to do slice jobs. Yeah. Except me. Yeah. Well, I'm glad.

[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:27.280]
I'm glad. And I just wanted to tell you I'm pretty proud of you. My husband's on weight watchers. Uh-huh.

[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:33.780]
So I know it's pretty tough to stick with something long term. Yeah. Well, I'm, I'm hanging right in there.

[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:39.080]
I mean, it's very slow now. I'll admit, but I'm under the 200 barrier and, uh, you know, 35 pounds isn't shop deliver.

[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.220]
I still got a way to go, but it's slowly but surely I'll get there. I get easier when you see it coming off.

[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:48.500]
Doesn't it? Isn't that good motivation? Oh, sure. Especially when they bring all the food in like they're going to do today.

[01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:54.680]
See, that's one of the big problems. I would probably be over 50 pounds off by now if it weren't for all the food that keeps pouring in here.

[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.660]
But, uh, you know, I'm just not in a position to starve all the rest of these people. A lot of them haven't eaten in months.

[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:07.880]
What a host. Hey, listen, I found something on the wire. I thought you'd be interested in Delray Beach ban boom boxes.

[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:11.760]
Yeah. Did you read that? I heard they banned the boom in the box, too, as a matter of fact.

[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:23.700]
Yeah, they banned boom boxes. Anything that can be heard from 50 feet outside or 100 feet inside is now illegal to be played in Delray Beach.

[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:30.440]
Yeah, that figures interesting. And anybody whose pacemaker forces them to make a lot of noise while they breathe has to unplug it immediately.

[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:36.880]
Listen, have a great day and say again, thanks to all our friends over there next door. We'll do. Take care.

[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:47.920]
Even Sally. Bye bye. Okay. Yeah, even Sally will like us eventually. We'll just have to work on her. May I don't know about Denise. Why maybe we can slowly but surely bring her back to her. She's kind of tough to get to.

[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:57.920]
She was brainwashed there for a while. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Uh, 12 plus midday. Uh, we want to know about how Judy T did is opposed the kernel on GTR. Well, let's see.

[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:06.200]
They went up a three o to a four. Okay. So they went up a full point and midday with Judy T kernel just just just not his month. Okay. We have these.

[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:17.140]
They have a kernel just hang in there. Have a wonderful life and whatever you do. Don't buy a house. In fact, I would show you know, if you're in this business, the smart thing to do is like sign a three month lease.

[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:22.300]
Yeah, when you're right to place. In fact, some of the places on this day, you can go like month by month like efficiency.

[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:28.080]
Efficiency is good because then you can't accumulate a lot of furniture. You don't have to hire movers and pack a lot.

[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:35.280]
So it works out really well. Okay. We have an open line in brown. If you want to join us in the next hour, and I have a feeling we'll probably take more calls and then we did this hour,

[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:42.260]
though we won't promise anything. It's the big noon to one hour. And there it goes at Broward line is flashing. A lot of people saw the piece on seven.

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:50.860]
I thank them again because. And it wasn't a tinkling piece. I mean, there were a few little barbs thrown in there and some caustic words to spice it up a little bit.

[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:58.320]
But I think you know, and they had gave sunny Rosenberg all the time in the world to show America is behind. And I think he did a great job of it too, by the way.

[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:07.000]
Sonny's behind hasn't looked better in a long time. Anyway, we've got April worth. I believe standing by in the exciting WIOD newsroom. April's got all the latest.

[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:12.840]
And we'll come back with our number three at 12.5 Steve with another one of his abortions from two to six this afternoon.

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:21.440]

[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:55.860]
What was it? Invacuation or evaluation? I'm sorry, it's the back evacuations of the peace agreement.

[01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:05.680]
And it will feature highlights from a thousand secret tape recorded. You'll learn to pronounce different government programs such as.

[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:16.000]
Not to chop social security benefits and keep the public aware of top world events. And the CIA would have to assess the country's or assist the country.

And the sunny is got a little air in Gytus, but he'll be okay. Want to hear a little more about those morning numbers and how they're dropping like a rocket Y 100, which we know they will continue to do.

[01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:05.040]
Yeah, well, a little bit. Don't forget he was only about three weeks gone out of this trend. You got to remember that. It's already started.

[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:11.660]
But it's already beginning. The flickering's are beginning. You know how that works. Okay, let's go to a duke and four Myers. How you do?

[01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:19.760]
Yeah.

[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:20.520]
And the thing.

[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:33.580]
Yeah, yeah, we're not doing the real talk. That's what Alice says. They do a real talk over there. You know, like K a T used to.

[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:43.640]
You know, that was a pretty weird spy report from from Alice. And after I got to thinking about that, you could name your show to the blue steel

[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:51.900]
robber show. The what? The blue steel robber show. Oh my God. Oh, yeah. Never mind. Whatever you say.

[01:32:52.260 --> 01:33:01.100]
It is. Let him rest in peace. Well, you play. Okay. Boy. As a matter of fact, that we do have a special show next Wednesday. It's called members only.

We have an open line in date County 751 W I O D 751 9463. And here's West Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. Yeah, I was talking to Steve Kane the other day about the old greyhounds. You know, yeah.

[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:26.580]
And he says the people that when they get old there, they throw them off the bridge. Now what kind of what kind of job is that? Can you answer that? They throw what off the bridge? The greyhounds.

[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:41.560]
The greyhounds right off the bridge. Well, that sounds beautiful. What kind of job is that? You'd have to ask kind of a Kimler. Okay, sir. Strange call. We have an open line in Palm Beach. Although I will say this, I heard a lot of that show. And I don't know.

[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:54.880]
Which is good. It's good having him like way in the background. Got it. Baby. You got it. Boy, I missed him. Oh, it's 1216 at W I O D. The only open line of courses in Palm Beach.

So any of you others who are really desperate to speak to us, that's the one place you're always going to find immediately available. 655 9463 6555 W I O D. Boka. Hello.

[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:21.540]
Morning, guys. How are you? Hey, Neil. Hi, bird. Hi. Listen, I got my family to watch your program list like they're on Channel 7. You guys look great. Well, what's really the bird? Because we kept him hidden all the time. What really are program? But okay.

[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:34.920]
Yeah, but it was it was really good to see you guys. Your new studio looks really tremendous. It is. It really is. It looks even better when the food is in it. Yeah, very impressive. I couldn't figure out who that who fought rich was. They're sitting here right there.

[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:51.460]
What we wanted to do kind of like a before and after thing for neutral system. And it worked out real well. Now you guys looked really good and it really sounded excellent. You look good. You look like you lost quite a bit away. Well, you keep saying that we look good. We look good. Well, that's great. I there. A lot of people I wish would say that, but never the right ones. You know, right?

[01:34:51.460 --> 01:35:05.260]
Yeah, that's life. And your numbers are real exciting to you. Yes, they are. They sure are. I'm concentrating. You know, we shouldn't accentuate the negative. We should talk about how great our numbers were and the station overall and GT are, but of course, it's a lot more fun to talk about Zeta. Absolutely.

[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:16.080]
I'm WLD. I was about to say I had a radio accident the other day and my my finger drifted to the dial there and put on Zeta. And it was ponders. Yeah. What were they playing the birds?

[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:29.900]
No, they were just talking. It happened to be. What was it the doors? You know, I used to love the doors and I'm going to have a record burning over the weekend in my house. It is a matter of fact, it happened to be that one morning where they really were knocking you guys and it was so boring and bad that.

[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:40.260]
Let's let's send a little challenge out to the morning crew over there. Get a little excitement for them. Maybe we can generate two or three people listening in the morning, which would double their cum. But you know, let's let's hear on Monday morning.

[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:54.240]
Yeah, I think a little analysis of these numbers. You know, the numbers didn't come out till 10. So they were already off the air. But the Monday, they'll have digested all of this. Probably a lot of peptobizmol. And let's hear their analysis of this. Okay. I like to know how they managed to do this in just three short months.

[01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:05.100]
The Colonel said we were washed up AM talk show host. Yeah. We're finished. Just sort of keep the transmitter ward here. And now I look at his numbers. I look at our numbers and it doesn't seem that way to me.

[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:17.340]
Well, you know, you made a very slight mistake before what's that? You said that their numbers were dropping like a meteorite. Yeah. Actually, their numbers are dropping like a large meteor. Much larger and heavier dropping.

[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:33.120]
Dropping like heli's common huge, huge meteor. Where is it? How is comment they can't make up their mind? No, those pseudo intellectuals. Well, listen, have a great life in a good weekend. You show tremendous. We really enjoy. Thanks a lot. I have a feeling they'll be thrilled with the numbers. Yeah. Probably will.

[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:52.900]
Now look, the last book they try to make an excuse. They said they predicted a one six and it turned out to be a one eight. Now it is a one six. So what are they going to say now? Well, we know it. We told you so. Right on target. Come on Rose. You just can't seriously just from a. I know that Bill wise wouldn't appreciate this because he wants him to stay to one six forever, which is fine with me.

[01:36:52.900 --> 01:37:03.040]
I don't want their numbers to go up, but I wish the music would be better because it's a listener when you're in that car and you're punching around like I said the other day and the music is as lame as it is in this market.

[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:21.940]
You'd like once in a while to find them playing something besides CCR or the doors. Okay. Well, I didn't want to be number one or the bird. They were worried. Well, that's true. Well, Kim said we would like to be number 19. And I think that's. And you know, it's not easy. I don't know how you are number 19. I've never been able almost 30 years in the business. I do not know how to be number 19.

[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:29.020]
I've never been able to do this. I just can't figure it out. So it got a hand to them there. It takes a lot of work. Anyway, I like that many 18 plus man.

[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:35.780]
8.8 that we did here in midday. I just mentioned that again in passing. Uh huh. Because that's a pretty amazing number. Okay.

[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:49.320]
Not compared to. Yeah. Compared to some of the other numbers. Okay. I don't want to mention anything. No, I don't want to get. Here's a mobile in Palm Beach. Hello. How you doing, Neil? We're doing it. How you doing, bud? Okay. Barry. Hey, Neil.

[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:57.440]
Barry. I want to know when we can bring down that low cholesterol pizza for you from pizza light. Oh, geez. Well, have to be one day next week.

[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:05.220]
Barry, we got pizza coming from Jupiter today and food from Uranus and all over the universe. They're not opening till March 1. So we'll do it. Well, probably next week

[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:13.620]
could be a little early. Then I guess that's right. But I want to set it up with you because it's a low calorie and low cholesterol. Great. So you'll enjoy it. Okay.

[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:20.660]

[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:29.520]
Uh, he is. Is there anybody living who isn't an old friend of yours? Well, I'll tell you, he is big claim to fame. And this, this will impress you. Barry.

[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:35.280]
And he may still, but when I knew him, I used to be like related to Barry Manelow. No, you know, when I was a film critic.

[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:47.760]
Barry used to be the film critic for you know that way off in the background better than it is like when you get here. Then muffled. Yeah. Barry used to be the film critic.

[01:38:47.880 --> 01:39:04.980]

[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:25.420]
I think our third party. That was that. Rich, you don't do anything on the show. Don't be congratulating him. He just comes here and eats. Okay. I can understand the impression you would get from watching.

[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:33.780]

[01:39:52.160 --> 01:40:04.020]
How old are you? Kid about 63. Come on, man. He's not one of the blue hairs in the old parts. They call that man up there in Helen, Dale, or wherever. Hollywood. You know, I thought that was fun. You're in hell. Yeah.

[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:19.480]
But anyway, yeah, you know, the guy was talking about what they said on the day of the morning about, you know, the old AM. Talk show. Watched up. Yeah. He said something about the dropping. Yeah. He's like dropped. You know,

[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:58.620]
We're just kind of biting our time. Have a little lunch. We thank Joe again for a tremendous spread. I have a feeling that our friends in Jupiter probably heard that we had all this coming today.

[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:07.740]
And if you will bring the pizza another day because it would be pointless to bring it on a day when we had all this other food. That's what they should do. And I am on my best behavior.

[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:17.240]
Believe me, this is a. I'm thinking with my fruit. I had little chicken salad there with the honey mustard dressing was mouthwatering sensational. And what should we do?

Okay, let's just straight this on up in the audience is Eric who is normally from Boka, but today is in the middle of Disney world with our general manager Mike Disney.

I want to hear on my head.

[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:32.620]
Why do you think they call me Tweety-Bull?

[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:33.800]
Oh, that's it.

[01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:36.780]
Hey, you guys look Carlos and Pembroke Pines, right?

[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.020]
We want Carlos and Pembroke Pines?

[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:39.900]
Carlos, yeah.

[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:40.640]
You remember him?

[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:41.080]
Sure.

[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:43.100]
Well, I like to call him a douchebag.

[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.080]
He's a good friend of mine, and he's on his way up to West Palm Beach for the weekend.

[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:46.640]
Oh, is he?

[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:48.260]
Well, listen, have a great time up there, Carlos.

[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:50.420]
And he's here for the women behind, okay?

[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.940]
Carlos likes, he doesn't like to share.

[01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:52.920]
He wants all of them.

[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:53.600]
Yeah, I know.

[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:54.800]
I know how it is.

[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:55.120]
Yeah.

[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:55.880]
I get stuck.

[01:59:56.700 --> 01:59:58.560]
Hey, um, we don't want to talk about that.

[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:01.700]
He's up there to meet some of his rich friends from Connecticut.

[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:03.020]
You know?

[02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:03.800]
Wow.

[02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:05.660]
But, um, that's all.

[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:07.120]
That's why he doesn't talk to us anymore.

[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:10.540]
He's a, we're not, uh, you know, he's, you know, he's, you know, he's, you're not important

[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.420]
enough for him anymore.

[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:15.040]
You can get pissed at me, but a lot of times he calls and he doesn't tell you a term.

[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:15.820]
Yeah, really?

[02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:17.360]
You don't recognize him?

[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:18.040]
Yeah, sometimes.

[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:18.660]
Yeah.

[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:21.740]
Now, he always sounds so depressed that I don't want to one mask him in front of the audience.

[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:23.640]
You know, probably go over the edge.

[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:24.020]
Yeah.

[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:28.600]
Well, listen, Carlos, if you're out there driving, have a safe trip and have a great life.

[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:29.000]
All right.

[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:29.600]
I'll see you later, then.

[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:29.900]
Bye.

[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:30.140]
Bye.

[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.660]
129 at WIOD.

[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.360]
We still haven't heard from Paul Harvey, Jr.

[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:36.280]
And we've had such ratings that come out.

[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:37.060]
They've been just tremendous.

[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:42.020]
And Jada's ratings were in the toilet and WLD got so old that they just about, um, two

[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:44.960]
feet in the grave and, um, everything's been wonderful.

[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.020]
Joe brought the tremendous piece from Tatsy, rotisserie.

[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:49.700]
Uh, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was a, it was here.

[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:53.340]
Diving all kinds of stuff on the cart that we couldn't dub because we have no place to

[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:53.600]
work.

[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:56.140]
And they're actually cutting my paycheck down there.

[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.480]
Do you, do you understand the thing?

[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:58.460]
What a dish.

[02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:01.560]
See, they could pay me like everybody else every other week.

[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:06.580]
But of course, in my case, they don't want to have put out one check that, that moment

[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:08.300]
this, I don't think they could afford to cover it.

[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:10.240]
So this gives them like a whole two weeks.

[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:11.160]
You follow what I'm saying?

[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.920]
To pawn a bunch of stuff and sell it.

[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:17.160]
So anyway, they, they evidently decided they're going to pay me every week, which is fine.

[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.340]
I mean, if they wanted to pay me a little bit every day or however they want to do it,

[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:21.940]
I'm easy to get along with as long as I get it.

[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:25.200]
But it's like every Friday, it's a major project.

[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:26.240]
Isn't it?

[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.320]
Thank God it isn't every day.

[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:29.340]
And they're down there right now cutting it.

[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:33.860]
If we listen closely, no, I mean the check I met.

[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:35.680]
130 at WIO.

[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:36.820]
Did we got a mobile in Miami?

[02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:37.180]
Hello?

[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:39.800]
Brian Cal, we're going to play the four on their brand new DJ.

[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:40.580]
We got ones.

[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:41.480]
We turned that corner.

[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:42.880]
We throw a plastic rock and roll.

[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:44.120]
We don't brand new music.

[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:47.160]
That bread over there.

[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.040]
And he's getting a little impudent, don't you think?

[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:52.960]
On the bread line.

[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:55.400]
Oh, Bill and even say that.

[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:57.940]
I know what he says that I'm a Dave line and on the bread line.

[02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:01.200]
I always think to myself, Colonel, you had it, baby.

[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:05.860]
And obviously with these numbers here, the Colonel is really doing it, isn't it?

[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:07.700]
They're going to be so happy over there.

[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.280]
I guess they're now they're right on the corner.

[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.060]
They've turned the corner.

[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:10.800]
One point six.

[02:02:11.100 --> 02:02:11.640]
They've turned the corner.

[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:13.220]
They've got a number that they can relate to.

[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.420]
And look, they didn't like it because we had a big audience in a more timoyum said

[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:20.280]
to me, we'd be much happier if you were number three instead of number one.

[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:22.060]
And I looked at him like he was out of his mind.

[02:02:23.140 --> 02:02:24.860]
And the one great thing about it now.

[02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:28.940]
They don't have to worry about any gigantic disproportionate on balance kind of thing.

[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:32.800]
Because now right across, man, you're like right there at a one six.

[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:36.340]
The gods are couldn't quite keep pace, but he's always, you know, they late in the

[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:36.840]
dollar short.

[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:38.300]
He's at a one five.

[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:41.540]
But one six almost morning noon a night.

[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:42.820]
They're right right across the board.

[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:43.460]
Well, congratulations.

[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:47.520]
And like I said, if you can't be successful, if you can't be good at least because this

[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:48.260]
is okay.

[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:49.300]
And they did it.

[02:02:49.500 --> 02:02:49.840]
They made it.

[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:53.740]
One six like almost a straight line or just a little wobble in there once in a while.

[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:57.000]
And one of the people with the diaries, you know, you can't just sit by the radio all

[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:57.120]
day.

[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.460]
Once in a while, you make a mad rush.

[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:00.200]
And I guess it was during those periods of time.

[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:04.060]
Well, when Gans is on, you get that feeling, you know, you start getting that surge in

[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:04.500]
your stomach.

[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:05.320]
Boys, that's it.

[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:07.680]
And you have to like run, yeah, recovered.

[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.680]
But anyway, they're really doing it.

[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:10.600]
We congratulate them.

[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.660]
And we knew they could do it.

[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:15.080]
And of course, if they want to borrow some other music now, if Pete's listening, and

[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:16.040]
I'm sure he probably is.

[02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:16.740]
Blasting.

[02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:19.980]
We have, you know, I loan them all OCDs.

[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:24.840]
But if they want to change, I have some incredible Chinese melodies that I'm sure that they would

[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:25.380]
love to borrow.

[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:29.140]
And it would be different, you know, unbelievable, unbelievable.

[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.700]
Well, I'm so glad we're out of there here, though.

[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:34.100]
Yeah.

[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:34.500]
Real.

[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:35.200]
Yeah, I'm too.

[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:40.080]
I don't want to, I don't like bothering people, you know, 132 at WIOD.

[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:42.600]
I'd like to tell Johnny Dark about nutritious stuff right now.

[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:43.900]
Johnny.

[02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:47.700]
Okay, now, no Steve is here to hear this.

[02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:50.220]
But, you know, there's some days when it just fits right in.

[02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:54.480]
I want to make, we usually don't think dedication, but a special dedication to my dear friend

[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:58.560]
Tim Williams and all the upper and middle-elemented people over there in Carroll City.

[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:00.340]
Nice job, well done.

[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:05.580]
Well, I was driving down 9.95 the other night.

[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:08.840]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.

[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:12.880]
I decided wasn't going to do any good to get mad.

[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:15.440]
So I wrote a song about him instead.

[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.260]
It goes like this.

[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:22.260]
We're even more than asshole.

[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:25.980]
Or did you work it in your whole life?

[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:30.200]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:33.840]
Cause you're an asshole tonight.

[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:37.960]
Yes, you're an A.

[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.180]
That's that fake, so Ellie.

[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:44.160]
And don't you try to blame it on me.

[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:48.520]
You deserve all the credit.

[02:04:48.660 --> 02:04:51.920]
You're an asshole tonight.

[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:58.440]
You were an asshole yesterday.

[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:02.060]
You're an asshole tonight.

[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:10.440]
I've got a feeling you'll be an asshole the rest of your life.

[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:13.840]
I'm a man.

[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.020]
I'm a man.

[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:16.700]
I'm a man.

[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:20.320]
I'm a man.

[02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.800]
I'm a man.

[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:37.700]
I'm a man.

[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:37.700]

[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:54.600]
And I was talking to your mother just the other night.

[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:58.820]
I told her I thought you were an asshole.

[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:02.500]
She said yes, I think you're right.

[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:08.820]
And all your friends are asshole.

[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.540]
Cause you've known them your whole life.

[02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:20.680]
If somebody told me you've got an asshole for life.

[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:27.000]
Or you've born an asshole.

[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:30.920]
Or did you work it in your whole life?

[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:34.920]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:37.600]
Cause you're an A.

[02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:43.900]
I don't do my job as well when I'm kind of stupid.

[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:44.900]
It's a nice.

[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.080]
You think you should have gone ahead a little bit, too?

[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:50.180]
That's a little bit.

[02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.640]
It's 140 at WIO.

[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:57.180]
I know you have young children and all of that.

[02:06:57.500 --> 02:06:59.860]
Just like Alice.

[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:05.100]
Oh, they're picking on me to try to ruin my life.

[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:09.600]
Just a radio show.

[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.340]
You're on a dying radio station with an audience.

[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:13.720]
It's all over the age of 500.

[02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:17.020]
Oh, God.

[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:20.660]
You didn't hear Alice's numbers?

[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.540]
Maybe you were listening on a speaker.

[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:28.760]
Now I got to dig through this whole thing.

[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:34.560]
I just want to tell those late-tuner inners that Zeta Force morning show with the kernel.

[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:41.040]
Got a 1.6, which is lower than the number they had with Jeep cash and in Scotland.

[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:44.740]
When we started over there, they had a 1.7.

[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:49.600]
Now it's a 1.6 in the morning from R55.

[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:51.640]
Let me just do these as we go along here.

[02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:53.260]
For example, men 18 plus.

[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:55.260]
Just a minute, relax.

[02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:56.780]
Many 18 plus, 3 to 7.

[02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:00.460]
Boy, they got so many pages here.

[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:01.220]
It's disgusting.

[02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:03.500]
I can't even find a page anymore.

[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:06.900]
Persons even 35 to 64.

[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:07.820]
They bit the big one.

[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:08.900]
They had a 1.9, Alice.

[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.140]
He was 19th in the market down from a 2.9.

[02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:13.940]
That means their whole audience is over 64.

[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:14.540]
Exactly.

[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:16.100]
That's the point I'm trying to make to you.

[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:17.280]
Persons 35 to 64.

[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:18.360]
They're like invisible.

[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:19.860]
They don't rate over 64.

[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:21.220]
The name should be fair.

[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:22.480]
Why are that at Sandy?

[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:23.520]
Yeah.

[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:24.080]
That's right.

[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:25.960]
Sandy probably brought Alice way down.

[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.260]
Well, Sandy had a 3.2.

[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:30.580]
Sandy, when we came here, Sandy was doing what?

[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:31.060]
A 4.

[02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.780]
I can't find anything that means anything here.

[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:35.360]
This is also a general breakdown.

[02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:37.060]
Well, I want to find a good stuff.

[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:38.440]
Well, here's Persons 18 plus.

[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:39.640]
Okay, 3 to 7 p.m.

[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:42.560]
Steve's got a 4.

[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.880]
And Alice, not on the second page.

[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:49.920]
We're down to the third page.

[02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:50.820]
Oh, oh.

[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:52.740]
We just went by Zeta.

[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:53.680]
Oh, my.

[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:54.720]
I'll wait a minute.

[02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:56.300]
What's going to be on here somewhere?

[02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:57.680]
I mean, they showed up, didn't they?

[02:08:57.880 --> 02:08:58.440]
We'll start at the bar.

[02:08:58.440 --> 02:08:58.940]
Oh, here it is.

[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:00.160]
A 3 to 2.

[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:00.380]
Oh.

[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:01.860]
And Persons 18 plus.

[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:04.200]
But that's as close as he comes to you anywhere.

[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:09.460]
I mean, like when you get into the more reasonable living and breathing demographics, it's like they're not existent.

[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:12.980]
And I will find the 25 to 54 if it takes me until 3.15.

[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:13.500]
Okay.

[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:18.580]
I will find it because it's just so interesting as somebody who used to work here used to say,

[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:20.660]
it is so interesting.

[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:22.980]
Here's 18 plus.

[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:25.140]
Man, you gave me so much stuff here, Sharon.

[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:26.520]
It's just phenomenal.

[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:29.320]
By the way, here's a check for Camilo-Saus while you're there.

[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:30.120]
Thank you so much.

[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:30.700]
Here we go.

[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:32.340]
25 to 54 afternoons.

[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:39.060]
Steve had, if we can find it here somewhere on the page, I know it's here.

[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:39.620]
Trust me.

[02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:45.920]
Steve had a 4.9 in 25 to 54, which is outstanding.

[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:50.140]
In fact, that's the highest number you've ever had, I think.

[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:51.720]
25 to 54.

[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:52.480]
Great number.

[02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:55.360]
And Alice, not on the next page.

[02:09:57.620 --> 02:09:59.420]
Oh, God.

[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:00.740]
Oh, my God.

[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:01.440]
Oh.

[02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:02.300]
Yes.

[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:08.380]
You know what would more to fund me more than anything in the world is if Zeta beat me in some time period somewhere.

[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:09.680]
You're telling me Zeta beat out?

[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:12.340]
Winds had a 1-8. Zeta had a 2.

[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.500]
Oh, that's a wrong category.

[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:16.160]
I knew it was just too good to beat out.

[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:19.280]
Boy, that really, well, maybe he's not on any page here.

[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:19.980]
Is that possible?

[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:21.100]
No.

[02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:23.140]
Oh, this stuff is so ballic stuff, man.

[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:26.780]
It's been brought in here in just sections and like all over the place.

[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:29.740]
Okay, let's take a caller to while we're fishing around here.

[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:32.880]
While we're searching through just thousands of pages,

[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:36.580]
trillions and tons and...

[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:39.420]
Let me just mention again, 25 to 54 in midday,

[02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:40.800]
Magic had a 7-7.

[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:42.260]
We had a 6-9.

[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.300]
We were number two.

[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:43.840]
Yeah.

[02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:47.620]
And that includes two weeks of Alan pardon me for destroying Philadelphia Burke.

[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:53.940]
Did you hear my story yesterday about the GM and the sales manager both got canned because they were responsible for bringing him up there

[02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:57.080]
and he's doing so poorly that they lost their job.

[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.240]
That's a very strong rumor that we have from our Philadelphia sources.

[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.800]
Alan is still working, but I don't understand it.

[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:04.300]
I don't know.

[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:05.300]
He's well more down.

[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:06.140]
He's keeping him alive.

[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:07.540]
Pembert Pines, hello.

[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:08.300]
Hey, new.

[02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:09.760]
Yeah, how you doing, Joe?

[02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:10.180]
Pretty good.

[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:10.700]
How you doing?

[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:11.040]
Great.

[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:13.180]
Well, I congratulate you for your numbers.

[02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:14.160]
You guys deserve it.

[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:15.140]
Thank you so much.

[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:18.140]
And I saw your little show yesterday and I taped it and kept it.

[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:19.340]
You saw my little thing yesterday?

[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:20.500]
I saw your little show.

[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:21.180]
Oh, I see.

[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:21.600]
Oh, wait a minute.

[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:21.960]
Here we go.

[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:23.760]
3-7 PM, 25 to 54.

[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:24.820]
Oh, I had the wrong number.

[02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:28.920]
Steve's got a 4-1 and Al has got just a minute now.

[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.220]
Here's Zeta with a 2-1.

[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:30.920]
I was right.

[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:31.620]
They did beat him.

[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:32.280]
Oh, no.

[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:34.260]
Oh, my God.

[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:34.840]
A 1-8.

[02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:36.600]
Even wins beat him with a 1-9.

[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:37.660]
He's got a 1-8.

[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:40.780]
Yeah, 1-8.

[02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:41.880]
Mm-hmm.

[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:42.620]
Oh, I'm Tony.

[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:44.620]
He's dropping like an atomic rock.

[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:45.500]
Go ahead, Joe.

[02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:45.900]
I'm sorry.

[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:46.800]
We're getting emotional now.

[02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:47.060]
No problem.

[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:47.740]
I can understand.

[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:49.720]
Bird, I don't know what you complain about.

[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:52.300]
They had a nice big 5-second thing on your face.

[02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:53.780]
Oh, I'm not complaining, sir.

[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:54.440]
It was great.

[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.760]
You think they ignored me enough?

[02:11:56.020 --> 02:11:56.300]
Oh, no.

[02:11:56.520 --> 02:11:59.820]
Well, you know, if you feel you've been ignored, just go to Toyota Hollywood with Neal.

[02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:01.860]
And me and my friends will come down there with a video camera.

[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:03.980]
And we'll do a little piece on you.

[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:05.040]
A little piece on him.

[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:05.680]
Hi, here that.

[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:07.260]
Steve's still there?

[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:08.300]
Yeah, he's right here.

[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:08.740]
He's eaten.

[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:11.160]
Oh, tell him I can get his Woody Allen poster for him.

[02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:11.820]
All right.

[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:14.060]
Well, we're going to be down there.

[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.160]
Now, seriously, we're going to be there a week from...

[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:16.600]
No, wait a minute.

[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:17.800]
Two weeks from Sunday?

[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:19.880]
It's the 12th, isn't it?

[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.020]
At Toyota Hollywood?

[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:21.240]
Yeah.

[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:25.260]
Okay, two weeks from Sunday, the 12th, we're going to be Steve and I'll be back down here again.

[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:28.740]
And the fact we actually might get the bird if somebody wants to get him some money for it.

[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:29.440]
Doubtful.

[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:30.040]
I'll pay him.

[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:32.080]
But don't wait that long to bring me the poster.

[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:36.260]
Well, they can't give me the poster until the movie comes out, which will be March 10th.

[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:39.300]
Well, that's great because the 12th is when we're going to be there.

[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:40.040]
Okay, that's cool.

[02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:40.780]
No, it's on good.

[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:42.440]
So you can bring us both something.

[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:42.920]
Sure.

[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:44.540]
If you follow my...

[02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:45.560]
Is that a stand-up thing?

[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:46.900]
If you follow my drift, Joe?

[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:47.540]
Yeah, I do.

[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:50.300]
So Steve, do you want to stand in the poster?

[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:51.400]
Oh, yes.

[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:53.060]
Yes, he's holding a stand on the air.

[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:53.880]
He's trolling.

[02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:55.020]
I'm trolling for posters.

[02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:56.120]
I can get you out of my way.

[02:12:56.300 --> 02:12:56.380]
Yes.

[02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:57.540]
I can get you both of them.

[02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:58.080]
Super.

[02:12:58.320 --> 02:12:59.640]
Okay, let's see it at the 12th.

[02:12:59.860 --> 02:12:59.980]
Yeah.

[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:06.340]
Neil, I liked everything about the show last night, except for after the last little piece of material you did, you know?

[02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:08.540]
And you said, have a great day and you know, like that.

[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:08.900]
Yeah, right.

[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.180]
The lady means sort of like a weird gesture, like a weird face.

[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:13.660]
Well, she's kind of a weird lady.

[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:14.240]
What do you expect?

[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:15.080]
Now, it was good, though.

[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:16.840]
I can't knock anything about it.

[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:17.660]
It was a fair thing.

[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:21.460]
You know, compared to the last thing Channel 7 did on us with Denise White and Steve Dawson,

[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:23.940]
where they just ripped us a new bud.

[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:25.500]
I mean, this was beyond belief.

[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:26.000]
It was great.

[02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:28.040]
Okay, you guys have a great weekend, I'll see you.

[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:28.980]
Have a wonderful life, Joe.

[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:29.240]
Bye.

[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:31.740]
147 at WIOD.

[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:32.080]
Charlie.

[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:34.200]
Okay, it's 150, and I almost forgot this.

[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:39.600]
An anonymous coworker inside the building would like me to dedicate that song that we played a couple of minutes ago,

[02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:43.660]
the I-95 song to Michael Luris of the WGTR sales department.

[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:46.300]
So we just mentioned that in passing.

[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.320]
It's 10 till two at WIOD.

[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:52.300]
Steve with another one of his obsessive abortion shows with Merle Hoffman,

[02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:56.200]
who is Dustin's full sister, known as the female billbeard.

[02:13:57.160 --> 02:13:58.680]
Well, I'll tell you this tender thing.

[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:02.020]
It's just, it's getting to the point you don't know who's what.

[02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:03.460]
It's what's what?

[02:14:03.460 --> 02:14:05.640]
I guess this is the new thing for the 90s.

[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:05.920]
Yeah.

[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:11.020]
And of course, we know it was started by Michael Jackson and his sister with the plastic parts.

[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:12.960]
Wouldn't that be great?

[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.540]
I think they're going to come out with a Jackson doll where they have all interchangeable parts where it can be Michael

[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:19.160]
or it can be what's your name?

[02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:21.140]
Oh, you build them like the robots.

[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:23.280]
Yeah, it can be any other Jackson's.

[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:24.940]
Okay, and it's got like mix and match parts.

[02:14:25.220 --> 02:14:31.080]
And if you want to really get cute, you can, well, you can just conjure up in your mind all the neat things that you can do.

[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:36.620]
But you could make Latoya with those big plastic, you know, and then she could also have, yeah.

[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.040]
Oh, God.

[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:40.440]
Okay, let's go to for Lauderdale.

[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:41.400]
Hey, Neil.

[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:41.980]
How you doing?

[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:42.760]
How you doing, Bird?

[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:43.260]
Okay.

[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:44.560]
My little tough on this rating.

[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:45.620]
Thank you so much.

[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:47.100]
And point us to you, too.

[02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:48.140]
Let me ask you a question.

[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:50.120]
What can we do about getting you on these UM games?

[02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:53.200]
I mean, if I hear it's not in the air, it's not in the ground.

[02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:54.440]
It's in the air one more time.

[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:55.660]
I'm going to go crazy, you know?

[02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:57.740]
I mean, can we do something about that?

[02:14:57.740 --> 02:15:01.860]
That thing was from, I think that was from a Yankee game or something that, that part of that promo.

[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.760]
No, it's not going to happen this season, I don't think.

[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:05.180]
Can we get you on the air?

[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:06.620]
Or is there any way we can call it?

[02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:07.460]
That's what I just said.

[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:09.800]
Well, you can go ahead and call him.

[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:12.400]
I don't think it's going to do any good, but, you know, give it a try.

[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:17.540]
And that song you had on a while ago about my boyfriend's back, who was that in the background?

[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:19.620]
Sound like Ann Bishop in Heads or something?

[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:20.560]
Well, that's who it was.

[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:23.460]
Ann was thinking about that Glenn Rinker story that Craig had.

[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:25.260]
What a story.

[02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:28.400]
Congratulations and Michael Tuft on the TV show last night.

[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.640]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:30.040]
Good-bye.

[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:30.460]
Bye.

[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:34.620]
Now, the Saltwater Cowboys, it says, oh, this is the second day in a row.

[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:35.400]
They sent me this back.

[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:42.000]
So all the guys in the band was wondering why you haven't played the song we sent that was delivered personally last week.

[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:44.820]
I don't remember it, but there's stuff that comes in every day.

[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:50.160]
And the problem is the reason it hasn't been played yet is because I haven't had to listen to it yet, and it isn't carded up yet.

[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:58.580]
Just like Jim Scholar sent us a thing here today called the bird in the boon, which is probably a sensation like all his stuff is.

[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:01.600]
And the Saltwater Cowboys are great, but it takes us forever.

[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:05.360]
That's why we had to have Johnny Dark come in today so that he could steal one of the production studio.

[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:08.180]
Well, the production studio for a period of time.

[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:13.140]
So it's just these little things that prevent us from really doing a kind of show we would like, but we'll always have a little handicap.

[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:16.900]
Wherever we work, we like to be, you know, give everybody a little edge.

[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:22.360]
Like, say, oh, you're going to cart that up for us. That would be so great.

[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:25.140]
So Nick is going to cart that up for us bird in the boon.

[02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:25.760]
He did.

[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:27.340]
And we could have that for Monday, maybe.

[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:32.100]
Yeah, I don't know what that other thing is with all the jingles on it, but burden the boon sound.

[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:33.480]
But I met you Mike in the audience.

[02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:33.980]
You love playing.

[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:34.700]
I would love to hear this.

[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.660]
Oh, we can play it right now on the thing there.

[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:37.420]
And then you could play it.

[02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:38.340]
If you would please.

[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:39.320]
Oh, I would be great.

[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.280]
Anyway, it's 153.

[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.140]
Here's a call from Boynton Beach. Hello.

[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:44.520]
Good afternoon, gentlemen. How are you?

[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:44.860]
Great.

[02:16:45.300 --> 02:16:46.680]
Listen, I called you about a month ago.

[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:49.680]
My wife was listening to you while she was in labor on the way to the hospital.

[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:50.420]
Really?

[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:51.760]
A member of Amanda Christina.

[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:54.220]
And Boy, she was almost born listening to you.

[02:16:54.260 --> 02:16:56.680]
And I want to let you know she's the happiest baby we've ever seen.

[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:57.440]
Well, that's great.

[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:58.960]
So we'll try to get in the second time around.

[02:16:59.220 --> 02:16:59.520]
Okay.

[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:03.180]
Secondly, last Friday, I called WPBR, the Jim Ackerman.

[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:08.540]
And I had a call.

[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:10.300]
He was on something about free speech.

[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:11.140]
And I called and I said,

[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:13.140]
you know there's a radio station down south of Tuvenport,

[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:13.780]
problems with that.

[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:16.420]
And instantly he said, you must mean Uncle Neil.

[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:17.920]
And I said, yes, sir.

[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:18.040]
You're really?

[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:19.420]
I said, yes, sir.

[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:20.080]
Let me tell you something.

[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:21.740]
You are all a bunch of hypocrites here.

[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.540]
And I just went on and on.

[02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:24.780]
And guess what he said at the end?

[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:25.480]
What's that?

[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:29.040]
My friend, stay cereal, and it's getting ponderous.

[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:30.600]
Oh, no.

[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:31.320]
No.

[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.060]
That's exactly what he said.

[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:34.000]
Good heaven.

[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:34.560]
Wow.

[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:38.700]
So next time you get a chance to let him have it, by all means.

[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:39.400]
Let him have it.

[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:39.920]
Okay.

[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:40.600]
All right, gentlemen.

[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:41.100]
Have a good day.

[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:41.480]
You too.

[02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:41.780]
Bye-bye.

[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:42.680]
You believe that?

[02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:43.960]
Boy, those Palm Beach guys.

[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:46.060]
Those Palm Beach people, man, they're really original.

[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:46.600]
They're there.

[02:17:46.660 --> 02:17:46.720]
They're there.

[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:47.200]
They're there.

[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:51.360]
They are really something.

[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:53.100]
That is some kind of radio market.

[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:53.440]
Okay.

[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:55.520]
Anyway, Tuesday we got Tom Jicke coming on.

[02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:57.020]
And the trends are all out here.

[02:17:57.140 --> 02:17:57.240]
Yeah.

[02:17:58.120 --> 02:17:59.400]
And what else just happened?

[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.680]
Tom was on that show last night, which we haven't even mentioned.

[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:01.980]

[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:03.400]
Tom, we thank him for his usual.

[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:04.000]
He interviewed him.

[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:04.980]
Oh, wonderful comments.

[02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:07.540]
Because you don't know that Tom and I have the insesctuous relationship

[02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:08.620]
that goes back years.

[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:12.700]
And, you know, there are all these sour grapes in the business.

[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:15.060]
Ah, how come Tom has always saved these wonderful things about me?

[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:17.080]
And how come he's always, because it's a great show.

[02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:17.380]
Okay.

[02:18:17.460 --> 02:18:19.640]
That's the answer to the question, because Tom has excellent taste.

[02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:20.440]
It's a great show.

[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:22.580]
And that we, you know, do knock on wood very well.

[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:27.040]
And we thank our loyal audience out there for, again, coming through, man.

[02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:29.800]
It's just like in no time, we brought him, dragged him over here.

[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:30.120]
Yeah.

[02:18:30.500 --> 02:18:32.280]
And we did a 5.8 and 12 plus.

[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:33.680]
And then 25 to 54.

[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:34.780]
We did a 6.9.

[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:37.520]
And we're washed up.

[02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:37.960]
Really?

[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:38.000]
Yeah.

[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:38.680]
And we're washed up.

[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:40.120]
And the Colonel didn't want 6.

[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:41.200]
Let's hear it, Bert.

[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:41.960]
We got that thing ready.

[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:42.780]
The bird in the pool.

[02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:43.780]
No, we don't have a ready yet.

[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:44.500]
Oh, it's bad.

[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:45.340]
Ooh, ooh.

[02:18:46.140 --> 02:18:46.400]
Ooh.

[02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:46.720]
Ooh.

[02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:48.240]
Oh, my.

[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:49.640]
Oh.

[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:53.180]
Oh, it wasn't just like regular, but like, odious.

[02:18:53.340 --> 02:18:53.520]
Yeah.

[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:55.240]
Remember Paul Anke and odious Cotes?

[02:18:55.300 --> 02:18:55.980]
Remember that record?

[02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:56.940]
Yes, I do.

[02:18:57.340 --> 02:18:59.000]
Well, evidently, this was in that category.

[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:00.220]
Who said so?

[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:03.600]
We'll just kind of like hold it in a band for another station, I guess.

[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:04.640]
Miami, hello.

[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:05.620]
Oh, Nia.

[02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:06.200]
Yeah.

[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:09.000]
You know, I'm talking about Glenn Rinker.

[02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:14.820]
I'm calling you from this office, and I got these rug burns on my butt.

[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.160]
And I had these whip-welts on my back.

[02:19:21.340 --> 02:19:23.020]
And it's kind of for me, dude.

[02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:24.540]
Oh.

[02:19:25.380 --> 02:19:25.760]
Oh.

[02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:27.700]

[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:31.060]
That, Anne, is just a piece of work.

[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:32.400]
And she has something else.

[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:33.600]
Oh.

[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:33.640]
Oh.

[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:39.400]
No, you don't know the truth, but this, uh, that's really Walter Cronice in the background.

[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:44.000]
What, what is this?

[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.540]
Why are you bringing this to me?

[02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:46.740]
What is that?

[02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:50.600]
April just brought me this super silly.

[02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:52.140]
Is why are you bringing that in here?

[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:52.640]
Blumers.

[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.320]
Oh, I couldn't read that.

[02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:54.940]

[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:56.540]
Oh, isn't that cute?

[02:19:56.800 --> 02:19:57.520]
Bill Wise.

[02:19:58.120 --> 02:19:59.600]
Oh, my God.

[02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:02.780]
Yeah, if I wouldn't have seen that, it wouldn't make any sense.

[02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:04.760]
I thought that April was going through his second childhood.

[02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:09.560]
Look at the little kid there on the far right, under where the caption says Bill Wise.

[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:15.060]
Now, if that isn't the spitting image, it's like the same stupid grin on his face as Spike always has to.

[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:19.540]
And they, oh boy, oh boy, that must be, you know how we have the cart young Neil.

[02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:20.900]
That must be from young Spike.

[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:22.360]
Oh, God.

[02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:24.580]
Doesn't it look exactly like that?

[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:24.840]

[02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:26.380]
That is shocking.

[02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:28.280]
It was shocking as what it is.

[02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:30.080]
Okay, should we take one more?

[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:30.820]
I don't think so.

[02:20:30.820 --> 02:20:32.380]
Now we got a mobile and curl spring.
