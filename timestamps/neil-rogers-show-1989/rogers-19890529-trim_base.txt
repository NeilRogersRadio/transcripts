[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.360]
That's good. Oh great. Don't stop

[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.860]

[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.320]
No, it's not working Henry don't you know just calm down

[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.900]
1007 a W I O D and Henry's been crawling around on his hands and knees all morning in the loo's room so that you give you an idea

[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.680]
This is it. This is the end. I'm going on strike on the next another fourth of July. I'll be on vacation anyway

[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.420]
That's easy for you to say

[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.440]
That's right. You'll be on vacation that weekend collection of highlands where the hell is highlands North Carolina

[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.420]
Well, we don't care about that. I feel like crap. I walk out the front door this morning. There's a snake on

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.040]
my front

[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.080]
Thing there on my stoop whatever you call it in front of your door is a snake not a big one just a

[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.620]
Smallish one

[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.540]
Yep up what it's falling. Oh the fan is falling. Maybe we'll have a fire in here or something

[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.280]
God that would be the best thing that ever happened to this place

[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.220]
It's the only way we'll get any time off. I'll tell you that and we probably do the show from channel seven

[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.240]
Well, that's great boy. Thank God for fat rich. I just a little circulate the thing is blowing hot air

[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.840]
And we got enough hot air at W.I. already okay?

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.740]
It's blowing hot air see now if the corporate

[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.960]
bureaucratic assholes were here today you can be damn sure they'd have the AC people in here and the engineers will be up on a ceiling

[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.060]
We're all here all alone and it feels like death in here man. This is pathetic. What the hell are we doing here today?

[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.320]
Good question and I got a Cubs game at one o'clock and we're trying to find WTBS playing the Braves in Atlanta

[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.840]
Why do you have to find a station? Yes on his cable three hours before the game?

[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.760]
Yeah, have you had to find anything on his cable system? Well, yeah, yeah, it could be a point

[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.920]
This this cable system is probably then have TVS, you know

[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.660]
KT LA in Los Angeles or something without good luck. This is this goal code. It's the weirdest way ever

[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.500]
Vest sparing no expense to bring you the very best. So this is gonna be quite a show

[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.120]
They're gonna get what they're paying for today. I'm buying over here. Yeah

[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.120]
Oh, man, I felt like puke coming in here, but now coming and sitting in this blowing hot air

[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.580]
From the vent so the fan is circulating the hot air

[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.700]
Feels like we're in a we're in a swamp like we're doing a show from the Everglades

[00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.940]
It might be what?

[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.180]
Frozen up

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.120]
Do you got a covered? It was turned off. It was turned off. It was turned off

[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.820]
Why was it turned off what kind of morons? So we got in this place. I don't wonder it wasn't

[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.740]
Geez, thank God for having like I said

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.540]
Hey listen, is it really working? Yeah, it was turned off

[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.140]
What are they doing conserving now? They're trying to save money. Oh, GTR got cold

[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.940]
Well, I saw their numbers. Okay, they're as cold as ice screw them. They got cold. They turned it off

[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.740]
How do you like this?

[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.400]
Jesus

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.020]
Yeah, some moron over a GTR turns the whole unit off so we can all just

Shritz over here all day on the holiday. What that nice. Yeah, thanks a lot. Okay. Thanks guys

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.140]
I mean, I grant it you can't get much colder than your numbers. We saw them. I hope you go down to a one in the next trend, okay?

[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.580]
Turned it off and then when his when their shift was over they just left. Yeah, don't worry about that door

[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.260]
Nope, everybody else in a building can just shwitz. Yeah, I like it

[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.600]
I think it's sick and nauseous and puke. I'm glad when you hear that music on GTR. Oh

[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.160]
God

[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.960]
And you think this fits in

[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.780]
Yeah, your mama

[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.300]

[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.460]
What's all this crazy question is

[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.140]

It wasn't bad enough. We had mr. Rogers with this sneaker zone

[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.940]
Now we got some ridiculous broad with a what do you call it that she's wearing some kind of a

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.380]
Pomona

[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.540]
Like some kind of a goy-ish or kimono that she's wearing with a thing of flowers around she's doing a little kazaki

[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.260]
She's doing a swim. Where's Bobby Freeman? Look at that. She's saying come on. Let's swim with Bobby Frida

[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260]
Like that. Oh

And that's mr. Rogers is on there look at that. Oh, oh god nice. No wonder the countries all screwed up

[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.520]
You're watching this crap this idiot with a sweater and a sneakers and all these bombed out zonked out

[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.960]
His back is got on there. No wonder America's going to hell in a hand basket. Oh

[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.040]
God what do you want sir?

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.580]
Deal. Yeah, how you doing? Well, these call. This is a good start. You hear the sound

[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.520]
I'm about ready to sit on a stream myself here in a second

[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.640]
So I hear this and brother. I hope you don't get stuck

[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.000]
But I I got to know the what the regional

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.060]
Up here the newspapers are my Amy wanted four to one they had to win three games in a row and then

[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.440]
There was a really interesting game Georgia Tech and Villanova was 18 to 16 in that game

[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.600]
It's a real good solid pitching

[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.800]
And in the Keynes a one two yesterday they beat Villanova four to one last night

[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.940]
So they're off to Omaha again. They won two yesterday. Yeah, who did it yesterday?

[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.880]
Going over who was the first game the first game was Central Florida where's this call from?

[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.260]
Highlands North Carolina. They don't have any news

[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.160]
No, bird you wouldn't believe it. No news at all comes one yesterday six to one. Bellucky had a shut out

[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.080]
And then it's thinking ugly Chris Sabo hit another home run for the reds

[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.480]
But it comes one it easily six to one and Sean Dunston drove in two more runs

[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.420]
So it's really exciting. I'm glad here as my two favorite teams of cover

[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.640]
Mike Bellucky when another complete game subcliff pitch the complete game on Saturday and Bellucky

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.440]
Completely mess today now. We know that streak will end today because Derek Sanderson starting for the Cubs

[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.860]
And he never gets by the fifth inning

[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.980]
Okay, I never never never in the

[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.900]
The Lambo journal up here all eight there's eight regionals going on the country and they report on three

[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.260]
One from the

[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.580]

Did you know there was a revolution in China? Yeah, I heard that bird. Oh, that did get up there

[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.120]

[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.840]
Nathan Hale is gonna be Steve's guest this afternoon

It's Fernando and then on sports talk they got Barbara Hale coming in was it Fernando's who beat the Gators?

[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.840]
In the first game yet the go the Gators. Yeah, yeah, and then he played for left field yesterday in the first game

[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.100]
He's just everywhere. All right. I'm glad to hear it

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.540]
Okay, well, you got all the information we'll ever need sir and have a wonderful life

[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.980]
Okay, easy for you to say what the hell I'm serious. This is the last holiday

[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.940]
I mean I might work like Tisha Bob

[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.740]
I'm not doing it. I am not doing it. It's ridiculous even like in

[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:48.020]
West Palm Beach we didn't work on these holidays. Oh my god three day weekend, you know once in a while even the

[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.460]
Talent even us mung-brain talent need a little extra day to recharge our batteries the Sally Fitzwood say

[00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:03.060]
Oh, man, this is this is pathetic. Thank God for Henry Barrow man and the only reason he did because he's been around here so long

[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:09.380]
He knows where everything is buried and I know that's who to go back the real reason he found he's got a bottle stands

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:16.100]
Where the unit is okay, we were gonna tell everybody. No, it's no surprise fifth race today

[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.920]
The bird is picking capital ABC with Castillo who won his first start at Halea

[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:28.180]
Did he run since then? I don't think sounds a second stark and then I trace I see they got medieval victory with Steve

[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.780]
Gaffley on on top well, I'm passing him up as you would expect and I'm going with one of my favorite horses

[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:39.020]
Billy Osage with a famous no rider. Oh in the ninth race had called her today of course

[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:44.400]
It's opening day of called her today and I got my pass my little pin here my media pin

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.940]
I wish I could get out there today, but the cubs come first. I hate to say it

[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.160]
But the cubs come for I guess I could leave about 12 30 huh?

[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.340]
I don't know why you're laughing. I'm serious. I'm hearted. I

[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.280]
Mean I realized I could see the first hour here, but then I miss a whole half hour in a way home

[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:05.260]
Wow, that's unacceptable isn't it? Yes, you possibly. I mean, then you won't be here tomorrow

[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.820]
So what are playing tomorrow night?

[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.620]
And there's gale out there wandering around in the hallway wondering what the hell is going on

[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.920]
Yes, wonder to gale. We wonder what the hell is going on see what it says on our clothes something about nasty boys

[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.840]
Yes, I'm a

[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.480]
Fascinating speaking of nasty boys Ross will be in about oh, I got to tell you an incredible story

[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.940]
Okay, well take the break when we get around to it. Okay. No hurry. We got no business today. It's a holiday

[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.020]
So what are we what are we doing here? Why don't they leave us alone already? Okay?

[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.040]
You idiot Disney. Why don't you leave us alone?

[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.180]
You don't see him here today do you notice? I could arrange it. I guarantee I could get him in here

[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.620]
You want to see me do that's okay? That's okay anyway, so I get a call

[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:59.100]
For getting to the phone call you see this piece of mail. Yeah, I'm curious about that has a return self-adressed stamped envelope in it

[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:05.620]
I'll do another story about Joe with seven ends after the break because he couldn't be listening to the his busy probably a wini roast like

[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.900]
See this holiday unfortunately has degenerated like all other holidays in America to excuse for everybody to get drunk

[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.340]
Yes, the only reason we have these holiday week area so everybody can get plowed

[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.540]
And then I hear on the news all these people got slaughtered in car accidents over the weekend and a great many of them

[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:27.660]
You know drunk drivers is that a surprise big surprise? I mean they've got you know every other billboard coming to work is a booze billboard

[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.160]
Okay, no, I don't get Henry upset because you got the air back on

[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.700]
Hi Neil. I enjoy you in your program

[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.560]
You always said don't bug me on the tapes for Christmas

[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.340]
But after hearing the blast you gave the guy for calling you the other day because he could call you about not receiving his tape

[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.040]
I feel I'm between a rock and a hard place

[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:51.480]
Oh, I see where this is going. Yeah, any of your houses canceled check and he did this and on and on and

[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.520]
So nice thing we got this when Rich was here. I like that

[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.540]
I would appreciate your checking on this for me. I check

[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.440]
We don't have it, okay

[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:10.120]
We don't know about it. We don't have it and we don't want to know about it, okay?

[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.080]
I'm in coherent. I needed I needed at least another three four hours sleep and I need to leave early to see the Cubs a glant of game

[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.180]
This is unacceptable is what it is. It's just unacceptable

[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.160]
And I asked you about all the other marginal talent in the market. They're working today most of them

[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.900]
Colonel. What does that tell you about the colonel is there? I said talent. Oh, oh, I'm sorry captain Dave was not there

[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.460]
Colonel has already had more days off. He's only been on the air like for six months over there

[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.860]
I already had more days on yeah, that's right. This is it for me never again

[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:48.820]
Never again in fact, I'm let me put it to this way any day that the high-level bureaucrats have off for some haul in other words

[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:54.720]
They won't take off for Sim Costa because they're all going anyway, but any day that they take off I'm taking off

[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.000]
Okay, so simple as that all right

[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.180]
1019 to W I O D

[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.260]
I don't do my job as well when I'm

[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:09.180]
Constantly today, huh? Does that fit in here today 22 after 10 at W I O D

[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:17.340]
Hurricanes are off to Omaha. I guess I mean sunny and Joe are off to Omaha. Oh, that's probably we I heard Rick this morning say the W I D will carry any

[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:26.040]
Evening or weekend games that the hurricanes play in Omaha. Oh, you know what that means. Yeah, means we don't get off any day

[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.840]
That's that's a crock of crap because I did the college world series for five years in a row

[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:35.980]
And I happened to know that they play many games in a morning like 11 30 games in early afternoon

[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.080]
Are you following me? Yes

[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:40.920]
now

[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:47.920]
All I know wouldn't make any difference anyway for us would it now yeah, just a little bit because Omaha's two hours behind

[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.800]
Oh, that's right. So they played 11 30 that would be 130

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.400]
Well, if they had a 15-minute pregame show 115. I'll take that

[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.560]
Forgot there two hours. He would take it. That's right

[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.620]
But not here at the island dreams man. We're just doing the least we can basically is the way it boils down

[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.940]
By the way, has anybody ever seen the California Angels? I don't want to get baseball intensive but down KTLA

[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.040]
out of Los Angeles. Have you ever seen any of the Angels game?

[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.040]
They were in Fenway yesterday. There was no crowd noise at all

[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.140]
It's not like they were in a vacuum tube and a guy who does the game

[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.160]
He's got one of these dick fatherly kind of boy. He is so bad. I mean Joe Tories

[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.420]
Okay, in the color, but you think Joe is spectacular because you just wish this other guy would never speak he is so boring

[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.260]
And all he wants to talk about he's kind of like somebody else we know about the SNS cafeteria

[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.900]
You know all he wants to talk about is oh he had breakfast with

[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.300]
Morning and he said so and so and then he was in a hotel and they were all getting ready and

[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.140]
Somebody took a bite out of every one of the donuts on the table like one of the pictures

[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:54.100]
And while he join her told him that he had a cramp in his rear end and oh geez honest to God the worst

[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.460]
The worst well not the worst. He's no Bob Murphy

[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.500]
It's a 24 how about those meds huh? Yeah

[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.420]
Well now I'm starting to come back a little bit like those meds boy. They're looking tough

[00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.340]
And I like that word that Rick Weaver had on the sports this morning. Yeah. How would you pronounce BALK?

[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.600]
BALK

[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.040]
BALK

[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.020]
BALK

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.460]
Roger McDowell BALKed in the so

[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.360]
Well, no that was Rick's way I don't blame him of protesting being here on a holiday

[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.020]
He's sick and tired of it too. He's been here forever

[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.800]
And now Sunny and the share are off there in Omaha

[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.020]
So no doubt some of these other people gonna have to work their tails off and they're getting pretty tired of it

[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.960]
Okay, I can't speak for them, you know

[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.260]
Well Rico come in and clarify

[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.340]
And then I heard Hank on sports talk Friday night making some idiotic comment to some guy about um

[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.860]
His bookie wouldn't say in bookie about betting on the game in the spread and the odds and all this and then of course

[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.960]
They're all of course so you're gonna be calling Las Vegas because we know it's illegal here

[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.840]
That was a caustic response

[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.820]
That nobody else will respond to because in America everybody and anybody can break the law when it comes to illegal gambling

[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.180]
Then it's a big joke, okay

[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.780]
Somebody goes out here in 79th street and picks up a hooker

[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.240]
Then right away we're gonna put him in jail for 30 years and the probably you know have him on a front page of the herald

[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.080]
right

[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.960]
This is what I really appreciate you putting this puppet show on the TV for there's mr. Rogers

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.100]
Well, it's the Roger show isn't it look at that

[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.640]
This is excellent. Yeah, they talk about this show being a bad role model for the kids of America look at him

[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:28.640]
Okay, he looks if he didn't have those heavy sneakers on he'd float away that sucker look at him

[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.120]
Hi boy, thank you

[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.600]
You have a sweater

[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:40.200]
25 past 10 to W.I.O.D. Look at all those calls on the board. Isn't that heartwarming? I couldn't give a damn less, okay?

[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.740]
Oh, isn't this cute

[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.080]
This Roger is a man here like this

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.060]
Oh, you're gonna love this

[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.720]
Oh, and it's the whole thing too

[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.420]
And you know what he always says

[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.580]
I'm a cup man

[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.140]
I don't do my job as well when I'm constipated

[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.960]
I bet almost

[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.300]
Let's close

[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.480]
Oh, yeah, anybody can talk about fair Roger. Oh, it's there's something gonna happen. Yeah, it's gonna sing

[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.660]
The beautiful name is named for red a beautiful day for labor

[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.860]
Would you want to be my neighbor

[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.340]
Listen kids don't ever sit on my friend Roger's lap

[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.280]
Don't ever and if red Rogers plays Santa I run and call my daddy immediately, okay?

[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.360]
Scream scream for your life

[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.500]
What is Andy one here now? We got like an open show. We got the door open

[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.240]
You know

[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.100]
Somebody out there

[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.680]
Get out and handle it

[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.940]
Here's a really interesting story in the paper. It says trainer John P

[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.940]
Poochek Poochek

[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.640]
Who got into an altercation with jockey Steve Gaffley on after Saturday's featured 10th race was fine

[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.800]
$500 something by the highly astords

[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.160]
Now wonder where Steve finished in that race in the 10th race

[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.080]
Oh, I don't know which was his horse okay because Jabitinsky with Gonzalez wanted

[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:27.300]
And there were only six horses in the race. Oh was it try on the even money shot the finished

[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:33.380]
Fifth and a six horse race could that have been it try on try on you went off even money and ran fifth

[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.720]
I bet you that was the one that Gaffley owned head in the 10th race poor Steve, you know

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.160]
He's a wonderful guy, but get serious

[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.520]
28 past 10 at WIOD and it's getting a little a cooler in here. Yeah, well, no, no, no, no

[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.580]
Leave it by the time I leave at 12 30

[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:52.580]
I have something here of interest to you today. This is out of that. I have the new

[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.840]
Before you do that is much more important okay, what I'll go ahead

[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:02.000]
It's a quote from our friend. Oh excuse me Martha. I haven't even eaten anything. No, I got a bad

[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.920]
I just feel snoshes from this room

[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.220]
I was a little under the weather when I came in. I think we need a class action suit against the company now for providing unsanitary

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:16.080]
We're I think we got Legionnaires disease coming out of here. Thanks to the idiots at GTR. Okay. I can I can see the little

[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.240]
Virai running around there. Yeah, can't you?

[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.960]
Well, it's Memorial Day soon. We talk about Legionnaires disease. Yeah, I see or would that be in poor taste? Okay

[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:30.840]
It's just a joke don't all these veterans band to get so up high. Did you hear what what's his name with sand?

[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.280]
From GTR. Yeah, what is his name being the bean Jim McBean beans

[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.280]
The Jim beans Jason boy the veterans are really uptight today

[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.260]
Well, of course they're uptake because these two morons over here next door this morning were ragging on them

[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.140]
Said they should have all gotten killed in service or some nice thing, you know as they usually do uh-oh

[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.120]
What is that? Oh, isn't that oh?

[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.280]
Thank you guys for whatever that is, but I'm I'm not eating okay captain Jimmy 29 past

[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.460]
I'm if I ate man you'd have a mess in here

[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:05.840]
You would drown, but we appreciate the sentiment captain Jimmy's is here. That's wonderful some subs anyway our friend Martha

[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:12.680]
Plumpton now you know who she related to George Marty. We call her Martha Plumpton. Yeah, that's uh river river Phoenix

[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:18.120]
The husband well you're not can believe this, but Martha Plumpton has shaved her head

[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:25.560]
And I heard he shaved his head to for the new movie called silence like glass

[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.900]
Mm-hmm. She shaved her head

[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.680]
He did she

[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.260]
It did wouldn't it be great if both of them shaved their heads didn't you really wouldn't have any idea what was going

[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.560]
It's pretty touch and go now when you look at that pair

[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.020]
But if they both shave their heads in you'd have no clue you'd have to bring in like a gynecologist

[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.640]
Marty shaved her head

[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:52.460]
She says it's not easy to make friends in this situation people don't know if you're bald because you're a skinhead or because you're sick

[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.840]
That's the little quote from yeah Martha Plumpton. I think sick is the operative

[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.120]
Boy

[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.560]
10 30 a w i o d we hope you're having a great holiday weekend and uh if you're gonna get smashed

[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.760]
Just hang around the house. Okay. Just take a long chat at the bottom of the pool and stay off the road

[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.620]
There wasn't a lot of traffic this morning

[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.500]
But what was out there was really a mess man. It were real slow. Oh, yeah

[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.620]
Oh, boy, I really weird not much to the other holidays when it's like almost clear sailing this morning

[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.840]
It was like they were running a little interference especially on the 79th street in the causeway

[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.060]
Slow, I mean so slow you have no idea

[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.900]
So you can always depend on this town now. I can give you any breaks. I shouldn't know

[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:38.100]
My front door to leave for working. It was a snake on my doorstep. That should have been the first clue to stay the hell out here

[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.380]
You know

[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.540]
Not a bad snake just a little snake, you know a little snake

[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.860]
Yeah, I mean I'm not too crazy about snakes

[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.560]
But it wasn't one that I started screaming and running the house and through the dogs on to protect me

[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.680]
Wasn't that kind of snake? Oh, just a little snake in a little snake. Yeah plantation snake a plantation snake

[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.500]
There are a lot of snakes in plantation, okay? I

[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.100]
Shouldn't say that because I

[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:06.560]
Got my permit on my satellite. They like I said I love plantation and the politicians there are the greatest and I love them the pieces

[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.400]
And look at that there's a little

[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.820]
Isn't that great? I talked about a snake and we got all these reptiles on a TV. I'm mr. Rod

[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.700]
There's this channel. There's a lot of broadets. Sure. I'm my favorite a broadetsaurus. That was a Jewish reptile

[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.740]
That was the first Jewish dinosaur was a broadetsaurus

[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.120]
I like this channel. It's 1031. I don't like this channel. Okay, and the sooner we get it off

[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.380]
Can you go fish around here and see if we can get TBS because it's already 1031

[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.780]
And a 105 the cubs in a braid. Hey, you'll be okay. You can be too nervous

[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.880]
I'm not gonna be discussing anything. I'm gonna be watching the game on one o'clock

[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.540]
Okay, if I have to be here that's bad enough

[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.820]
But when the cubs play nothing is more important in my life than the cubs, okay?

[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.240]
If they never win another game the rest of the season so far. It's been so great

[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.880]
You have no idea. You're right. I have no idea

[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.920]
Even without Andre Dawson all the kvetshing about Andre Dawson Andre's like a week away from coming back

[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.180]
Well, I know I've been sleeping real well. I have to

[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.500]
Until last night when somebody came home about a quarter to three in the morning

[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:09.440]
And I still would have slept through it, but he closes the door and tiny jumps off my bed and goes running out into the house

[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.240]
And starts barking and screaming and puking and I wake up and I've had it's been a rough weekend

[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.000]
I got all these mosquito bites the size of cum quats. Yeah

[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.140]
They are man. They're small now, but they were as big as watermelons over the weekend

[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.520]
Look canus! Would you get that crap off?

[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:33.900]
And then I woke up and I'd been sleeping through it and then they started hurting and I got this meta quick spray and back teen and all this other and usually that works great

[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.680]
Not this weekend. It doesn't work at all. These are the play and get out there on holiday

[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.940]
So for two hours I lay there spraying and scratching and excruciating pain

[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.260]
And I think part of it was my Monday morning allergy known I had to come here to cover

[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.220]
Well, that must be TBS. It's got cartoons on okay? Is that TV?

[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.340]
Close. No, I'll not leave on MTV. I don't want to see that crap

[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.260]
They might have Steve Tyler on there and I'll see how bad he really looks

[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.200]

Six is that sick? Good. Be I mean who knows if anybody knows what channel gold coast cable is on on

[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:32.680]
With TBS on gold coast you got flutters in your stomach. It's already 1034 games at 105. So you're real nervous

[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.720]
See when it's in Atlanta, it's always 105

[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.480]

[00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:01.240]
I know where parma Michigan is now. This is parma Ohio where big Wilson used to say that everyone wore white socks. Yeah

[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:08.700]
No, not here. He bet he didn't wear it. Do you want Jewish Federation television? No, would you please? No, give me that thing. I don't want to show

[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.200]
So anyway, it's a nice day in Cleveland. Yeah, I'm coming. I live in Davie not too far from where yeah, how about those Indians?

[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.280]
How about those Indians? Yeah, what did they lose a couple games? No, they won yesterday

[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.040]
Yeah, Ross for the row and this is what is it 25 oh wait a minute

[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.020]
We just found WTBS sir look at that. It's exciting as hell

[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.020]
That hours away from the Cubs game my god

[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.440]
And Scott Sanderson's pitching day because we want to give the braves a good chance and we will

[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.820]
That's great. Who's a point? Who's a comes playing today? Let me say it again the braves. We want to give him a chance

[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.420]
I'm not paying attention to him a little hearing problem up there in parma

[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:51.660]
So I know it's a long way I know it's pretty hard for these signals to transmit all the way from here to parma

[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.180]
Where is parma nearser is that near Cleveland? Yeah, near Northfield problem

[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.780]
These are simple questions for simple people let me say it again is in your north field where the racetrack is no

[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.420]
It's on the other side. Thank god. Thank God boy that racetrack. Oh man

[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.220]
Years ago. I was indietroid. We got a tip on a horse at Northfield

[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.820]
I've told a story before the name of the horse was mr. Z

[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.340]
I'm making it up. Yes

[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.240]
And I should have known then that anything named mr. Z from that point in my life would be a disaster

[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.740]
And we drove all the way from Detroit to Cleveland

[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.140]
We get to the track. We plunged our brains out. We've been him down to three to one

[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.440]
He had the rail it was the one horse. He never he broke away six from the gate

[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.860]
He never improved his position the whole race and it was a long trip back to Detroit

[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.980]
What does that mean did I have any money there?

[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.200]
I found a pigeon outside my door during the cubs game

[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.500]
And I said here take this over to high a league. They needed it for the handle

[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.580]
Had no for anyway, I want to thank you for as he left the track

[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.060]
He was smiling at the flamingos and said I just put everything I had on number two

[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.280]
Number two

[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.780]
Well, anyway, I want to thank you for pushing interest of my last 54 pounds in four months. Oh good luck to you sir

[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.320]
Well, it's too bad some of it was between your ears, but nothing is good

[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.780]
I can't hear too well such a long distance. Yeah, I know well. Have a great day now. Bye. Bye. Say how to big Wilson for us, okay?

[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:18.000]
Oh, boy. What a place this is okay. I'm we're gonna find out who the asshole is who turned the AC off in this building

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.400]
All they had to do is turn the thermostat up to like 74 and there be as warm as they could spit their brains out

[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.260]
It could be like an a son of that, but that wasn't good enough

[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.640]
Okay, they couldn't just turn it up. They had to go to the main unit and shut the damn thing off

[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.740]
So everybody else could be uncomfortable throughout the rest of the weekend if it wasn't for the very astute Henry Barrow

[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.780]
I like the way they just left then if was a stupid

[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:47.100]
I like that just left. Yeah, I like that. Screw everybody else. Okay. I was warm. That's all that matters. Yeah

[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.360]
Boy

[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.260]
Those people over at GTR man, they can't get arrested now

[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:58.260]
Did you call that person did that an asshole? Yeah, she said well, that's very good a serious asshole. Okay. Thank you

[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.860]
Not just your regular ordinary run of the mill, but a serious

[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.820]
Okay, I'm so sick today man. You have no idea. I'm just nauseous

[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.780]
nauseous and I think it's like because yesterday I felt fine

[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.320]
All weekend at a great weekend it comes where scoring runs like it was coming out of a sieve

[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:23.640]
And everything was great now. Are you nervous about the braves? Is that what the bottom of this is you're real nervous

[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.700]
I'm gonna be nervous about the braves

[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.700]
They did beat the cardinals two nights ago and then

[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.280]
Three nothing they tied it up and got rained out so the you are nervous

[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.180]
Passing the cardinals are three games behind the cubs. I just mentioned that

[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.520]
nervous and then they're thinking Montreal man

[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.640]
How the hell did they swing that deal and get they get this incredible picture is gonna win about 25 games for them

[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.240]
Mike Langston

[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.400]
Mark Langston well, whatever the hell you can call them anything you want. He's making so much money

[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.660]
Mark Langston pitched a four-hitter

[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.960]
And struck out 12 yesterday in his first game with Montreal. Yes, Seattle didn't need him you know Seattle such a

[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.300]
stellar team

[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.700]
They didn't need him anymore

[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.820]
So Montreal are probably win the whole damn thing now

[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.160]
It's 1038 at W.I.O.D.

[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:18.120]
You know, that's amazing part of it. We got all his food kept in Jimmy's brought all his food and then Arnold's a royal castle bringing food later

[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.880]
And I have a feeling that nobody's gonna show up here today that first stunk in a Todd didn't he say he was working today

[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.540]
We're not feeding him anymore. Okay. He's been shining us. He is working is here. Oh

[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.060]
How do you know that?

[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.720]
How this guy knows everything. I don't we don't know we don't know anything. He knows everything. Okay. We take it all back Todd

[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.640]
You're okay in my book anyway

[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.920]
Annie's here and gale is here

[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:48.040]
Rogers here very briefly he'll be flying out of here the minute that the Nick walks in the door or is Nick may not show up

[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.640]
and oh look at that Matt's stick is running the boy an alias bourbon

[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.720]
And buddy hack it we've already made our picks the burger all our capital ABC in the fifth. I'm picking Billy O's age in the ninth

[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.580]
But boy there's a

[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.240]
Oh, I'm gonna get so sick

[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:12.960]
Salad. I mean don't take it personally the food. I is great, but I just I'm so sick to my stomach and just watching you making a pig out of yourself

[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.600]
Well, look at that my monodies is running today. Wow

[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:23.100]
All our favorites are running today. This is incredible quacking up. Oh in the seventh

[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.740]
Naval Academy spelled with an E. I like that

[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.520]
And

[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.400]
What is all this great? Well, I'd go out to colder today and just plunge my guts out

[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.900]

[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.520]
Mori puppet. Hello. Hi Neil. How are you?

[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.400]
Hello

[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.680]
How do you think my greeting formula is working?

[00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.900]
Well, when I'm

12 races the tenth is um the big race Gary Stevens on the line is eight to five in a morning line

[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:14.140]
Proper reality with Jerry Bailey seeking the gold with Pat day. He should only finish dead last that pat day

[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.160]
Boy, do I dislike him a lot

[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.740]
Uh, trite and tree with Chris Antley finders choice with the Kent

[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.260]
Desermo how do you pronounce his name? That's a kid from um

[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.840]
Philadelphia that's so good hot hot as a pistol. He's gonna be the next Antley

[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.000]
The Sormo and that is named

[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.740]
Whatever the hell of it is dancing spree with no rider forever silver with Julie Cron

[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.060]
And it's academic with the famous no rider boy. All I care is that seeking the gold finishes way

[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:50.800]
Back with pat day then he'll have some excuse. Yeah, complain. Yeah, he'll he'll lodge a foul against the rest of the field for running too fast

[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.620]
But I really have really enjoyed the phone calls this morning

[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.380]
They what phone calls. Yeah exactly

[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.320]
Well, I am so out of it you have no idea this

[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.200]
This company man what they understand about giving you a little time to regain your uh

[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.520]
Sanity and of course remember I should have already had a week's vacation

[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.520]
But I had to postpone it because we've got that simple to back there in the sales office

[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.860]
I don't want to start in on a Lynn

[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.100]
Friday's but she had to you know cause me to postpone my whole vacation

[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.820]
And then she tried to pull it again

[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.180]
Yeah, she tried to pull it again. She said well, how about the week after this for a moment?

[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:25.840]
I said wait a minute

[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:30.960]
Doesn't it dawn on you that I already told you that I was gonna be on vacation that week no

[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:36.580]
She'll do anything to screw up your life that woman she will do anything in her power to screw up your life

[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:42.880]
Here's a tape that just came in boy. We just got all kinds of stuff coming in here. Oh, this is probably for you rich

[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.160]
It's called rob's moon

[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.880]
God poor rob

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.400]
It's another roblo tape well

[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.660]
It's professionally recorded by studio 109

[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.000]
Or studio I don't get it studio 109 is it oh

[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.540]
It's Lakanto production so it's frank Lakanto so we know it's gonna be what

[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.900]
Specialty song yes, well produced for this show

[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.860]
1053 we mail an apology to GTR because there's somebody over there for turning the uh air off

[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:22.840]
Because maybe the unit is busted and they went in there and they shut it off on purpose because it's boiling in Roger studio in a control room

[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:29.900]
It's boiling yes, it's telling Henry thought he really had it fixed and we appreciate Henry's efforts says he staggers back into the news booth but

[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:34.500]
You matter fact that see gale is gonna be doing the 11 o'clock news Henry is a little

[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.560]
Electoral day so we probably ought apology to GTR but we aren't gonna give one because there are a bunch of douchebags anyway

[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.440]
Right

[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.420]
Well, yeah, they deserve a shot especially that spike wise who's a real putts

[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.220]
It's 10 in fact if you look up putts in the dictionary you see spike wise is picking right

[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.160]
Looks like silly grin idiotic haircut

[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.540]
1054 a W I O D we have an open line in bokeh we haven't even given the numbers now

[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.300]
We already got seven stinking calls on

[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.760]
Why do you like that we have a long distance calls are incredible from the big city like parma o'hio where they said

[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.660]
Murray puppet puppet puppet jr

[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.640]
And of course bills. Oh

[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:19.820]
Only two hours and 11 minutes away from broadcast time the game I guess be 115 uh-oh. Are you gonna be okay?

[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.400]
No

[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:28.020]
Then at two o'clock then I got a drive home it takes me at least 40 minutes and I can't hear it on a radio boy

[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:33.860]
What are you gonna do? I can't take that 40 minutes. I already imagine all the runs at sanderson could give up in 40 minutes

[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.440]
I can just see Murphy hitting one that's still on the way like to aintry Georgia

[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.740]
That's got sanderson boy and I hit an amazing part of it is he's got the best record on the team

[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.480]
He's five and two don't ask me how got the highest earned run average he sucks

[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:54.560]
But he's five and two so much liver right I guess uh. He's okay for five meat desperate innings five struggling desperate innings

[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.540]
But we want to especially salute shaw and dunston

[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:05.480]
For that clutch hit again yesterday. Shawns uh motto is I may not hit often, but I hit when accounts okay like once every tissue both

[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.060]
Stupid stuff on the facts. Yeah, you people out there who are stupid don't bother us today. Okay from papito

[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.420]
Great. Papito go away. Will you go leave us alone?

[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.500]
Will you bug you bug me okay? Go away and

[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:24.740]
Speaking of go away so Friday morning we had a call on the air from a stunned and shocked Joe with six ends remember

[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.900]
Sure, we hadn't heard from in weeks and weeks and weeks suspiciously with all these things we've been hearing

[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.140]
And he asked me was very frantic called me at home yesterday or a Friday afternoon

[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.320]
And wondering what I was talking about with a CIA and all this other stuff and I told him all these little rumors

[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.480]
I've been hearing about him being an ojohn provocateur

[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:49.980]
And then his story about this guy following him from my house to his work and the story keeps embellishing and any

[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.100]
Legitly got a call from the same guy at home

[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.260]
asking if he knew nea Rogers and the guy hung up the phone and

[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:03.220]
Where am I going on vacation and just a whole so I invited me go with me just to see what the reaction would be and what was the react?

[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.660]
Well, he's got another job

[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.420]

[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:14.200]
So I think I'm going like to Lakeland on vacation instead. I'm not great. I changed it twice already

[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.820]
And I think I'm gonna change it again because I think I probably if I went to where originally was going to

[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:24.020]
I think I get on a plane and looking there be like 30 other familiar faces on the airplane with me

[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:28.560]
Just wanting to make sure everything is kosher. I just I'm not into that at all. You know, I travel alone

[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.380]
Oh, I don't know what history is, but it just gets it's a little bit too bizarre for me

[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.240]
Okay, I just don't know what it's getting more complicated and more

[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.980]
Intelligence each day goes by

[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.080]

[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.800]
And I'm over here exactly

[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:15.080]
It's not gonna happen and I'm gonna tell you today. It's the perfect day to tell you upstate New York without going into all the details

[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.780]
You knew that

[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.240]
It's not gonna happen

[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.840]

[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.000]
I can kind of monitor your activity by the way

[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.700]
I like chose a little joke Friday that he's coming in here when you go on vacation to see me. Yeah, that's a real funny

[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.640]
Why he's gonna be busy with his new job. Oh, okay

[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:08.100]
So all these people that are going away. Please don't waste any time. Okay, like stem is going to sleep away camp

[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:15.020]
When you were almost 20 years old, did you always prefer to camp your sleep away

[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.500]
Sleep away camp in Jersey. Oh my

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.220]
It's like going to sleep away camp in Tamarack. I had church in Tamarack when they go to camp. It's for a long rest. It is I mean a long

[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.900]
It isn't newwork is it

[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.960]
I think that good

[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.900]
He's going to sleep away

[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.180]
Where do I find these people you know, how do they find me that's the real question interesting. Yeah

[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.660]
But it's been nice knowing all of them 1059

[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.680]
No idea sick to my stomach. What do we have in a 1 o'clock hour by the way? We got a lot of life stuff in there that we could

[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:06.240]
Jam in before then I'm going home early. I'm telling you right now. I think he is. I really think everybody's gonna say

[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.760]
Oh, it's close to the cubs game. I got news for you. I may not even watch the game

[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.400]
I may just go home and lay down and sleep

[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:17.960]
Put the tape on I think you are leaving early. I may. I just do it. Just out of the hospital. Right. Go on strike

[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.080]
They got some god damn nerve bringing us in here on Memorial Day

[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.220]
Boy boy are they without conscience, you know, and even when they are here

[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:29.280]
They're out playing golf and jerking around when they are here, you know

[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.740]
Anyway, Henry's already on his way. I'll watch out for him if you're driving gale not so bright has the 11 o'clock news and

[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.840]
Rich and the bird will be back and maybe me at 11.05

[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:52.500]
Hey

[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.660]
Okay, it's 11.05 at W I O D and we're only two hours away from game time

[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.820]
Yeah, oh, man, we got the fan. So Henry, we appreciate your efforts, but it wasn't the

[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:20.320]
That was not the solution to our problem. Okay, the whole unit is becauc as they say in China

[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:20.360]
Yeah

[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.920]
Is it what Boon said the other one brought the food in there? He said something about his building you said it's pacac

[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.680]
And it's exactly like everything else that happens on a holiday

[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.880]
But we take captain Jimmy's for the great spread. They're wonderful folks. Yeah, brought by delicious stuff

[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.320]
Just numerous times

[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.740]
And I had a little slice of dill pickle there and I'm not sure whether I'm getting sick or better was very good as always

[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.720]
But I'm I am really a ranked today

[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.140]
You know, it could be you think that when you get these

[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:54.760]
Enormous mosquito bites and it gets in your system. No, no, I mean like a whole bunch of

[00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:00.660]
I can't make you nauseous when you keep spraying it with that stuff for hours and hours. I know

[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:05.060]
Thanks, uh, and inhaling that awful crap when it doesn't help

[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:11.240]
But I woke up weird this morning too because I feel like I'm gonna breath any minute here. Yeah, I know

[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.160]
Like all over these CDs. Well about 105. I think you may come out of it

[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:23.540]
You know, no, not what sanderson pitching with you. I'm gonna get a lot sicker. Oh, he is deadly scot sanderson

[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:29.160]
Well, I guess they wanted how come mad at this and pitching today is there anybody out there who has any idea what's going on

[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.560]
The rotation is all screwed up now because Sutcliffe mr. Turn

[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:44.340]
With that back thing in fact Sandberg mr. Game mr. And we still want how do you like that? No Dawson no Sandberg in a cup still blew away the reds

[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.400]
How do you like that now is this like rotisserie baseball

[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:55.720]
If that norm can't don't stop bugging me about rotisserie baseball and alter cocker baseball

[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.640]
He's driving me nuts. He wants to be president now with the softwool to shuffle board league

[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:09.600]
And I said how about rotisserie shuffle gory there. Yeah, what a great. I want high me an Irving from windmore on my team

[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.000]

Oh look at that Irving got a nine

[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:21.060]
It's 11 awaited W I O T. We may take a couple of calls this hour too, huh? Or we might just uh

[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:28.700]
Wow, you sure haven't heard from this guy in a long time. I'm he's finished into the woodwork kind of like holiday music you get sent

[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.780]
To my killer. My death or king

[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.400]
Isn't it low real low

[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:39.880]
It is

[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:43.600]
I

[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.300]
Got a crank wide open there's no feedback

[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.140]
I'm telling I'm going on strike on Mondays. Okay, you can go through Monday

[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.640]
I just this every Monday is traumatic. Yeah

[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.560]
Because the weekend crew has been in here. Uh, oh geez. That looks so good, you know, but I have a feeling if I eat it

[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:07.340]
May make you feel better rest all over the place. I make you feel a little better. All right, let me try one

[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.480]
Oh now look at what he's doing. You know you you may

[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.320]
He's trying to play mr hero here with the hero sandwich and he's like um

[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.420]
Scooping all the insides out and tossing the bread out like he's gonna impress us like Linda might be listening from neutral system

[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:32.240]
Well, I might take a little bite. Okay, just just one piece. I think it's gonna be a mistake. No, I don't think so

[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:38.680]
I really don't because I'm nauseous man. I am real not stabilize your little may help to

[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.520]

[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.260]
I mean, yeah

[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:52.400]
Well, we're on the countdown here. It's like an hour 56 minutes now. So, you know, you got a lot of pressure

[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.200]
ah

[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.940]
How about that mic bollucky, huh?

[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.140]
I got to earn one average of about 1.6 now, okay

[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.140]
And nobody there was one of these sports shows on last night. I think it was on

[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:12.020]
I think it was on this station. Uh-oh. It's on before that idiot costus

[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.780]
One thing I'll say, you know, I it's almost impossible to be universally dislike usually somebody likes you

[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.420]
I don't know anybody likes costus

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.420]
Even big Dave hates

[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.880]
Costus because you know he stays up and watches Letterman. Yeah, so I guess he's seen some of that afterward. Yeah

[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.140]
And he hates him. Hey

[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.380]
Well, I watch a little wise ass snobby pseudo-ital

[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.660]
To all puts let's say I don't watch the sports shows. He does but oh my god. Do I oh?

[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.200]
So he anyway, he was doing the game Saturday because NBC

[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.100]
Murder god

[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:47.220]
Now do they tell of eyes that game here or would they tell by the Yankee game on

[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:48.760]
NBC

[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.760]
See because if you didn't have I didn't have the satellite dish. I would have missed the cubs game because it was not the primary game

[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.900]
But on F212, which is WXIA in Atlanta

[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.360]
NBC there was Bob costus no less. Oh, why?

[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.700]
And Tony pardon me for being a goofball Kubak

[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:11.840]
Since that ball hit him in the throat in the 60 World Series. He's never been the sees speaks with a quaggle

[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.640]
Dickie Don deke Don

[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:20.340]
It's 11 past 11 at WIOD. We're just having a hell of a good time and I'm so happy to be here

[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:25.040]
You can't imagine and we hope you're having a great holiday weekend wherever you are and don't forget

[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.680]
Make those wini's real hot before you pop them in your mouth, okay

[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:30.640]
Anyway

[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.860]
Then this is good, you know, but I'm just gonna have to eat it in real small

[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.380]
Exactly because I don't want to breath more even worse than that. I don't want to have another Oakland episode

[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.840]
Yeah, that's right now one good thing the building is pretty well cleared out. Yeah, it's right

[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.140]
It's a clear that used to really frost my something one and remember with the other building

[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.360]
Mm-hmm once in a while it'd be a full house

[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.100]
And they would say well go in the back of the building Ron Harrison's got his own

[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.740]
His own setup

[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.140]
And I'd say you don't understand I'm never gonna make it all the way back there members eddies to have their staff meetings in the

[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.100]
Public restroom remember that when you when we were on I&C and oh yeah

[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:16.560]
Yeah, if I'm used to have their staff meetings in the restroom and you couldn't get in with Jeff Chase used to be kind of like the a pivot man in that meeting

[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.580]
But it's true they had a locker room. That's what sport. He does on another on sports channel. Yeah, you're favorite

[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.780]
Yeah, my favorite. I think there's something symbolic about it. No, there

[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.000]
And

[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:34.700]
Okay, 1115

[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.160]
At W I O D

[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.740]
Isn't this interesting what I'm just looking at this little thing here

[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.760]
Anyway, let's take a call or two and then we'll do another break and we'll uh before you know it

[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:55.640]
It'll be comes baseball time. Mm-hmm. Now you're gonna do play by play. Can't do play by play. It's illegal. Oh too bad

[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.520]
But you could do it in the past tense. Oh kind of like wait what you should do with the reds

[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.000]
Past tense

[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:14.480]
Mm-hmm at oh talk about horrendous John Sterling and who's the goofball it does uh jay John Stone for the Yankee games on a station the absolute worst

[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.320]
The worst and they keep trying to be funny and they're not

[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.900]
Like a lot of people in this market on the air

[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.740]
Yeah, I wouldn't say they're the worst. They're not as exciting as

[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.500]
Harry Callison Philadelphia

[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:32.520]
He sounds like he went into coma 400 years ago. He's like a cross between Byram Som and Bob Elson

[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:37.940]
He's always talking like this

[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:39.840]
Oh

[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.440]
Nobody cares. Yeah, I'm looking forward to when you give somebody's name that I know

[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.880]
I can't help it that you don't know anything except uh Phoebe Ketch's boobs, okay?

[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.000]

[00:48:53.660 --> 00:49:01.000]
Oh my god, I'm gonna tell you one more time. This is the purpose of calling the show is not to try to be a comedian. Okay, because you're not funny

[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:03.640]

Yeah, I got a solution for your cub game. I got two solutions here

[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:39.000]
Um number one if you watch it there at the station you can leave here hairy carry that way you just keep playing the carts over and over

[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.900]
Yeah, you know what I mean? Uh-huh

[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:44.860]
All right, what else you can do is when you get down to your car when you go to leave um have called big day

[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:48.020]
Have you know put the phone up to the team? Yeah, I never thought about that

[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.440]
That's a good idea that'll cost me about a hundred dollars going home. Oh, he's well missed nothing. That's true

[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.000]
You think he's gonna be awake at two o'clock while you're dreaming

[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:56.960]
No

[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.200]
Probably taking a long nap for about 15 hours

[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:09.080]
Can you hear anything on this overhead? Very little. It's not the fan. Is that can I be hearing it? It's just real low

[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.460]
I won't hear the fan. Are you sure in there today?

[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:12.800]
Mm-hmm

[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.060]
There's nobody here today. Huh you were just appointed in her what?

[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.700]
A special attitude what she said the other day about what's his name Ross on the air that's not you know

[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.580]
Well, I I forthorough to repeat it on air because she said it off the year

[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:33.580]
And I figured if she said it off the year the least she can do is repeated in you know not take shots behind his back

[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.600]
Yeah, but the worst part of it is Ross is a great looking guy and for her to say that

[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.520]
I mean if we're true it would be okay, but he's uh he's tremendous. Okay. He I mean I know what he's like

[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.120]
You know around the farm

[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.800]
Well, but I'm just saying the point is not only was it a cheap shop, but it's not true

[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:56.800]
She should only be so lucky to get anybody looked like that. She should kiss the ground if anybody looked like that even looked at her

[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.040]
Hey, I could remove just don't look at her

[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.380]

Oh, man, you really get out of here. Yeah, there's no idea what he's talking about

[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.800]
Sharon's a nice lady, but she's hot

[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:19.320]
He's no idea. She doesn't go to the remote does she was at one I won maybe he doesn't even know what he's talking about

[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:25.840]
One of the others which makes his comments even more embarrassing a salesperson maybe yeah think about it a little

[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.840]
And she gives me one. It's already booked, you know

[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.180]
There was the only date she could possibly give me that would have created a problem

[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.580]
Sure enough. That's the one she's got. Okay

[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:55.040]
Why she is she's even making Bill Mullin look pretty good nobody ever dreamed that can't know

[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:57.080]

We got I mentioned before trappers alley, which is implantation. Mm-hmm. The shocking news is we now have the salvos in plantation

[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.460]
What I know it's a shock in fact the best part of it is

[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:32.240]
It's right in front of my old favorite windixi there on sunrise in Pine Island

[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:40.100]
In Jacaranda Square and it is tremendous if you like a great family style Italian food then the salvos is for you

[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:43.960]
In fact, then we got some takeout from there the other day didn't make a big simmiss about it

[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:48.840]
But the day went by and picked it up. I had some spaghetti and sausage and we got some baked ziti

How do you like that at the salvos? They're open Monday through Thursday 11 in the morning till 11 night Friday and Saturday 11 a.m

But it's not

[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:14.880]
I'm ready to split for some places really hard

[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:20.680]
Winter

[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.340]

[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:30.540]
Miami hello, oh, great listen the Cubs are a lot today. Yeah, the brave satin that dug out for an hour and a half that rain delay

[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:34.720]
Let's not before they had to get on a plane. Mm-hmm. So they got to be pretty tired today

One thing that's sunny is there a room and a sunny shave decided to say with a lightning bolt

[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.020]
Why didn't you see what happened yesterday with the McCain they shaved all their heads on the side?

[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.860]
Yeah, well Kirk dullum started that and then the rest of them jump on a bandwagon

I mean when you consider the WIOD is gonna bring you all evening and weekend the world series games that the Cains play that goes to show you

[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.280]
The tremendous commitment that our sports department here has to the hurricane baseball program

[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.640]
Well, I'm gonna listen to one of those games

[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:38.020]
Neil did you hear when the interviewed Michael Jordan idea about the MVP given away to magic Johnson? No

[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:42.900]
He said and I quote he didn't want to be an O zoom for a long tour, but he thinks it was rigged

[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.760]
Yeah, how do I okay? I didn't want to be one I

[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:56.300]

[01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:57.500]
I

[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.640]
Kind of wanted to hear that one you know didn't matter

[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.720]
Miami hello

[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.140]
Okay

[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.900]
You're in a whisper I can't hear you at all

[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.640]
If you're in a fan in this overhead, which is like on terminally off

[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:24.280]
I'll crank it up a little louder. I said okay. There we go. I was sick this weekend

[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:30.480]
So I stayed home both days and I was listening to the radio that best of cane is terminal. Oh, no, what are you were sick?

[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.820]

What is that?

[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:44.040]
North was a hero like Oliver Norse and this the Ku Klux Klanman from Louisiana

[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.380]
The guy he said he was a hero also

[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:53.060]
Yeah, I mean the Colonel, but he was an honorary the Colonel what? Oh, yeah, that's a data Colonel

He sounded just like Al Rantel. Oh come on. I'm serious. Manage is a good guy. I'm so out of great broadcast

[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.800]
It's a good guy and just as I was getting over it somebody called and said the cup sucked

[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.100]
It was the most incredible thing while I got news for you can see it all they want but they're in first place by two and a half

[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:27.160]
No, that was a game they lost the Cincinnati that read all again that they blew the seven it no they didn't lose to reho

[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.520]
They want to say lost that they blew the lead seven at two and they blew it and they lost 10 to eight well that's because

[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.220]
Zimmer left killgason too long, but you can't second guess Zimmer. Okay. He's been great all year

[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:40.060]
He's in first place. He's not perfect, but he's certainly a done an incredible job

[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:44.200]
It can't be as bad when you look when you look like that and you can win 27 games, man

[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.920]
You got to be okay my book that's right because it can't be as bad as everybody thinks that's for sure and

[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:54.160]
Just wait till you see Sanders in a day. She could disprove that sir believe me. I got nothing but confidence in him

[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.520]
Oh God Lord. Well, just call to give you a little little story there and Zeta

[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:05.740]
I talked to Kimba who works the the evening ship. Yeah, she has a sense of humor. I'm sorry

[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.000]
I heard she has a sense of humor. I wanted to know that's why they put her on it

[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.100]
They want somebody who has a sense of humor every Friday when she gets her paycheck. Uh-huh and

[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.520]
I I asked her you know, hey, you know, I called her Thursday day before you guys did the rating show I think

[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.640]
The baby for you did the ratio I can't remember what day it was and I go oh you can listen cuz you go no

[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.360]
I never listen I go right. She never listened to this show right well

[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.040]
No, Kimba doesn't have the intellect to listen to the show she wouldn't understand it. Oh

[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.220]
And then I go well, you know, you think if I send a tape to Rosefolder, he'll listen to me

[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.880]
Anybody who thinks that Steve Tyler looks like God

[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.360]
There's a guy with lips like a flatfish, okay? Oh, he has gruesome

[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.280]
The man is like she had me kind of to believe in it was good looking and then those videos you see him like for a

[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.480]
10th of a second, you know

[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.140]
And now that I saw him the other day for like actually sitting down and looking straight ahead for like 10 seconds

[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.340]
I think that's why I'm so nauseous today. He is gruesome. I want to add one to the all ugly team

[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.220]
But if I could he makes Yogi Barra look like Roblo

[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:07.460]
Remember Carmen Fungzone. He makes Yogi Barra look like Craig Bigio

[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.260]
Carmen who?

[01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.280]
Carmen fun zone you can't say that sir. I you're on zone

[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.740]
I couldn't say I think they have that at the salvo is for lunch. No, no, no

[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:23.200]
This guy plays for the Cubs many years ago. Falcon. Falcon. Not fun zone. I'm sorry for giving me. Yeah, I love these cubs

[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.940]
No, I'm not a cousin, but I'm trying you know that's before I was a cubs

[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.640]
I don't know any of those cubs. Okay, you're any banks and all those other marginal players. I don't know any of those people

[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.900]
Well, I know I know you can't wait to leave because I know it's 12 30 you'll be gone

[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:40.400]
So I could be I might be I could be I am out of here

[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.340]
I like to tell my wife to get a life. Okay. Thank you sir for your incredibly ponderous call

[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:51.460]
It's 11.35. He was okay. Leave him alone. Okay. Killed some time. Yeah, that's true. This is murder today

[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.100]
man every minute is like an hour

[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.700]
It's kind of like watching the meds. We have an open line in Palm Beach 6 5 5 W I O day

[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:03.440]
How about those meds? I Dave maggot in at first wow and

[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.680]
And a Mackie sasser behind a plate

[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:12.420]
Well, they got some real heavy duty guys on that team and the doc just can't get another win

[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:14.640]
You know that they didn't lose the game yesterday, but he didn't get any decision

[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.840]
He just can't and they were hitting the crap out of him all through the game man. He's lucky didn't lose it

[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:24.480]
That the boat doctor. I mean when you can't beat Fernando Valenzuela who hasn't won a game since last June

[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.200]
You know you got a problem, okay?

[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.820]
It's called anemia badding anemia

[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.540]
And then poor Davie Johnson they kept slapping his face back together yesterday and it kept dripping apart

[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:39.160]
You know, and they had to keep running around around to pick the pieces up out there and LA was disgusting

[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:45.000]
It's 24 till noon at WID. Don't knock it man. The time is flying by take your vitamins and just

[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:13.280]
Just dig right in there Todd. We thought we're gonna get shined again today, okay?

[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.220]
Just don't mind us. We're all sick and ready to puke all over the place. So take it real quick

[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:22.780]
The air is off. Okay, man. The air is on that day. Oh, you're gonna take oh

[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.680]
Isn't that cute and it doesn't even faze me so you know I must be really sick Miami. Hello

[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.240]
Hi, Neil. Hi. This is a Coleman

[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.260]
Oh, yeah, yes, right

[01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:43.200]
They're one another one of our brain surgeon salespeople in the WID sales department

[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:49.060]
Uh, last Friday morning you said that you told you that you've partied or

[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.540]
Pucka me me. Yeah, well

[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:54.140]
E-Wide sure he's eating around eight o'clock

[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.020]
We saw him at

[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.320]
Hoppies and grow at what?

[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.760]
in the girl that's a gourmet wine and cheese

[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:06.100]
Face and face there. Oh, so he had something better come up is it?

[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:11.700]
Well, I got news for him boy. He did be a big favor because I had a great meal at Trappers Ali and they were very nice and

[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:18.120]
And you know, I eaten solitude and then peace and it was delicious and I didn't have to listen to any of his BS

[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.460]
You betcha was great

[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:22.760]
Okay

[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.060]
Not Coleman. Yeah, Coleman

[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.260]
All right, we have but you don't understand dinner was at five o'clock

[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:36.740]
Well, I didn't realize it's really I'm sorry then, but he was there so maybe maybe

[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.260]
Yeah, maybe his car did die. Well, we can only hope we can only hope so

[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:47.480]
Why did you turn that fan down? Don't you want to get it so loud? I don't care how loud it is

[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.080]
It's a lot more important to be cool and hear these callers. I don't think that personally

[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.120]
Okay, have a good one. You too. Bye. You have a point there. Yeah

[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.360]
Actually this crowd hadn't thought about that

[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.520]
No, you didn't you know, it wasn't still low when he turned it off. Turn it down

[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:07.500]
But I was thinking I got it cranked up much higher than usual. It's still low. Can't hear it

[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.440]
Harden hear us thinking it's a blessing sometime. Yeah

[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.940]
Well, it's Monday, you know, we don't have the engineers aren't here and all the uh

[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:19.120]
They had Maha Shafi's aren't here and all these and very important important people

[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.480]
And so you just kind of do like a slip shot pasted all together and hope for the best, you know kind of like the way Rick

[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:25.620]
Weaver did the sports this morning

[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:31.060]
Uh for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, I don't know great. Got a question for you. Are you track today? Are you gonna show the

[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.300]
Cubs game on the

[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.260]
Heavier Cubs game. Are you out of your mind?

[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.320]
So I don't know about tomorrow. They spent a renovation there to show us all right. It's possible

[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.060]
I don't know

[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:46.480]
Let's see there in North day. It's pretty unlikely. They probably unless they got their own satellite dish

[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.980]
They must have a satellite dish because they got the cymbal casting from Belmont. Yeah, so it's possible

[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:58.320]
What do they need? Therefore it's on channel 11 in Atlanta. So it's probably it's probably gonna be on

[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.080]
But it's on it's on Atlanta today. So next three days are on

[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:08.320]
TBS so it should be on there and if not tell them to turn it on

[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:15.980]
The basketball games on a three so just not even show the Cubs game. I can't hear this. I can't hear anything

[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:19.200]
As monitor is that why is that I got another thing?

[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.300]
You're from the sunrise area, right?

[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:28.460]
I'm from the sunrise area. I can't say you out of your mind. What what I wasn't I wasn't no

[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:35.380]
Oh, where do you live in plantation? Okay. You're from around there. Are you with them? Are you a movie theater? Is that a real? Yeah? Yeah, okay

[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.920]
Does it I want to watch the basketball game their

[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.880]
Tuesday night. That's Tuesday night, right?

[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:45.560]
I had a sports bar and that I'm not gonna give the name of it. It's in the area there. Yeah, that little complex

[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.780]
Go in there. They have a six-foot screen

[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.460]
They advertise themselves in the sports bar. They got the basketball shot pool tables for nine yards, you know? Yeah

[01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:00.180]
Just one thing that we say they're not showing the game. We're showing a Clint Eastwood movie. Oh, that's good. They don't have cable

[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.940]
The sports bar doesn't have cable

[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:03.500]
Mm-hmm

[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:09.140]
No, that's a Clint Eastwood. He's a pretty sports intensive dude, you know. He's a good sport

[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:23.020]
How soon what I can't hear a word your saying is it me? How soon can we start seeing people wear a card?

[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.480]
I'm not afraid good

[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:29.480]
Beats a hell out of me, but I'll go out looking for him this afternoon after the game. Okay. Okay. Good luck to you

[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.380]
It's not the time to fall. It's the huh only sports calls

[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:38.540]
Does it make any difference what they're talking about you can't hear them anyway. Oh just places just so depressing and so debilitating

[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:43.520]
You know what for what a day to feel just not a lot better, but just a little bit better

[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:50.360]
But you can't hear a goddamn thing the air is out the places of toilet and they don't give a damn because none of them have to be here today, you know

[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.700]
Oh, we're out to have a little weeny rose to the backyard. We can't be bothered with that stuff

[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:59.920]
See on the air complaining again. He's a mouth content. That's all just complained you watch out

[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.980]
Maybe if they could you ever get their damn act together. We do you know now you watch out quick the air conditioning's fixed tomorrow

[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:11.160]
Oh, yeah, like like a shot like a shot tomorrow. It'll be fit by me at the over in Carroll city

[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.540]
I remember I never forget it the air was out in the whole building

[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:19.780]
It was like a sauna bath in there. Where do you think they were working first to get it fixed in Gary Lawrence's office?

[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.620]
Of course, they had it you could a hung meat near they had so cold by it within an hour

[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.260]
Okay, we were up in the other way to the building

[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.340]
Schwitzing our brains out okay

[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:28.480]
Schwitzing

[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.140]
Alan oh now come on somebody told us yesterday that Alan hates us

[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:40.700]
No, I don't hate you guys. That's what that's what the rumor was Alan that you hate us like poison

[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:45.960]
God who would say something like that one of your great friends probably somebody that spit on my car, you know

[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:52.720]
I hate them. I hate them hate people. Oh, I thought he did us. How you doing now? You don't know Joe do you? Joe?

[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.940]
With four ends

[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.400]
Four ends yeah, it claims to know you I think he went to Cooper City

[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.180]
He works at the Sheridan 7 movie theater. Oh, I know Joe. I saw Joe the other night. Did you?

[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:08.720]
What's his story anyways? He becoming a scoundrel spy or what is his deal? I don't know. What what was he doing?

[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.880]
I don't know something the something there that just doesn't meet the eye with Joe, you know what?

[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.060]
I just can't figure him out. I don't know. I just I saw him at the movie theater. He's like why'd you pay?

[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.300]
But um, I went to brick oven pizza yesterday

[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.200]
Yeah, now don't get surly Alan sounds pretty good. Is it true that you're selling fish?

[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.280]
I got fired today. Did you? I couldn't believe it. I got that shocking. Does that look what a shot?

[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.620]
I thought Alan and fish kind of related to real heavily together. I thought that made a lot of sense. No, I was working at a pet store

[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:39.180]
And I got to okay. I get up from work this morning like eight o'clock, you know

[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:45.200]
Drive all the way up the market in fact. I work in market and I drove all the way up there got there

[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.900]
And they told me they had to let me go for what?

[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.080]
For what? Okay, I

[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:56.840]
We um bought out like another pet store like all the stuff they were going to have business and um and like I don't know

[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.160]
It's just all this whole DS and BS that yeah tell them to screw off Alan

[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.840]
So now I need to know you don't need no you need a job. Maybe you'd like to be my houseboy Alan at

[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.320]
No, I just I just said that to give for pocket because there are people out there in the audience

[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.440]
You're real nervous when I say that because how old are you Alan? What about 11? No, no

[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:19.160]
I'll be 19 in July Wow and all you got for pocket two if there ever was one

[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.080]
I don't understand Alan. How can anybody who looks so good have so many problems? You know what I mean?

[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.780]
I just don't understand I don't know. Yeah, I've got problems all my life. I know it

[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.480]
I don't I don't know it goes to show you I guess that the life kind of evens its way out, you know

[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.420]
You can look like hell and just to fake your way through life with no problem

[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:39.520]
And you look could look just tremendous like you do and just be behind the eight ball your entire life

[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:44.280]
Trusted out beyond the way, you know, yeah, just uh stressed out. I think is a good way to put it

[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.260]
Yeah, well listen

[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:48.840]
I want to thank you for spitting on my car because that's the only place it's clean now

[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.920]
You know what's it be because out of your car man Spencer really messed up

[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.380]
He schmoots stuff my car last week in fact this week he's supposed to straighten it out

[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.420]
He messed up that Corvette. I was almost in tears

[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:03.920]
I just had my car clean the other day. I did really good job. Did he? Yeah for 28 bucks. Wow

[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:08.680]
Well, we don't pay Spencer that much. Maybe we ought to start paying a little more. He might actually do a job

[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.680]
I don't know, Neal, but I need a job now, so do you? Yeah, well we're here for a public service

[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:18.160]
Maybe we can land something for you somebody who's like a massacres to wants to put up with that

[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:24.620]
So when are you coming to visit Alan? I don't know. Can I come down to the station when I don't know whenever

[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:28.440]
Oh sure anytime you want any time I want no as long as I'm not here

[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:36.120]
I had to show for myself for a day. Alan like Sunday would be a real good. Yeah, Saturday or Sunday

[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.820]
Saturday or Sunday. Yeah, I think I can fit both those days. You can come down sitting on the best of Neal. It's on tape

[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:41.460]
Oh

[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:48.220]
I just I was really wounded when a guy called the other day and said you hated me with a passion

[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:53.260]
I thought what the hell did I ever do to what's his name? I don't get I how could I hate you?

[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:56.540]
I mean I really don't even get to listen to you because I work from 10

[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.840]
to three so how about those gators huh? Yeah gators

[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.820]
You know I'm a hurricane fan anyway. Well, that's good

[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.400]
You know, I'm happy something worked out well in your life Alan

[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:09.360]
Yeah, at least the gators are going somewhere

[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.420]
Well, listen you can come by anytime you like Alan. Just give us plenty of advanced

[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:16.920]
Okay, plenty of it. How many weeks do you need it at least a day's notice? Okay

[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:25.200]
Yeah, bring those good looking guys by here. It's okay to look Alan. That's what they always told me. Yeah, he's another time

[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.900]
No, another douchebag. Okay, Alan had a great life. Yeah, you too. I'd like to you. He better not come here

[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:35.400]
Well, you stop it already stop degrading and humiliating yourself. It's just a joke. He's not coming here

[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.300]
Takes it literally

[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.800]
Because they all take what you say literally and they believe what you say

[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.660]
Do you think on his worst day he could be any worse than Joe's friend that was here that day? Yeah

[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.900]
You do yeah, well, I think you're wrong. I think that quenella that day was pretty uh, yeah

[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.500]
It was and now I'm sure so what you weren't throwing anything

[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.000]
Well, that's because you've got a thing with Alan you got I think it's kind of like a little love hate

[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:02.480]
You know, I mean

[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.780]
No, it's a 10 before noon. I think there's something there that doesn't quite meet the eye. No anyway

[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:17.640]
I'm looking at the world to flies eyes looking at the world to flies eyes looking at the world to flies on

[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.440]
And you can just buzz off

[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:28.340]
Well, I think I'll buzz in the front door as a guy who buzz around the back door screen

[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:30.840]
The guy who buzz around your face

[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:32.960]
Then I'll land on the ceiling

[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:46.980]
It's 1153. I really appreciate you turning that off. You know, no who brought that in

[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.700]
Todd is bringing material now, okay

[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.760]
Now let's have a vote

[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.780]
Rob's moon or flies on

[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:01.040]
Now these people that uh, pernise this that they ever heard the W I O D

[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:07.780]
Mung off they ever heard this show in their entire life you leave him alone now you're gonna start picking on Todd. I've summed up both

[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.160]
Go ahead see what I mean

[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.320]
bears out exactly what I said before. Oh,

[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:19.880]
If they if he was old and ugly you'd probably be a big fan of Todd, okay

[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.040]
You'd probably want him in here all the time like a security blanket. Oh, yeah, right

[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:28.580]
But you're threatened by these young good-looking guys like when wrong comes when you start crawling under the table

[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:33.340]
Mitch says he's on his way by the way now we admit shouldn't have to come in here on a holiday

[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:39.600]
No, no, no, besides by the time he gets here. I'll be gone. Oh, it's you didn't have to do that sure

[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:46.100]
Well, nobody else is here today. Oh, it's still going. Oh, that was just a tail end there. That was good

[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:50.240]
I couldn't do that again a million years. Do you hear that? I potted it up and just the last huh?

[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:54.560]
Well Todd is from plant city doesn't that sound like his kind of humor? Mm-hmm

[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.800]
Absolutely no question kind of like that

[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.240]
Down home corn spun

[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:04.060]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, almost Nashville humor, you know, mm-hmm exactly

[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:08.020]
But he eats a mean sandwich. I'll tell you that okay. Let's go to Miami. Hello

[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:09.600]
My

[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.380]
One

[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.160]
Yeah, this isn't him is it

[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.800]
But I got a friend who talk to you. No, that's not the real P.P

[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.800]
Oh, it's an imitator. Yeah, P.P. Jr

[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.680]
What it didn't work. It's like screw them

[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.800]
It's why yeah the monitor I got to cranked up to seven you know the more important and a Jesse AC that would the app when I don't start ordering him around

[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:39.300]
Like some kind of a petrion goof order. Yeah, I'm suggest boy the way he said that like some kind of who the how do you think you are?

[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:44.960]
Okay, this is America's premier engineer who comes schlepping in here on his day off to get some food a list and

[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.000]
I know you want to fix the air conditioning

[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:52.520]
Yeah, and you're ordering him around like some kind of a lackey like he was spike-wise or some amitches

[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.360]
He known me for about 12 years. That doesn't that's no excuse. How long did you know? Well, what's his name from?

[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.060]
My hot 105 that came in the morning and you shined that morning Jim

[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.980]
What's his name? Yeah, let's go through that name Jim Skyler. Yeah, I can never go through that episode today

[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:09.060]
It's been a while he insulted him. He treated him like crap. He came in the building. He brought us all that material

[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:10.020]
He treated him like garbage

[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.760]
Turn his back on him

[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:18.360]
Well, we need to go through that. Yeah, and you wouldn't have treated him any worse. How do you like that saying a lot if it would our Allen?

[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.880]
Okay, I didn't throw things at Jim

[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.740]
Now you got to admit Allen looks good. Okay, you've got to admit that

[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.320]
From a distance

[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.400]
Yeah, like a lot like like one into a football field or the other

[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:36.020]
Well, that's only a hundred yards. Yeah, that's about right. You want to see me run fast?

[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:43.300]
Now he does he's a great looking guy, but he just got like a thing over his head, you know? Yeah

[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:46.660]
Exactly a black board under a black thing. Yeah

[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.540]
Marguer Hello, I like that Brian will

[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:55.840]
Do you yeah, yeah, it's a great song. Oh good. We'll send you the CD and I get out of here. I can't hear a thing on

[01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:01.140]
They're getting lower and lower. Yeah, they are it's like they're fading out. Sometimes it's a blessing

[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:05.900]
Who did that was it the stones did not fade away? Yeah, was that buddy hauling those stones?

[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:11.680]
Both you're right and if we had a version of that I'd play because I think that's what's happening to the colors

[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.760]
They're like fading away they each color gets a little lower and I got this thing cranked up if I crank it any louder

[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.640]
They'll think Rick's scar is programming the show. We got so much reverb

[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.920]
I 61 like Ricky Tiki

[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.320]
Not quite

[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:34.940]

Okay, and the Saturday's paper an hour and eight minutes ago. This isn't Lloyd is it

[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:47.680]
No, oh you sound like Lloyd's twin something. Oh, I never met Lloyd

[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:54.060]
Oh consider kiss the ground sir kiss the ground. Okay. There's another good one. How about you Alan knows him too

[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.660]
Well, you took a pole. I think Lloyd went to sleep away camp with stem

[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.980]
And the pole was

[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:07.980]
Which local newscaster's and national casters he would want to see his viewers would want to see nude and a playboy

[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:11.400]
Santaful. Oh, okay, and Bishop

[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.240]

And for national they picked Kathleen Sullivan. Oh

[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.460]
Areas Shriver. Yeah, something sir. I'd rather I would rather meet my maker than have to look at Kathleen

[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.180]
Sullivan

[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.200]
Naked or dead and make it

[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.740]
Those that didn't make it with some surprised were Connie Chung and Jane Paulie

[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.220]
How about Jessica Savage how did she make out?

[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:12.220]
Not too well. Well, I know Lee's audience. You know, they're pretty sick about she might have been the top of the list

[01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:16.460]
Also Linda, I'll be she didn't make it at all. Yeah. How about Arlene Frances?

[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:17.760]
No

[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.200]
Best Myerson

[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.080]
Ed Koch

[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:26.000]
No, okay, have a nice day pal. We sure appreciate all that really important

[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.320]
Information boy. They're so carried away with themselves up there

[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.460]
They think the whole world revolves around their little bush league town. I sure do

[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:36.780]
We don't know who people down here think the whole world revolves around this big bush league town

[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:42.840]
Anyway, Gail not so bright as standing by. We'll look at that only an hour and five minutes till uh, I think it's six minutes

[01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.120]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:53.740]
Till airtime on the Super Amos Super Station and April April's got the new news whoever's got it go ahead and do it please

Oh jays

[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:07.140]
Oh

[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.060]
It's 1204 W I O D that's what we needed was to come back a little bit early

[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:15.460]
It's a minute early. Oh

[01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:22.620]
God oh my well no the pot was closed because somebody you know that cart that we played about 20 seconds up

[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:25.400]
Mm-hmm. It was not about like a seven and a half minute cart

[01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:27.340]
And our white to play

[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:31.620]
Well, I think probably it's just as well that didn't fire you know what yeah

[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:33.620]
Anyway

[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:40.160]
Well, this is a mess to me. I was just feeling under mess. I was feeling better for a while there. Yeah

[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:47.620]
No real relax relax. It's real mong it's real hot and uncomfortable. So Steve is by any chance listening

[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.160]
I doubt it but if he's listening

[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:52.300]
Oh, you might want to have second thoughts. Okay

[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.940]
Crawling sick and let him put some tapes on

[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:59.540]
How come if they can do that on Saturday they can't do it during the week, you know

[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.220]
Just slap some tapes on they can do it anytime they want yeah

[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:06.980]
How come if they can get away with it every Saturday and put the audience in a coma

[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.540]
With that embarrassing tape repeat crap how come they can't do it on a holiday so we can have off

[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.720]
Oh, and here is mr. Arnold with all those burgers boy

[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:34.320]
Andy and Todd they go under some stupid shooting or some you know we get shootings all of time here

And this is the last holiday I'm working over take tell your tell your fake boss in here tomorrow never again

[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:26.220]
That's my focus. Okay, he wouldn't understand what that means but take a box. Yeah, take a box. Just go nuts guys because we're a

[01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:26.820]
box

[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.300]
Yeah, but he's trying to say is take a box and get out. That's what he's now. You are

[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:36.260]
I'm not either day to gale in April. That's not what I'm saying and they know it

[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:39.300]
That's exactly what he's saying take it and get the hell yeah go ahead

[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.080]
No, he's not

[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:42.280]
Surly

[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.600]
Notches. I know

[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.160]
Thank you. He said the Allen was unrepeatable anytime. Okay. Well, that's true

[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.500]
Anytime probably at W.I.D. I may be leaving in about 22 minutes

[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:54.900]
And now

[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.240]
Partly because of being sick and partly because of the cubs game

[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.440]
Mostly because of being sick. I don't know. We'll see

[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.840]
Maybe it would be fun to kind of watch part of it in here while it's well the show is on

[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.760]
I don't think I can make it that far though. It's too it's just so

[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.340]
Close in here, right? Very does not feel good in here at all

[01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:18.380]
We didn't have the fan. I mean, I was sick when I came in and now we come in and the air is off and the building is in disarray

[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:22.860]
And this is the way it stays man as long as the corporate headhunchos aren't in the building

[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:26.980]
The place can be if they don't care can be burning to the ground. Don't bother us. We're busy on holiday

[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:30.900]
You know air be days of holiday for these people around here. It's pathetic

[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.940]
What is she running? Did you see Cheryl just running down the hall? What the hell is she doing? What could be that important?

[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:47.400]
Racing down a hall. What could be that important and we look at this we got three open lines on the board too

[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.980]
We were off like a house on a fire if you're part of that expression

[01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:55.460]
And now we got three people dropped off. I can't blame them because if I were out today if I were not here today

[01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:00.060]
I'd find something better than this no kidding wouldn't you then rehashing all the

[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.840]
The games or must be there must be something

[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:05.460]
More important

[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.440]
No, well

[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.960]
What a look

[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.160]
I guess I'm wrong

[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:21.700]
For you attack Alan okay that would have had enough then you started attacking april and gale for no reason at all like take the box and get the hell out of here

[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:23.800]
That's not what I said now you're attacking a cubs

[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:28.020]
No, yes trust me

[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.340]
Said on the facts or this just a note it says Todd says when he comes back

[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:37.380]
There had better be some burgers left for him. He's gone to a murder

[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:40.980]
Well, I got news for you Todd the next murder you go to maybe your own

[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.500]
Okay with another note like that

[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:46.840]
That's as early as your note or whatever you said before to Mitch

[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.820]
I didn't say anything surly to me you said it was it's early or not

[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:55.600]
It was said in a very disrespectful surly tone about I'd start working on the AC first

[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:01.180]
No worry about the levels on a stinking goddamn ceiling well, I think I was right. Yeah. Yeah

[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:07.080]
I know get this I'm serious. They got to get their act together here. They got to get their stuff together

[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.960]
This building is just impossible

[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.760]
I mean we had some warm days at Zeta, but this is like

[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.440]
Sultry is the word I'm looking for it's only 95 degrees in the shade out there. It's like

[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:22.120]
Well, you know how you always win this I'm sick to begin with you always want to do the show outside

[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.900]
Yeah, probably is a lot cooler outside. I don't doubt that

[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.640]
Oh, this is appropriate. It's the bokeh puke or hello a meal. Yeah

[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.480]
Hey, I just want to wish you in the bird a happy memorial day. It's captain breath

[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:40.640]
Yeah, I just hope you get to feel it a little better before

[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.220]
I see one of those sodas that they brought me before you drink all of them rich

[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:45.420]
Yeah

[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.640]
Or is that just nice?

[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:49.580]
What's inside?

[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:54.760]
Because this is getting a little pea warm here if you're part of that expression. What's that sir?

[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:58.800]
I just hope you get to feel it a little better. All right as soon as I get out of this building man

[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.480]
And I think I'll be out sick for about a week. That's the only way you can do it here

[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:02.900]
They won't give you any time off voluntarily

[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:04.860]
So you have to get sick

[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:12.600]
I'm gonna put the diet seven up over the ice there you go. Thank you mr. and mr. Arnold you're just terrific

[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:20.680]
They are see now. I think when nuts today they brought boxes and boxes of these little burgers and they brought chicken soup and sodas and ice and

[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:27.860]
God was that nice? Well, it's new. Yeah, I gotta go outside and I'll turn my ribs over so you guys take it easier, right?

[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:32.880]
Okay, get that finger ready to go down your throat now. No, not today. I got to keep it all down today

[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:35.860]
It's good food. Okay. See you. All right. I'm disappointed

[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:40.020]
12 minutes past I get on it right away. Mitch if I were you okay? Whatever

[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.820]
Just can't believe you you're so

[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:49.920]
Surly and crass and hostile you talking to me. Yeah

[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:57.320]
Well in hospitable my god. What what is the verdict? Is it think if he uses words that we can actually say

[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:02.940]
Well, it's not as dirty as it's not as bad. It's not as bad as everybody

[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:06.140]
I see but you know

[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.040]
I think it's worth listening to I think Neil will have a good time with it. Okay. Now you guys aren't working today

[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:17.320]
Are you while I'm here in the office? There's no there's no traffic is there no very limited service today

[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.320]
Yeah, I'm gonna have an easy time on the way home. I hope

[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:26.360]
Uh, well, you know don't go to any of the parts from the new game. You're gonna get some delays going to the park

[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.260]
Oh, I see no I'll stay away from them

[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:35.380]
But you should have a pretty fair day today. Okay, everybody's at home. Yeah, they have any brains. Yeah

[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.080]
Yeah

[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:42.740]
All right. Yeah, we'll see what what it sounds like. Okay, sure. I'll tell you what I'll tape it for you. I'll make a dub of it and

[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:51.380]
I'll see if I can get it to your studio sometime this week. All right. Okay. See you. Okay. All right

[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:56.480]
There they are traffic patrol who has obviously very very little to do today. Thank god

[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:02.580]
All right, Hollywood hi, Glenn. Hi. I was wondering did you have an accost the end of the end of 500?

[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:10.520]
I did see the why I saw the you know the highlights right on the news right and I must say they had some great crashes this year

[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:15.400]
Didn't they? Uh, well no crashes great, you know, no, but I mean, you know incredible

[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:20.660]
The one where they had the camera right in the middle really where it knocked the camera out that was unbelievable

[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:24.600]
I was being you know, I was being facetious of course, but ever but he walked away

[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:28.420]
It was this unbelievable crash with car parts flying everywhere

[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:32.800]
The car that was left was the engine. Yeah, and he just hopped out like nothing

[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:40.100]
You know, but I know that they have now it's just amazing. It sure is because that look you know that looked like the word

[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:44.520]
That's what what that's why I can say the crashes were great because nobody was heard apparently

[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.700]
Well one of them really

[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:51.120]
Frost my ass a little bit. I'd like to call ever some phyta Paul de a douchebag because

[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:55.580]
He fussed out answer junior there right at the end. Yeah, I saw that

[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.740]
I was able to lose the race, but answer didn't protest or anything

[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:05.140]
Well, I'd like to protest would you would you think he would have if he had felt he had been wronged?

[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:07.760]
Well, I would think so and he didn't

[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:13.980]
Well, I really wanted to see how junior I see okay, but it was it was a really spectacular race

[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:18.540]
The highlights. I saw were really good. I must say it was truly one of the best races ever

[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:25.080]
Yeah, I can understand why so many people go up there really is spectacular. Well, it is really happening

[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.960]
It really is yeah

[01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.980]
Oh, absolutely just like Daytona, you know, uh-huh

[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:37.820]
In fact the Coca-Cola 600 was pretty high yesterday also. Okay, that came down to within just like split second

[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.440]
The two that finished

[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.060]
Uh-huh, you're fading away

[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:47.180]
Well, I'm really kind of disappointed that deal wasn't feeling well and he left

[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.680]
Well, it really is bad

[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:57.120]

[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:33.160]
man

[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:47.860]
Uncle Neil left kids bailed out of here left. I really can't blame him the AC is fouled up. It's a holiday

[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.360]
The cubs are on you know and

[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:58.700]
I gotta get rich when he gets back in there to get the damn cubs off our TV. Oh by the way before we go to the phones and everyone is lit

[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:03.680]
I know that's weird. So we'll go see that what they want but first I got something for you here

[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:19.240]
One of which happens to be Lee were sure what every morning from six until nine a.m

[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.480]
That's his problem actually you know we've been telling you quite a bit about this cat his personal life

[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.560]
So for the song he's got a big problem happens to be that he gets up every morning to be here at six o'clock

[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:31.240]
Yeah, that's not too bad, you know, but he stays around here all day and mess around making little things here

[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.980]
Little this little and it sort of gets to you everyone's well, you know, I mean

[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:36.800]
You can't you know put so much of yourself into your work

[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.200]
You should have a little time for play and rest of relaxation and stuff like that, you know

[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:45.280]
But even when he goes out, you know, what is why if it's tough like that they go out in the mobile unit and listen to police radio

[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:53.440]
These are the angels

[01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:05.700]

[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.620]

Go to bokeh hello, hi Glenn. Hi

[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:35.060]
Uh, I'm calling about yeah in the news segment you're running a thing about uh

[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:42.300]
The tomb guards and the old guard the guys walking the two yeah, I used to be one of them. Uh-huh

[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:48.140]
Like you know what a prerequisite? We're prerequisite for uh getting there

[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:53.980]
They didn't care, you know, what you did and be up and on or anything is just as long as you never had sex with another man

[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:55.340]
Is that right?

[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:03.580]
This was what they were really interested in. Yeah, one of their main worries was uh that you had never had sex with another man

[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.440]
Oh my god, well you see they know what's important

[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:13.580]
It was sick me. I mean you they get in this big room and uh, you know trying to intimidate you and scare you at that

[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:18.200]
Hmm and that's the only thing they talk about what what city did you do it in?

[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.900]
Who is in Arlington up in Arlington. Yeah, what's that movie um

[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.840]
Garden's a stone garden's a stone. That's quite a movie. I saw it. Yeah, what'd you think?

[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:32.640]
It's parts of it are pretty representative. Uh-huh. It doesn't fairly decent job, but you know

[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.900]
It doesn't tell a whole story. I understand, but it's a pretty good movie. Yeah. Yeah, I would recommend it actually

[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.260]
Garden's even taking a buy in a copy. I rented it

[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:44.820]
Having been there. I thought about buying a copy, but I don't know. Yeah

[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:49.740]
Well that that showed some of the screwed up inside, you know priorities

[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:53.920]
That's what I mean. Yeah, it's better, you know how screwed up you were whether you were you know

[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:58.000]
Wacked out on drugs or anything just as long as you know you were uh

[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:04.880]
On the surface you you could look good and uh, yeah, they were real homophobes. Is that right? Yep

[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:10.180]
Well, I'll be damned. Well, I like you telling that story today. Well, I don't know why, but I

[01:44:10.180 --> 01:44:14.960]
I you know memorial day they used to make us go out and do all kinds of strange things for the people and uh

[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:19.100]
And uh, I just thought I'd call you and offer that

[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:24.980]
Glad you did have a good day. Uh, okay. See you. Yeah, that was bokeh. Yeah

So I got a relax and dig you guys.

[01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:02.640]
Yeah.

[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:08.120]
And I got a surefire way for Neil to avoid having to work on holidays.

[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:08.740]
Uh-huh.

[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.940]
I called you the last time Neil was sick.

[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.480]
Remember he was sick for about four days in a row.

[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.360]
At least a couple, yeah.

[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:18.840]
Well, now he was like really sick for a bit.

[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.600]
He was out for like three or four days and came back and he wasn't feeling well.

[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:22.080]
Right.

[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:26.700]
I called you and I relayed a story to you about when I was working on the beach in

[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:28.620]
Lauderdale and I said something about Canadians.

[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:29.460]
Right.

[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:30.100]
Canadians.

[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:31.020]
I got let go.

[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:31.720]
Yeah.

[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:35.220]
And then I had sent you a bit of information about me.

[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:37.380]
I was this track, you know, everything you said, ascending for me.

[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.860]
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:41.920]
And you would keep it in mind for when Neil goes on vacation.

[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:46.260]
I don't believe in radio people working on holidays myself.

[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:47.880]
But me, I do it for the fun of it.

[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:48.160]
Right.

[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:51.400]
So when Neil needs somebody, no, I ain't trying to bump him or you are.

[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.280]
But, uh, I mean, hey, the guy doesn't feel good.

[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.220]
And then, you know, you people are the only people down here in the market that are really

[01:48:58.220 --> 01:48:58.740]
worth a while.

[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:02.780]
You and I would get along great because I love baseball, but I'm not a Cubist band.

[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.280]
Wow.

[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.300]
I'm one of the few.

[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.240]
I mean, I watch the Cubs.

[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:07.000]
I'll watch any team.

[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:07.920]
I root for Texas.

[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:09.920]
Now, do you have a job yet?

[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:10.620]
Oh, yeah.

[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:11.620]
Not in Ray.

[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:12.360]
I've been DJing.

[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:12.660]
I don't know.

[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:13.640]
Various parties.

[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.320]
I work a few nightclubs, but I work a regular day job.

[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:16.940]
I see.

[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:19.560]
But the thing is how many Texas bands are down here?

[01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:21.120]
Probably very, very few.

[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:22.860]
I never ever hear anything about it.

[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:24.360]
Well, there's a guy to play for Texas.

[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:25.520]
That's from the Miami area.

[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.200]
Palmeiro used to be with the Cubs.

[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.860]
So there probably are a few Texas bands down here, but not enough to make you upset.

[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.640]
Now, I thought when Neil left, we were going to stop talking about baseball.

[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.280]
Well, no, I'm just, you know, letting you know that such a person exists that would

[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:43.400]
come in and have a great time.

[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:44.960]
I don't use the word douchebag.

[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.420]
I've got another word that I use that I don't think I'd better say right now, but it would

[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.360]
go over pretty well.

[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.260]
It would be a new word for the vocabulary of the English-speaking people down here.

[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.820]
I have one question for you.

[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:55.700]
You can play something.

[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:56.160]

[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:02.460]
You had from, I guess it was GTR about two weeks ago, a collection of new novelty things.

[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:07.180]
And there was something about a grateful dead, something about Jerry Garcia or something like that.

[01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:07.480]
Yeah.

[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:14.340]
Now, that's on the comedy rock network, which are on CD, and he didn't leave those for me.

[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:14.900]
Oh, well.

[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:16.900]
And we don't have any Q-sheets anyway.

[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.240]
I couldn't find it in any way.

[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:19.380]
Oh, that's all right.

[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:20.700]
I'll have to pass it on to Neil.

[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.040]
You still got the thing that I set you, correct?

[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:23.360]
Yeah.

[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:29.740]
Well, look, if the situation occurs that you need a guest for an afternoon or whatever, let

[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.100]
me know because I'm well trained.

[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:34.640]
I go potty on the paper, you know.

[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:36.800]
So I mean, Neil's not to worry about me messing the studio.

[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:40.580]
And I can't wait, I can hardly wait for Steve Kane's show.

[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:43.480]
I mean, that's going to be more exciting as having my teeth pulled.

[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:44.740]
Okay.

[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:45.500]
I'm not sure.

[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:47.220]
I want to be honest with you.

[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:51.160]
I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do when he goes on vacation, which is the first

[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.660]
two weeks in July, by the way.

[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.380]
That's no problem.

[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:54.400]
Like four weeks away.

[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.280]
That is no problem.

[01:50:55.280 --> 01:50:55.960]
So I'll let you know.

[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:56.940]
Yeah, I lived out.

[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.140]
I'm going back to Connecticut for a weekend for a wedding, but aside from that, a new problem

[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:03.540]
as my nine year old cousin would say.

[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:04.480]
I'll let you know.

[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.800]
Hey, well, thank you very much.

[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:07.580]
You've been here to show you're doing a great job.

[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:08.100]
See you.

[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:08.420]
Take care.

[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:08.660]
Bye-bye.

[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:11.000]
Somebody trying to warm their way into the show.

[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.980]
Yeah, we have enough problems with that.

[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:13.580]
Trust me.

[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:14.400]
Miami.

[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:16.640]
Yeah, listen, Bert, I'm going to send you my resume.

[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.020]
I'm going to send you my spancers feeling under the weather.

[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.420]
I'll be more than glad to come a villain.

[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.960]
This is the second time he's tried that with me, simply as resume.

[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:27.340]
I, I, I remember.

[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:28.640]
I remember.

[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:28.780]
I remember.

[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:29.740]
I'm going to be honest with you.

[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:32.260]
I think now, Neil's going to go out a way for two weeks.

[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:33.700]
OK, first two weeks in July.

[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:37.460]
This is for all the Nielies to, you know, like get your mindset, because Uncle Neil's going

[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:39.580]
to be gone for two weeks, OK?

[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:44.840]
And I think, I think I'm just going to sit in here with the callers and do the show.

[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:45.440]
You know what I mean?

[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.000]
You've done it before and it sounds great.

[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:51.500]
Yeah, we, you know, Johnny Dark may come by one day and we may do some little things like

[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:51.660]
that.

[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:53.260]
I don't think we're going to do anything real major.

[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:59.240]
That's what's in my mind that we're just going to, oh my god, spike wise is in the building

[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:00.100]
ladies and gentlemen.

[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:01.600]
Holy man.

[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:01.840]
Holy moly.

[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:02.920]
Is he coming in here?

[01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:03.620]
He's got his kid.

[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:06.260]
Spike, wait, sir, just hold on, OK?

[01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:07.640]
I got Neil's long court.

[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:11.120]
I'm going to walk around out to the door and see if I can get Spike wise to come in here

[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:11.640]
with this kid.

[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:12.600]
I'm over at the door.

[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:13.460]
Spike.

[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:15.720]
Hey, Spike.

[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:17.800]
He's checking.

[01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:18.520]
He won't come in here.

[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:21.380]
Yeah, if you can find him rich, I haven't come in here for a minute.

[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.240]
He wants to talk about GTR, but we want to say hi to Spike.

[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:27.260]
Spike's here on a holiday, sir.

[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:28.460]
That is amazing.

[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:32.120]
It's, it's, that's why, you know, I made such a big semis about it.

[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:37.260]
We have a bureaucrat, the operations director of the radio station, he's here on a holiday.

[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:38.540]
That is to be commanded.

[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:39.660]
No kidding.

[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.900]
So I wanted to bring him in and commend him, you know what I mean?

[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.340]
Yeah.

[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:45.580]
So I sent that rich out, we'll see if we can get him in here for a second.

[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:47.920]
Oh, anyway, what were we talking about?

[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:48.460]
I forgot.

[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:53.640]
OK, by the way, what is the status with the, with that movie that Neil wouldn't see and

[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:55.300]
the Captain Dave kept pushing on him?

[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.160]
He never saw that was Blade Runner?

[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:58.460]
Blade Runner, have you ever seen that?

[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.440]
Yeah, I've seen that.

[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.440]
I saw when it was in theaters, you know, years ago.

[01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:03.620]
I was thinking about 85.

[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:04.020]
I also think about 85.

[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.660]
I watched it again about a month or two ago.

[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.740]
It's very shaky.

[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:09.720]
Have you ever seen it?

[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.780]
It doesn't transfer well to the TV screen because the whites didn't see it on the laser

[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:16.840]
disk where they let their box didn't put that around sound.

[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:19.820]
No, that hurts, but you're right about that.

[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:22.400]
But I did see it in the theater back when it was new.

[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:25.820]
I remember liking it better back then, I don't know.

[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.640]
Yeah, it's a very visual movie.

[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:31.160]
If you don't really get the full impact of the theater with the sound effect on the

[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:32.980]
white screen, yeah, you're right.

[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:34.860]
Rachel Ward was also very good looking at that film.

[01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:35.260]
Yes.

[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:37.980]
They gave her that 40's look that was really incredible.

[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:39.420]
Wasn't Sean Young in that?

[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.340]
Sean Young, not right now.

[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:41.920]
Yeah, not Rachel, or Sean Young.

[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:42.940]
She did look great.

[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.820]
I think that's her first movie or something.

[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:45.060]
Yeah.

[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:46.420]
Well, she was stunning in that movie.

[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.940]
I never recognized her to kind of do so her next movie.

[01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:49.540]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:53.120]
That's one of the main reasons I looked at it was to look at Sean Young.

[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:53.600]
Yeah.

[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.600]
And she looks good, but she's nuts.

[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:56.340]
Let me tell you.

[01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:56.560]

[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.420]
He can't find Spike wise.

[01:53:58.580 --> 01:53:59.780]
He disappeared, man.

[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:00.720]
He disappeared on you.

[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.340]
Ha, ha, ha.

[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:02.780]
Man.

[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:04.300]
When to speak to him for a minute.

[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:05.320]
OK, OK, Spike.

[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.460]
97 GTR, OK?

[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:08.120]
All right.

[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:09.800]
We have to do that for Spike her.

[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:13.540]
By the way, Bird, happy to be late at 29.

[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:15.860]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:16.320]
Thanks.

[01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.180]
OK, well, listen, I'll talk to you next time.

[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:19.780]
OK, bud.

[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:20.280]
Take care.

[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:20.580]
Bye.

[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:21.800]
All right, there he goes.

[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:24.900]
Now, since possibly we have a call from Homestead,

[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.300]
I'm going, every line is full.

[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.660]
How did Bird is half-f

[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:29.260]
supposed to, but you know what my friend is calling me?

[01:54:29.580 --> 01:54:31.040]
Hey, how you doing, huh?

[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.180]
I'm doing great.

[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.500]
I just want to talk about that last call.

[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:35.400]
He's got about much chance of getting on that station

[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:36.860]
as I kneel there as a man and a woman.

[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:37.340]
Yeah.

[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:39.540]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:42.620]
Well, you have a way of making a phrase there.

[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.140]
I've got a good feeling of it.

[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:44.840]
It's going to happen.

[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:45.380]
Yeah.

[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.700]
But what I'm doing right now, I'm doing some almost legal.

[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:49.700]
I'm sitting on concert tickets.

[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:51.580]
You're what?

[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:53.440]
I got concert tickets for the hero.

[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:54.800]
I got a first for a center person.

[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.740]
I thought you said you had Gonzerticket.

[01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:58.960]
Well, no, Gonzert, I know you got that right.

[01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:00.220]
He won't let me talk to him anymore.

[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.660]
No, you're gone as soon as he hears who it is.

[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.320]
You're gone.

[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:04.500]
I was hoping he's going to be there

[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:05.880]
because I was going to try to ride him around today,

[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:06.660]
but what he's going to do.

[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:09.060]
Well, we are going to do it, and you will get through.

[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:09.960]
Thanks, Bird.

[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:10.420]
Take care.

[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:11.620]
OK, ha, there he is.

[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.820]
A very, very brief appearance.

[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.120]
But compared to Uncle Neil, that was incredibly long

[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.000]
and ponderous.

[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:21.200]
I yell ponderous as the word, right, Uncle Neil?

[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.920]
I can't believe he's listening to this while driving down

[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:24.560]
9.95.

[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:26.320]
You can't find Bill Wise on.

[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:28.400]
Now, he disappeared out of here like a bad out of hell.

[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:31.620]
Now, first of all, we want to commend him,

[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:35.080]
the only bureaucrat at WIOD in the building.

[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:35.680]
For that.

[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:37.460]
That's a can't.

[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:37.820]

[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:40.800]
Now, he should be up here for a coffee.

[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.800]
Are you a dark city?

[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:44.980]
He's a white, he's a black.

[01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:46.280]
Oh, my God.

[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:48.820]
He from the top of the Empire stay a while ago,

[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:50.480]
but it was busy all day.

[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:50.940]
Weird.

[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:52.640]
Yeah, every line show.

[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.640]
I don't understand every line's full.

[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.760]
Yeah, I just saw Robin Williams in the park.

[01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:57.660]
Good.

[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:58.480]
And with his kids.

[01:55:58.800 --> 01:55:59.840]
How's the weather up there?

[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.260]
Today, it's gorgeous.

[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:01.660]
Yeah.

[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.940]
It's like 66 clear like 66 WABC.

[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:06.360]

[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:09.360]
Yeah, I couldn't find what's his name on the show.

[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:09.660]
How are you?

[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:10.260]
No.

[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:11.540]
He's on K Rock.

[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:13.720]
Yeah, but nobody seems to know what's the name.

[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:14.580]
It's low on the dial.

[01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:15.000]
Yeah.

[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:16.620]
I'd say that it's a 92.

[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.400]
It's unlike 92.

[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.120]
Yeah, I was fiddling around.

[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:21.100]
Yeah, you can find him.

[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.020]
Look, way down low on the FM dial.

[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:23.580]
Uh-huh.

[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:27.200]
Well, we're heading out to back to Miami in about three hours.

[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.520]
Oh, well, then forget it.

[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:29.620]
Oh, well.

[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:32.120]
I couldn't resist getting through to my man.

[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:32.700]
Yeah.

[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.440]
Well, he, uh, he talked to me.

[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:35.300]
Yeah, you remember me anywhere.

[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:36.640]
I'm your old buddy, Jimmy Jr.

[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.200]
Jimmy Jr.

[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:39.640]
That's right, Glenn.

[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.860]
He said me here in 1981.

[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:43.220]
Of course.

[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.020]
Was that one who was 81?

[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:45.840]
It was 81.

[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:46.940]
Jimmy Cagney.

[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:47.700]
That's right.

[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:48.960]
Boy, those were the days.

[01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:49.980]
Yeah, you're not kidding.

[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.200]
I sure remember you.

[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.320]
What are you doing these days?

[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.340]
Well, I'm still trying to get that big break, you know,

[01:56:55.540 --> 01:56:56.560]
acting wherever I can.

[01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:57.240]
I see.

[01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:57.940]
You know?

[01:56:57.940 --> 01:56:59.460]
Getting a little work here and there.

[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.580]
You know, they're doing something else at that theater now.

[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:02.500]
They have it open again.

[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:03.140]
Yeah.

[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:03.940]
Yeah, I know.

[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:05.860]
Four old movies and, uh, all right.

[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.520]
Yeah, they're supposed to be having a big film festival.

[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:08.320]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.600]
So we wish them all the best.

[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:10.360]
Yeah, for sure.

[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:11.520]
Well, great.

[01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:12.560]
I'm glad you gave us a call.

[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:14.280]
Well, by the way, I got to tell you.

[01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:18.580]
I saw the most gorgeous Oriental woman with the nicest set

[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.300]
of bright, unbeliever.

[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.660]
This was right up your alley.

[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:24.820]
You thought about me.

[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:25.640]
Absolutely.

[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:27.780]
Right before we got into the cat.

[01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.920]
Oh, we had the most stirring cab ride last night.

[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:33.760]
The guy's going 100 miles down to the avenue.

[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:34.360]
Yeah.

[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:37.460]
I mean, we're talking major, major bouncing.

[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:38.080]
Mm-hmm.

[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:41.460]
I've had some cab rides in New York City, Jimmy.

[01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:44.260]
I'm serious that I will remember till the day I die.

[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.260]
I'm serious.

[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:46.480]
I'll never forget him.

[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:48.220]
I mean, almost as good as a roller coaster.

[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:49.540]
Yeah, very similar.

[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:50.320]
Very good.

[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:53.340]
This guy's name had like seven concerts.

[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:54.200]
Yeah.

[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:55.860]
They all do.

[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:57.320]
Is that funny?

[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.220]
Total trip.

[01:57:58.260 --> 01:57:58.860]
I'll tell you something.

[01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:01.760]
As much as everybody's so in love with New York,

[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.440]
I'd rather be a Miami any day.

[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:05.220]
Yeah, I'm going to take the eating humidity.

[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:05.960]
Exactly.

[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.200]
And we got it here today.

[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:08.200]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:10.700]
Well, we'll be sweating our cars off tomorrow.

[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.020]
Well, sorry, Miss Neal.

[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:12.980]
Yeah, me too.

[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:15.420]
But hey, look, I got to talk to my main guy.

[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:16.020]
All right.

[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:17.340]
See you later, bud.

[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:18.260]
All right, talk to you later.

[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.840]
OK, call from New York.

[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:21.500]
Unbeliever.

[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.100]
Well, it's almost 130.

[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.780]
So we're going to take a break here in the lightning round.

[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:30.460]
We'll be on today, differing from what was previously

[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:31.700]
an out previous host.

[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:33.680]
No, I'm going to do it.

[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.020]
We'll do it in about 15 minutes.

[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.260]
OK, we'll be right back.

[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:39.120]
And W-I-O-D.

[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:40.080]
131.

[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:40.960]
And we go to point.

[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:43.780]
OK, now, first off, I want to, for all those

[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:45.500]
with your score cards at home, OK?

[01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:50.560]
Line 5 and line 8 are on hold for the lightning round.

[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:51.380]
OK, you got that?

[01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:52.540]
Line 5?

[01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:54.740]
It's like Bingo, you know?

[01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:59.120]
And line 8 are on hold for the lightning round.

[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:00.720]
OK, point and beach.

[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:01.680]
Hello?

[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:02.560]
Hello, bird.

[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:04.120]
You're a douchebag.

[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:06.320]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:12.220]
Also, a very, very long appearance with Niels not here.

[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:12.680]
Miami.

[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:13.920]
Hey, Glenn, how's it going?

[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:14.560]
OK.

[01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.680]
Hey, listen, I'm sure Niels not listening anymore.

[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:20.160]
Do you have a copy of the golf game for when he goes away

[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:20.480]
on vacation?

[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.240]
OK, now, this is a big secret, sir.

[01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:25.260]
Well, he's not me, so I'm by now.

[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:27.180]
OK, yeah, you're right.

[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:28.200]
Nobody's listening anyway.

[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:29.480]
Yeah.

[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:31.180]
He doesn't know that.

[01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:32.780]
He knows deep down that I do.

[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:33.820]
I have got it.

[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:35.320]
I don't have it in my hands yet.

[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.340]
But I-

[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:37.720]
It's hidden.

[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.120]
I'm not going to tell you what city it is in.

[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:42.100]
It's in a city in South Florida.

[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:45.160]
And I'm going to get it before he goes on vacation.

[01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:47.120]
I mean, you know, for when he goes on vacation,

[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.780]
which would be like in about four weeks.

[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:49.440]
Great.

[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:52.660]
And I will play it the first day.

[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:53.700]
Great.

[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.820]
Hey, listen, you know any good Thai restaurants in North

[01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:56.180]
Dade?

[01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:01.780]
The best one is Thai House 2 on 163rd Street.

[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:02.560]
Have you ever been there?

[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:02.940]
No.

[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:08.220]
It's almost a federal highway on 163rd Street

[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:09.000]
on the right-hand side.

[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:12.820]
If you're going east, it's called Thai House 2.

[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:15.380]
That is absolutely without question

[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:17.220]
the best Thai food in North Dade.

[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:17.960]
OK, I'll take it out.

[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:18.940]
My opinion, OK?

[02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:19.360]
OK.

[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:20.020]
See you.

[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:22.020]
OK, and now we go to Hollywood.

[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:22.620]
Hello.

[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:23.600]
How you doing?

[02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:23.880]
Good.

[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:26.180]
I'm sorry to bring up the subject baseball again,

[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.400]
but I think there's an expression.

[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:28.980]
Pat Mitchell probably agreed with me.

[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:29.780]
He had Niels forgotten.

[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:32.680]
And that's that if it's early in the season,

[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:33.660]
if the cups are on top.

[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:37.860]
I think even I've heard that expression.

[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:40.220]
Yeah, it's given enough time to cut the matter

[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:41.600]
to hang themselves early, too.

[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:44.060]
And I think the match will pull it back out

[02:00:44.060 --> 02:00:44.820]
on a big match fan.

[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:45.460]
OK.

[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:46.580]
Oh, that bill wise.

[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.220]
Bill Wise.

[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:47.680]
Come here.

[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:48.120]
Come here.

[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:48.480]
Come here.

[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.160]
OK, sir.

[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:50.580]
We got a bullet.

[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:51.360]
And here he comes.

[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:51.760]
Here he comes.

[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:52.560]
He's got his kid.

[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.540]
Here he comes, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:57.860]
Bill Wise is coming down the hallway.

[02:00:58.080 --> 02:00:59.500]
Bill, come on in here.

[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:00.860]
Come on in here, pal.

[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.980]
Now, first off, we want to commend you, Mr. Wise.

[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:06.660]
Hey.

[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:07.760]
Hi.

[02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:09.660]
And Bill's one of Bill's sons.

[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:12.800]
You are the only bureaucrat at WIOD that's in the building.

[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:14.340]
Yes, please sit at that microphone.

[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:18.080]
You're the only bureaucrat.

[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:21.100]
In the building on a holiday, what the hell are you doing here?

[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:21.400]

[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.180]
How hot it was.

[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:24.360]
Isn't it?

[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:25.900]
It's the building.

[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:27.240]
It's like this room.

[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:27.520]

[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.680]
The rest of the building's like an ice cube.

[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:36.960]
And this room is like a sauna, right?

[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:38.380]
Near left, Bill.

[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.920]
About 10-1, he packed it in.

[02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:43.340]
Now, who is this child here?

[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:46.700]
Is he going to talk to his Benjamin?

[02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:47.900]
I don't think so.

[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:48.680]
How old is he?

[02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:49.820]
How old is he?

[02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:50.480]
He's shy.

[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:51.540]
He's shy.

[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:53.920]
He's like boom boom.

[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:54.600]
It's like his dad.

[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:55.480]
He's shy.

[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.580]
Now, Bill, I know some stories about you.

[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:03.260]
Uh-huh.

[02:02:05.260 --> 02:02:07.080]
They had no body knows.

[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:09.440]
Would you like me to tell a couple?

[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:11.280]
It's a holiday.

[02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:11.860]
Come on.

[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:12.700]
It's a holiday.

[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:16.220]
I'm looking for a car because I want Benjamin.

[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:17.740]
Now, what did I-

[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:18.600]
It's Mitch fixing this.

[02:02:18.660 --> 02:02:20.580]
Yeah, they AC people are on the way.

[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:21.060]
Now, Benjamin.

[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:22.180]
I heard you're complaining about him.

[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:24.200]
Yeah, they give a bad water pumpers.

[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:26.140]
It should be done by sports talk.

[02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:27.600]
Now, this is what we want you to do.

[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:30.340]
Now, listen, Benjamin, Benjamin, are you listening to me?

[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:31.160]
Now, listen to this.

[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:33.280]
It's the water to two hours.

[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:35.480]
See, that's the kind of stuff we want you to do.

[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:38.780]
The water he does are.

[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:43.320]
What in God's name are you doing in this part of town?

[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.820]
Thought I'd come in and see what Richard ordered for lunch.

[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.120]
Would you like a burger?

[02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:49.720]
Like a sandwich?

[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.200]
A sub from Captain Jimmy's.

[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:52.760]
And we have burgers from Arnold's here.

[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:53.620]
Oh, is that-

[02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:55.520]
Yeah, do you like a little hamburger?

[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:56.820]
Little cheeseburger?

[02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:57.300]
No.

[02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.520]
Are you going to talk to us?

[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:00.440]
No.

[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:01.120]
OK.

[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.180]
We wanted to be on the lightning round.

[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:04.640]
I was coming up in about 10 minutes.

[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:05.180]

[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:07.860]
You know, you know, did I say 97 GTR on that?

[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:11.420]
We get the best calls starting Friday Bill on the hotline

[02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:13.100]
for the lightning round for some reason.

[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:19.100]
Yeah, the best calls seem to come in on the hotline.

[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:20.880]
OK, that's-

[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.340]
What's the good thing here at Business, OK?

[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:23.060]
Business.

[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:23.840]
Yeah, what?

[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.480]
It's a busy day around here.

[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.820]
Jason Louise, listen to these guys.

[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:31.680]
I'll forget to listen to Hermitim McBean of Warmark, 97 GTR.

[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:34.000]
OK, now Neil might still be listening, so get out of here.

[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:36.640]
The Cubs.

[02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:42.840]
All right, there he goes, kids.

[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:44.360]
Spikewise, there he goes.

[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:45.940]
He's a departing the studio.

[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:49.520]
OK, at 136 for those of you keeping up.

[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.720]
Now, line five and line eight are on hold for the lightning round.

[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.220]
We just want to keep that clear.

[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:56.220]
Dear feel.

[02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:59.380]
I've got that two sports reports, one for you and one for Neil.

[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:00.060]
OK.

[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:03.040]
First of all, Steffi, but one, six, one, six, one.

[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:03.360]
Really?

[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:04.780]
Gabby, one, six, love.

[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:05.560]
Oh, love.

[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:07.140]
Oh, my God.

[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:08.860]
Now, which ones do you like?

[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:11.120]
Which ones do you like for the open, Burrett?

[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:12.480]
Oh, Gabby all the way.

[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:13.040]
You like Gabby?

[02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:15.100]
Oh, I have a terrible crush on her.

[02:04:15.220 --> 02:04:15.740]
Yeah, me too.

[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:16.200]
Do you?

[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:16.480]
Yeah.

[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:18.380]
Oh, I mean, I have pictures of her.

[02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:20.240]
A listener sent me pictures of her.

[02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:23.220]
He snapped out at Lippton, I guess, years ago.

[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:25.620]
Unbelievable young lady.

[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:28.220]
Anyway, yesterday you probably didn't watch the Lakers game.

[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:28.740]
Me?

[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:29.980]
But the highlight of the game.

[02:04:30.020 --> 02:04:31.900]
Now, why would you think I didn't want to say that?

[02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.220]
I have a feeling you might have been out doing things,

[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:34.780]
but the highlight of the game for me

[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:36.920]
was when they made a special announcement

[02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:40.280]
that Brent Bingbanger was 50 years old

[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:43.060]
and the entire crowd booed him when they brought the cake out.

[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:45.700]
Even I like that.

[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:46.940]
But that was quite humiliating.

[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:48.380]
Yeah, even I like that.

[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:48.760]
OK.

[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:49.940]
All right, sir.

[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:50.760]
You want a good job, Burrett?

[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:51.580]
Thank you, sir.

[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:52.000]
Hey, care.

[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:52.600]
All right.

[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:53.800]
Unbelievable.

[02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:57.220]
OK, now, let's go.

[02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:59.320]
This is a pretty lively, isn't it, Rich?

[02:04:59.600 --> 02:04:59.980]
Miami.

[02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:01.260]
Hello, Burrett.

[02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:01.640]
Yeah.

[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:03.720]
Burrett, I've got a film report for you.

[02:05:03.780 --> 02:05:04.360]
Film report?

[02:05:04.620 --> 02:05:04.780]
Yeah.

[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:06.420]
You've got to go check out.

[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:07.280]
He doesn't know evil.

[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:08.160]
He doesn't know evil.

[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:09.080]
He doesn't know evil.

[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:12.520]
Now, that's the Richard Prior and Gene Wilder film.

[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:13.360]
It's funny, yeah.

[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:16.400]
A lady in there with the most gorgeous pair of legs.

[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:18.040]
You know that's Joan Severinson.

[02:05:18.540 --> 02:05:19.060]
Is that?

[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:19.920]
Joan Severinson.

[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:20.680]
Exactly.

[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:22.060]
Yeah, she's beautiful.

[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:24.380]
I mean, the whole theater was going for boo.

[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:25.100]
Uh-oh.

[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:26.840]
And she's a Brunette, didn't she?

[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:27.220]
Yeah.

[02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:28.000]
No, boy.

[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:28.600]
My type.

[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:29.600]
No, god.

[02:05:29.840 --> 02:05:30.840]
You have to go check it out.

[02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:32.140]
I like this series of calls.

[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:33.380]
It's like balance here.

[02:05:33.580 --> 02:05:34.280]
You know, you know, this way.

[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.800]
First, we drew over Gabby.

[02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:36.800]
Now we're doing.

[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:37.920]
This is good.

[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:39.540]
This is good balance for this show.

[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:40.520]
I like it too.

[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:41.180]
All right.

[02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:41.620]
All right.

[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:42.400]
I'll talk to you later.

[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:42.740]
OK.

[02:05:42.860 --> 02:05:43.020]
Bye.

[02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:43.400]
Bye.

[02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:43.940]
All right.

[02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:45.300]
Now we have another call from Miami.

[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:45.720]
Hello.

[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:46.220]
Hello.

[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:47.240]
Hi.

[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:49.640]
Every line is full.

[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:49.980]
Hello.

[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:50.700]
Len?

[02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:51.120]
Yeah.

[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:51.600]
Hi.

[02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:52.000]
How are you doing?

[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:52.480]
Good.

[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:54.860]
Getting ready for the lightning round, sir.

[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:55.360]
Yeah.

[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.040]
Before you get the lightning round going, can I give it a?

[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:03.900]
Can I ask you a favor to get you to play I-95 song?

[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:04.820]
Wow.

[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:08.380]
You know, I'll play it for you if I can find it.

[02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:08.620]
OK.

[02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:12.860]
And I'll tell you why is because it hasn't been on in weeks

[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:13.800]
and weeks and weeks.

[02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:14.220]
Sorry.

[02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:16.200]
Now would you like to talk it up?

[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:19.420]
Well, not really, because what I wanted to do is recorded.

[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:21.720]
Well, son, hi.

[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:22.820]
Good luck to you.

[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:23.700]
All right.

[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:25.480]
He wouldn't talk it up.

[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:26.640]
All right.

[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:27.660]
So we're playing this way.

[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:31.300]
I'll come think to holiday and get a kill some time.

[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:34.180]
And plus it hasn't been on in a long time.

[02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:38.940]
Well, I was driving down I-95 the other night.

[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.180]
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.

[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:46.140]
I decided wasn't going to do any good to get mad.

[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.640]
So I wrote a song about him instead.

[02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:51.840]
It goes like this.

[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:59.060]
For you born an asshole, or did you work it your whole life?

[02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:03.060]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:06.680]
Because you're an asshole tonight.

[02:07:09.860 --> 02:07:12.940]
Yes, you're an A. That's that's H-O-L-E.

[02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:16.800]
And don't you try to blame it on me.

[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:20.620]
You these are all the credit.

[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:24.440]
You're an asshole tonight.

[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.720]
We're an asshole yesterday.

[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:34.260]
You're an asshole tonight.

[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.360]
I've got a feeling.

[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:42.480]
You'll be an asshole the rest of your life.

[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:25.320]
I was talking to your mother just the other night.

[02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:29.810]
I told her I thought you were an asshole.

[02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:33.410]
She said yes, I think you're right.

[02:08:36.330 --> 02:08:39.650]
And all your friends are asshole.

[02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:43.270]
Because you know that you're a whole life.

[02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:51.370]
If somebody told me you've got an asshole for life.

[02:08:53.710 --> 02:09:01.110]
For you born an asshole, or did you work it your whole life?

[02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:05.190]
Either way, it worked out fine.

[02:09:06.130 --> 02:09:07.590]
Because you're an A.

[02:09:10.650 --> 02:09:12.710]
I don't do my job as well.

[02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:14.310]
Disgusting program.

[02:09:15.130 --> 02:09:15.450]
One-night.

[02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:23.410]
Well, you know, Niels out here.

[02:09:23.670 --> 02:09:27.150]
We can't. We don't have the perfection that we have when he's here.

[02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:29.050]
But it was okay. It was good to hear that again.

[02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:30.690]
Okay.

[02:09:31.690 --> 02:09:33.590]
Now is it is a really line two?

[02:09:33.730 --> 02:09:36.010]
Is that is that the next one on the yeah?

[02:09:36.230 --> 02:09:36.910]
Okay. All right.

[02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.290]
Hello.

[02:09:39.330 --> 02:09:39.730]
Hello.

[02:09:40.230 --> 02:09:40.630]
Hello.

[02:09:42.170 --> 02:09:43.830]
Okay. I thought it was line two.

[02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:45.330]
Now this is the only one to go to.

[02:09:45.390 --> 02:09:46.090]
Boca. Hello.

[02:09:46.670 --> 02:09:48.770]
And I for the light in row.

[02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:52.350]
You know, you know, you can.

[02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:53.090]
And you know why?

[02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.970]
Because it's a holiday.

[02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.650]
Okay.

[02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:56.910]
Oh, no, I hung up on him.

[02:09:57.010 --> 02:09:57.770]
Oh my God.

[02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:59.710]
See, you just can't get that perfection.

[02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:01.610]
I hung up on the guy.

[02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:03.070]
I meant to put him on hold.

[02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.730]
Hit the right.

[02:10:06.810 --> 02:10:08.170]
Yeah, there are no coincidences.

[02:10:08.190 --> 02:10:09.550]
I hit the wrong button.

[02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:11.770]
So you're just going to have to call in again.

[02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:13.910]
I'm sorry boy, you know, that's damn.

[02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.430]
That's a shame.

[02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:14.690]
All right.

[02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:17.250]
We'll take another call or two and then we'll take the break.

[02:10:17.250 --> 02:10:19.210]
And then we're going to do a hold.

[02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:20.910]
They're all going on hold for the lightning round.

[02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.770]
That's what happened in Nick.

[02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:22.130]
Okay.

[02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:23.970]
We're going to update you here now.

[02:10:24.210 --> 02:10:26.290]
As you know, we have line five and eight on hold.

[02:10:26.590 --> 02:10:28.010]
They asked to be on hold for the light in here.

[02:10:28.090 --> 02:10:30.630]
And line two now is on hold for the light.

[02:10:30.670 --> 02:10:31.750]
You're an anline seven.

[02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:35.730]
And of course, line seven is Boca.

[02:10:36.110 --> 02:10:36.370]
Hello.

[02:10:37.410 --> 02:10:37.770]
Miami.

[02:10:38.350 --> 02:10:38.470]
Hi.

[02:10:38.770 --> 02:10:38.950]
Hi.

[02:10:39.970 --> 02:10:41.970]
I'm about to go grab it.

[02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:43.070]
Okay.

[02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:45.570]
Now we'll go ahead and take the break and come back

[02:10:45.570 --> 02:10:46.590]
and do the lightning round.

[02:10:46.590 --> 02:10:48.230]
It's coming up right after this.

[02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:49.950]
The game in the Cubs.

[02:10:50.070 --> 02:10:51.050]
The Cubs suck, you know.

[02:10:51.570 --> 02:10:51.710]
Yeah.

[02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:52.690]
No scoring the game.

[02:10:53.230 --> 02:10:53.510]
All right.

[02:10:54.730 --> 02:10:55.770]
Are we ready?

[02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:57.870]
We're ready to go.

[02:10:57.970 --> 02:10:59.830]
This is my first lightning round, by the way.

[02:11:00.130 --> 02:11:02.730]
We have four four lines on hold out of eight.

[02:11:03.250 --> 02:11:05.290]
And we'll take them first and we'll see how it goes.

[02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:06.770]
I've never done this before.

[02:11:07.450 --> 02:11:09.570]
So I got my fingers already to go here.

[02:11:10.090 --> 02:11:10.270]
Can you?

[02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:11.330]
I can't hear anything.

[02:11:11.490 --> 02:11:11.710]
Hello.

[02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:12.510]
Are we on the area?

[02:11:12.930 --> 02:11:13.050]
Okay.

[02:11:13.530 --> 02:11:13.970]
All right.

[02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:14.670]
Here we go.

[02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:17.930]
It's 146 and here we go with the lightning round.

[02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:18.330]
Okay.

[02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:18.790]
Hello.

[02:11:19.090 --> 02:11:19.830]
Give me an L.

[02:11:21.230 --> 02:11:22.070]
Give me an L.

[02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:23.890]
Boca.

[02:11:25.690 --> 02:11:25.690]

[02:11:28.130 --> 02:11:30.230]
The angle of the dangle equals the mass of the S.

[02:11:31.590 --> 02:11:32.530]
This isn't too bad.

[02:11:32.730 --> 02:11:32.870]
Is it?

[02:11:33.130 --> 02:11:33.430]
Okay.

[02:11:33.610 --> 02:11:34.270]
Line two.

[02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.610]
Hello.

[02:11:35.070 --> 02:11:36.170]
No secret cards.

[02:11:36.690 --> 02:11:37.770]
So many numbers.

[02:11:40.330 --> 02:11:41.530]
I'm getting the hang of this.

[02:11:41.530 --> 02:11:41.970]
Okay.

[02:11:42.250 --> 02:11:42.530]
Hello.

[02:11:43.230 --> 02:11:43.590]
Boca.

[02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:44.890]
Boca.

[02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.910]
Geez.

[02:11:47.170 --> 02:11:49.350]
You know, we were rolling along so good.

[02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:52.330]
Now I'm just going to take them in order because I don't know what to do.

[02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:52.930]
Line one.

[02:11:53.090 --> 02:11:53.330]
Hello.

[02:11:53.610 --> 02:11:54.810]
That's going to be...

[02:11:54.810 --> 02:11:55.270]
Let's see.

[02:11:57.170 --> 02:11:57.530]
Okay.

[02:11:57.630 --> 02:11:58.350]
You ran out of material.

[02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.890]
Now it's hard.

[02:11:59.530 --> 02:12:00.030]
Neal's right.

[02:12:00.190 --> 02:12:01.570]
The levels are so low.

[02:12:01.670 --> 02:12:02.490]
It's hard for me to hear.

[02:12:02.670 --> 02:12:04.530]
So Rich, if you hear anything weird, let me know.

[02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:04.850]
Okay.

[02:12:04.930 --> 02:12:05.350]
Don't touch.

[02:12:06.030 --> 02:12:06.270]
Okay.

[02:12:07.090 --> 02:12:08.010]
We dumped that one.

[02:12:08.110 --> 02:12:08.310]
Okay.

[02:12:08.370 --> 02:12:09.310]
That's our first dump.

[02:12:10.590 --> 02:12:11.950]
That one didn't get on.

[02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.870]
All right.

[02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:13.250]
Hello.

[02:12:13.530 --> 02:12:15.850]
Is there anything that you chose that glen hill?

[02:12:17.670 --> 02:12:18.150]
Okay.

[02:12:18.670 --> 02:12:19.150]
Yeah.

[02:12:19.250 --> 02:12:20.870]
I got to let the light build up for a minute.

[02:12:21.190 --> 02:12:22.210]
The other one didn't matter.

[02:12:23.150 --> 02:12:23.630]
Okay.

[02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:24.230]
Hello.

[02:12:25.570 --> 02:12:25.910]
Bird.

[02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.590]
Yeah.

[02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:27.710]
What do you call off?

[02:12:28.150 --> 02:12:29.910]
Mid-sitz psychic that Boca had a gel.

[02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:30.470]
What?

[02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:32.190]
A small meeting at large.

[02:12:34.090 --> 02:12:35.210]
That's not bad.

[02:12:35.970 --> 02:12:36.250]
Hello.

[02:12:36.250 --> 02:12:37.950]
Her mimic being on the greatest.

[02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:40.990]
Oh, that's Spike wise.

[02:12:41.250 --> 02:12:43.010]
You know, he's just insatiable.

[02:12:43.150 --> 02:12:43.390]
Hello.

[02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:45.190]
Sales people are anthuls.

[02:12:46.770 --> 02:12:47.870]
Very good, sir.

[02:12:48.290 --> 02:12:48.570]
Hello.

[02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.350]
Bird.

[02:12:49.870 --> 02:12:50.130]
Yeah.

[02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:52.070]
You just got to play the wack or twist.

[02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:55.190]
You know, I wish we had time.

[02:12:55.450 --> 02:12:55.690]
Hello.

[02:12:56.250 --> 02:12:57.330]
I got your mother over here.

[02:12:59.450 --> 02:13:00.650]
Nothing on the hotline?

[02:13:01.090 --> 02:13:01.310]
All right.

[02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:02.290]
We'll start over again.

[02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.610]
Hello.

[02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:04.470]
You amateur.

[02:13:06.710 --> 02:13:07.190]
Hello.

[02:13:08.110 --> 02:13:10.670]
If you're a neilie when you listen to neil,

[02:13:10.770 --> 02:13:12.470]
are you a hanky when you listen to Goldberg?

[02:13:13.890 --> 02:13:15.230]
Excellent question, sir.

[02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:16.410]
Can you believe this, Steve?

[02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:18.850]
Well, what you have walked into, you have walked into hell.

[02:13:19.630 --> 02:13:21.950]
You have walked into hell.

[02:13:22.630 --> 02:13:23.890]
Hope you have a good time.

[02:13:24.010 --> 02:13:25.230]
You playing trivial pursuit today?

[02:13:25.610 --> 02:13:25.810]
No.

[02:13:26.010 --> 02:13:27.090]
No trivia today.

[02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:30.390]
Oh, you sure you don't want to reconsider.

[02:13:31.870 --> 02:13:32.430]
Hello.

[02:13:33.570 --> 02:13:34.130]
Hello.

[02:13:35.450 --> 02:13:36.010]
Broward.

[02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:38.610]
So far, the men don't wear panties.

[02:13:40.190 --> 02:13:40.750]
Broward.

[02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:43.770]
You were still a bigger jackass than you work with.

[02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:47.230]
You know, I can barely hear these people.

[02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:49.290]
I know I do what he said, but that's okay.

[02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:49.710]
Hello.

[02:13:50.630 --> 02:13:51.190]
Broward.

[02:13:51.450 --> 02:13:51.570]
Yeah.

[02:13:52.210 --> 02:13:55.150]
This is Tommy Suns at Remord over here.

[02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.910]
Boca.

[02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:59.490]
Hey, Roland.

[02:14:00.970 --> 02:14:02.750]
Yeah, I told you to get back on.

[02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:04.590]
No problem at all, okay?

[02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:05.410]
Palm Beach.

[02:14:05.730 --> 02:14:08.750]
Bird, you have the faith only a newbie and goat herder could love.

[02:14:09.970 --> 02:14:11.370]
Still nothing on the hotline.

[02:14:11.670 --> 02:14:11.830]
Dead.

[02:14:13.150 --> 02:14:13.590]
Hello.

[02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:14.650]
Pretty bird.

[02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:18.770]
I like that one.

[02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:19.410]
That was cute.

[02:14:19.730 --> 02:14:19.950]
Dead.

[02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:23.030]
Glenn, you're still the best, but we're still dying over here.

[02:14:24.690 --> 02:14:25.130]
Dead.

[02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:26.130]
Hello.

[02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:26.630]
Yeah.

[02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:28.070]
I've seen the glimpsies.

[02:14:30.570 --> 02:14:31.910]
I've been waiting for one of those.

[02:14:32.050 --> 02:14:32.450]
That's good.

[02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:33.330]
Broward.

[02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:35.510]
Glenn, tell me you'll put up a little bit.

[02:14:37.330 --> 02:14:37.730]
Broward.

[02:14:38.070 --> 02:14:40.130]
The land is in the top of the tall, man.

[02:14:40.290 --> 02:14:42.190]
I fell off the fall and I can't get it up.

[02:14:42.530 --> 02:14:42.810]
Yeah.

[02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:43.990]
Broward.

[02:14:44.330 --> 02:14:44.910]
Thank you, Rocky.

[02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:49.690]
Boingles.

[02:14:49.690 --> 02:14:51.930]
It's so nice to hear from Boingle today, wasn't it?

[02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.930]
Boca.

[02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:55.890]
Steve Kane makes me puke.

[02:14:59.950 --> 02:15:02.530]
He's not doing trivial pursuit today.

[02:15:02.670 --> 02:15:03.230]
Can you believe that?

[02:15:03.370 --> 02:15:05.370]
He's going to attack somebody.

[02:15:06.010 --> 02:15:06.750]
Palm Beach.

[02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:07.850]
Mama, me, Elbicho.

[02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:10.590]
Okay.

[02:15:11.050 --> 02:15:11.610]
Dead.

[02:15:12.130 --> 02:15:13.970]
Fat man can't stand that heat.

[02:15:14.210 --> 02:15:15.410]
So he gets out of that kitchen.

[02:15:18.730 --> 02:15:19.430]
Dead.

[02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:21.890]
The most disgusting program.

[02:15:23.050 --> 02:15:24.210]
Isn't the truth.

[02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:25.010]
Dead.

[02:15:25.010 --> 02:15:27.290]
Would you play the golden butt plug?

[02:15:32.490 --> 02:15:33.130]
Broward.

[02:15:33.330 --> 02:15:35.970]
I never did, man.

[02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:39.170]
I don't get it.

[02:15:39.530 --> 02:15:39.990]
Broward.

[02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:43.670]
Killing from Pimbroke Pines is a brown nose chronic number one.

[02:15:44.810 --> 02:15:45.310]
Wow.

[02:15:46.150 --> 02:15:46.570]
Okay.

[02:15:46.930 --> 02:15:47.430]
Broward.

[02:15:48.370 --> 02:15:50.350]
I'm fiddin' to the toilet over here.

[02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:52.450]
Oh, God.

[02:15:52.450 --> 02:15:54.550]
You know, Boca.

[02:15:54.970 --> 02:15:56.070]
I'm fiddin' to the toilet.

[02:15:58.910 --> 02:16:00.070]
That's what I like.

[02:16:00.330 --> 02:16:01.690]
You know, creativity there.

[02:16:02.210 --> 02:16:02.790]
Palm Beach.

[02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:04.490]
Burr, burr, burr, burr.

[02:16:04.710 --> 02:16:07.070]
Burr, burr, burr.

[02:16:07.090 --> 02:16:10.790]
Still nothin' on the hotline is dormant today, which is strange.

[02:16:11.090 --> 02:16:11.430]
Dade.

[02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:13.130]
XY, Sir Athol.

[02:16:14.810 --> 02:16:15.370]
Okay.

[02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:16.390]
Dade.

[02:16:16.630 --> 02:16:17.470]
My, oh my.

[02:16:17.910 --> 02:16:19.170]
We're heaven to the fuck up.

[02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:20.110]
Yeah.

[02:16:20.110 --> 02:16:20.970]
Okay.

[02:16:21.170 --> 02:16:21.970]
Boy are we ever.

[02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:22.490]
Dade.

[02:16:22.730 --> 02:16:24.070]
But my friends still call me happy.

[02:16:32.590 --> 02:16:33.110]
Broward.

[02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:35.970]
It's the smartest program I've ever heard.

[02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.710]
Boy.

[02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.390]
All right.

[02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:39.450]
Hello, Broward.

[02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:41.930]
Really blissful playoffs in the douchebag.

[02:16:43.330 --> 02:16:43.850]
Okay.

[02:16:44.550 --> 02:16:45.070]
Broward.

[02:16:45.350 --> 02:16:47.830]
I like to stick my weenie in Gabriella, 17.

[02:16:51.210 --> 02:16:53.750]
Now I cannot argue with that whatsoever.

[02:16:54.130 --> 02:16:54.270]
Okay.

[02:16:54.430 --> 02:16:54.770]
Boca.

[02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.670]
Boca.

[02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:57.330]
Would you like to?

[02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:58.350]
Okay.

[02:16:58.670 --> 02:17:04.010]
I dumped that one also rich and we'll, I mean, you know, we can't.

[02:17:04.330 --> 02:17:05.610]
And that's just too ridiculous.

[02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:08.870]
We're gonna wait for the delay to build up here for a second.

[02:17:10.570 --> 02:17:13.450]
And this will help kill some time here.

[02:17:13.610 --> 02:17:15.470]
That's the water to two hours.

[02:17:15.470 --> 02:17:17.090]
I think it's obvious.

[02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.770]
Okay.

[02:17:19.010 --> 02:17:22.710]
Yeah, we gotta wait for the delay to build up a second neck and then we'll continue.

[02:17:23.050 --> 02:17:23.570]
Broward.

[02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:25.170]
It's a stationery flood.

[02:17:25.550 --> 02:17:25.750]
Over the moon.

[02:17:26.130 --> 02:17:26.130]

[02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:27.210]
Okay.

[02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:28.130]
All right.

[02:17:28.410 --> 02:17:31.770]
I can't hear half these calls anyway.

[02:17:31.890 --> 02:17:33.590]
The levels are so low.

[02:17:34.410 --> 02:17:34.910]
Broward.

[02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:36.890]
It can't even make it.

[02:17:39.310 --> 02:17:40.950]
I've never heard that one before.

[02:17:41.610 --> 02:17:42.090]
Broward.

[02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:43.290]
Can I clean up your nest?

[02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:45.470]
No.

[02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.830]
Boca.

[02:17:47.250 --> 02:17:48.350]
Is this the Glenhill show?

[02:17:48.930 --> 02:17:49.190]
No.

[02:17:49.770 --> 02:17:49.930]
No.

[02:17:51.310 --> 02:17:52.070]
Palm Beach.

[02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:53.590]
Hello.

[02:17:53.890 --> 02:17:54.070]
Yeah.

[02:17:54.590 --> 02:17:54.830]
Bird.

[02:17:55.170 --> 02:17:55.310]
Yeah.

[02:17:55.930 --> 02:17:58.330]
Dr. Fager thinks that the olfidouish big.

[02:17:59.170 --> 02:17:59.410]
Okay.

[02:17:59.470 --> 02:18:00.730]
Now the hotline is ringing rich.

[02:18:01.010 --> 02:18:01.790]
Look at this.

[02:18:02.410 --> 02:18:02.710]
Hello.

[02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:03.690]
Hello.

[02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:07.170]
I did Steve Cain and Norman Kent last night in their Mount Eros.

[02:18:08.970 --> 02:18:13.270]
I see we've been waiting for a call in the hotline for all this old lightning rather we've got one.

[02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:15.350]
Wow.

[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:16.770]
Okay.

[02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:18.550]
Now every line continues to ring.

[02:18:18.610 --> 02:18:23.630]
This is almost spooky as we continue with our memorial day lightning round.

[02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.170]
Dead.

[02:18:24.630 --> 02:18:25.390]
What's the question?

[02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.870]
Good one.

[02:18:28.090 --> 02:18:28.270]
Dead.

[02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:30.230]
The call is a shock.

[02:18:31.590 --> 02:18:32.110]
Yeah.

[02:18:32.530 --> 02:18:33.430]
I think we know that.

[02:18:33.690 --> 02:18:34.390]
No score net.

[02:18:34.630 --> 02:18:35.190]
Big game.

[02:18:35.450 --> 02:18:35.970]
All right.

[02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:37.050]
So Neil didn't miss a thing.

[02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.950]
Dead.

[02:18:38.310 --> 02:18:39.690]
I'm ruthless over here.

[02:18:42.450 --> 02:18:42.970]
Broward.

[02:18:42.970 --> 02:18:45.390]
The cops fought my ass.

[02:18:45.590 --> 02:18:46.070]
Yeah.

[02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.530]
Me too.

[02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.610]
Broward.

[02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:49.170]
You are a tilt-out.

[02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:51.550]
You'll let that go.

[02:18:52.210 --> 02:18:52.710]
Broward.

[02:18:53.310 --> 02:18:53.570]
Hello.

[02:18:53.930 --> 02:18:54.130]
Yeah.

[02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:55.110]
Hey.

[02:18:55.690 --> 02:18:55.850]
Hey.

[02:18:56.210 --> 02:18:56.210]

[02:18:56.350 --> 02:18:56.570]
We're here.

[02:18:58.330 --> 02:19:00.030]
We'll let that one go too.

[02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:02.730]
See which ones we let go and which ones we don't.

[02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.470]
Boca.

[02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:05.570]
You're the baddest you want to be, baby.

[02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:08.310]
Palm Beach.

[02:19:08.550 --> 02:19:08.850]
Funny.

[02:19:09.050 --> 02:19:10.670]
I hate the hitting but I don't mind the swelling.

[02:19:12.970 --> 02:19:15.410]
And thank God the hotline is what we're just going through.

[02:19:15.610 --> 02:19:16.910]
I'm going to I go through them in order.

[02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:18.410]
You know, just you do day.

[02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:19.350]
Then we do Broward.

[02:19:19.470 --> 02:19:20.050]
Then we do the others.

[02:19:20.210 --> 02:19:21.010]
And then the hotline.

[02:19:21.130 --> 02:19:23.890]
If it's ringing and thank God this round it isn't.

[02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:25.050]
So here we go with another round.

[02:19:25.050 --> 02:19:25.530]
All right.

[02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:25.890]
Dead.

[02:19:26.470 --> 02:19:27.590]
At the end of two innings.

[02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:28.330]
That's the braids.

[02:19:28.410 --> 02:19:28.570]
Ten.

[02:19:28.730 --> 02:19:28.990]
The cops.

[02:19:29.210 --> 02:19:29.510]
Nothing.

[02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:31.390]
No score.

[02:19:32.130 --> 02:19:32.450]
Dead.

[02:19:32.770 --> 02:19:33.510]
I don't hang up on me.

[02:19:33.570 --> 02:19:34.210]
Don't hang up on me.

[02:19:34.210 --> 02:19:35.770]
Don't hang up on me.

[02:19:35.770 --> 02:19:35.990]
Dead.

[02:19:36.650 --> 02:19:38.830]
You are as bad as everyone thinks.

[02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:38.910]
That's right.

[02:19:42.330 --> 02:19:42.810]
Broward.

[02:19:42.890 --> 02:19:44.290]
Dave and Bruce are a douche bag.

[02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:47.050]
Oh, okay.

[02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:48.230]
Broward.

[02:19:48.610 --> 02:19:49.210]
Yes, Bird.

[02:19:49.450 --> 02:19:51.950]
I don't know whether to scream or eat your banana.

[02:19:52.930 --> 02:19:54.670]
I'm not going to let that one go, too.

[02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.990]
Broward.

[02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:57.470]
Broward.

[02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.970]
Broward.

[02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.390]
Yeah.

[02:19:58.770 --> 02:20:01.490]
What do you call a person who uses hair spray six miles up?

[02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.410]
I don't know.

[02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:04.090]
And those on from Blocketour.

[02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:05.690]
All right.

[02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:06.470]
Boca.

[02:20:07.170 --> 02:20:07.850]
Steve K.

[02:20:12.390 --> 02:20:13.750]
He's not the quality.

[02:20:14.090 --> 02:20:14.630]
It's the quantity.

[02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:18.670]
And thank God the hotline is not ringing.

[02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:20.810]
Now I just go through him, you know, just in order.

[02:20:21.150 --> 02:20:21.950]
And I will see what happens.

[02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:22.330]
Dave.

[02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:23.950]
Yee hee hee, podcast.

[02:20:25.230 --> 02:20:26.110]
Okay, Dave.

[02:20:26.370 --> 02:20:28.830]
There once was a fellow named Chris whose balls were made out of brass.

[02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:30.930]
It's enough for that one.

[02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:31.450]
Dave.

[02:20:31.930 --> 02:20:33.130]
Emory, clat to an hour lot.

[02:20:33.370 --> 02:20:34.410]
That you'll bring your dangas.

[02:20:36.430 --> 02:20:37.750]
Ha ha ha.

[02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:40.190]
I know.

[02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:42.070]
I don't know whether to scream or yeah.

[02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.830]
Broward.

[02:20:42.930 --> 02:20:44.350]
I'd buy that for a dollar.

[02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.810]
Robocop.

[02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.370]
Yeah.

[02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:48.090]
Broward.

[02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:48.890]
He's my ampita.

[02:20:49.450 --> 02:20:50.210]
This is Elvis.

[02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.930]
Broward.

[02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:56.650]
He's your first picture to chop chop chop.

[02:20:57.530 --> 02:20:58.530]
Good one.

[02:20:59.170 --> 02:21:00.030]
Ha ha ha.

[02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.590]
Boca.

[02:21:01.050 --> 02:21:03.070]
I'm waiting for Neil Tapue.

[02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:05.490]
Excellent.

[02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:05.570]
What?

[02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.630]
Pumbich.

[02:21:07.730 --> 02:21:08.250]
Pumbich.

[02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:10.230]
Yeah, preparation for Bacatora.

[02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:11.990]
Ha ha ha.

[02:21:12.430 --> 02:21:15.790]
All right, we did another round there and no hotline ring.

[02:21:15.970 --> 02:21:16.510]
Thank God.

[02:21:16.770 --> 02:21:17.870]
Okay, 156.

[02:21:18.130 --> 02:21:21.350]
We got, we can do at least, we can go through him at least one more time.

[02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.750]
Okay.

[02:21:22.290 --> 02:21:22.490]
Dave.

[02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:24.550]
I don't need a damn history lesson.

[02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:25.570]
I need help.

[02:21:26.390 --> 02:21:28.090]
Ha ha ha ha.

[02:21:28.770 --> 02:21:29.290]
Dave.

[02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:32.030]
I can't get this back some proper fine.

[02:21:33.150 --> 02:21:33.990]
Okay, Dave.

[02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:36.810]
Hey, Sean says Kevin and Dennis are both douchebags.

[02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:39.190]
Okay, now let's go to Broward.

[02:21:39.310 --> 02:21:40.150]
Thank you, Ruckian.

[02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:42.890]
Oh, here's a boy called twice today.

[02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.430]
How cool.

[02:21:44.350 --> 02:21:44.830]
Broward.

[02:21:45.010 --> 02:21:47.270]
So far, I'm in Delaware, Ben.

[02:21:48.810 --> 02:21:50.570]
And another one in Broward.

[02:21:51.610 --> 02:21:52.590]
Okay, Boca.

[02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:54.010]
You got it, baby.

[02:21:54.270 --> 02:21:54.850]
You got it.

[02:21:57.470 --> 02:21:58.430]
Okay, ampumbich.

[02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:00.210]
Where the hell's the door, lady?

[02:22:00.970 --> 02:22:02.090]
You know, you're right.

[02:22:02.090 --> 02:22:06.310]
I wish you hadn't said that because now all of a sudden the door lady didn't call me.

[02:22:06.670 --> 02:22:08.750]
I'm doing the lightning round, which I've never done before.

[02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:12.210]
And the door lady who I have a terrible crush on doesn't call me.

[02:22:12.350 --> 02:22:12.870]
All right, Dave.

[02:22:13.090 --> 02:22:14.170]
You better like you, old.

[02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.670]
Dave.

[02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:17.710]
I'm a lot of you.

[02:22:18.050 --> 02:22:18.710]
Ha ha ha.

[02:22:20.290 --> 02:22:21.170]
And Dave.

[02:22:21.390 --> 02:22:23.710]
If you like my head going to blow, would you?

[02:22:24.450 --> 02:22:26.510]
Okay, we dumped that one.

[02:22:26.770 --> 02:22:27.850]
Didn't go on the air.

[02:22:28.410 --> 02:22:28.850]
Broward.

[02:22:28.850 --> 02:22:31.290]
My wife came to show, but I hate my wife.

[02:22:33.310 --> 02:22:34.110]
Okay, Broward.

[02:22:34.750 --> 02:22:35.730]
The video, the video, the video.

[02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:36.430]
That's all, Boca.

[02:22:38.310 --> 02:22:39.050]
And Boca.

[02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:41.970]
The door lady makes me pu-

[02:22:43.130 --> 02:22:44.470]
Now, pumbich.

[02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:45.950]
Oh, you are, damn f.

[02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.910]
We're smiles.

[02:22:49.930 --> 02:22:50.970]
All right, can we do one more?

[02:22:51.290 --> 02:22:53.470]
And we'll do it through one more time so we can find the door lady.

[02:22:53.650 --> 02:22:53.790]
Dead.

[02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:56.110]
Go ahead, he'll be a fruit cage.

[02:22:57.310 --> 02:22:57.970]
Dead.

[02:22:58.850 --> 02:22:59.550]
Where's that beef?

[02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:02.710]
Oh, you talk about dated.

[02:23:03.130 --> 02:23:04.590]
Oh, my God, dead.

[02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:07.270]
Oh, you're super sure.

[02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:10.170]
Broward.

[02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:12.610]
Broward.

[02:23:13.890 --> 02:23:14.550]
Hello?

[02:23:15.130 --> 02:23:15.390]
Hello?

[02:23:15.850 --> 02:23:16.050]
Yeah.

[02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:18.490]
Jeffrey, get over here.

[02:23:20.410 --> 02:23:21.070]
Broward.

[02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:23.150]
Holly, remember how dumb I used to be?

[02:23:23.610 --> 02:23:24.830]
Well, I'm better now.

[02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:27.830]
Broward.

[02:23:28.210 --> 02:23:30.050]
Jay and Domingo don't buy a house.

[02:23:32.290 --> 02:23:32.710]
Boca.

[02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.610]
Boca.

[02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:37.510]
Okay, pumbich.

[02:23:38.650 --> 02:23:40.710]
Hey, Glenn, you're doing a fantastic job.

[02:23:41.250 --> 02:23:41.670]
Prabhakatur.

[02:23:43.090 --> 02:23:44.530]
Okay, and the hotline is ringing.

[02:23:44.730 --> 02:23:44.930]
Hello?

[02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:47.690]
Okay, we had to dump the hotline.

[02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:48.910]
Now, what does that tell you?

[02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:49.430]
Yeah, that's it.

[02:23:49.550 --> 02:23:51.890]
That's the lightning round for today on Memorial Day Edition.

[02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:56.150]
When you have to dump the hotline, I mean, does that tell you anything?

[02:23:57.070 --> 02:24:00.190]
Okay, well, if they get the AC fixed, Uncle Leo will be back.

[02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:06.150]
And I'll see you two 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, right here at 6'10", W-I-O-D.

[02:24:06.470 --> 02:24:07.410]
The news is next.

[02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:18.910]
