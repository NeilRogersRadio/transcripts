[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380]
All collect the opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station now

[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.160]
Here's Neil Rogers on new stock radio 610 W I O D. I'm a cup fan

[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.320]
I know bud man and I trust you are too. Okay. We'll get this over with real quick

[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.380]
So you don't have to get upset because I know you're under a lot of pressure this morning

[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.900]
Six the Cubs had five home runs in the month of May as a team five in a whole month of May

[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.260]
Yesterday they hit six in one game. I

[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.820]
Still I'm in shock. I'm reeling

[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.720]
When Shaw and Dunston hits two home runs in again, then you know something's wrong

[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.180]
Anyway, the Cubs 113 and we got that over with and they're still in first place

[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.640]
And they start four against the meds today and that's the name of that tune

[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.520]
We got a lot of stuff to cover today boy

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.560]
We have just tons of things to talk about really

[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.960]
Now the cane show today the new split in the Catholic Church radical priests attacked the Vatican

[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.760]
moderate say the radicals are tearing the church in two and

[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.480]
Those two priests will be father Patrick O'Shea and father Joseph Francis Collins

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.880]
Why is it a lot of priests have three names?

[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.540]
I don't know if a father Collins is related to Dennis Collins at W. Snooze

[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.320]
You think that's possible because he don't have a prayer over there on that

[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.160]
Anyway, I had a great day at Calder Saturday. I lost only a few dollars

[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.040]
I had a great time got a lot of something a little bit of a burn here in fact

[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.160]
I could say I got burned at Calder, but that would be

[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.820]
And I had a wonderful time saw a lot of people Ed Kaplan was there from Q.A.M

[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.340]
Wow, and I didn't recognize him

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700]
Yeah, I felt embarrassed because I kind of was

[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.540]
Serly enroute and he probably takes it personally. I didn't recognize you. I'm sorry

[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.340]
But then when you walk away. Oh, that's Ed Kaplan. He works at Dick Fahley station

[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.660]
He's an Ojoan provocateur. Oh

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.460]
Anyway, who a Hank was there of course and Hank had a bad losing dad all losers and Steve I understand I didn't run into Steve

[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.540]
But he was up in a press box a bug and Hank for winners

[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.620]
No, he couldn't have had a really big day. I heard to the grapevine. He did have one winner, but

[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.260]
Because Hank had all losers on Saturday

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.680]
Just he Hank stays with those same like sweet Bobby V

[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.120]
You know when you're gonna get over that Hank

[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.900]
You just got to give up some of those chronics and who else did I see there? Oh and of course

[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.720]
Seriously, this was very nice of him to do Mike lions from Zeta and his lady friend were there

[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.100]
And he had this package in his arms he slept it around the whole time luckily

[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.380]
I saw him early so I could slip it around the rest of the day that I was there and it had six of my old CDs from Zeta with my name on him

[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.400]
He said I took this just in case he I would run India out here today

[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.040]
And it was very nice and I appreciated it and he said that everything was just fine

[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.480]
Well, I have some big news from my clients today who I

[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.020]
Well, okay, we'll get to that tonight before you start getting people depressed now. You're rumours will do it and

[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.040]
This is confirmed room great meal at La Tevernetta took some friends La Tevernetta

[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.360]
That's always great, but this was the best meal of all time. It was just

[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.080]
indescribable beyond belief

[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.920]
Okay, I don't want to admit that I had veal because I've been off baby cow for a very long time

[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.560]
But their baby cow is so good boy. It was just incredible

[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.880]
And I discovered they got all these different new dishes named after me everything is Rosario

[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.020]
Rosario which in Italian means Rogers according I think they make that up as they go along if the food was just

[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.280]
phenomenal beyond belief and you remember carols

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.820]
Nice I think it is or was it her daughter? What who was graduating? Don't you remember last weekend?

[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.320]
They were closed because all these are daughter. Yeah, her graduating was it her daughter?

[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.840]
Very attractive young lady by the way she was there with the whole the Gonsa Mishbhaha the whole family was it was just great

[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.220]
So we had a wonderful time in a terrific meal. I'm just kind of like recapping everything that happened

[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.900]
Is that okay? Sure. I covered the cubs game in like 40 words or less

[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.040]
I know this is gonna come up a lot more than I didn't mention that me even Mitch Webster had another so I brought in my life magazine to read while you guys

[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.920]
I know what I wanted to say I had a great time at Calder

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.920]
They have refurbished that fourth floor up there when we go out there. You're gonna flip. That's what rich told me oh man

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.940]
Is that beautiful up there in the where Martha and

[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.360]
All my friends Mickey all those people are up there with a food on the deli thing and they've refurbished it

[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.140]
And it's enlarged it. It's beautiful and inside where the windows are like the guy said it looks like a casino

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:31.360]
Looks like Garden State in in Jersey. Wow. It's all glittery and fixed up. They've done a beautiful job out there

[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.780]
They really have my only complaint at Calder

[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.520]
And it could be that the brave's game was fed and be seen at this area. I don't know

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.600]
Because I thought I'd go out there and get to see the cubs game on TV

[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.980]
Which luckily Saturday I didn't see because they lost in tenetings, but

[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.040]
The only game that was on was the brave's giant's game on one monitor

[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.100]
So either they had tvs on which would really frost my ass or NBC fed this area the

[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.300]
San Francisco game instead of the main game remember I ask you about that on priority. Yeah, well

[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.520]
You never know in this town, you know, I don't so maybe somebody out there who knows which game was fed by NBC here

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.740]
I told you that priority because this is but I had a good time out there

[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.940]
And if I'd have stayed home and had to watch them lose the next runnings

[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.380]
I couldn't I would have been bad. It would have been wrong. So I'm glad that I went out there

[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.180]
Okay, let's do a little break here and then when we come back

[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.500]
We've got some shocking radio news coming up finally just the astonishing news

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.240]
Finally we can confirm some of these rumors that have been floating around throw some of these ridiculous rumors out from other sources

[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.340]
You mean like Dennis racing?

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.160]
Exactly. Yeah, Dennis you really ought to hang your head and shame. I mean you're a wonderful guy

[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.080]
And you got big numbers over there and you're doing great

[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.040]
But on the rumor line you just you just doesn't have it maybe he in fact I would put him and Steve uh-huh

[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.280]
On a par okay, because you know the Steve's rumors seem to be basically the school of swishful thing

[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.360]
It says that was an NBC feed so we don't play my friends had called or I knew they wouldn't be foolish enough to put the braves game on when the pirates and the card

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.240]
Or when they comes in the cardinals were playing who that was a Freudian slip

[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.020]
but

[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.040]
So it's not their fault that was what NBC was feeding to this town. I've had a been home. I could have still seen a cubs game on

[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.820]
uh F2

[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.240]
Okay, I'm one of the satellites

[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.420]
Are you following me?

[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.280]
Anyway, it's 12 minutes past 10 at W.I.O.D

[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.940]
We thank whoever called him boy. It's gonna be another Monday on that phone. I can see that boy

[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.240]
Do we get some response on that? Huh passing your seat my one call?

[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.900]
One call? Oh three calls. Well excuse me. I take it all back ladies and gentlemen. You're really really

[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.480]
Just overburdening us with response Dave. Well one of them was fat rich

[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.900]
Like I said, we had two calls 12 minutes after 10 at W I O D

[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.920]
I want to tell you about shells

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.240]
They start each day looking over the freshest fish available in South Florida. They choose the very freshest help

[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.060]
Now what are you doing in here denim brig? Why are you pooching around? What is that?

[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.960]
606 for a six pack. Oh, we'd love by the way for lunch today. We'd love Arnold's

[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.440]
I don't want to impose upon them. He's coming Wednesday

[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.860]
Well, I was in the mood for it today. Okay. I just went in that impassant time

[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.140]
Wings plus today. Have I wings plus? Oh, we do have wings plus today

[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.840]
If we want I see I don't understand that they're way they hell up there in Yanemousville. How do they do that?

[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.640]
Okay, so if Arnold's are listening if mr. and Mrs. Arnold who are wonderful folks Wednesday will be ready

[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.820]
Because wings plus is coming today. Oh, is that mean those garlic wings that I'm just obsessed with?

[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.800]
Oh boy, by the way, eight at Lotta vernetta last night. It was just phenomenal

[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.400]
I just mentioned that for you because you're so nervous all the time

[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.840]
And they just love me with a passion. They were just tinkling all over. I had to change my honor because I'm a wonderful guy

[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.840]
Tom unlike some people I don't want to mention a name

[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.920]
It's a 1015 at w i o d anyway. Where were we before the sales you notice the whole sales department

[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.200]
I'm bothered with the couple of exceptions Coleman of course is probably

[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.520]
lost today

[00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.240]
And our other friend whose name mr. BM yeah captain. He doesn't come in here. He won't come in here

[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.480]
Because I won't have anything to do with him ever again trust me. I told boy gary that this morning

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.540]
By the way, you noticed they're back. Yeah, yeah, isn't that incredible?

[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.400]
It is Memorial days finally over huh boy. It took a lot of time. I guess the holiday is finally over for long time this year

[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.280]
Yeah, long time, long time, we can the history of the United States

[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.960]
It's probably going to go in the Guinness book of record two weekends

[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.840]
And they finally have come back all these bureaucrats are back in the building which means we're probably going to have some real grief

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.560]
Exactly, we think ran very smoothly

[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.200]
Except of course for the psychosis from the sales department

[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.900]
I shouldn't say from the sales department basically from captain BM

[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.100]
Okay, it's 1016 and here we go with the incredible shocking

[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.420]
We got a rumor at the end of the show Friday was from Johnny Dolan and it said that Zeta

[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:53.920]
Was going to go pirate radio on the satellite now. I have confirmed this over the weekend from another source

[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.880]
And this is why they're just sitting there

[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.500]
Sitting there doing nothing they're waiting this is not this format is going on westwood one satellite

[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.440]
You had to know something was going. Yeah, Scott Shannon is putting this together of course from uh

[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.900]
New York he's out in LA. They're going to do it from the westwood one

[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:16.680]
Studio in LA and it's going to be called pirate radio which is already on of course in Los Angeles radio

[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.720]
But it's going to be on the satellite. I don't understand what makes Scott Shannon a programmer

[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.500]
Well, he had like the number one station in New York City

[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.640]
Remember

[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.480]
No, I understand that but what makes him okay go ahead he did he's got a very successful

[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.740]
And he went out to LA in New York, but I know I made your story in the industry when he went to Los Angeles

[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.460]
I thought the major story was KFI

[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.680]
What do you mean our sister's

[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.940]
Was to say the cats isn't that the major story that Jeff Edwards walked out because Tom like us was a douchebag

[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.680]
I guess that was number two. Oh, but anyway, what they're gonna do and I think a two share out there

[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.300]
Yeah, not bad

[00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:00.680]
There's one one one two the billboards that you see watches space those will become one five pirate radio billboards

[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.800]
Which are very nice. Mm-hmm. They're eye catching

[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.240]
This means they carry the pirate games to

[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.760]
Preserve pathetic. They're just really

[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.500]
It will be on them up just in time when it goes on satellite in three or four weeks and that's the story

[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.940]
Is that's a hubbub but what they're going to be doing? It'll be satellite delivered probably won't be any disc jockey locally

[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:26.060]
Maybe in drive. I don't know, you know, but they won't talk to the other words the kernel and the morning crew is gonna be gone probably

[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.260]
I didn't hear that specifically, but they won't talk much if they have any DJs on the

[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.400]
I heard in the building today from a very authoritative source

[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:41.200]
That while Rose Folger was out of the building either on vacation or whatever last week that they were interviewing a whole bunch of people for his job

[00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:48.780]
Fascinating isn't that fascinating yeah, because several of those people have been in contact with over here. Yeah. Yeah, that too

[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.400]
Mm-hmm. Yeah

[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.660]
So that's the that's shocking. Yeah, what a way to start the week and finally getting to the bottom of what's gonna go on

[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.720]
It only took them two years of schlepping a raw along with the same

[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.140]
sorry music

[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:07.260]
The same tragic numbers, but I want you to notice that when we have room we didn't fit in those numbers

[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.380]
We're just too bright for the rest of that format, but I want you to remember when we have rumors from other people

[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.200]
Like Dennis Reese or Steve O they don't seem to happen

[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.580]
Yeah, the WOLD rumors that we've been battled with since we've been here

[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.460]
But you know I have not participated in that at all

[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:29.000]
I want I never gonna get led down to Garden Path when I give you a rumor and you know this kind of like

[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.720]
It's kind of like that horse that Steve was touting out of your weakness. It's very good exam Northern douchebag wonderful metaphorical comparison

[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:43.020]
Yes, but when I give you the rumors and you know this from the past they seem to happen don't they yeah when I give them to you

[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.320]
Confirmed by the way

[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.800]
We own apology to Joe with two ends we do yeah

[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.200]
Well all that mysterious stuff that well I was being fed all total fantasy

[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.800]
We're really and about that crank call that he received that day, you know, yeah, it did happen

[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.300]
And I even know who made it

[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.100]
It's 20 past 10 at W I O D father's day is coming up

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.860]
Father's day is coming up on what date this year is

[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.260]
It's

[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.720]
23 after your ten at W I O D. We just had an incredible experience a shocking

[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.100]
That we're just keeps popping up all over the place

[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.300]
Tom Denenberg opened the door again

[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:28.840]
He said the wings plus is coming on Wednesday Wednesday made a mistake now Tom has never been known to make a mistake

[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.100]
But I guess he's calling Arnold's right now to see if we get the little Royal Castle burgers today

[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.880]
The ones with a bacon change. Oh, they made those special for us those were heaven sure were those were spectacular

[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.340]
Anyway, you had a little thing happen with your battery, which we just might mention briefly because I came in in the hoodie your car was up

[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.380]
Problems and it seems that that lifetime

[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.840]
Made in its free you'll maintenance free battery

[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.060]
The water was out of all the cells and our crack engineer Mitch Wien was out there save my life saving your life made a little

[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.820]
Makeshift funnel there to get the was amazing isn't even called in Dick funnel from channel four

[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.700]
By the way, we neglected to mention last week Alan

[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.920]
douchebag over from chip Harris who used to be the general manager before

[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.900]
Admitted that the worst mistake he ever made was firing Jim Brazmer

[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:21.420]
And then because they just got rid of that David Jackson the guy with the runaway S on the news that I've been ripping for a year

[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.480]
However long he's been had right and then we say at the time Brazmer was excellent

[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.800]
Everybody liked him. He's been here forever and now he's up there in channel 25 in West Palm Beach, which is like being

[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.720]
I don't know. Maybe he's doing real well

[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.260]
I hope so because he's a good guy and a great talent and the Alan you're among head. Okay, you're just a douchebag

[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.840]
Yeah, we know Larry Kings on heraldo. We don't care

[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.140]
Okay, if his breath if his breath is bad enough today

[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.180]
Maybe heraldo will pass out on the stage. Okay, this could be another one of those contrived deals

[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.660]
You know where heraldo has one of these accidents falls down breaks his neck. He'll be in a brace

[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.580]
Be the first man in history to break his neck from somebody's bad breath

[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.300]
What's a question herald

[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.100]
25 past 10 and W I O D. So anyway, that's kind of a synopsis of all the excitement that's going on over here

[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.740]
Yeah, that's right. We got lunch. I guess pretty well set up. I guess

[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.440]
Yeah, you got the Keynes in the college world series tonight at 810 against Texas

[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.500]
After their win against LSU and skip bourbon on Saturday. So that gets everybody right up to date. We got everything going

[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.200]
No bush being bang

[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.960]
So everything's great, right?

[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:24.760]
I

[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.780]
Guess boy, they really did a beautiful job at Calder man. It was great good

[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.820]
I'm looking all and also oh man. I saw the article about the I haven't you know

[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.720]
I don't read the paper because it's frightening. It's dangerous. You get depressed and there was this big article

[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.660]
In yesterday's paper about the racing dates

[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.520]
Oh, and how

[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:51.220]
Brunetti at highly is going to be overlapping all of these dates with with calder first now can you see?

[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.440]
What it's going to look like at highly if they really go ahead and do that? I'm

[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:55.900]
horses

[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.340]
Okay

[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.760]
And even if they do have enough horses to fill a card

[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:08.980]
He won't have 1500 people there frightening. This really frightens me. He won't have 1500 people here at highly it may not have a thousand

[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.300]
So what kind of purses would they be able to offer when the mutual handles like 150,000 dollars

[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.360]
That's like going to a bule of downs or something. Okay, purses will be like $609

[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.100]
$100 the word suicide comes to my mind the word plow horse comes to mind

[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:30.860]
Okay, king of dance may be back for a day for an encore. Why are they doing this? Oh because the three of them are just

[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.400]
That was the cross crux of the whole article again is about how

[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.480]
Kenny know and the dug-don and Brunetti just refused to get along and they've got all these personal

[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.360]
conflicts with each other and as a result

[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.960]
They you know the whole thoroughbred entry in the state is like in a shade a state of shock and shambles because of it

[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.180]
And they just don't want to get their act together which is really a shame because we got some beautiful racetracks

[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.620]
Yeah, and these people just won't get their crap together

[00:15:54.020 --> 00:16:00.440]
27 after 10 at W.I.O.D. our first call of the morning is a mobile and brown word hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah. How you doing great?

[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.560]
I called you before about remember remember on the one I didn't try to tickle wings from I never tried them

[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.040]
Yeah, well, I went to the wingsprus and there kickass tickle. Oh, yeah, they're incredible

[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.900]
I picked it to the garlic just like you know

[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.340]
As a matter of fact, I was really psyched up when Dennyberg came in today and said they're coming today

[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.840]
And I got myself right in the frame of mind for the garlic wings and then now I got to wait till Wednesday

[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.700]
Wednesday, yeah, I thought you're getting aren't you getting the wings today? No, Dennyberg made a mistake

[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.380]
Oh, so what is ironholes coming today then? I guess

[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:32.740]
Yes, you have to try those too. Those are great. But all the stuff we got in here is great

[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.020]
Yeah, well, you're lucky kind of guy you get to get to eat all this good food here. That's right

[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.460]
Well, that's what happens when you're a star when you're a real stupid star

[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.080]
You got it pal. Well, listen have a great day. All right, and you'll take a look

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.660]
28 after 10 at W I O D

[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.620]
We have one line open and brown one in bokeh where I actually off to a fairly good start for a Monday

[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.080]
I will say that let's not you know talk about it too much

[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.300]
There goes the other brown line boy. This is shocking. We have an open in bokeh 278 9463

[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.380]
278 W I O D, but don't forget I got six CDs in this thing here that Mike lions give me that was really nice

[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.560]
You know what? Mm-hmm. I really mean that he brought him out

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.660]
He didn't know if I was going to be there or if he'd run into me and just as luck would have it there he was

[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.400]
I didn't know he was a Neely. I had no idea. Oh, he loves the show. Yeah, I'm obsessed

[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.740]
Well, I'm obsessed everybody's obsessed because there's nothing else going on in town

[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.340]
I think the show kind of reflects you know, it's compared to a lot of the other stuff that's on a year

[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.340]
It's a reflection in fact

[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.040]
I even listened to go into the track to a little bit of our tape rerun on Saturday

[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.800]
And it was it was the one where we had the doctor on hold during the whole show

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.860]
You know the one I'm dying over here who by the way got fired

[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:46.420]
I found out yesterday he got fired for a whole bunch of screw-ups, but evidently for mostly

[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.740]
Not doing any work in fact his patience

[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.760]
Oh, seriously his patience had a favorite line

[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.140]
I'm dying over here. Yeah

[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.640]
Because he was on the phone the whole time and he was the

[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.000]
Expiring in the waiting room. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello. Hey guys. How you doing? Yeah, okay

[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.980]
Hey, bird did you see you to see yesterday?

[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.160]
Terry Merman and that my matured hospital

[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.600]
Yeah, well she looked at standing yesterday. Oh, you got oh, Lord. She's not that great. Okay, sir

[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.660]
Oh, man, she had this dress on. Yeah, it was just a knockout. Well the dress may have been great all by itself

[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:25.360]
She's not that great. She's all right. Oh, if they could get her hair straightened up was her southern accent coming through

[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.000]
Yeah, yeah, how about that?

[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.180]
Hey, Neil. Yeah, can you put me a hole for like me, Rob? Sure. No problem

[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.760]
I'm going to say today. I'm forgetting early man. Okay, you're holding

[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.560]
Yeah, that'd be a real good idea. We'll do like Larry can't use to do with trivia

[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.140]
What we'll do is we'll have people call in right at the beginning of the show and we'll tie up all eight lines

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.800]
Then we don't ever have to pump the numbers anymore

[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.000]
Maybe somebody gets disconnected or hangs up that you have an emergency

[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.380]
That would be a really good idea

[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.060]
I can't pioneered this oh, yeah

[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.040]
We're gonna open a line at six o'clock on Sunday morning. Oh

[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:10.040]
She have it oh she have it. Oh man. Hello Larry. I have a beautiful coaster. It only toasted 700 pieces of bread by actual count

[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:17.140]
It has a little mong inside the elements, but it's in good shape. I like $10. Oh

[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.000]
Oh god those were the good old days this market is so far behind it

[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.540]
So we got pirate radio coming to zeta for now. What's gonna happen to the call letters? I don't know

[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.200]
I honestly gonna be like w-o-f-f something that's appropriate

[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.920]
I didn't hear anything about that the interesting question. I don't know about w-f-u-n

[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.040]
Those calls are a little bit difficult. I think they are. I think you're crazy

[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.120]
Well, somebody would have I don't know somebody somewhere would have picked those up our way. I wondered about that

[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.120]
You know somebody should leave it to what he's subring to drop the best call letters in America

[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.460]
Yeah, w-f-u-n, you know reminds me of dropping i85. Yeah, or a one a

[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.420]
Open line in bokeh 278 9463

[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.680]
We haven't had a tinkle in bokeh at all this morning. That's pretty depressing north Miami. Hello

[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.120]
Great a call for Mike, but wait a minute. Do you see again my psychic powers are working? Yeah

[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.860]
Last time I mentioned w-f-u-n. I just mentioned it

[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.020]
We punch up the next call and the guys got an old w-f-u-n jingle cute up there

[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:29.600]
Incredible this show is astonishing, you know, I think so. I think we got a shock ease getting passay

[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.780]
It's getting overused. I think we have to go to astonishing

[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.080]
Is what it is that's I even I can't believe that that's almost

[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.400]
Not quite but it's almost as astonishing as this say want to okay

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.760]
I'll think we got the let me get that a little bit more compression going here

[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.480]
Because a little bit he'll most oh wait a minute wait before he goes on you know what I've discovered

[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.700]
I don't want to knock mech because you did a great job with your battery. Yes, he did

[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:57.880]
But you know how we always talk about the music renearie plays how it sounds like it's way off in the background

[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.060]
Well, I was listening to the best of this on Saturday

[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.000]
And there was a record we played and it's still even on the CD player

[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.400]
It sounded like it was off in the background

[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.680]
It did had no it was shallow. You know what I'm saying that be because there's no compression on this station

[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.140]
All right, that's true. Is that true? Yeah, far as I know well

[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:22.100]
That's why the music stays like in a background sounds like the level is even even if it's cranked up even if it's banging a needle in there

[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.100]
The music sounds like it's on a different level. It's

[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.420]
Suppressed or something. There's no compression. Well, when if we can get any compression

[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.420]
You think we can get some? Yeah, so we could sound like that would be good. Then we could really do a jubble

[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:45.100]
I got pipes there hey 75 degrees in the magic city. Hey, we're broadcasting live hold on a second

[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.500]
Let me let me stop that over

[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.960]
75 degrees in the magic city hills of a great storm

[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:57.600]
Already old dog come on down with it. We're gonna get down to that we're going to dread groovy. It's the right time

[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.980]
What they hell about talking about

[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.640]
It's still astonishing. Yeah 1033 at w.i.o. D. Margate. Hello. Hello Neil. Yeah, I'm your burning bird

[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.220]
Take your advice and finally made it out to let Tebernette over the weekend. Oh boy

[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.920]
We had a meal there last night that I'm just still a spastic over it was so great

[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.660]
Yeah, walked in there as soon as you walk into place you know, it's in the time

[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.520]
I mean, it smells great the garlic is permeating the air

[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:33.320]
Just as we were walking in the door and this may apply to you bird we're here to tremendous crash and a big bird had crashed right into

[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:33.740]
They won't know

[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.580]
Just flying at full speed crash into the window. It was just like lying there on the sidewalks

[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.500]
I said immediately no poultry dishes tonight

[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.600]
But we went in that we wondered

[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:48.680]
And the woman who's in the front all they said yeah, I heard about you from Neil Rogers and the wio

[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:56.500]
Welcome Neil always comes and he loves it, but then we ordered and then we kind of got like reprimanded for not ordering one of their the Neil specials

[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.640]
I mean I ordered like real Parmesan because I didn't know what you would what you had ordered before and I've heard all your

[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:07.120]
Specials when you talk about your specials all the time and the way it goes through the menu and I'm saying what how does Neil order

[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.780]
And I just get it didn't come up and came to mind so we ordered what we ordered and then she came over and we kind of like got

[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.540]
Reprimanded for yeah

[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.920]
That was a first like last night my friends ordered they'd never been there before when they ordered a couple of dishes and they

[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.220]
Matured who's a wonderful guy said nah forget that

[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.020]
I'm gonna bring you this and as it turned out they said it was the best meal I ever had in their life

[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.320]
So much you well, what do you what do you like favorite dish when you go over to start their meal is you know

[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.480]
I hate this baby cow stuff, but their meal is just tremendous and last night

[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.480]
I think it's called Veal cardinale. It's got capers and Muts are all a cheese and it's on a bed of angel hair pasta

[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.060]
And it was just behind peppers tremendous all right

[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:49.020]
That will definitely go there again terrific place. Yeah, I'm glad you enjoyed it got a little quick cable nightmare for you

[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.920]
Watching the Dodgers Houston game the other night the game that went 22 innings. Yeah seven hours

[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.740]
Yeah, it was on the sunshine network and I did we had some friends over

[00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.260]
It would just happen to be out of the background and then everybody left and I was watching just come kept telling myself one more

[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:06.000]
Any one more inning finally got to the 16-winning and her shy's there had been pitching for a couple of innings

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.480]
And it was getting real interesting they cut to a commercial was on the sunshine network

[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.440]
The cultural commercial they come back and there's like the rock and roll report is on they just took the game right off the air in the middle

[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.620]
Oh, yeah, that's nice, huh?

[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.080]
16-th inning they took it right off the air they put on some little kitty video party show and

[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.100]
You know while I'm sitting there like Apple Plectic pulling out the TV guy trying to find their phone number in there

[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.040]
Yeah, if you would have had your satellite dish you'd have seen the entire game. I don't know. Neal

[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:36.960]
It's getting to that point. I don't know if I could take him anymore. Okay. You're talking to you have a good day

phenomenal selection if you're in the market for a super for example, and there's a particular color or style that you're thinking about

[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.020]
They got it over there more likely than not or a camp here

[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.980]
Move over Jane Fonda. It's the Rob Low video workout

I've got it over here 1040 20 before 11 at W I O D

[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.560]
By the way, we got a great record that we ought to dedicate to some of these people who start those false yeah radio rumors

[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.100]
See we like the ones that are true

[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:22.720]
Okay, let's continue with these great calls. I see a couple of people in Broward dropped off already

[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.180]
I told you not to get your hopes up too high early. It's Monday

[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.580]
524 9463 524 W I O D and I'm gonna say it again because I don't want to get the Rob Low intensive again. That's old news

[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:39.740]
But it's nothing to see okay, right nothing to see everybody who sees the tape is so bitterly disappointed

[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.100]
Just forget about it. Okay, find something new and exciting in your life

[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.660]
Anyway, speaking of finding something new and exciting

[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:51.000]
We got to tell that to the newsroom remember Steve last week was correctly fetching about the cloud pepper hysteria

[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.640]
That was on what day was that Wednesday or Thursday

[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.440]
Well here it is Monday

[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.640]
They're slaughtering people in the streets in China the Iatola finally dropped dead

[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.720]
The cubs had six home runs in one game and what's our lead story this morning is I'm coming to work on W I O D

[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.220]
cloud pepper again

[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.400]
Man they're just pepper intensive here

[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:12.940]
Wow

[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.840]
Coconut Grove hello. Yeah, it also include the first place Orioles in that as well. Oh, yeah, that amazing. Yeah

[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.600]
What they went seven in a row now?

[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.100]
Ah

[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.440]
First place but listen back to this morning and I thought that room you had was about sheet not Zeta. Yeah, I read it wrong

[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.280]
Okay, oh you read the yeah, remember I read it or leave it on the Friday and

[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.960]
The spike wise belted them in the head done in the hallway and said you read the damn memo

[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.400]
Yeah, we don't ever do it again

[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.500]
We weren't concerned about it Friday, but then when I heard it again over the weekend

[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.520]
Yeah, pirate Ray. I don't know how Johnny Dolan does it. Oh, so when is this supposed to start now three or four weeks

[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.120]
We're you know

[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:57.640]
Another abortion. Yeah, maybe well, then what we hear is there's a lot of obscure music on pirate radio

[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.940]
So they ought to be able to relate to that the people listen to Zeta. Yeah, yeah, I don't think it's gonna bring

[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.220]
A many bigger numbers and they already have probably not but it'll be cheap see that's why they like these satellite formats

[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.280]
Because they don't have to pay the talent it'll be cheap

[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:15.600]
I'll I think like you do it to seem that they waste a hundred thousand water. Oh, yeah, I mean, you know

[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.980]
I'd love to have that station to make it all talk they could have a six-year on maybe a seven-year on that station the all talk station on FM

[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.640]
Believe me. You're right. I'm willing to go because it's a Monday and I'm sure you got a lot of

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.500]
Oh, we're hot today, man

[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.420]
I'm telling you we're just bursting at the scenes with call today have a

[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.740]
Okay, see you later 1043 a W I do you still air sir? Yeah, hold on. Okay

[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:43.460]
All right, we have one in day one in Broward. That's open line just in case we don't really care on Monday because we're getting used to it

[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.720]
Oh, so we just kind of like pick our own as they say on the renearie show

[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.600]
Just kind of pick your own here for just south

[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:58.140]
Not another one from Detroit. I love how they always go to the same ones. Mm-hmm. Just amazing

[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.940]
God cherry waves every time yeah, I'm doing those shows here's cherry waves. I'd like to

[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.600]
pounding his breast

[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.720]
And telling us all about how talk shows are gonna save the world from itself or we're gonna

[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.100]
We'll solve on in Mike C. Goldie. We're gonna solve the problems of the medical

[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.500]
Props of the league of probation. Oh

[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.220]
God

[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:23.520]
See that's what the public is tired of man. That's why they go for all these ridiculous shows because eat no matter how

[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.040]
Ridiculous it is

[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.540]
At least it's different

[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.560]
That's why it has to become more bizarre all the time because you kind of burn yourself out

[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.560]
You know, yeah, you can only have so many guys who turn out to be women

[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.680]
You know what I'm saying? And then it becomes old

[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.660]
Like he never turned out that George Washington was a woman at this point nobody would care

[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.020]
They'd say oh, well, he had a pretty wig, you know, and uh

[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.160]
What's a big deal? Of course the fact that he slept with Martha that might create some, you know

[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.500]
And then they'll probably be a whole thing on those shows about that

[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.260]
Former presidents who slept with lesbian wives

[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:02.600]
Anyway, it's 1045 at WIOD. It's true sameness man to me is just a killer. It's just disgusting me too

[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.160]
It's when people do the same thing over and over

[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:07.220]
Hahaha

[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.480]
Yeah, I can't stand it

[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.600]
Discusting

[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.880]
Well, I can't believe Disney was in the hallway this morning and walked by with kind of a puzzled look on his face like

[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:25.360]
GM I in the right place and even one of our engineers who usually look it does not speak to me

[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.780]
Diddy I said do I pass him in the hall it was one of those one of those encounters where you just have to say something

[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.760]
Okay, I felt compelled and I said good morning

[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:33.900]
I had no idea.

[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.100]
There was a gutter-ol-sau that came from his throat.

[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:38.520]
I can't.

[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.840]
Now, either he had indigestion.

[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.380]
He had it.

[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.940]
Or he actually said something to me this morning.

[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.760]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.960]
See, he's still cleaning that old Rick Edwards I.N.Z.

[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.540]
Now, he does.

[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:47.780]
He just hates me for that.

[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.980]
I don't know what it is, but he just has never...

[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.260]
Really?

[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.520]
Never gotten over the fact that I wasn't a disciple of the Rick Edwards

[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.240]
who were dealing with Mike Baster the ceiling.

[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.800]
He's got a thing about it.

[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.420]
I don't know what it is.

[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.600]
He'd better get over that.

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.800]
Well, it's kind of fun to have some people in the building who don't speak.

[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.540]
And then, of course, I saw Rick Weaver was in the sports booth there.

[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.400]
You saw him?

[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:06.380]
From...

[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.160]
He's always...

[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.540]
For some reason, when you pass him and he's in that room, his back is always to you.

[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.500]
Is there any special reason for that?

[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.720]
And I noticed when he left that room, he was backing out.

[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.900]
I've heard of backing out in the car.

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.360]
But it's unusual to back out of a room.

[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.800]
But I guess that way you don't...

[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.220]
Well, listen, he's been here long enough.

[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.900]
He probably knows there's a good reason for it.

[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.680]
And Kat Stevens records.

[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.140]
I'm telling you, but the biggest thing about it is,

[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.760]
Jerry Williams is keeping his mouth shut.

[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.140]
Is he? Well, that's unusual.

[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.920]
That is really unusual, but...

[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.860]
Don't get me wrong, Jerry is a great talent on the air.

[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.260]
He's a tremendous talent on the air.

[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.500]
But over and above that, his ego is bigger than the whole state of Massachusetts.

[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.180]
I think that a man is just a monster in his own mind.

[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.740]
But Larry King is being...

[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.900]
Well, he's not...

[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.800]
Did he brush his teeth this morning as he still got that killer breath?

[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.480]
Yeah, they kind of look kind of purple to me.

[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.620]
Yeah, wait until he asks Charaldo to cash a check toward the end of the show.

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.100]
Yeah.

[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.720]
That's when they're going to start the fist fight.

[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.100]
In fact, Jerry Williams has been on a couple of shows where they had fist fights, too.

[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:04.580]
Really?

[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.340]
So I have a feeling, is that show still on?

[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:06.800]
Yes.

[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.220]
Oh, yeah, wait until the last five minutes and Larry King is going to whip out a checkbook

[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:14.520]
and he's going to write a check out to Heraldo, who's going to look at it.

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.840]
And then Larry's going to breathe too close to him with that bad breath he had on.

[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.240]
And Heraldo is going to start getting dizzy and start to pass out.

[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.080]
And then somebody...

[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.080]
Williams, the probably runner, was saying,

[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.560]
I know this, and he's going to bounce the check off the floor.

[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.340]
It'll bounce like a rubber ball and then it'll all start like a big brawl.

[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.860]
Like in the Cubs game yesterday with Mark Grayson, Frank DePino.

[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:30.660]
Absolutely.

[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.900]
Hey, Dunston with two homeruns?

[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.660]
Yeah, and Mitch Webster with two and two days.

[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.660]
This must be for Reo.

[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.900]
I hate that one.

[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:40.260]
And here, right in the middle of this incredibly important...

[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:40.960]
Yeah, it is his question.

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.060]
We had six hundred of her yesterday.

[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.560]
However, well, who we have a bullet in pitch to complete game?

[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.820]
Oh, is it about Claude Pumper?

[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.180]
No.

[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.660]
Radio highlights in the sunset and all four of your stand by.

[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.420]
You're on the phone for a...

[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.720]
Oh, God.

[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:54.700]
Oh!

[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:55.760]
I told you.

[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.040]
Oh, all of a sudden my stomach is churning.

[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.200]
My appetite may be in question today.

[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.060]
Who the founder?

[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.520]
Go topic. Are you ready, sir?

[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.120]
Let's go.

[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.680]
Florida's mandatory helmet law with motorcycle enthusiast Rick Ciderman.

[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.460]
Rick Ciderman, Mr. X.

[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.540]
Who only drives on the extreme right hand side of the road.

[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.300]
He is a douchebag.

[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.140]
Oh, boy.

[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.480]
He's another one of Steve's slime ball surrogates.

[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.340]
Yeah, I know.

[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.660]
Well, listen, have a great day, pal.

[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.680]
You've been quite an addition to the show.

[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.160]
Okay, Neil.

[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:23.860]
See ya.

[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.020]
Bye.

[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.380]
1049 at WIVD.

[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.500]
Actually, these people are pretty decent today.

[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.080]
They've been okay.

[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:29.560]
Have a name.

[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.780]
For a Monday.

[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.200]
Yeah.

[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.960]
And far so good.

[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.420]
They've been pretty interesting.

[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.120]
Well, I guess it's a double-bawoyal day holiday.

[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.060]
You know, something just hit me at Calder Saturday for the first time ever.

[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.900]
The green sheet.

[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.960]
Which when we go out there Thursday, or not green.

[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:42.880]
It isn't green.

[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.320]
No, it isn't.

[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.480]
It's a pip sheet, but they call it a green sheet.

[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.420]
Anyway, one of the pickers.

[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.880]
There's like four different pickers.

[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.240]
This is one of the pickers named, and it's been in there.

[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.680]
I don't know who these people are, but his name is Harvey Jr.

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.420]
And Harvey Jr. is not one of my favorites.

[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:56.800]
I don't know.

[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.340]
I never pay any attention to his picks.

[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.220]
He's a wonderful guy.

[00:33:59.300 --> 00:33:59.580]
I'm curious.

[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.960]
And then a dawn on me, this is Paul Harvey Jr.

[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.160]
Is pickin' on the green sheet?

[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.800]
I thought it was the guy from Kendo.

[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.440]
Or is that Harvey of Kendo.

[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.980]
Harvey from Kendo.

[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.820]
See how he's got that, oh, I don't know because we haven't heard from him in a while.

[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.680]
In fact, he was like Donna in reverse.

[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.680]
remember for years he was ripping us then all of a sudden he made that big turn

[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.720]
around here a while ago.

[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.340]
Big turn.

[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.100]
Sonnest that sucking around.

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:26.400]
Of course now he probably hates us again, but you never know with Harvey of

[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:26.780]
Kendall.

[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.000]
As opposed to Harvey from Kendall.

[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.360]
Maybe not be the same person.

[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.540]
Anyways, it's time to talk about the salvos and that's good because we're picking

[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.840]
our lunch for Thursday now.

[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.120]
Now what would you like on Thursday?

[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.260]
I don't care.

[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:42.680]
But you know my favorite thing at the salvos is the pizza.

[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.660]
So maybe pizza.

[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.640]
Yeah, let's get a pizza.

[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.260]
I haven't had pizza in a while.

[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.580]
Yeah, with what?

[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.080]
I'll circle the toppings.

[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:49.480]
Okay.

[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.180]
Not that in a matter.

[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:57.900]
We'll get a large with sausage, onions and black olives on it.

[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.640]
I know how to put together a pot.

[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.400]
I know.

[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.620]
And I'm going to get the sausage Parmesan sub.

[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.240]
That just sounds good to me.

[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.300]
I'm in the mood for that right now.

[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.260]
Now Fat Rich will be here on Thursday too.

[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.340]
He had a call in on the bat line if we can do that before the end of the spot.

[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.180]
If you love good family style Italian food, you're going to love the salvos pizza and Italian restaurants.

[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.760]
And I say plural because there are now three locations.

[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.800]
They're in Hollywood, Davie and a brand new one.

[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.900]
And boy, we're kissing the ground.

[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.120]
We're having celebrations daily that they're in plantation right in front of my old favorite

[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.640]
Windixi there at the corner of sunrise and Pine Island roads.

[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.540]
And for lunch or dinner, you can't beat it because they've got delicious food.

[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.380]
Everything is fresh.

[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.420]
They're pizza out of this world.

[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.680]
Some of the best pizza in town.

[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.040]
And the good news is they give you humongous portions.

[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.100]
Boy, they give you enough food for the Chinese army.

[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.120]
This isn't a good week to say that.

[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.720]
They give you enough food for the Lithuanian army.

[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.020]
So when you're hungry and you're really jones for some good inexpensive family style Italian food,

[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:57.080]
the salvos is open Monday through Thursday, 11 to 11 Friday and Saturday, late till midnight.

[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.220]
And every Sunday from 1 to 10 p.m.

[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.860]
Here are those three locations again in Hollywood right across the street from Toyota of Hollywood

[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:09.080]
between Taft and Sheridan on 441 in Davie on the corner of Sterling and University in a table supply shopping center.

[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:14.180]
And of course that newest one in plantation and we are excited and proud to have the salvos in our humble town

[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:17.060]
on Pine Island and sunrise at Jacaranda Square.

[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.640]
1053 at WIOD.

[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.920]
Wouldn't you know a little late here on the bat line?

[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.940]
Well, sorry about that.

[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.780]
Bat Rich making his order for Thursday from the salvos.

[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.880]
I think I need to be on the straight and narrow.

[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.720]
In other words, what that means is you're going to suck around for all the other things.

[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.100]
Exactly. I'll lend this taken measurements in two weeks.

[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.660]
I've got to make a showing here.

[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:42.920]
Well, good luck to you.

[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.840]
Okay, let me look on here now for the salads.

[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.860]
Well, I guess I can probably find it myself.

[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:49.780]
All right.

[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.140]
All right, I don't do it.

[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:51.720]
You're sure?

[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.340]
Oh, here it is, little antipasto for Slim Rich.

[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.180]
And a little...

[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.220]
Oh, a little baked tea.

[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:57.240]
Oh, a little baked tea.

[00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.620]
Oh, okay.

[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.220]
All right, I'll catch you later.

[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.060]
Okay, see you.

[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.180]
Okay, there he is.

[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.820]
A real comedian.

[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.100]
A real comedian.

[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.440]
Let's see, pasta dinners.

[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.720]
Here we go with the baked tea.

[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.500]
Oh, a Sicilian with...

[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.820]
I should have asked him.

[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.100]
We'll just get the regular for Bat Rich.

[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.400]
He doesn't need that eggplant because it's no calories.

[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.180]
1054 at WIOD.

[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.180]
What was I just going to do for him?

[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:19.860]
You're going to have a record.

[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.800]
I haven't heard an ad.

[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.180]
Uh-oh.

[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.460]
It's, uh, yeah.

[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.000]
Hamlet?

[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:31.900]
No, it's...

[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.160]
Hamlet, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:33.580]
It isn't.

[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:33.860]
It's...

[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.440]
Frank and Reynolds?

[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:34.960]
No.

[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:35.540]
No.

[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.660]
I wonder what she's doing tonight?

[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:41.800]
By Tommy Boyce.

[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:42.320]
Wow.

[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.080]
And Bobby Hart.

[00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:43.660]
You were right.

[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.480]
I haven't heard it in over 10 years.

[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.100]
Hi, Alia.

[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.200]
Good morning, gentlemen.

[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:47.860]
When is this?

[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.120]
This and before we...

[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.120]

[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.600]
We bore the bird here a second.

[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.540]
Listen, uh, bird.

[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.760]
What? You bore me?

[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.480]
What? What?

[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.060]
I come in, I'm watching the SPN.

[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.620]
With the tennis that's going on.

[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.600]
Well, we're a little preoccupied here, sir.

[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.680]
I know it's hard to believe.

[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.500]
Maybe you saw Mary Jo yesterday when?

[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.520]
No, I didn't know.

[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.460]
I just asked me during the break how did Gabby do it

[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.460]
when I broke the news to him.

[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.000]
He started to hallucinate it.

[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.960]
I just looked it up and my heart sunk.

[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.080]
Okay, now we can get away from that.

[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.960]
And then come up to something else, honey.

[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.360]
Yeah, you can say that again.

[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.440]
You know, if you look at Zimmer every time the...

[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.020]
The wild man comes in the pitch.

[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.140]
It looks like after every pitch he's ready to go have some diarrhea

[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.280]
or something because he just makes you too nervous

[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.500]
to watch this guy throw the ball.

[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.880]
Go have some diarrhea, boy.

[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.280]
I never really thought about it

[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.760]
in quite those terms before, you know.

[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.820]
But the guy is nerve-racking to watch him pitch.

[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.120]
You're afraid that he's going to hit...

[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.460]
Well, what day are you talking about?

[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.120]
On Friday, he struck out the side.

[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.540]
Right.

[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.880]
But did he pitch Saturday?

[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.160]
Uh, I think he came in to clean up, yeah.

[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.420]
Did he mean to clean up?

[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:43.860]
They lost the game in the tenth inning.

[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.160]
But the thing is just not...

[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:45.560]
He knows.

[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.420]
When they bring him in,

[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.560]
is any time they bring him in, you look at him,

[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.460]
and he just looks...

[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.640]
Poppies. Yeah, his eyes start popping out of his head.

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.040]
And, you know, the way he throws the ball,

[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.500]
it looks like he's going to knock the hell out of him.

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.040]
Well, I love...

[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:56.940]
I still love on our...

[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.060]
On this station, those sports talk people with all their great sports writers

[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.680]
from the Harold and the Sun sentle keep saying,

[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.360]
oh, that bitch Williams, you know, a couple of saves,

[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.300]
he'll never save another game.

[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.400]
That was like back in the first week of the season.

[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.620]
He's now got 14 saves, and he's just beyond belief.

[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.740]
He's getting the job done.

[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.220]
Yeah.

[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.400]
And the Yankees, you know, they're so pathetic.

[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.440]
They're so glad to see Dion Sanders, you know,

[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.220]
he'll bring any kind of...

[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.600]
They were thinking of signing up Dion de Mucci as a matter of fact.

[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.280]
They called here and asked if we knew his address in Boka.

[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.360]
Oh, no.

[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.800]
But, you know, the couple are doing good,

[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.560]
and let's just hope they can...

[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.460]
Yeah, let's hope they just win four and a row from the Metz

[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.460]
to make it a nice clean memory.

[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.740]
That's right. That's all they need.

[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.180]
Okay.

[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:35.660]
I...

[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.380]
I...

[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:36.740]
I...

[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.000]
We appreciate Steve Stancell over next to our GTR

[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.520]
and all that good stuff that he did for us.

[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.400]
However, I will say...

[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.000]
That we're regressing back to the old...

[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.540]
Good old days.

[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.400]
Blaring.

[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:45.760]
You hear that?

[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.260]
Something?

[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:46.960]
Something.

[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.040]
I was kind of glad during that last call I didn't complain.

[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:50.820]
But now...

[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.280]
I wasn't even listening to Caller at all.

[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.320]
Newstalk Radio 610.

[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.500]

The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.820]
Now, here's Neo Rogers.

[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.940]
On Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.600]
Hi, I'm Ed Buford, a Buford gang son.

[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:24.960]
And so...

[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:25.600]
Let's go and guns.

[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.980]
We have the largest selection of blues and firearms in the state and will personally assist you

[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.360]
in choosing the correct alcoholic beverage and weapons for your next outing.

[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.320]
Going squirrel hunting?

[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.180]
Then you'll love our low prices on snaps and hang grenades.

[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.660]
Let it in the city.

[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.140]
Check out our deal on handguns at California 1.

[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.140]
Maybe you aren't interested in hunting or self-defense.

[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.640]
Maybe you just like to get drunk and shoot a mailbox.

[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:53.200]
Well, we've got gallon jubs of wild turkey and 44 magnum shells on sale this week only.

[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.520]
We're open 24 hours.

[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.740]
We never check IDs and we're LRA approved.

[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.220]
So come on down to Buford gang son.

[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.880]
Licker and guns, where everything leans loaded.

[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.460]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.640]
Do we have all this stuff already?

[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.680]
On CD?

[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.760]
Oh, that's me.

[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.160]
What's going on here today?

[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.200]
I mean, not that I want to sound unappreciative, but we've got all this stuff already.

[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.260]
And they're putting it on cart.

[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.360]
Well, I guess it sounds better on cart than on CD, yeah?

[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.840]
Some world of normal FWD on court.

[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.480]
Anyway, it's 1107 at WIOD.

[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:29.120]
We have a very famous celebrity handicaprer from the racetracks all over South Florida on the phone now.

[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:33.160]
First off, speaking of Muffel, Claude got a little clammy by now, doesn't he?

[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.640]
So I think that's a disgusting comment.

[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.160]
Listen, I know about as much water, not with chlorox.

[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.260]
I know about as much about horse racing as Glenn does.

[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.760]
Oh, yeah, I've seen your picks.

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.460]
And I've got to ask you a question.

[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.400]
Every morning I ride past Calder on the turnpike and I see them training.

[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:00.200]
And of course, there are most of the time they're training around the track counterclockwise.

[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.520]
But everyone's so loud you see them switching go the other way.

[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.460]
Why did they do that?

[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.360]
Some of them go the other way.

[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.800]
Now this is a question, yeah.

[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.880]
Paul Harvey never lets me down.

[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.640]
I will be out there Saturday the 24th.

[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.480]
I have to tell you that. Glenn will be there, won't he?

[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:19.200]
Yeah.

[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.020]
All right.

[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:20.820]
Wow.

[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.760]
Miss Fryd aspect, there doesn't know it yet, but absolutely.

[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.320]
He will be there and he will be paid for his performance, too.

[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:26.960]
Good for you.

[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.460]
So I just want to make sure she's aware of that because she has a tendency not to communicate.

[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:37.680]
She's the toughest person in the building to set a date for remote for next to Captain BM.

[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.360]
Should you want, I'm sorry, I'm stepping over you.

[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.820]
Should I bring my scooper with me?

[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:42.920]
Scooper.

[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.860]
No, the guy with the dog will not be permitted.

[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:45.400]
Believe me.

[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:45.840]
Okay.

[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.740]
Is there anything we should look for?

[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.880]
We're going to bring us some special Mongolian bodyguards out there on that Saturday.

[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:53.400]
Mongolia?

[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.720]
We miss you, Boats or us, Paul.

[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.820]
You know, I was on that muscular or multiple.

[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.600]
Oh, that's right.

[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.040]
You went on that bike ride that we did.

[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.080]
Yeah, I did another one yesterday for the Alonga Association, a hundred miles.

[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.520]
You want to talk about feeling like, mulled.

[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:05.860]
Wow.

[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.760]
We knew there was a logical explanation.

[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:09.480]
Yeah.

[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.520]
Otherwise, I had to driven all the way down there from Boca Routon.

[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.260]
Bells.

[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.720]
And there's Clockier Abe.

[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:16.680]
Clockier.

[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.000]
Clockier Abe's pretty sharp.

[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:19.940]
K Wells is good, though.

[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.940]
She sometimes picks those long shots, boy.

[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.260]
She's got some real courage.

[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.020]
And who else is on there?

[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.080]
There's one track man.

[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.460]
I don't know who...

[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.320]
See, they've all got names.

[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.020]
It's like Mike Melody and Johnny Dark and all these other phony names.

[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.460]
Track man.

[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.440]
I'll tell you who does a great job.

[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.040]
Is a guy who makes the graded line in there.

[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.040]
Is that Bob Savage's son.

[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.460]
Does that?

[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.840]
He does a tremendous job.

[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:45.640]
He really does.

[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.000]
He's good.

[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.580]
Very often, I don't pay any attention to that because your ego gets in a way.

[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.220]
That's why Steve went out there on Saturday.

[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.060]
But no, seriously, sometimes your ego gets in a way.

[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.400]
You figure, well, I'm not going to...

[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.260]
Yeah, I'm not going to just bet on somebody else's picks.

[00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.700]
I'm going to study the forum and scope it out myself.

[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.960]
And so often, you see that they really have their stuff together in the green sheet.

[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.380]
So if you go out to Calder today, there'll be no losers in the green sheet.

[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.300]
That's because there are no races today or tomorrow.

[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:10.580]
Yeah.

[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.440]
But boy, they have done just a...

[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.240]
I can't get over it.

[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.000]
Beautiful, beautiful job on that fourth floor in a clubhouse.

[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.580]
I didn't get a chance to get around the rest of the track as a check out any other changes.

[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.420]
But boy, they have just made that polatial up there.

[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.100]
Great.

[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:25.720]
Phenomenal.

[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.940]
Anyway, the reason that they're blasting over a GTR, their air conditioning is out today.

[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:30.560]
Isn't that a shame?

[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:32.380]
What?

[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.420]
It sure breaks my heart.

[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.220]
So they have the doors open and as a result, that bass is just pounding through the walls.

[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.840]
Just blasting through the hallways.

[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.340]
What are they playing? Some CCR?

[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.620]
I don't know.

[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.220]
Anyway, if you're in plant trees...

[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:46.780]
Yeah.

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.960]
Up, please.

[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.600]
And up, you high on feet.

[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.120]
11-13 at WIDI.

[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.020]
Apologized.

[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.840]
I had a little accident here.

[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.940]
We had a CD that slipped there and hit the button.

[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.440]
So you heard a little mumbling there.

[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.360]
But it kind of fits in.

[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.240]
Because the big story continues to be Claude Pepper.

[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.280]
It sounded like him.

[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:08.340]
We're taking up an office pool to see which newscast it finally will be on which day

[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.460]
that Claude Pepper is not the lead story on the news.

[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.640]
And I don't think it's disrespectful at all.

[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.600]
I mean, Steve was right.

[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.980]
The guy was one congressman out of 465 or 435, whatever the hell it is.

[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.240]
And he was 88 years old.

[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.580]
It's not like it was some great shock.

[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.200]
And he'd been sick for weeks.

[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.140]
He had a great life.

[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:27.600]
Yeah.

[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.440]
He lived a long, full life.

[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.880]
And they're rioting in China.

[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.260]
And they're slaughtering him in the streets.

[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.920]
And the Iatola just dropped dead.

[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.340]
And God only knows what's going to happen over there.

[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.380]
And like I said, it comes at six home lines at one game.

[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.060]
And we're talking, we're talking a China with Claude Pepper again.

[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.180]
I mean, let's give it a rest already.

[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:49.180]
OK, let the guy rest in peace for crying out loud if they don't.

[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.520]
Sooner or later they got to put that body in a ground.

[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.060]
You know what I mean?

[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:52.920]
Today.

[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.280]
Oh man, it's got to be getting through the little rank.

[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.080]
Is that by now?

[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.500]
I don't think they've ever schlepped anybody's body around like this.

[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:01.060]
Have they?

[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.740]
Not Kennedy.

[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:05.700]
Now he just, he was in Washington.

[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:06.400]
That was it.

[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.120]
I'm trying to think.

[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.760]
Even when Tody Fields died, I didn't schlepper around like this.

[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.160]
It's 1114 at WIOD.

[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.220]
Let's go to Hialeah.

[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:16.500]
Hello.

[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:17.880]
Hey, Neil Aguilin. How's it going?

[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:18.240]
Great.

[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:24.360]
This thing with Claude Pepper kind of reminds you way back on Saturday night live when Chemi Chase used to do the news.

[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.500]
You know, Francisco Franco is still dead.

[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.120]
And for months it went on.

[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.840]
And that's going to be this way with Claude Pepper too.

[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.200]
It looks like.

[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.520]
Wouldn't it be something if they were, you know, doing this motorcade thing and they had the coffin open?

[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.320]
And all of a sudden he started like sitting up in the thing.

[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.240]
Wouldn't that be incredible?

[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.960]
I don't want to think about it.

[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.420]
You may not believe it, but I think Penny Daniels is going to have that inside story tonight on Channel 7.

[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.400]
I'll be watching.

[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:50.260]
In fact, you know all the talk about Elvis and that they say it was a wax dummy?

[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.400]
I think Claude is still alive.

[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.960]
Well, my people always thought Claude was a wax dummy anyway.

[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:56.580]
Yeah.

[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.680]
I was not going to question for you.

[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.460]
He's just as alive as he has been last 20 years, isn't he?

[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:02.100]
I guess.

[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.180]
Well, he's a lot of good things in Ripham.

[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.880]
No, it's not a Rip, but I mean, the guy's like was 88 years old.

[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.520]
Even my loan already.

[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:10.360]
It's just time, I guess.

[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.600]
Hey, was I had a question?

[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:13.160]
Okay.

[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.160]
Back on Zannie, you played a record from the casino.

[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.080]
Really great song.

[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.360]
Then you can tell me goodbye.

[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:19.780]
Can you play there?

[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.460]
Oh, Jesus, expect me to find that now.

[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.780]
Well, you know, sometimes today.

[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.220]
I sometimes today, but you don't understand.

[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.060]
They still have most of my CDs over there.

[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.720]
It would only, I could only play it if I had one of these CDs over there.

[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:30.760]
Wait a minute.

[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.220]
I've seen that.

[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.820]
Just decided a big deal about it over there when we played it.

[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.120]
Remember?

[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.320]
Yeah, I'll have to dig through all my CDs.

[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.740]
No, you really made some serious work, but I'll dig it up.

[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.160]
You can do it.

[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.260]
You played on Zatobruc's a Scratiol record.

[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.700]
You didn't have it on CDO over there.

[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:43.600]
Really?

[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.080]
Yeah.

[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:44.740]
We didn't.

[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.520]
So I don't have any Scratiol record.

[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:46.960]
It's dark.

[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.480]
Now, I'm sure it's on CDs somewhere.

[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.220]
If I don't have it on CDO.

[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:50.420]
It is.

[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:51.180]
What?

[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.020]
I think it is.

[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:52.680]
Oh, I know it is.

[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.920]
It's on that oldies.

[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.040]
It's on these.

[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.180]
The oldies Bacutei series.

[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:57.880]
I remember.

[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.520]
On Sounded in Crata of Label is this.

[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.200]
Original Sound Entertainment.

[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.600]
What a great label that is.

[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.120]
But anyway, I'll find it.

[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.200]
I've always been the reason I caught it.

[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:07.960]
I got a spirited work.

[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.300]
It's about to do with Greg B. Dale.

[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.120]
There's something going on with this marriage, I think.

[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.360]
He and his wife got a big argument this weekend.

[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.040]
He has to do something.

[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:18.720]
I think I had to come to him with a posture, something like that,

[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.480]
because he came home and she had noodles in her mouth.

[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.340]
Oh, boy.

[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.060]
Nice job.

[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:24.700]
Have a great day.

[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.840]
I like that joke.

[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.700]
That was the cute one.

[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:26.980]

[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:29.620]
Oh, God.

[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.300]
Five Americans.

[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.780]
One six ten.

[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:36.980]
One pirate.

[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.040]
Oh, okay.

[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:38.640]
Yeah.

[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.860]
But it was a...

[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.020]
Let's stick with English, sir, okay?

[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:43.500]
Yeah.

[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.260]
Don't talk me a Chinese with all these Chinese words now.

[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.920]
Yeah, you're the best kid.

[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:49.560]
I know it.

[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.480]
I'm no Larry King, though, because I brush my teeth every day.

[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.440]
No, I listen to Jerry.

[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:53.920]
Jerry?

[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.680]
Jerry is a tremendous talent.

[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.840]
He's a question about it.

[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.560]
He's kind of a pompous ass, but he's a great guy.

[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:00.520]
Great guy.

[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.160]
Well, I know he's a noble friend.

[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:02.640]
I've been to yours.

[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.620]
Well, yeah.

[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.140]
I listen to your show every morning.

[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.160]
And lo and behold, you mentioned Gerardo, so...

[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.180]
Gerardo, yeah.

[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.680]
So I'm not a listener, it's hacker.

[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.580]
Well, there you go.

[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.560]
See, I'm giving him a policy.

[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.420]
I want my cut.

[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.000]
I want my share now.

[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.220]
Did they have a fist fight on the show or not?

[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:22.820]
No.

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.680]
That's disappointing.

[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.000]
Very nice, but he's the Jerry's full of the show.

[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:27.540]
Yeah.

[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.540]
Well, he stands heads and shoulders above the other fakers

[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.360]
that were on that show.

[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:31.840]
That's right.

[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:32.700]
Trust me.

[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.520]
You better believe it.

[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.500]
Okay, have a great life.

[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:34.940]
You too.

[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.220]
As they say in the Chinese riots, I go on.

[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:38.240]
Oh, okay.

[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.340]
1119 at WIOD.

[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.300]
You're all hit.

[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.220]
Music.

[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.960]
Oh, I forgot which one I put in there.

[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.240]
It starts cold and I'm talking.

[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.040]
Oh, boy.

[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:47.680]
Yeah.

[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.160]
Wow, I'm forget to get out that cart.

[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.860]
We're going to have to get out that rookie tiki cart.

[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.940]
By the way, do you hear what Ranieri did to Janie Merkins this morning?

[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:57.540]
Oh, you're...

[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.440]
Mr. Arnalys here?

[00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.620]
Mr. Arnalys here.

[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.680]
Now, great boy.

[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.960]
I'm so in the mood for those little burgers, boy.

[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.060]
Is that Mr. Arnalys?

[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.100]
This would do it for me.

[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:05.740]
Hmm.

[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.760]
You went into that other room.

[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.280]
I don't know what he's doing in there.

[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:09.840]
What?

[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:12.060]
You know, maybe he's getting the guided tour in the new product.

[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.780]
By the way, speaking of the other room, today is the fifth of June.

[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:16.200]
Yeah.

[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:16.880]
There he is.

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.420]
Look at this.

[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.380]
This is like heaven in a box.

[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.080]
Okay.

[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.100]
What did you find in that?

[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:21.700]
Heaven in a box.

[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.900]
Anything interesting in there?

[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.520]
No, I was looking for Roger.

[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.540]
He's giving his three.

[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.500]
Looking for Roger.

[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:27.620]
Oh, he'll get him.

[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.400]
Don't have no fear.

[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.940]
Roger, get taken care of.

[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.160]
I didn't bring you a soda, but I brought you ice.

[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.180]
Oh, thank you.

[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.100]
That's what we just love the ice.

[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:36.260]
That's what it's all about.

[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.340]
Thank you so much.

[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.340]
You know, everybody I know, they are...

[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:41.880]
Oh, great.

[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.460]
Well, let me recommend personally the bacon cheeseburgers.

[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.180]
These are the best in the history of mankind.

[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.420]
I really like those.

[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:47.780]
Great.

[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.700]
Yeah, because everybody I know tells me they're stopping by your place now.

[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.920]
So, obviously, you're pretty good at retiring about a week.

[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.140]
Thanks, a million Wayne.

[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:57.620]
Oh, this is great.

[00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.180]
Hi, Henry.

[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.340]
Where are you?

[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.040]
Here's a bacon cheeseburger just because you're such a wonderful drunk.

[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.300]
Okay, it's 21 past 11 at WIDs.

[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.520]
Roger, hi, not any workers.

[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:07.680]
We got that personal eye.

[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.220]
Roger gets his own personal bag.

[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.040]
How do you like that?

[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.000]
And we get our cups of ice.

[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.860]
Oh, this is terrific.

[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.100]
Okay, and everybody on the phone has been so good today.

[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.080]
Good morning, good morning.

[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.320]
Whatever, and it's not that far off.

[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.080]
Not only a month and a half away.

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.140]
Well, Ricky's so upset.

[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.480]
Well, whenever the weather gets like this, you know, footballs would always come to my mind.

[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.080]
Yeah, when you go to the other day about Eric Cammaro.

[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:36.980]
Oh, they do have the little bacon cheeseburgers at Arnold's Royal Castle.

[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.760]
So, when you go in there, there they come.

[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:39.160]
Great.

[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:40.660]
Hmm.

[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.240]
I don't know what's in the box, but please help themselves.

[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:44.600]
Okay.

[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.760]
Is there more in the box?

[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.200]
Oh, God, he just went nuts today, didn't he?

[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.140]
There's a whole box of them?

[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:53.220]
Well, great.

[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.140]
Let's see, what day is today, Monday?

[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:59.460]
Well, why don't you take that box to the newsroom, and maybe that'll cut down on.

[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.560]
Oh, God's not here today.

[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:07.060]
Sure, it's out with Andy working.

[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.060]
Oh, working.

[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:09.340]
I thought maybe they're out playing golf.

[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.740]
Today coming their golf shirts today.

[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.180]
Henry's going to a wine tasting, but Henry was in here briefly just in time.

[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:15.800]
I'm surprised.

[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.200]
Cleans his palate with one of these burgers before he goes off.

[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.440]
What does that mean, Georgia?

[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.060]
What is that?

[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.380]
Hello?

[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:23.540]
Yeah.

[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:24.600]
Yeah.

[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.280]
Hello.

[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:26.880]
Hello.

[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:27.780]
Let me say it again.

[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:28.040]
Yeah.

[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:28.540]
Neil.

[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:28.980]
Yeah.

[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.320]
Is this Scottam in Georgia right now?

[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.440]
Well, that's your problem, Scott.

[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.880]
Well, hey, we just got down from Geneva, New York.

[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:35.740]
Great.

[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.220]
We were talking to a good buddy of yours up there.

[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.420]
You're hitting all the high spots.

[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.500]
Oh, you're hitting all the high spots.

[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.220]
I was wondering, I know it's a big deal.

[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.420]
Can you possibly come here and hold for the lightning, man?

[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.360]
You were talking to a buddy of mine up there?

[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:46.980]
Yeah.

[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:47.740]
Who's that?

[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.160]
Oh, Chris.

[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:50.980]
What's that guy's name?

[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.200]
We talked to you, Neil.

[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.040]
From Boston.

[00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.820]
Obviously made it to the middle of the fresh.

[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:00.320]
What?

[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.200]
Oh, it's great radio because we're eating.

[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.280]
Hey, Norm Nathan.

[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.780]
Norm, never heard of him.

[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.580]
Never heard of him, huh?

[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.460]
He does a talk show at Boston.

[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.800]
He does a talk show?

[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:10.840]
He does a talk show.

[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:11.240]
Yeah.

[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.560]
No, I'll never heard of him.

[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.620]
You're a big star up there.

[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.420]
Yeah, I know.

[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.980]
Too bad I can't do it here.

[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.720]
Well, I think he used to work for a while.

[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.460]
He used to work for a 180 WHAM in Rochester.

[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:20.800]
No, come on.

[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:21.980]
Get out of here.

[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.580]
That was Bob Turner used to work for WHAM.

[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.980]
Okay, well listen, I'm going to put you guys on hold

[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:28.500]
because you're we're paying for it, right?

[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:29.220]
Right, indeed.

[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.360]
Okay, well, let's start to run up a hell of a good bill.

[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:31.820]
That's good.

[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:32.240]
Hey, bird.

[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:33.280]
What?

[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.060]
What's happening?

[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.720]
He's busy eating now and he thinks you're disturbing him.

[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.760]
Okay, just had a very perturbed look on his face like,

[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.380]
I could ask the bird one question.

[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:40.540]
Yeah.

[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.760]
What's the deal with our cineohol?

[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:43.800]
What about him?

[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.860]
Well, why is he so hot?

[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.480]
The guy's the lame of conscious, isn't it?

[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:46.920]
That's right.

[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.720]
He's got no talent and he looks like he just came off a spaceship for Mars.

[00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.080]
Well, he's different, you know?

[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:53.420]
Yeah.

[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:55.800]
We don't have too many other Martian talk show hosts.

[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.480]
Exactly.

[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:57.780]
Okay, hold on.

[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.560]
Don't go away and I'll come back to you time every once in a while.

[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.460]
Ask a few questions.

[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:02.480]
It's the old story.

[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.260]
He's different.

[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.080]
Yeah.

[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:04.960]
I'd say that again.

[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.300]
I haven't seen the show that many times.

[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.040]
I like that one big guy in the middle of his forehead.

[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.220]
It's 24 past 11 at WIOD.

[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.200]
Over the years.

[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.200]
1126 at WIOD.

[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.860]
Steve today with the couple of Catholic priests who are going to get into a little tiff.

[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:23.800]
Oh, good.

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:28.580]
And Father Patrick Gosset and Father Joseph Francis Collins.

[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.800]
And they both say the other one is full of crap, okay?

[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.120]
Which is all you need on the steep can show a couple of guys who are, say, the other guy is full of crap.

[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.360]
And generally you get a little bit of religion in there and a lot of good hatred.

[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.240]
And we got a good contrived controversy.

[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.700]
And that's what's coming up from two to six.

[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:48.360]
And then after sports talk tonight with a host to be announced, it says no writer.

[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.060]
Well, sports talk.

[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.720]
It says Cain's baseball tonight from the college world series in Omaha 810.

[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.500]
The Hurricanes in Texas.

[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.540]
Well, I'm not doing the show.

[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.360]
And oh, you're not going to do sports talk tonight.

[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.100]
They may have.

[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:03.280]
I think you get a big audience.

[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.220]
Lays their time.

[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:06.440]
So Alex Fernandez is going to pitch for Miami tonight.

[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.660]
So that would be a real incredible ballgame.

[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:16.120]
810 tonight exclusively on 610 WIOD in spite of what they say on some of the other sports station.

[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.240]
That's right.

[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.440]
I can't believe I was so rude to Ed Camplin on Saturday.

[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:21.380]
I have to apologize.

[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:22.440]
And I didn't recognize me.

[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:24.460]
He said, do you remember me?

[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.120]
And I, you know, I don't like to say no.

[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.380]
What do you do when somebody says that no?

[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.360]
Well, I thought he was just some schlep listener.

[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.060]
And he sat down for a minute and he was, you know, trying to be friendly.

[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:38.640]
And I was very not rude but distant, you know, because I want to be left to hell alone.

[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.760]
I'm sitting out there on the roof card.

[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.040]
And then when he left, I thought that said Camplin is a good guy.

[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:43.780]
Yeah.

[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:44.800]
They sound good.

[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.080]
He sounds good.

[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:46.600]
He does.

[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.560]
In fact, there's sports over there is picking up all the time.

[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.100]
I don't want to get anybody paranoid in the building here.

[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.440]
But there's sports sounding better and better.

[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:58.160]
And they talk about more than just the anchies or the mets or the dolphins.

[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.600]
I know that's pretty unorthodox in this town.

[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.840]
Even on the beach that's unorthodox.

[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.040]
Well, this is the time of the year when you wish you were Hussi Dick.

[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:07.380]
Don't you?

[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:11.700]
When you could be wearing 700 pounds of clothing, have your hair down to your pupic,

[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.100]
and wear a nice big hat over there on the beach.

[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.100]
Don't you wish that?

[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:15.580]
What's in there?

[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:16.420]
Ice.

[00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:16.840]
Ice.

[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:17.920]
Oh, this ice is great.

[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:20.920]
Got an under control.

[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:21.420]
Yeah.

[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.640]
Everything's real mellow and there's no bad air.

[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.320]
And what's your bag?

[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.700]
And what's your bag is here with your name on it?

[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.080]
Your name's on it.

[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.480]
Your three plain, whatever it is.

[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:30.780]
Wilton Manor.

[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.040]
Hello.

[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.680]
There's your cool castration.

[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:33.760]
Huh?

[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:34.540]
Hello.

[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.620]
What do you say, sir?

[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:36.660]
About castration?

[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:37.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.000]
Sally.

[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:42.020]
Right now on the Sally Jesse Raphael, she'll speak about the ball game.

[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.360]
They've got a real mixed bag on there.

[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.700]
They're talking about surgical castration.

[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:46.520]
Really?

[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:46.920]
Yeah.

[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.080]
For repeated sex offenders.

[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.140]
Oh, great.

[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.000]
They got some real psychotic doctors there.

[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:52.640]
Is Sally going to be the first volunteer?

[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.660]
She keeps talking about it.

[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:58.400]
She says, man, you know, so you get this guy and he's a repeated sex offender.

[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.340]
And you cut his, and you fill in the rest because I don't talk like that.

[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:01.720]
Yeah.

[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.340]
But you know she's thinking like that.

[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.100]
No, she's thinking about it all the time.

[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.060]
That's why she wears those funny glasses.

[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.700]
Oh, it's unbelievable.

[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.120]
Yeah.

[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.360]
Talk about that clogged pepper.

[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.700]
It's kind of morbid that they've been dragging that body around.

[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:14.840]
Yeah.

[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.200]
Why don't they bury the guy already?

[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.080]
Most people get buried when their body is still fairly fresh.

[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:23.380]
They put it in the Congress there and people are walking by looking at it.

[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:23.640]
Yeah.

[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:24.220]
It'd be creepy.

[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.300]
I wouldn't want to go to work.

[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.080]
I'd be like, well, good.

[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.360]
Couple of people walk by and slap the face a little bit.

[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.560]
And why don't they leave it alone before it all crumbles?

[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:30.960]
Yeah.

[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.480]
Isn't there some, yeah, health code or something?

[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.380]
Good, but not in Washington anymore.

[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.200]
All right.

[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.080]
Now everything is unsanitary in Washington.

[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:39.820]
Certainly.

[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.860]
In fact, that's why they call it the Mung City.

[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.340]
Well, listen, you've been a real addition to the show.

[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:44.840]
All right.

[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:46.560]
And if you believe that, you'll believe anything.

[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.140]
Have a great day.

[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:47.680]
Enjoy your meal.

[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.260]
Thank you.

[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.420]
1130 at WIOD.

[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.100]
Yeah, this is good.

[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:54.500]
This really just hits the spot without going nuts early, which is good.

[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.880]
Yeah, because I had that dig me a last night a lot to have another herb.

[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.740]
Now for those who are tuning in late,

[00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:02.760]
we want to repeat the staggering rumor that we heard earlier,

[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.140]
because it's more than just a rumor now.

[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.760]
Yes, it is.

[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.260]
And we apologize, because usually up until we came to WIOD,

[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:11.440]
we had an impeccable record, almost a perfect record.

[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:11.840]
I'm sorry.

[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.760]
And passing along information about the business.

[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.780]
Once we came here, we started getting, well, kind of manipulated.

[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:21.200]
If I can use that word a little bit into passing along information that was less than dependable.

[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:21.480]
Yes.

[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.180]
So don't depend on it.

[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.960]
And as it comes from, is that our slogan, don't depend on it?

[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.060]
Isn't it great that so far we've been on an hour and a half,

[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.640]
and even though Disney's into building, boy, Gary,

[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.740]
and Spike Wise, I saw him, they're all in the building,

[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:37.560]
and everything is still kind of mellow.

[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.120]
You know what I mean?

[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.320]
Boy, maybe they can go away again for a couple of weeks.

[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:41.900]
Wouldn't that be good?

[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.060]
Well, there must be.

[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.240]
Because I was debating over the weekend.

[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.820]
I like to bitch about the fact that they never show their faces in here,

[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.620]
and they don't do anything.

[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:51.380]
But on balance, you know, when they're gone, things go pretty well.

[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.180]
You know what I bet you.

[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.120]
Anyway, the rumor is that's been confirmed, by the way,

[00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.380]
from different sources.

[00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.700]
Also, before you go to the rumor,

[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.140]
I heard this morning from a very, very, very reliable source

[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.280]
that several people were interviewed for Rose Folger's job while he was away last week.

[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:10.400]
And I said, I can't believe that in this business.

[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:11.340]
They would do a thing like that.

[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:13.620]
We've seen it before.

[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.060]
We have?

[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.620]
Anyway, in about three or four weeks,

[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.040]
ETA will be going pirate radio.

[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:22.980]
They're going to pick up the Pittsburgh Pirates game.

[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.720]
They're going to pick it up off this satellite from Scott Chanin's doing the format out in L.A.

[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.500]
It'll be on Westwood One, out of that building.

[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:32.220]
They're already doing it in L.A.

[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.340]
But it's going to go on satellite.

[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.380]
And they're going to pick it up here.

[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.760]
Three or four weeks.

[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.280]
You'll see the billboards on the screen.

[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:40.840]
Which is what?

[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.140]
Well, I guess this month.

[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.000]
No, I mean, what does that mean?

[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:45.840]
Pirate radio.

[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:46.320]
Mm-hmm.

[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:49.620]
Well, it's a new format in the industry.

[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:52.660]
They play, uh, they play some oldies.

[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.080]
Are they waiting till I go on vacation again?

[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:54.600]
Maybe.

[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.560]
That's when they do all the way.

[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.300]
Hey, thank you.

[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:56.940]
I'll go in.

[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:57.600]
And you'll come back.

[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:57.880]
Yeah.

[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.180]
Remember?

[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:58.940]
With Stan?

[00:59:59.120 --> 00:59:59.440]
You bet.

[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.860]
Oh, it was just coincidence.

[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.420]
There was nothing to do with it.

[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.340]
There's no coincidence.

[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.760]
They play some oldies from the 60s, but different oldies than you're used to hearing.

[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.700]
They play some new cutting edge, hard rock music.

[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.380]
Cutting edge.

[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:15.140]
Yeah.

[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:15.740]
What does that mean?

[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.960]
Well, it means like the records are sharp.

[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.340]
And if you don't watch yourself, you'll slit your wrist like Ozzy Osborne.

[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.060]
Different.

[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:23.880]
New music.

[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.900]
Oh, here's a question from Nick.

[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.520]
Do they play Slayer?

[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:29.680]
Maybe.

[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.060]
Yeah, maybe.

[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.620]
Dead Milkman.

[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.560]
Definitely the dead milkman.

[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:33.740]
Yeah.

[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.840]
They play a lot of that.

[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.200]
And then they play some records that were hits about five years ago.

[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:43.000]
But only like every second or third record will be a recognizable, uh, big hit, you know.

[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.680]
They play some obscure music.

[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.600]
Perfect for ZTA.

[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.000]
And, um, that's it.

[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:52.880]
That's the story.

[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.120]
And the billboards will be changing.

[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.160]
The watch, the space billboards will be becoming pirate radio billboards.

[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.420]
That'll probably be the first and they're very, very nice billboards.

[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.060]
Very eye catching.

[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.360]
That'll probably be the first indicator.

[01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.200]
Yeah.

[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:12.920]
Well, they were, they were having their meeting at the Chica Lodge where I broadcast my Friday night show from.

[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.320]
Yeah.

[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.260]
And they stayed in there about five minutes after I went on here and then they all took off.

[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.920]
I don't know if it's because they know that I talked to you every now and then or what.

[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.900]
But not one of them wanted to get up and talk to me except the Jeff Clark.

[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.500]
Is he a nice guy?

[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:25.820]
I don't know.

[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.960]
I couldn't tell much from the interview.

[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.620]
Well, since his operation, it's a real calm, you know, very mellow.

[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.660]
And every other Wednesday they bring him in and they talk to him and are still waiting for a response.

[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:40.660]
They talk to him real quiet and they hope that he'll finally start speaking.

[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.180]
He hasn't spoken in three years.

[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.160]
I saw Denimberg.

[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.940]
He's the only one that was under five foot tall, right?

[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:47.200]
Yeah.

[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.420]
Okay, I got to see.

[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.240]
Yeah, he lost two inches, by the way, and he's pretty upset about it.

[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.920]
He's the one that they went out parasailing with, I think.

[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:55.160]
Yeah.

[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.700]
Yeah, they used him, they put him on a fish hook.

[01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:58.440]
They used him as bait.

[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.920]
They had a wonderful time and the people at Chica say they hope they never come back there again.

[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.780]
Good. Well, listen, we were hoping the same thing that they'd stayed out there.

[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.020]
And I got a little life report on myself.

[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.560]
I stopped doing the morning show from 6 to 10 a.m.

[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.760]
The station management gave me a promotion.

[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.440]
They made me sales manager and program director.

[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:15.820]
Wow.

[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.000]
Oh, you're really moving up, Jimmy.

[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.720]
Well, now I have to consider myself a total asshole and I'm going to commit suicide.

[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.080]
Okay, well, listen, say hi to your brother, Jerry, for us.

[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.340]
So, take care.

[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:25.640]
Have a good day.

[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:26.800]
Jimmy Music.

[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.060]
Wow. What is it?

[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:28.240]

[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.080]
What is it?

[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:29.660]
Hmm.

[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.820]
Oh, these little bacon cheeseburgers.

[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.400]
When you go to Arnold's Royal Castle, get the little bacon cheeseburgers, believe me.

[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.140]
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:38.720]
I agree.

[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.920]
Who are they good?

[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:50.240]
Anyway, it's time to remind you that on Saturday, June 24th, we're all going to be at Toyota of Hollywood.

[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.120]
Now, remember the last time that Stephen I were there and I said I wanted a record-breaking turnout.

[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:55.560]
Yeah.

[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.640]
We did have a good turnout.

[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.380]
They sold a ton of cars, which is what, you know, that's main idea.

[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.660]
But we just, there are a lot of those regulars, you know what I mean?

[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:10.260]
A lot of those same faces, including the guy with the dog and then that obnoxious slob from who hangs out at playoffs, Mr. Rez.

[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.660]
And those people are not invited this time.

[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.580]
We want a whole bunch of like new and different people.

[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.200]
We're going to have all kinds of pictures and bumper stickers and prizes.

[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:26.320]
I mean, some not, not these crappy little prizes that they usually try to pawn off that they think you're going to come in for.

[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.420]
We're going to have some real legitimate incredible stuff.

[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.460]
So, Mark the date, Saturday, June 24th, they've been ever decided to tell me what time I'm going to be.

[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.740]
Well, Johnny Dolan just called off the air with a very shocking message.

[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.460]
He said, hi.

[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.060]
Which shocked a hell out of me.

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:44.020]
And he said, pirate radio is for 18 to 24 year old males.

[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.120]
Well, we know that just like K-102 was for 18 to 24 year old males.

[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:56.300]
And there is a section of those mentally deficient 18 to 24 year old young pinheads who are in that real heavy duty crap.

[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.020]
OK, about one share. That's what it was good for before in this market.

[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.440]
And they can relate to that.

[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:07.080]
Over there, they'll be comfortable with like a one three, maybe one six.

[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.640]
Anyway, it's 1138 at WIOD and we'll go to Deerfield. Hello.

[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:13.360]
Yeah, now.

[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.320]
Yeah. How you doing?

[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:14.740]
Great.

[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.440]
I took your advice and went to La Tevanetta.

[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.340]
Unbelievable.

[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:19.880]
Yeah.

[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:25.600]
But there is one place in town that makes La Tevanetta a distance second.

[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.080]
I don't believe that.

[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:27.920]
Aldo's.

[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:28.860]
Yeah.

[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.180]
Are you the crank?

[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.440]
Am I the crank?

[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:32.800]
Yeah.

[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:33.680]
No, not the crank.

[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.000]
Did we ever hear any more about that?

[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:36.320]
No.

[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:37.720]
Not a word.

[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:39.500]
You got to try it now.

[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.940]
I think you'll let you to agree.

[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.880]
I prefer to have a notice, sir.

[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.100]
1138.

[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:46.820]
What are they looking for?

[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.400]
Free publicity? Is that what that was all about?

[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.400]
I don't know.

[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:50.820]
Interesting.

[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:52.660]
You know, I'd forgotten all about it.

[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.180]
Yeah.

[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.280]
Until he mentioned it again.

[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.720]
I think that's going to be like the donut place.

[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:57.580]
Yeah.

[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.080]
Could be.

[01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.560]
Could be.

[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.900]
A lot of energy went into that crank, boy.

[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.060]
Yeah.

[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:07.000]
And we still wound up beating from our friends up to the street at Flora's, a tremendous meal.

[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.400]
It was wonderful.

[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.580]
It finished the week.

[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.260]
Great.

[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.500]
But isn't it interesting how we haven't heard any more about that?

[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.520]
I was going to call up there, and I forgot about it because it was on the weekend.

[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.580]
Probably just as well.

[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:21.880]
Boy.

[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.040]
Yeah.

[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.580]
I can see that this guy's.

[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.140]
That was such an obvious setup call.

[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.300]
You have to be an idiot not to smell it from 100 miles away.

[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.380]
You can smell it garlic.

[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.880]
Anyway, it's 1139 at WIOD.

[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.080]
And we got a call from West Palm Beach.

[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:43.380]
Hello.

[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.820]
Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.140]
Good.

[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.400]
Wanted to call and let you guys know.

[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.240]
I checked out one of your places you use to talk about the Andrias this weekend.

[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.100]
And I don't know what happened, but I called information.

[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.160]
He got their phone number.

[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:56.600]
Yeah.

[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.960]
And it gave me the wrong number.

[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.720]
I made reservations for some restaurant.

[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.760]
I don't even know where it was for five o'clock.

[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:07.300]
But we showed up at the Andrias at five and the lady says, well, we don't open till six.

[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:09.480]
She opened the restaurant up.

[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.120]
She was the owner.

[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.980]
And let us come in and have a couple cocktails.

[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.300]
And at six they seated us.

[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.600]
And the food was out of this world.

[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.100]
Oh, yeah.

[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.460]
It's excellent.

[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.160]
We'd sit down and start.

[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.880]
We took my mother and mother there for dinner.

[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.600]
And she started to order something and Todd was the waiter.

[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.100]
He said, now you don't want that.

[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.180]
Try this.

[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.240]
This is what Neil would have.

[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.340]
And everybody was just.

[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.040]
No, he didn't say this is what Neil would have.

[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.500]
Yeah, he did.

[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:37.940]
Yeah.

[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.140]
So this is what Neil would have.

[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.660]
And she says, okay, I'll try it.

[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.040]
And the food was excellent.

[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.080]
And I told him, you know, that probably Bill Mullen was handling the account before.

[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.500]
So they must have had a little problem.

[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.200]
No, Coleman was handling the account.

[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.460]
That's kind of in the same genre.

[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.460]
But the food was actually, I drove.

[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.040]
Yeah, it's a terrific.

[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:00.680]
Were they busy?

[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.640]
Yeah, for Sunday afternoon, I was surprised.

[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.040]
Good.

[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.560]
Of course, we were the first people there.

[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.300]
So we could do it.

[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.120]
I'll see it takes some time.

[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.440]
I think they were a little impatient.

[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.360]
And also they picked the time right after Easter when everybody disappeared.

[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.180]
Yeah.

[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.220]
But they're going to do okay.

[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.080]
They've got a great restaurant.

[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:17.640]
Food was excellent.

[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.440]
And every time we hear a restaurant, you know, run across WIOD, we check it out.

[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.800]
And we haven't been disappointed yet.

[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:23.120]
Good.

[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:26.260]
I haven't had a chance to check out those burgers you guys are eating yet.

[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.120]
But I understand there's nothing like a great piece of ice.

[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:30.200]
Yeah.

[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:30.660]
Yeah.

[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.660]
So to speak.

[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.340]
Have a great day.

[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:32.840]
Talk to you.

[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.580]
See, he was great and then he tried to be funny.

[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.060]
I know.

[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:38.500]
He was a good call, but he tried to be a little humor there in the end.

[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:40.480]
And it was about as funny as like a broken leg.

[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.920]
1141 at WIOD, we have an opening.

[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.020]
Oh, he's on a Palm Beach line.

[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.020]
I'm sorry, I apologize.

[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:51.340]
655-9463-655-WIOD in Palm Beach County.

[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.880]
The Lee Fowler Show today, asking the musical question, is Rick Ciderman really a douchebag?

[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.240]
Oh, boy, is that a tough question?

[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.620]
They can answer that in about three minutes.

[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:04.200]
Miami, hello.

[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.200]
Hello, Deel.

[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.800]
This is Harry.

[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.180]
Are you there?

[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.520]
Bad voice, Harry.

[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.060]
Excuse me?

[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.200]
I must have been called those six home runs yesterday that did it.

[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.440]
No, I don't, I'm not sure.

[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.620]
There was the home runs or there was the fact that I do that you were coming to Chicago.

[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.480]
Yeah, that must have been it.

[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:28.520]
Well, listen, when you do come up here, I want you to visit me.

[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.640]
I want you to come up.

[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.980]
Is it a good thing he told us who it was?

[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.360]
Yeah, I want you to come to Chicago.

[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.160]
You sure it's not Elvis?

[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:35.940]
Is this Elvis?

[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.480]
Don't, Harry.

[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:39.000]
Elvis is with Cards.

[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:39.680]
Oh, okay.

[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.060]
Listen.

[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:42.060]
Neil?

[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.020]
Yeah, Harry.

[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:43.780]
It cuts that.

[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:44.460]
It's him, right?

[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:44.980]
Like Al.

[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.680]
I trust you are too.

[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.940]
Okay, Harry, take care of yourself.

[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:49.360]
Okay.

[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.860]
Are you sure that one now?

[01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:52.640]
Oh, Al Flandon.

[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:52.920]

[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.320]
1143 at WIOD.

[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.160]
See what I mean about these amateur comedians?

[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.460]
The worst, the worst, the worst.

[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.360]
Just painful.

[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.280]
Deadly, it was.

[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.760]
In fact, Harry's starting to get surly even after the Cubs 113 yesterday,

[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.820]
starting to get hysterical after that.

[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.580]
Miami, hello.

[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:09.440]
Hello, Neil.

[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:09.860]
Yeah.

[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:10.420]
How you doing?

[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:10.880]
Okay.

[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.440]
Bird, how you doing?

[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.020]
Fine.

[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.580]
Let me ask you a question, sir.

[01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:15.100]
Yeah.

[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:15.720]
How you doing?

[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.360]
I'm doing just wonderful.

[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:17.740]
Good.

[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.980]
Yeah, I got caught by the respiratory porn.

[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.840]
As you know, the bird tells us there are no coincidences.

[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.400]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:27.560]
Okay, well, the IOTO will pass the way left.

[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.740]
Yeah, I was thinking about that.

[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.400]
Isn't this a pretty bizarre idea?

[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.300]
Have you ever seen Claude and the IOTO together?

[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.660]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:33.960]
Yeah.

[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.760]
How would he look with one of those, you know, beard?

[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:37.100]
With a smatha on, yeah.

[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:37.760]
That's right.

[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.020]
Okay, think about that.

[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.500]
And why doesn't he speak as good an English as you or me?

[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:42.880]
Okay.

[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:43.220]
Yeah.

[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.300]
What rule rules?

[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.320]
Yeah, maybe he's speaking in a rainy.

[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:48.160]
I rainy, or maybe that's his first language.

[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:48.780]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.020]
Okay, well, that was just my thought on that.

[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.560]
In fact, they asked Claude how he got elected to the Congress.

[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.480]
He said, I ran.

[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.560]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.000]
Pretty cool.

[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.000]
I think he was trying to tell us something there, sir.

[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.520]
Pretty weak there now.

[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:00.920]
Yeah, I know.

[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:01.600]
Yeah, okay.

[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.460]
Listen, it was great to Cubs Croyd 11 runs.

[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.200]
That was unbelievable output for them.

[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.280]
That's about a week's quota, usually.

[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:08.500]
Couldn't believe it.

[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.260]
Okay, when I heard that.

[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:09.940]
Let me say it again.

[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.480]
They hit five home runs in a whole month of May, and they hit six in one game yesterday.

[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.840]
That was incredible for them.

[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.500]
I don't know so many, you know, they must have got lucky or something.

[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:17.760]
Yeah.

[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:19.880]
Well, anyways, an extra gatorade.

[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.320]
Uh, okay.

[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:21.980]
Have a great day.

[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:22.780]
And passing, though.

[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.440]
Yeah, I'd like to call Sean a douchebag.

[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:25.020]
In closing.

[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.040]
Okay, in closing.

[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.960]
Remember, Rick Shaw or Dog's lead.

[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.280]
Ha-ha-ha.

[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.540]
Oh, they just all got to get those little tentacles, you know.

[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:35.180]
Yeah.

[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.680]
Oh, that was a good launch, one of them.

[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:39.820]
We hit it fast.

[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:40.900]
I'm going.

[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.900]
Like lightning.

[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:42.280]
Yeah.

[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:43.240]
It's all gone.

[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.380]
So every drop.

[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:44.840]
Yes.

[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.200]
Every drop.

[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.760]
There is some ice in the bag.

[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:48.340]
That's right.

[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.080]
That's it.

[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:50.860]
It's all gone.

[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.940]
There ain't nothing left.

[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:57.140]
So Andy and Todd, you missed out, but it was exceptionally good today.

[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.100]
I want them to feel bad.

[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.760]
But it was probably the best ever, wasn't it?

[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:01.740]
It was great.

[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:02.900]
Bokeh, hello.

[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.000]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:04.380]
Let's see.

[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.740]
Have a quick spy report, April word spy report.

[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.340]
Sorry, Sadie.

[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.340]
This weekend, you know what I think she was ordering partially soup.

[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.220]
I couldn't believe it.

[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:14.660]
Unbelievable.

[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:16.920]
Yeah.

[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:17.680]
Take care.

[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.360]
See ya.

[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.020]
Now, for a Monday, these are exceptional calls.

[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:23.600]
Oh, I would agree.

[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:26.920]
The quality of the calls today is compared to the usual Monday plus the number of the calls.

[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.800]
We've had more calls already that we usually get in a month of Mondays.

[01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.820]
Yeah, it was kind of a pretty good weekend.

[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.520]
I enjoyed it.

[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.200]
Everything was great.

[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.820]
I had a tremendous dinner last night.

[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.140]
I had a good time at Calder on Saturday and the Cubs scored all those runs yesterday and

[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.320]
everything was great.

[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.000]
Life goes on.

[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.020]
I think.

[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:45.720]
I don't know.

[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.280]
I need a little rest now.

[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:48.140]
You know, after that lunch.

[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800]
Because it was quick.

[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:51.240]
Yeah.

[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.900]
See, I usually space mine out.

[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.060]
That's why it takes me so long because I eat it very slowly.

[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:58.980]
Because while you're on the air, you don't want to do anything real quick and have an accident.

[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:00.560]
Yeah.

[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:02.420]
Speaking of that.

[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:05.980]
Oh, I'm going to have to be excused.

[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.420]
Go right ahead.

[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.740]
Now, I have to go that like it's a data.

[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:20.100]
We say that I have to go check the mailboxes, water the flowers, and what else did we use to say?

[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:24.960]
I don't know, but they told us we couldn't say anything over there.

[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.000]
I don't know how we got any numbers because we couldn't say anything about anything.

[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.540]
So I have to go check and be sure the kitchen is on.

[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.840]
We wouldn't want this rumor about pirate radio to affect Tim Williams, the general manager,

[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:42.740]
because he does have young children who are highly impressionable and would not want to hear other kids in school saying that daddy is a douchebag.

[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.320]
The daddy is some kind of a mindless mong brain who couldn't, he wouldn't know a radio from a freight train.

[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.380]
Go ahead.

[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.960]
Just zip right on out of here.

[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.020]
You're going to have to wait for an engraved invitation.

[01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.720]
While you're doing that, I think I'll tell everybody about Nutri's system.

[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:05.260]
Okay, 1150, 10B4 new to WIID.

[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.520]
Can't feel like a certain freedom now, like if I wanted to talk about all the home runs that Cubs had yesterday.

[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.180]
And it's Sanderson pitched a complete game and go...

[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:12.400]
Neil.

[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.200]
Yes.

[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.720]
My name is Kelly.

[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.140]
I'm a first time callin' a long time.

[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.500]
Well, that's great, Terry.

[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.700]
How you doin' over there with all our American money?

[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.660]
Well, I'm not getting much of it because I'm a host, maybe, I'm cable bitch.

[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:26.800]
You've been to Bahamas before.

[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:27.600]
Oh, yeah.

[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.360]
Yeah.

[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.200]
Boy.

[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.600]
I work out, uh, I see.

[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:34.340]
As they say, and is they say in Siberia, it's Faltmare Hallusches, you know what I mean?

[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:34.860]
Yeah.

[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.320]
It's quite hot over here also.

[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.400]
Yeah, well, it's pretty hot here too, Terry.

[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:41.680]
Yeah.

[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.960]
You're doing a great job and you always make my day.

[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.380]
I hear we have a lot of listeners over there in the Bahamas.

[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.260]
There's been a lot of time listening while they're counting those American dollars.

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.020]
Is that true, Terry?

[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.280]
Well, I used to be doin' a lot of work.

[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.720]
I'm working pretty hard.

[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.060]
You're workin' what?

[01:13:58.540 --> 01:13:59.100]
Pretty hard.

[01:13:59.100 --> 01:13:59.860]
Oh, pretty hard.

[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.380]
Yeah, I'm a host, me, it all, and cable bitch.

[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:03.200]
Oh boy.

[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:07.420]
Well, you probably get to rub elbows with all those rich people, huh?

[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:07.960]
Yeah.

[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520]
Now listen, let me ask you a question.

[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.780]
That new casino that Murf Gryffin opened.

[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:13.280]
Aha.

[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.380]
Which one is that?

[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.360]
That's the one that will part his island.

[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.520]
Oh, it's in NASA?

[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:21.100]
Yes, it's the NASA OleAde Island.

[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.760]
Boy, talk about haloshes.

[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.680]
Now what's the name of it?

[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.760]
It's Sheraton Grand Hotel, Uncocino.

[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.440]
The Sheraton Grand Hotel, Uncocino.

[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:30.980]
Uncocino, yeah.

[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.360]
And that's Murf Gryffin, and he's got his own...

[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.320]
Yeah, port and everything.

[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.100]
He's own little airport.

[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:35.740]
Yeah.

[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:36.960]
Isn't that great?

[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:37.920]
That's right.

[01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:40.800]
And his Pat SayJack reached you when you get off the plane there with Vanna?

[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:41.580]
Got it.

[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.720]
I say it must be a really great place, huh?

[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:44.740]
Yeah, it is.

[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:45.760]
Yeah.

[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:49.040]
But they're doing great over there, over part of the island.

[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:52.740]
The Sheraton Hotel and the casino thing.

[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:53.020]
That's right.

[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.400]
Well, I'm thinking about going over there and checking it out.

[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:56.340]
It's supposed to be nice, huh?

[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.260]
Yeah, it is.

[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.040]
Even carnival is nice to the Crystal Palace.

[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.820]
The other one that just opened up.

[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.880]
You know, and cable feature here.

[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:05.460]
Yeah.

[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:06.680]
That's lovely, also.

[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:08.600]
Great. Well, listen, that's great hearing from you.

[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.680]
Yeah, okay.

[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.080]
And say hi to all our friends over there.

[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.220]
We understand we've just got a legion of fans over there in the Bahamas.

[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.300]
Yeah, you do.

[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:17.400]
Well, that's pretty exciting.

[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.280]
Okay, me.

[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.100]
Have a good one.

[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:19.900]
Okay, bye.

[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:20.360]
Bye.

[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.240]
Why don't you nice?

[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.380]
We have an open line in Palm Beach, 655 WIOD.

[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.120]
And I have no WI-5, 9463.

[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:27.960]
Hollywood, hello.

[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.200]
I know you're going to be angry at me.

[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.280]
Yeah, I'm already, I'm already angry.

[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.100]
I apologize.

[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.360]
I'm the one that was supposed to deliver the food,

[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.860]
but I must tell you what happened.

[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.560]
Yeah, right.

[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.420]
See, I'm already...

[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.760]
Sir, let me ask you a question.

[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.140]
Yes.

[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.640]
Is this, how long is this going to go on?

[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.460]
Is this a joke?

[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:48.100]
No, it's just that dog ate part of it.

[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.560]
I put it in the house to break.

[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:49.820]
Yeah.

[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.380]
1153 at WIOD, we have an open line in Davey.

[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.620]
Listen, it's noon time or we'll be soon,

[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.880]
so I can't wait to that news report.

[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.220]
If they've buried Claude yet.

[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.580]
How much you want to bet, sir?

[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.520]
I mean, just a friendly little...

[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.060]
But wait, sir.

[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.140]
Imaginary wager that's the first story on the noon news will be Claude Piper.

[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.660]
It very well could be.

[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:09.340]
Yeah, I think the odds are one-to-nine.

[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:10.760]
Oh, quick burn.

[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.500]
Yeah, you're one-to-nine yesterday and you got gaffed in the third race.

[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:14.040]
Really?

[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:14.580]
Yes.

[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.460]
A-noes one-to-nine shot tonight.

[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.180]
Well, he opened up with a thousand dollars in the pool for him.

[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.060]
And then it went down from there.

[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.660]
Yesterday was a blood bath for me at Calder.

[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.020]
Really?

[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.620]
Where did Quick Burn finish your one-to-nine?

[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:26.540]
I think about...

[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.720]
Well, he didn't go off at one-to-nine.

[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.060]
One time he was like that.

[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.240]
He came in fourth, I think.

[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:30.880]
Great.

[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:31.840]
He got off the board.

[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.320]
Yeah, I had a horse yesterday.

[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.240]
You know one of those tips.

[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:35.960]
This horse can't lose.

[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:36.400]
Yeah.

[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:38.120]
I hear that.

[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.240]
Yeah, like the 12 horse in the first race Saturday.

[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.260]
He's still...

[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:43.600]
In fact, here he comes right now.

[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.700]
Oh, man, I'm telling you it was incredible.

[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.020]
Truly, it was a blood bath.

[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:49.040]
I thought I was in the...

[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.240]
What if a tan man square or something in China?

[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:51.720]
Yeah.

[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.040]
But you still have a good fun.

[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:54.380]
Exactly.

[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.160]
I thought it would.

[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:55.980]
You know, that's one thing.

[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.640]
Even though I lost a few bucks Saturday, I had a great time.

[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.160]
I got nice tan, I sat outside.

[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:01.420]
I wandered around.

[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.880]
I ran into a whole bunch of people.

[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:03.620]
It was great.

[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.060]
You know, I ran it to your buddy there.

[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.220]
Well, I don't know if he's really your buddy.

[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.240]
Lester Green shirt.

[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:07.560]
Yeah.

[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.640]
The old Lester.

[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:09.620]
I love that.

[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.300]
Oh, listen, you know, the one race I hit real good on Saturday,

[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.820]
which got me even for a while, for a while, was the third race.

[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.820]
And Lester, who every time he sees me, he's got it,

[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.480]
toply on a horse.

[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.420]
He gave me the two horse in that race.

[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.720]
He's still running, so I immediately scratched him out.

[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:25.260]
But perfect, it was a mortal one-three,

[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.540]
and Lester was touting the two.

[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:27.160]
Oh, boy.

[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:27.920]
Well.

[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:28.760]
He's a good guy, though.

[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:29.560]
Yeah, he's good.

[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:32.240]
He ever catches a ticket, he can afford it by a new shirt.

[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:33.620]
He's always there.

[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.720]
I'm getting buried out here.

[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.080]
Yeah.

[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:35.700]
That's...

[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.240]
But he's having a good time doing it, though.

[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.100]
Yeah, he's always there.

[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.300]
Okay, I'll see you.

[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:39.680]
Neil.

[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.160]
Yeah.

[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.860]
I ran into a good friend Larry Kent the other day.

[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.520]
You ran into him?

[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.360]
Well, probably had to have stitches, didn't you?

[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.100]
Yeah, well, we were talking, and we were talking about you,

[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:50.720]
and a couple other things.

[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.800]
I think he's a fan of yours.

[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.960]
Yeah, he's a closet neither.

[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:53.440]
He's a good guy.

[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:54.640]
Yeah, he's a good...

[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.860]
As fate would have it, we were talking about where is WFUN now.

[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.240]
And he says he thinks it's up in Ohio.

[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.860]
He's a giant in the industry, sir.

[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:02.680]
He's a think-fedable guy.

[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.660]
Okay, how do you get there?

[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:04.060]
Bye-bye.

[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.240]
Okay, well, there's a guy who plunged his guts out

[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:09.720]
and called her yesterday, and that's the kind of guy we really admire and appreciate, okay?

[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.680]
And little preview, we're going to have a tribute to the old Zeta in the next hour.

[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.420]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.200]
Just a little preview there of what's to come.

[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.680]
Gail not so brighter as in April.

[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.800]
Who's sitting in there?

[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.220]
April?

[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:23.200]
Press by the host guest or callers.

[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.280]
Are not necessarily those of the station.

[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.120]
Now, here's Neil Rogers.

[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.920]
On News Talk Radio 610 WIO.

[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.780]
Don't say nice and simple, you hear.

[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:32.760]
Get out of here.

[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.520]
Get out of here.

[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.560]
Not that bad.

[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.940]
12.05 at WIOD.

[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.900]
Spike Wise from 97GT.

[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.640]
Just in here, bugging us again.

[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:46.440]
Boy, he is something.

[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:52.580]
Well, I got a special tribute now to, wouldn't it be great if we could get like Caprita on here?

[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:53.980]
Wow.

[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:57.240]
After it's all over over there, it should be probably in a couple of weeks.

[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:57.660]
Yeah.

[01:18:59.020 --> 01:18:59.600]
Yes, wouldn't it?

[01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:01.600]
When that piece house the whole inside story?

[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.140]
Yeah.

[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:03.580]
The inside edition?

[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:04.660]
What's he going to do?

[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:05.820]
Good question.

[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:06.960]
What's Rose going to do?

[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.420]
Rose bought a house.

[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.300]
You told him not to do that.

[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.800]
Well, like everything else, he didn't listen to anything else.

[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.420]
I told him so why should be different on that?

[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.060]
So, well, the interesting thing is he wins the Colonel Office Pool.

[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:21.120]
Okay, a little tribute.

[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.280]
In front of him.

[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.320]
My friend.

[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.580]
Three, two, three, two.

[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:32.900]
I guess he's not there.

[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:34.940]
He's here.

[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:35.160]

[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.480]
The phrase, image, or whatever.

[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.420]
No, yeah, they're talking about him, all right?

[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.720]
Boy, that was...

[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.640]
A guy over here.

[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:44.980]

[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.960]
Let's see if we can do it over on this side of the board.

[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.060]
There we go.

[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.400]
Should be a Tizeta.

[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.040]
Yeah.

[01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.980]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.380]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.060]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.040]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:03.480]
Listen to that.

[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.860]
Now, are you supposed to hit the buzzer in the second?

[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.600]
That is nice.

[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:31.420]
Very nice.

[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:32.720]
Oh!

[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.540]
Good.

[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.440]
Heavens.

[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.900]
Well, I wanted to be perfect because it's a Tizeta.

[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:38.280]

[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.680]
And their favorite recording group.

[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:40.540]
Okay.

[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:44.060]
And look what they've done for him.

[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:44.840]
We think it's a normal record.

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:44.840]

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:48.700]
get to the part that I like the best though. What cut is that? It should be pretty easy.

[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.100]
It's number one.

[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:55.380]
I'm not missing it.

[01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:00.280]
What's it at? It's got a music. I need to keep on playing it.

[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:05.040]
There we go. This is the part that just sends me.

[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.340]
There we go.

[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:14.340]
Every time I think is eight of man. I just start rolling.

[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:15.840]
I'm like in my stomach.

[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:22.500]
1207 at WIOD. We have a celebrity caller from Channel 25 in beautiful Palm Beach County.

[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:23.340]
It says hello.

[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:24.700]
Neil, Bert, how you doing?

[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:25.140]
Good.

[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.660]
Great. I'm working up here at the Channel 25.

[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.580]
You know, and Jimmy Brosmer is up here now.

[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.640]
You know, but nobody gets it anyway.

[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:32.540]
Who is this?

[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.200]
It's Alan Collin from Channel 25.

[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:35.780]
Alan.

[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.860]
Yeah. First time caller.

[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.480]
What do you do up there?

[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:44.360]
I'm one of those salespeople or assholes.

[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:47.320]
Oh, it's a salesperson from Channel 25.

[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:47.940]
There you go.

[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:50.360]
There you go. Got a couple of somethings for you here.

[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:50.840]
Okay.

[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:56.860]
All right. On WDZL on Channel 39, they do these promos for a love connection.

[01:21:57.500 --> 01:21:58.420]
I don't know if you've seen them.

[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:04.320]
Anyway, they have these little cuts of people talking, answering questions,

[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.540]
and in the middle, they're yelling out, get a life.

[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.640]
So they're ripping material off from you, Neil.

[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.860]
Yeah. Like everybody else.

[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.760]
Anyway, there's a, have an answer to a musical question that,

[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.160]
a caller had a few weeks ago.

[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.820]
He wanted to know what the song was at the end of that movie, Groove Tube.

[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.200]
Yeah.

[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.360]
Yeah. It's called, Just Me, Just You.

[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.480]
Oh, the singing in the rain, thank you.

[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.700]
What are you talking about?

[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.400]
He's wandering around Midtown Manhattan.

[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:36.520]
Yeah. He's sort of dancing around the street.

[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.400]
Right. Right. So it's good call.

[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.460]
Just singing in the rain was in a clockwork orange.

[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:40.940]
That's right.

[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.420]
That was a great movie though.

[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.060]
It Chevy Chase was in it, Richard Belzer.

[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:46.080]
Yeah. He thought it was singing in the rain the morning.

[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.180]
Well, in a clockwork orange?

[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.780]
Well, you must have seen a different version than I did.

[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.660]
He's talking about Groove Tube.

[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.120]
Oh.

[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:55.740]
Yeah. But that's the name of the song, it's called Just Me, Just You.

[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:56.280]
Yeah, Groove Tube.

[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.680]
Wasn't that with Malcolm McDowell?

[01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:58.340]
Yeah. Right.

[01:22:58.920 --> 01:22:59.200]
Exactly.

[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.920]
So if you guys get your station constructed yet, you all done?

[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.160]
Yeah, we're on the air. We've been on the air since January 1.

[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.700]
No, no, but you had it like a new facility, you know, brand new.

[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.560]
Yeah, it's done.

[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.260]
It's done. It's up. It's rolling.

[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:11.880]
It's what?

[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.120]
It's up and rolling.

[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:13.620]
Rolling.

[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.200]
Rolling on the river.

[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:15.980]
Yeah.

[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:17.780]
Yeah.

[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.800]
But that's it. Just wanted to call it.

[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.220]
Well, say hi to Jim Brosmer for us.

[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:21.880]
He's a great guy.

[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:22.840]
He's a super job.

[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:23.580]
He's a great guy.

[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.940]
In fact, I have a Jim Brosmer club pepperanticoat for you.

[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:27.400]
Yeah.

[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:32.480]
Jim was telling about how in 1960 and 90, he had club pepper on it on his own.

[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.580]
One of his interviews during the late news.

[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.520]
And it was just about the time of the moonwalk.

[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.960]
And he during one of the breaks, he motioned over the quad and said,

[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.560]
what do you think of the moonwalk here?

[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.880]
And Clyde said something like, well, there's just a lot of sand and rocks on the moon.

[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.120]
And no, we got plenty of that here down on Miami Beach anyway.

[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:49.820]
Yeah.

[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:52.180]
So there you go.

[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.080]
It's a fastball.

[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.320]
Yeah.

[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:58.620]
And pretty soon he'll be part of the sand and dust on the beach, too.

[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:01.360]
What goes around comes around. Listen now and have a great day.

[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.260]
Hey, thanks a lot.

[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:02.660]
See ya.

[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:02.960]
Bye-bye.

[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:05.500]
Boy, for a Monday, this is a mid-age.

[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.640]
It has been shocking, hasn't it?

[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.840]
I wasn't ready for this.

[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:12.200]
It was something about quarter that I was just going to tell you only moments ago.

[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.800]
And it just slipped my mind.

[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.680]
Something really desperately important.

[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:18.640]
Attendance?

[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.060]
Oh, yeah.

[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.240]
They did yesterday.

[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.240]
On a Sunday, they had 9896, 10,000 people.

[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.360]
And held a 1,337,000.

[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:29.680]
Yeah.

[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:30.520]
We saw better.

[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.580]
We should be better on a Sunday.

[01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:33.780]
See Sunday racing has never been taken off down here.

[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.020]
I don't know.

[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:34.900]
Well, I do know why.

[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.580]
It's because everybody hears over the age of 100.

[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.120]
Oh.

[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.980]
Oh, not on a Sunday.

[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.920]
We have to go play into my drunk tournament on Sunday.

[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.400]
And they're having a little thing in the clubhouse tonight.

[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:46.920]
Oh, boy.

[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.780]
When is this ever going to change?

[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:49.480]
It isn't, isn't it?

[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:49.940]
No.

[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:50.340]
No.

[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:51.320]
Mm-hmm.

[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.580]
Pray tonight.

[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.180]
I don't think so.

[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.180]
Yeah.

[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:56.300]
I don't know.

[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.340]
He's a good kid on the block.

[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.920]
And he wakes up right in the morning.

[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.260]
And he knows he's a little nutty.

[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:06.740]
And he knows he's a little squirly.

[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.440]
Where are we?

[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:12.640]
He thinks that you and the whole inner record just to say hello.

[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:13.500]
Hi.

[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.480]
I could see what you all are doing out there.

[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.340]
And the morning on his eight of four is the new.

[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.400]
Roger's show.

[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.340]
Come on in here.

[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:20.760]
Yeah.

[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:21.540]
And the same to you.

[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.520]
Isn't that cute?

[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:23.180]
That's Heather.

[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:23.720]
Yeah.

[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:24.480]
Really?

[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:24.880]
Bring it back.

[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:25.420]
More memories.

[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:25.700]
Wait.

[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.160]
Two bellies.

[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:26.160]

[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:26.160]

[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:26.160]

[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.840]
I don't have all our old jingles from Zeta.

[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:30.280]
Maybe they'll send them over now that they're going to become pirate radio.

[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.500]
And they're going to have the big change over.

[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:35.940]
Maybe out of the kind of, and especially if Rose is going to get canned, the least he can do is get us.

[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.420]
Maybe that's why they brought me those CDs yesterday.

[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.360]
You think?

[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.320]
Jingles?

[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:42.500]
Those jingles.

[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.120]
Hi, son Skip.

[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.320]
I just skipped.

[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.520]
I, at so happens, I'm not here.

[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.780]
Well, they elect me to the hall of fame.

[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.900]
I want you to do it.

[01:25:50.900 --> 01:26:03.560]
I have a real gracious kind of way, but just turn it down because if I can't be here and spell the roses, what the hell good does it do me to be in the hall of fame?

[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:10.760]
And Harry, if we come here and don't play at least some commercials, what the hell good does it do?

[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.680]
Our producer, a beleaguered man, Bruce Cornblatt, who's sitting here in Zappoplactic.

[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:16.660]
Oh my god.

[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.020]
He became apple plucking.

[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:19.740]
I heard it.

[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:20.880]
I couldn't believe it.

[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:21.900]
Well, that's a constant man.

[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.040]
He's a real original guy.

[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.280]
Boy, I tell you one of the kind.

[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.920]
Everybody listens to Neoraj.

[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.020]
You can say it again.

[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.820]
Hey, I saw this other show, Jockey.

[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.020]
I don't know if you've ever seen that.

[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:30.400]
No.

[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.020]
It was on Channel 33 last night.

[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.940]
Boy, those guys really put their lives on the line.

[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.160]
Oh, that's a dangerous sport.

[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.040]
Oh, my god.

[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.480]
In fact, I don't know if you've ever seen any accidents or anything.

[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:40.780]
Oh, yeah.

[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:41.900]
Even on film, you know.

[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.020]
They showed them it was horrendous.

[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:44.560]
Oh, it is.

[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.980]
Turn, you know, because these guys fall and one horse goes and they stop on the other one.

[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.520]
And horrendous stuff goes on.

[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:50.860]
Unbelievable.

[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:54.120]
Well, I'd like to say Walter Berman is a big douchebag.

[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.280]
Okay, thanks for the costus report.

[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.020]
That was Got Me Apple Plucked.

[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:58.580]
Okay, Neil.

[01:26:58.740 --> 01:26:59.180]
See you later.

[01:26:59.280 --> 01:26:59.480]
Bye.

[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:02.320]
Oh, back there.

[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:04.100]
Where's Gaspett?

[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.060]
It's not.

[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.720]
There's a long ride.

[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:07.820]
It's the other side.

[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.680]
Why the infinity?

[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.080]
It is.

[01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:12.020]
Half over.

[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.920]
It's like it's from the new studio.

[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:16.400]
The other room.

[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.060]
I like it.

[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:17.920]
Yeah.

[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:18.980]
Do you like the level on that?

[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.460]
It's not muffled enough for me, but other than that.

[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:27.280]
Boy, well, it isn't a really great recording, but I think that that cart machine number one again.

[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.120]
I think they're taking turns dying again.

[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:34.000]
No, seriously, because I put that same cart machine number three last time and it said.

[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.000]
I'm dying over here.

[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.840]
They're taking turns.

[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.320]
22 past noon at WIOD.

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.060]
We have an open line in Boka 278.

[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:41.720]
Not forever.

[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:43.780]
This is shocking.

[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.220]
Okay.

[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.080]
This is a real record.

[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.400]
No milk today.

[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.320]
My life has gone away.

[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.020]
The bump is not for no.

[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.820]
A symbol of the door.

[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.500]
Is shocking the guy?

[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:55.680]
When we want his life.

[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.000]
Is...

[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:57.120]
Yeah.

[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.820]
WIOD presents Neo Rogers.

[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:03.820]
To get a touch and talk, call 751 WIOD and date.

[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.320]
524 WIOD and Broward.

[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.000]
Or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.

[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.620]
Other areas make all collect.

[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:16.060]
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those who are not in the same place.

[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.500]
Now, here's Neo Rogers.

[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.060]
On Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD.

[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.060]
It's the Royal Tituel.

[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.620]
Whoop of the day.

[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.240]
I think I'll end on a Ross Pathum.

[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.920]
Now, land on your potato salad.

[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.020]
106.

[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.080]
All right, that's enough.

[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.100]
106 at WIOD.

[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:41.300]
One thing that's a ton of cards, man.

[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:42.860]
They're all predictable, aren't they?

[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.380]
They're all direct from plant city in their radio.

[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:47.040]
Oh, okay.

[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:52.440]
Go to shop and share all sorts of things in red.

[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.780]
Oh, here's a good uplifting song by Herman Sermitz.

[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.560]
Is this a little ripoff from Ricky's favorite?

[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.260]
From Skeeter Davis?

[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:10.940]
Skeeter.

[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:12.680]
Skeeter.

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:12.840]

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:12.840]

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:12.840]

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:12.840]

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:12.840]

[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:19.940]
I'm going to have to wear a brand new cap.

[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.060]
I don't even want to think about it.

[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:24.260]
Yeah.

[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.600]
107 at WIOD.

[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.100]
It's the big one to two hour.

[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.540]
We got pirate radio coming to town.

[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.940]
We got the sandy paint and show it.

[01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:34.520]
What else could anybody want?

[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:35.560]
And Ricky Dickie.

[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.540]
And Ricky Dickie too.

[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:38.060]
Margued.

[01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.260]
Hello.

[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.000]
Hi.

[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.240]
I just wanted to tell you that we went to the melting pot

[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:46.620]
and crawls brings and we said that you sent us in the food.

[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:47.780]
What's being a task?

[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:48.080]
Yeah.

[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.140]
Did Troy wait on you?

[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:50.380]
I don't know.

[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.620]
This guy have blonde hair.

[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.180]
Oh, no.

[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:52.840]
That's not Troy.

[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:56.620]
Unless he's a blow-drying and dying his hair.

[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.800]
Did you ever go to cast the relas and cook in a creek parkway?

[01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:02.340]
Yes, or relas.

[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.080]
I don't think so.

[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.200]
You've got to go there.

[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:04.740]
They're great.

[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.920]
They're telling food that is world-based.

[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:07.200]
Okay.

[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.180]
And they sent us a thank you letter.

[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.120]
We wrote a check for Pete's one night.

[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:15.620]
And they sent us a thank you letter for our business.

[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:16.420]
Great.

[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.000]
So I'm going to try it sometime.

[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:19.620]
Okay.

[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.220]
I'm glad you enjoyed the pot.

[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:22.180]
It was great.

[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:22.740]
Thanks a lot.

[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:23.080]
Okay.

[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:23.480]
All right.

[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.500]
One-o-waited W.I.

[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:24.740]
Yeah.

[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.600]
Here's that horse quick burn that the guy talked about.

[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.620]
Went off four to five.

[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.120]
He opened.

[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.240]
He said a one to nine.

[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.380]
Somebody put a thousand bucks on him on the first flash.

[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.280]
He went off one to nine.

[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.400]
And early and then four to five we closed at.

[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.700]
And he finished in eight horse fields sixth.

[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:40.580]
I love that.

[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:42.480]
Well, I love to see that choco down the drain.

[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:47.280]
And a horse that won a race with a lester paid 5280.

[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.020]
What was that?

[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:49.860]
What was his name?

[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.600]
A bellquist beauty.

[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:53.080]
Bellquist beauty.

[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.280]
Or a blowquist beauty.

[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.660]
It's got an apostrophe.

[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.900]
Is that a bloomquist beauty?

[01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:57.440]
Tough.

[01:30:57.900 --> 01:30:59.600]
Something like that with Bobby Lester.

[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:01.400]
Hmm.

[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:02.080]

[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.360]
A lot of chock though yesterday.

[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:06.680]
I see here's a little bit of everything.

[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.840]
There were three chocks in a row.

[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.840]
Here's a 25 to one.

[01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:09.740]
Here's a six to one.

[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.100]
With Rodriguez.

[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.880]
Here's one centron.

[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.440]
Oh, boy.

[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.860]
Steve Gaffley on one two races yesterday.

[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:17.860]
It would have been a rough day for me.

[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:18.940]
Mike Gonzalez had a winner.

[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.680]
Sonny Northern dancer.

[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:22.320]
One going away.

[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:23.420]
Five forty.

[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.320]
Not too much there.

[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.620]
The last race.

[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.580]
Julio Pizua for 2150.

[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.980]
I don't understand what Pizua was still doing here.

[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.300]
He had a horse on Saturday that I bet a real long shot.

[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:37.120]
And he was right there at the top of the stretch.

[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:37.720]
And then he puked.

[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.700]
Could he give it a hell of a shot?

[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.920]
He always gives you a real good shot, even if he doesn't have the horse.

[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:42.540]
And he won this one.

[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:42.860]
Look at this.

[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:43.760]
Nine and a half to one.

[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:44.980]
He was ahead all the way.

[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:45.600]
Wired a wire.

[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.880]
It was ahead by four lengths at the top of the stretch of one by three and a half

[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.580]
for 21 dollars.

[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:52.900]
I'll take that any day of the week.

[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.140]
I don't know why Julio is here.

[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:56.820]
Nine minutes after one at WIOD.

[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.040]
Miami.

[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:57.540]
Hello.

[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:58.980]
Hi, Neil.

[01:31:59.200 --> 01:31:59.440]
Hi.

[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.000]
Hi.

[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:03.760]
Talking about animals, I've got a choice tidbit for you.

[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.480]
That great, physical, Mickey Dane.

[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.180]
Oh, yeah.

[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.720]
Did he hear about it?

[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:08.940]
No.

[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:18.140]
He was arrested on Saturday for a word beginning with a B battery on a tenant in her duplex.

[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:19.160]
Oh, boy.

[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:19.520]
With a TV.

[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:20.160]
Wow.

[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:23.600]
Her son put up the hand to block the TV cameras.

[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.620]
That is shocking.

[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:26.300]
So, right?

[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.460]
Well, shouldn't she...

[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.020]
I was a least...

[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:28.820]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.780]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.080]
Where?

[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.600]
Shouldn't she have known they were coming?

[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.800]
Yes, she sure should have.

[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:36.140]
Yeah.

[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.100]
Which is a great visit.

[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:38.620]
You would think so.

[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:39.420]
Uh-huh.

[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.140]
Well, that's shocking news, I'll tell you.

[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:44.000]
At least it'll keep her off the radio for a while.

[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:44.580]
Uh-huh.

[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:45.860]
Wait, I got something else.

[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:46.360]
Yes.

[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:47.560]
And yesterday's Harold.

[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.120]
Section E.

[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:54.760]
There's page 4E, which connects across to the right continuation of 17E.

[01:32:55.220 --> 01:33:00.320]
At the top of the page, the one says Sunday June 4th, 1989.

[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.960]
And next to it says Sunday, May 21st, 1989.

[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:05.740]
Yeah, that's the Harold for him.

[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:06.160]
Right?

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:06.740]
Uh-huh.

[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:09.200]
Oh, that's the only paper you got.

[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:10.460]
They can put any date they want.

[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:13.280]
Can a sane person exist in this town?

[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:14.300]
No.

[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:15.840]
That's why we're here.

[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:17.140]
Have a great day.

[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.180]
Okay.

[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:18.640]
See ya.

[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:18.960]
Bye.

[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.740]
You think it's anything to do with that appearance on the Greg Read Elf show?

[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:25.540]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.020]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.580]
People that appear on it, if you delshore, have often been on it.

[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.700]
Do a rational thing.

[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:31.940]
Shortly after.

[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:33.420]
Telling me that you're a good fan.

[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:36.080]
Telling me that you're a good fan.

[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.660]
So the music really sounds good, huh?

[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.880]
That's amazing.

[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.860]
And if I'm telling my loved you, I'm bad.

[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.240]
When is that grassroots CD coming out, by the way?

[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:45.140]
The one that's got the grassroots.

[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.000]
And who is the other group that was going to be on it?

[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:48.080]
Oh, Gary Lewis and the Playboy.

[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:48.360]
Huh.

[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:49.960]
Which I did here.

[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.700]
I do want to give credit where credit is due.

[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.340]
I heard on magic.

[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:57.080]
She's just my style by Gary Lewis and the Playboy's the other night.

[01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:57.840]
I couldn't believe it.

[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:58.560]
I cranked it up.

[01:33:58.660 --> 01:33:59.860]
I had my speakers vibrating.

[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:00.240]
It was.

[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.240]
I said this has to be a mistake.

[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.120]
I must be in Orlando.

[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.720]
I must be listening to cool radio.

[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:05.700]
But it was magic.

[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:06.260]
Hmm.

[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:07.100]
With a J.

[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:09.360]
For less of this.

[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:22.460]
I'm going to do it.

[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:22.460]

[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:22.980]
Is that all right?

[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.300]
And his father's a douchebag.

[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:25.600]
But that's what it goes.

[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:28.740]
Gary Lewis and the Playboys on all-head radio on pirate radio.

[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:29.960]
I'm 61.

[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:31.960]
We pirate radio.

[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:32.240]
Yeah.

[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.340]
Why don't we do it first?

[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:33.860]
Okay.

[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.080]
That was big.

[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:36.460]
We can use her liner.

[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.020]
The original pirate radio.

[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:39.180]
I'm 61.

[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:39.340]
I'm going to do it.

[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:39.340]

[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:39.340]

[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:40.180]
Yeah.

[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:40.180]

[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:40.500]
We'll scoop them.

[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:44.120]
Why don't we all come in with patches over our eyes tomorrow like a sailor's cat?

[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.760]
We'll do our own pirate radio.

[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:47.600]
We'll scoop them again.

[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.680]
We can do their liners before they do them.

[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:49.800]

[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.720]
We can do the liners.

[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.580]
You know, let's have Mitch record a whole bunch of pirate radio stuff.

[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:56.520]
Why not?

[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:57.720]
Why not?

[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:58.200]
Miami.

oh it doesn't let me try let me let me try it again see we expected a lot from

[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.900]

[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:29.760]

[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.220]
the rickeyeki

[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:39.460]
item

[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.860]
holding that on they didn't make a video fault it although the lock ideation care

[01:36:54.860 --> 01:37:01.500]
He doesn't care about it. He's had his lunch. She don't give it next time called before lunch. He's leaner and hungry

[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:06.720]
Before the cookies backed up little leave on the local motion, but they she was not a member of the group

[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.760]
However, Earl Jean King who was the late singer of the cookies told Carol King to hire little leave as her maid

[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:18.160]
Billy Jean King as her maid see she was a leave as me. Yeah, Carol King's maid. Carol King was little leave as made

[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:24.620]
Not yet. I thought I thought babysitter stuck in my hand. It was made

[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:30.520]
Both. Yeah, maybe another another interesting thing was that this Earl Jean lady was the first person to record the song

[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.800]
I'm into something good that Herman Turmitz covered as their first hit. Well, I'll tell you you are so cool about

[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:41.040]
Amazing, man. It's a porza warning that Chuck Barry you played about a half hour ago was bogus. That's not the real version

[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:47.960]
Does that surprise you now you ought to get the great 28. That's a good CD. Okay, whatever you say Phil and tell me the audio chain is set up

[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.580]
There for voice not for music. It could use a little more bass and maybe a little more high treble some compression

[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:56.700]
Yeah, that's too. It needs compression this station. Okay, I'm up and it's talking exactly

[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.000]
We already got part of that

[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:01.540]
Have a great day Phil. You too. See you

[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:05.000]
Little way to put yeah, we already got half of that

[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.400]
We got an open line in a brow or there it goes boy. This one to our it's like legendary. Okay, incredible

[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.600]
It's Steve's in here early opening up his mail

[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:21.580]
Getting ready for his two a priest. Oh, where the hell is that record? I got to get that I got to stand by now. Oh, jeez

[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.340]
You know what ever happened to that rack we were gonna have on the wall for the CDs

[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:29.100]
I got like four different cases here full of CDs

[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:36.180]
Whatever happened to that or is that getting am I getting carried away now again? You think that's unrealistic? I guess

[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.140]
Wouldn't be right there on the wall wouldn't bother anybody just a nice thing

[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.860]
No, I wanted to give everybody a preview of what's gonna be on Steve's show today's got these

[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.880]
Yes, we're coming in

[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:52.180]
You know this with the D this is to mm-hmm from spike

[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.000]
Oh my god, that spike gave us wow

[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:02.400]
So anyway the two priests were sitting in his bar and the blurs head was spinning around

[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:07.380]
Nice letters

[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:12.460]
Hi, Slutter from one of our good friends. Oh, by the way, I want you. I need to see you okay and

[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:17.360]
In about two minutes. I need to see I got something to show you that you're just gonna pass out on the floor

[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.660]
I'm talking a 21 after the hour at WIO

[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:33.500]
Right 124 WID with a fax machine is just loaded with stuff. Yes, he knows he knows just the please not for on the year

[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:38.140]
It says you oh here's one of those spy reports that are generally

[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:44.140]
Pretty much on target. Mm-hmm. It says you may recall that the pirate radio story

[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:48.460]
Was broken by us in a previous community case so good luck to the BLD

[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:50.620]
Who what's that from?

[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:55.640]
It's from the Zeta phantom reporter don't you recognize the I don't remember them breaking

[01:39:55.640 --> 01:40:00.000]
We are compelled however to point out that the story may no longer be operative

[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:07.160]
Yes, it appears as though they may stay the course after all they've swallowed a bitter pill and turned the corner

[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:13.600]
This is shocking to say the least but we will keep you apprised to further developments by the way pirate radio is not as Glenn described it

[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:19.600]
We don't want to pick on him since he's somewhat sensitive but the format is actually a combination of metal AOR and

[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.300]
high-energy dance music

[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:25.280]
very teen intensive if you want a sample call

[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.180]
It's got a number. Oh who's on a bat line?

[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:36.240]
It's always busy whenever we make he's son. No, we're not talking to Mickey's son

[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.180]
I'm not going out of your mind. I'm not putting him on here. It has the bat line. Yeah, he's calling on the bat

[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:48.440]
Like I'm not interested in any Mickey Dane stories. Okay. I don't want nothing to do with Mickey Dane or her son or anybody else

[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.320]
Good luck to her. I wish you're nothing but the best

[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.060]
Okay, let's punch this up

[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:59.060]
Can you believe that we get that call like 10 minutes ago and right away her son is on the line

[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.740]
I don't hear it. Mm-hmm. It's that ring

[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.980]
No, it's playing but it's not is like the pot way down or something Nick

[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:12.400]
Is the pot way down? I can just barely hear this call. It's on a bat line. It's

[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:18.260]
This

[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:19.580]
This is a sample great

[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:21.940]
What does that mean?

[01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:29.460]
Did they say it's not the way I described it as I what they said it says it's a combination of metal a.o. R

[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.300]
And high-energy dance music. Okay. Well, that's just like a more discreet

[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:38.560]
Well, that's what's like why said either he said they would play like deaf leopard and then they might play Madonna right after

[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.280]
Yeah, yeah, everybody sounds pretty delicious to me. I'll tell you that

[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:48.600]
Really strange, okay, but you know the question is how many formats are left?

[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.700]
Right good question. That's the question and this is a new format 126 at W.I.O.D

[01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:01.600]
Well, we just got so much stuff going on here. It is frightening. Let's take a call from Pompano. Hello

[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.180]
Pompano

[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.420]
Okay, nice chatting with you. Femwork Pines. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah

[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.960]
Took me about a week to get my courage up the call again after I chased the bird out of the room last week

[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.440]
Talking about the Cubs. I'd like to start off today with

[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.160]
Some news and you might not be aware of but

[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:24.440]
Evon don't call me Ivan Lendle went down in five sets to Michael Chang

[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.860]
Well, I'm real happy for him. Okay, maybe he can get some new teeth. Well, that was supposed to be something for the bird

[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:36.480]
I know I don't really care about the Ivan or Ivan Lindler

[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:40.460]
I don't need right. I just want to make the bird happy but getting back to baseball

[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:45.460]
Don't you think it's ironic that Shao Wang, Dunston and Riny, San Bernard, each had two two run homers on the same day?

[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.600]
Yeah, pretty good stuff there now it's gonna be

[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:56.360]
Where's the three game series to see who four four four game series? Yeah, four were the Metz four more were the Cardinals

I wish you could play about ten with the Philly's how about them Orioles? Yeah, how about those pirates?

[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.720]
They really suck too, don't they?

[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:08.100]
Everybody all the Metz fans are gonna say oh we're really coming back. We want to four in a row

[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:12.240]
Yeah, three against the pirates the pirates couldn't beat the Vassar

[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.120]
Alright Neil, I just want to say hello to Scotch book

[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:21.180]
I want to know when Alice's restaurant's opening up again and say hello to good friend of mine Johnny

[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.080]
Start us to have to be out in Las Vegas, okay?

[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:27.600]
Well, we can't give personal messages on the air but have a nice day 28 past one at W. I. D

[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:32.940]
We have an open line in Broward and one in Boka and we've got a couple of things here a couple of somethings in the mail

[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:33.740]
There's one package

[01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:38.340]
I don't like these packages, you know because they're sealed like I

[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.120]
Gonna have to put the mic down

[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.800]
one moment please it's alright

[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:48.980]
Someone faxed me something here about Morton down a junior syndicated show

[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.060]
I don't know what this is out of the New York Times maybe

[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.600]
Morton down a junior

[01:43:53.320 --> 01:44:00.000]
Gasping for air it says MCA television with syndicates the Morton down a junior show to about 70 stations across the country

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.720]
It's having trouble persuading those stations to renew the show for this fall

[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.740]
now this is from

[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:08.720]
MCA and

[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.960]
Quantum Media Inc. They produced the show and it says some stations while not can't cancelling the show

[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:20.620]
Have moved it to less desirable times and this includes of course New York's channel nine which is owned by MCA

[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:23.420]
And that's where they taped the show in Cacacast, New Jersey

[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:28.440]
On June 12 Mr. Downey will switch times with our cineole halls

[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:35.000]

Ladies and gentlemen Frank the audience gapes what the hell is it?

That's what it says here. It says what the hell is it isn't that what I just said the name is spelled with a pH in a hard C

[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:24.480]
I'm Frank the kids howl and this tiny daughter of

He aged with a heart

[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:18.620]
Oh

Listen, I asked a question. Yeah, are you gonna watch inside storage tonight? Wow, what's on it?

[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.500]
There's a new new topic new subject something never ever before

[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.740]
Discussed anywhere

[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:22.800]
Lee Harvey Oswald act alone. Yeah, I've never heard of that subject before that ought to be pretty exciting

[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:28.360]
Well, I think I might be interested. I heard tomorrow night. They're gonna ask did John Wilkes Booth really do it?

[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:33.820]
Who's that? Oh, yeah, that's guy Shirley's older brother. Yeah, well Neil

[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.760]
Mike, how you doing Glenn?

[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.200]
Who is this George?

[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:42.700]
Why is I'm just a dedicated listener with the hotline

[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.900]
He's not on the hotline

[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.660]
Seven I'm sorry. Why is everybody attacking this poor guy? They're a cute

[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.640]
Next you'll accuse him of playing rotisserie baseball

[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:59.840]
You don't play roach sir. Let me ask you a question. Do you play rotisserie baseball? I don't even know what that is good

[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:06.640]
Okay, you're okay in my book, but it feels good. I'll try. Okay. Have a great day. Okay. What a poor guy

[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.580]
The poor guy

[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:13.520]
Is this Frank like I said one of the cuts is called Martina

[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:16.800]
On his album by Frank

[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.520]
With my hit song swively

[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:34.920]
I don't get it. I don't I'm still not sure what this is this can't make

[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:42.300]
Billy Tipton looked like your average run of the mil guy. I don't know if this is Frank with a pH it says

[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:48.780]
We asked the soul searching question who is Frank and what the hell is it?

[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:53.100]
She responds with a parody of French movie style Frank Frank is just Frank

[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:56.940]
She has an image that is that some consider butch others film

[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:02.100]
Yeah, but Frank is neither butch nor film no roll. She's about as feminine as Charlton

[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:06.360]
No roles are defined by fair. Yeah, that's for sure with the pee

[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:10.300]
It said the audience gasped what the hell is it?

[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:12.660]
And that was exactly my reaction

[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:17.040]
So I guess I don't feel out of touch with reality that's exactly what I said what the hell is it?

[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.040]
