[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.460]
Which means we'll have to stick the mic back up on the thing here. I don't like doing that. I get very insecure

[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.380]
Very insecure. It's like the old days like the good old days when we used to talk to people who had Nike you over three boy

[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.380]
I remember those days

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.320]
With fondness

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.040]
Mm-hmm. Well, if the layman you on here never heard anybody

[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.380]

Look at his he's got all these plates and he's got eight million curry pops and all his

[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.160]
Rice and vegetables and you think he was gonna feed both Chinese armies here today

[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.840]
Wow, yeah, they probably can use the help right now anyway. This is the time

[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.280]
I know it's early. It's not 11 o'clock yet

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.400]
But now is the time if there are people in the building want some of this great Thai chow

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.420]
This is the time to do it because otherwise it's gonna go to waste and we're gonna have to throw it out

[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.680]
It's gonna be just a depressing

[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.360]

[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.580]
Mm-hmm every time

[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.000]
Yes, even Henry's having a little curry pop

[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.440]

Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm getting emotional. Okay. I went to a you know

[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.840]
You got a certain talk show host in the afternoon there comes on around. I don't know what time he comes on

[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.540]
He's got a certain advertiser a restaurant

[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.040]
Live something I can't remember what it is and I went there a few weeks ago and

[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.340]
1057

[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.120]
See I'm not gonna play that game if Steve wants play that game

[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.380]
It's juvenile and childish will do it with the fondue plays only because it fits in it's a direct. Yeah, it's a very narrow

[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.500]
Kind of thing right I guess, but I'm not gonna play that game

[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.940]
So those are your jackasses out there that think you know if you want to do it on his show

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.820]
And he lets it go fine and then I'll just rip the crap out of him again tomorrow

[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.360]
But I think it's embarrassing

[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.420]
And then you know and the hypocrisy of it when wings plus brought in at great food yesterday

[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.820]
And he was just coming here practically begging on his hands and knees and licking the table and sucking up his celery and the blue cheese and

[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.300]
Giving fat rich dirty looks because he didn't leave a few of those great garlic wings and then he's like you know

[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.280]
Throwing little size shot at him, okay?

[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.800]
Speaking of shot. This is probably one for you. Hello. Hello. Yeah bird

Also got a little spider-port for you

[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.980]

[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.020]
Yeah, she's no only Zeta's the only one she's ever done. So she went on a competing morning show

[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.000]
Well, she was there with Donna summer. Oh

[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.900]
Now what does this tell us is she's going up against the classic army? I don't know this is shocking. Yeah, what a turn coat

I wonder if you guys are telling okay

[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.800]
Well, be sure you leave all your possessions at home because if somebody gets ripped off it'll be your fault

[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.340]
All right, you guys have a good day you too. All right. Bye. Bye

[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.340]

[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.540]
You

[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.140]
La

[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.800]
You can hear the sound of the car

[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.060]
Tennis is on the track's own

[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.200]
The single side is in the car

[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.340]
Yeah, it's been on so far

[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.780]
It's been on so far

[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.320]
It's been on so far

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.380]
Basement lights and gangway fights

[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.320]
Highest rain flooding all this night

[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.960]
The most empty is a candy car

[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.540]
Yeah, it's been on so far

[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.020]
Oh, and on so far

[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.740]
Oh, I feel so close and get so far

[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:18.300]
Where are you, little star?

[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.740]
We go, we go, little star

[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.540]
I wonder where you are

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.120]
Who the hell knows the classic

[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.160]
I've had you like a diamond on the sky

[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.620]
And all I have to know

[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.640]
Grounds is freeing your destiny

[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.120]
Some memory I've played in step 4

[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.840]
It's written on the subway wall

[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.660]
Oh, and on so far

[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:56.980]
Where are you, little star?

[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.420]
Oh, and on so far

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.940]
Where are you, little star?

[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.660]
You know I'm not living out of my name

[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.680]
We slowly went our separate ways

[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.960]
Right in the night, there's a song from the cold again

[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.580]
It's been on so far

[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.040]
It's been on so far

[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.680]
Where are you, little star?

[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.900]
Girl, you can't go back

[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.200]
No, you can't go back

[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.040]
Girl, you say it in the end

[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.800]
Yeah

[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.180]
Denny Bird went the other way

[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.900]
Thank God

[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.800]
Anyway, that's written on the subway wall

[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.040]
Little star, and it's Leon from No Franky

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.500]
With Paul Simon

[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.060]
A lot of interesting people on the album too much

[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.860]
Patty Smith, what?

[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.100]
Patty Smith, Mark Lennon

[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.100]
Keith Scott, Brian Adams on Drive-On Night

[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.320]
Paul Simon, Lou Reed

[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.420]
What do you want, Denny Bird?

[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.780]
What is your story, little Tommy?

[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.740]
What do you want?

[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.220]
What do you want?

[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.680]
Is Arnold coming later?

[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.820]
Great, because Leon's supposed to be here around noon

[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.580]
We're going to feed him and play some of his music

[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.500]
And then Dion Grupe

[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.620]
Oh, Denny Bird's a Dion Grupe

[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.440]
Well, you can come in and you can just make a fool of yourself, Wally

[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.980]
Same with Fat Rich, okay?

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.860]
Who showed up on Wednesday instead of Thursday this week

[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.840]
But then, of course, he realized Trappers Ali was coming with a big banquet tomorrow

[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.780]
So, probably, we'll have to come back tomorrow

[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.700]
Because we don't want to make his feel lonely on Thursday

[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.260]
Here's a collect call from New York

[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.120]
Hey!

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.020]
Yeah!

[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.580]
Neil!

[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400]
What's happening down there?

[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.440]
Oh, man, it's so exciting you wouldn't believe it

[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.920]
We got riots in the streets and we got people giving away $500 bills

[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.700]
Holy cow, it sounds like the big apple

[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.060]
They're doing that up here too

[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.980]
Yes, same old crap

[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.400]
Except the weather sucks

[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.400]
Really? Is it raining there?

[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.840]
It's raining, I've been here for five days, it's raining every day

[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.560]
But is it raining hard, sir?

[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.160]
Everything's hard here, Neil, you know that

[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.680]
No, come on, is it raining? No, it's not, that's a problem with New York

[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.560]
Is it raining hard?

[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.900]
It's raining hard

[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.200]
Good, because I want that game to get rained out tonight

[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.380]
Oh, yes, yes

[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.460]
We don't want good and to have to, we want good and to get all screwed up, you know what I'm saying?

[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.900]
Yeah, Neil, I have a spy report

[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.940]
I'm listening to Howard Stern up here

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.360]
Okay, yeah

[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.540]
I heard all this good reports about him

[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.020]
From who?

[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.500]
You know, from the New Yorkers, of course

[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.560]
Yeah, you hear the good reports about the Metz-2 from the New Yorkers, right?

[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.860]
That's right, that's right

[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.280]
Listen, Bon Jovi and Sam Kennison

[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.240]
blew him away today, blew Howard Stern away today

[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.140]
It's supposed to be, it's a big joke

[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.780]
And this is what the whole show is about

[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.580]
It's supposed to be on the show today

[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.700]
And they just didn't show up

[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.640]
So, that's what's going on up here

[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.700]
Not too much of your statement

[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.280]
Well, that's pretty exciting, I'll tell you that

[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.980]
Unbelievable

[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.980]
Howard will have to do an extra lesbian dilatate this week

[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.120]
Anyhow, I called because I want to be your official New York spy up here

[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.940]
I need to get the bat line, I'm going to be away from Sunny South Florida for about six months

[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.440]
I want to call you

[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.740]
Can I ask you, can I wait a minute?

[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.940]
Sure, when you calm down a minute, stop screaming

[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.320]
It's not the lead followers show

[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.420]
Can I ask you a question?

[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.040]
Yes sir

[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.200]
Why do you need the bat line?

[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.520]
Didn't you get right through here today?

[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.120]
It was amazing, but you know what I did?

[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.840]
I tried on the, what am I on the...

[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.640]
You're on the vocal line

[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.520]
I'm on the vocal line

[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.660]
Palm beaches and lit even now

[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.160]
You can get through on either one of these anytime

[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.940]
Don't give me that crap about the bat line

[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.220]
I want to call you every Wednesday at 12 o'clock

[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.020]
to give you the word of the day, how's that?

[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.440]
Great

[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.280]
During lunch

[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.720]
You're going to be in New York for how long?

[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.260]
Unfortunately, six months

[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:44.720]
Wow

[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.860]
When I come back down here

[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.440]
Boy, you're going to see a lot of garbage coming going oh six months

[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.520]
I got a nice boat down there, I want to take out the WIOD staff

[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.520]
I just want to say in spite of the fact that it's taking up time from your call

[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.180]
that the coconut milk soup that Boon brought today is the best ever

[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.800]
Is that right?

[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.360]
It is incredible

[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.060]
And I hadn't put a little rice, he brought a whole thing of white rice today

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.940]
enough to feed both Chinese armies

[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.400]
And this is tremendous today

[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.420]
Listen Neil

[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.180]
The guys here more

[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.320]
I told them all about you

[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.640]
They want to say hello, we got John on the phone here

[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.920]
Is John on the phone?

[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.380]
I am Neil

[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.700]
John, we're those pictures we were supposed to see

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.140]
What's going on John?

[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.200]
I don't know but I hear you guys are funny down there

[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.420]
We are funny here, if we were up there we wouldn't be too funny

[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.940]
Because we're not, you know, we just don't fit in with the vibes

[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.640]
We don't have a lot of garbage all around us

[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.840]
It's just one of those things, you know

[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.220]
No, it's the ark is great isn't it?

[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.280]
Come on John, be honest

[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.560]
For about five, ten minutes it's terrific

[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.820]
Yeah, that's about it

[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.340]
Yeah, when the sun comes down every couple of months it's terrific

[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.680]
It's about 90 degrees sunny and human here John

[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.260]
So we don't want to make you feel bad, okay?

[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.660]
And don't forget, better days are coming

[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.340]
The Yankees and the Metz both laws last night

[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.320]
We don't want you to feel bad

[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.960]
The Metz are

[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.360]
How about those nicks, huh?

[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.600]
Yeah, that's doing good to

[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.980]
How about those islanders, huh?

[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.920]
How about Phil Esposito?

[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.600]
Well, it just wasn't the year for New York

[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.560]
Listen guys, have a great day

[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.280]
Hey Neil, take it easy

[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.200]
Talk to you next week

[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:03.860]
Bye

[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.760]
How do you like that?

[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.000]
Very high pressure call

[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.220]
Now you know what they mean by the high intensity in New York

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.340]
My stomach is churning

[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.920]
You too

[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:11.780]
Boy

[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.080]
It's either that or I'm eating the soup too fast one or the other

[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.600]
But boy

[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.560]
Anyway, it's time to talk about the only fondue way on it

[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.940]
Hey, you like 26 past 11 at WIOD

[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.900]
Deon is in the building so he'll be up here any second down

[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.660]
Good timing too

[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.860]
Isn't that great just on the heels of all this lunch showing up?

[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.280]
You think it's an accident?

[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.740]
Oh man, this is a little more than I bargained for, isn't it?

[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.080]
What do you mean?

[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.260]
All is food

[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.720]
Oh, yeah, well you asked for it

[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.100]
All it runs?

[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.740]
Well, it's what we asked for but it just you know what it actually shows up

[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.140]
You can relate to things like that

[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.400]
After something that's almost unbelievable and when it actually shows up

[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.780]
You're almost overwhelmed by it?

[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.980]
Have you never had an experience like that?

[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.760]
Mm-hmm

[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.200]
Of course I have

[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.060]
Okay, 26 past 11 at WIOD

[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.120]
Here's a call in Miami

[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.520]
Hello

[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.640]
Hey, uh, what can I say to Rantel to make him get him upset like you do?

[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.340]
I mean, what you know about him, I don't know

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.020]
To get, what do I know about him?

[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.400]
Yeah, because boy, when you know he, they say you're a name over there man

[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.020]
He goes, uh, bunkers

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.640]
Does he really?

[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.060]
I'm telling you, I don't know what you know about him but you can really get it

[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.580]
I don't know too much about her to be, I have about him to be on him here

[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.560]
Okay, thank you

[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.440]
Okay, pal, have a good life

[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.620]
Boy, Alice is apoplectic? Huh?

[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.920]
I can't believe that, look at Dion just sliding in here like he's been here all of his life

[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.600]
And he's, he's smelled the lunch downstairs

[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:35.940]
How you doing, Dion?

[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:36.940]
Okay, good

[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.900]
Great to see you, boy your album is so great, it's just phenomenal

[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.400]
If we can only get this douche bag next door to play it then we'll really have something going, you know?

[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:43.840]
Alright

[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.360]
So anyway, what do we start Dion off with?

[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.520]
Because actually the whole purpose of you being here is for lunch

[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.260]
I get that

[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.880]
That's the bird, this is fat rich and that's basically the size of it

[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.400]
All these other people wandering in and out, we don't know who they are

[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.380]
We don't know who they are, they just come in to eat every day, okay?

[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.620]
Now see, you'd never been on a radio show where all of you'd was eaten and get paid for it, haven't you?

[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.380]
Where's the hero sandwiches?

[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.520]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.380]
He wants the hero sandwiches, he wants the...

[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.900]
Where's the stuff from Atlantic City?

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.080]
Don't you remember White Castle in New York?

[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.620]
Do you remember sure?

[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.360]
You probably used to eat there all the time before he got rich and famous

[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.840]
Give him some of the little royal castle burgers, it'll make him feel like yesterday

[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.800]
When he was poor and broke on the streets

[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.620]
Kind of like he is now in Boca

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.760]
Did you really used to live in North Bay Village?

[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.640]
No, I lived in North Miami 20 years in the same house

[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.540]
But all my friends moved out and I was lonely

[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.740]
I was in North Miami

[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.600]
Nobody lives in North Miami, how do I know what it would have been?

[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.860]
I did

[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.420]
Long story, me, long story

[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.400]
This is a paradise for Bronx kids, you know?

[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.800]
When you're in that...

[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:42.940]
Yeah

[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.840]
When I was in playground

[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.760]
I tell you, when I had my first daughter in Bronx, New York City, I was taken...

[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:49.940]
First daughter?

[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:50.520]
Door

[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.320]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.840]
You can't tell he's from New York, do I?

[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.400]
I still like him that record.

[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.300]
My favorite line when he says, a Rick Shore, that's my favorite

[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.720]
You know, the accent has gotten worse down here, I don't know why

[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.240]
Because you're all with all the Yorkers down here, that's a problem

[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.340]
I don't know why

[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.520]
Yeah, I was driving this little girl, I mean this, you know, couple of day old kid back

[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.140]
on the cross Bronx expressway and all these trucks were farting in my face

[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:22.080]
And I mean, it was dirty and all of a sudden I got aware of these little clean lungs

[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.620]
Next, you know, me, I treated myself terrible but this little angel like next to me

[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.920]
I said, I'm getting out of here and I moved down to Miami in 68

[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.880]
And I was, I have three daughters and they were raised in the same house up in North Miami

[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.240]
And it was great neighborhood man, I liked it

[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.260]
One real lot of time, yeah

[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:40.760]
Yeah

[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.080]
And now you're in Boka?

[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:42.840]
Yeah

[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.740]
I didn't know, I didn't think I'd like Boka, I tell you the truth, I thought it was gonna be like

[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.180]
We hate Boka, we don't, it's not impersonal, I don't think we can get here, we hate it

[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.880]
Maybe we just don't understand it

[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.820]
You don't know, I moved up there, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do

[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.000]
But the people got great attitude, the people I met, really

[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.680]
So they know who you are?

[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:07.320]
Yeah, you know, when that, I live in a little unreality, I got it, I bring the best out in people

[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.640]
For some reason, I don't know what it is, it's just, I have a lot of fun up there

[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.400]
But I have some real good friends that we're really open to each other

[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.380]
What if it wouldn't be something if we got good calls on the Boka line while he was here?

[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.000]
Well, because that would prove it, if we can get good calls on the Boka line while you're here

[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.040]
Because we never got a good call in Boka since we've been here, have we?

[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.320]
Maybe one?

[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.520]
Maybe one, probably somebody you know

[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.960]
Pretty cool, yeah, pretty cool

[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.920]
Anyway, your buddy Tony called before it said to say hi, your best buddy

[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.280]
I bet you got a lot of best buddies that'll be calling in

[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.640]
He's probably a friend of somebody who used to be my uncle

[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.040]
Yeah, in the Bronx and like that, you know

[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.440]
Who's got to the same Maudelli?

[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.720]
Who's Tony, Tony who?

[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.320]
I don't know, is the way Owen Munney is probably

[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.440]
He said he knows you and Larry King, something like that

[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.120]
So what is the experience like of seeing yourself on BH1 all the time?

[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.200]
It's just the video runs constantly. What is that sensation like, you know?

[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.140]
You know, it's kind of like the old days, you know

[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.460]
Let me just take you back for a minute

[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.700]
Wait a minute, did you say it takes you back?

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.900]
You know what it said on the Zeta Billboard?

[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.900]
You haven't been over the Zeta before you came here, are you Dion?

[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:12.420]
No

[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.980]
It takes you back, I can't believe it. This is an Ojampra Vakatur here

[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:17.960]
I like to go back

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.920]
I come from a very, you know, the kind of, I don't know, where do you come from?

[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.520]
Rochester

[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.400]
Okay, well in New York, you know, but upstate

[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.200]
It's kind of like that. I come from like a ghetto section

[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.160]
We've called it a neighborhood. It was an Italian neighborhood

[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.080]
Like the Italians lived on one side of the Bronx Park Zoo

[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.960]
And the Jews lived on the other side and then on the south side with the Puerto Ricans

[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.020]
And then we, you know, I like that

[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:46.900]
So in my neighborhood, when I got, I was 17, I got my first hit record

[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.220]
And when those records were played on the radio

[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:57.140]
And somebody said, number one, this week, the wanderer, the whole neighborhood

[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.900]
All their windows were opened and the cars, the cars, the tops were down

[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.860]
The radios were blessed and the whole neighborhood celebrated

[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.660]
They all came out the window at the same time saying,

[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.160]
Fran, they were yelling at my mother through the alleyways

[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.420]
And I, it's not when you're on your son's side

[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.680]
You think he's gonna step on himself?

[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.600]
I said, I don't want to step on yourself, I would have been embarrassing

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.380]
But it was like a commune now that I, I, I, I, I, I realize it now

[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.380]
It's time now the whole country sees it at the same time, you know

[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.580]
You have videos of a strange thing today, you see music, you know

[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.720]
You know who did the first video? I don't want to show like I'm showing off

[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.000]
But I saw a thing on, Ozzy Nelson created the first video

[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.720]
He did Rick Nelson doing Travelling Man

[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.940]
And he did it like in his basement, you know, with real primitive equipment and everything

[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.600]
And he, he superd all these films of Hawaii in the background and Alaska and so on

[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.780]
That was the first video

[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.780]
Did you learn something? You come here, you come here, you come here, you learn something already

[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.860]
I did one of the first professional videos that they were putting out on the market

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.400]
It was called the telebox at the time when I did Ruby Baby

[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.120]
Or he's pushing me now, saying

[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.380]
Well, it was, it was about 1962

[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.760]
And they had this, they rented this house

[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.920]
They rented this yet

[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:21.940]
Rumuubi

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.040]
Yeah, they rented this jet in France

[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:30.000]
And I did this whole stick on the plane with 14 stortuses and the champagne

[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.100]
And the, you know, playing the playboy and all

[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.480]
And what this video was, I don't know if you remember it, but they had these

[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.100]
Like television screens on top of the jukeboxes, you threw a quarter in, I remember them down on Times Square

[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.720]
And you wouldn't only hear this song, well at the time it was only a dime

[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.660]
But if you threw a quarter and you'd see the, you'd see your video on top of the TV

[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.380]
Never heard of it

[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.220]
It only lasted, it must have been three months

[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.480]
And so for some reason they pulled it off the market, but I have a couple of those home

[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.460]
Anyway, yes, me a question, I never answered

[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.060]
There's things being played on VH1

[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:14.000]
And in my house, I don't know if my kids are impressed, you know, but you know, I find myself throwing the channel of VH1

[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.520]
Yeah, they're playing it, you know

[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.940]
I haven't seen it yet, they're playing in heavy rotation

[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.760]
Yeah, I get it all the time

[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.660]
I've seen it

[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.980]
I'm kind of excited about it

[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.820]
Yeah, because I found a guy up in the Pompano has a bunch of old films of the neighborhood

[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:34.420]
And I nobody had a video or a film, you know, a camera in my neighborhood

[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.580]
Who did, who did, who did, who came out on the streets with the camera?

[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.600]
No one except this guy that I met in Pompano says I got some old films of you driving around on your first Kaiser

[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.680]
And went out of business in 54

[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.060]
I said bring them all

[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.380]
Well that's the same guy, it's got the Rob Lowe films, isn't it?

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.740]
I think the same guy, yeah

[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.000]
He goes around with everybody

[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.440]
But anyway, in this video on VH1, you see a lot of these old films

[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.160]
Oh, that's what he came up with, we inserted them

[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.780]
Yeah, they're actually on Cretone Avenue and Bronx, New York

[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.420]
Black and white films, yeah, that's right, I remember

[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.060]
I'm telling you, Neil, I'm nervous

[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.520]
Oh, come on, I can't believe it

[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.220]
I'm nervous to buy one

[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.820]
Because I listen to you on radio, a man

[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.960]
I said, you're nervous

[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.380]
I regret it

[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:22.360]
We got a legend in here, look at this guy, he's got a monster in the industry

[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.700]
And he comes in here with a couple of shleppers like that, and he's nervous

[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.920]
All we do is sit in the air and eat, we get paid for

[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.220]
All right, let me do a little food spot, I know it's unusual on the show that we talk about food

[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.660]
But charade is over right now

[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.540]
Great, what is he talking about?

[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.860]
I think he's catching it from you

[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.920]
It's 1137 at WID, little Tommy, oh wait a minute, I remember that album

[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.000]
Columbia, Donna the Primadonna

[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.200]
Right? I remember it was just yesterday

[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.420]
It was a song about my sister, she hasn't turned, she hasn't changed at all

[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.680]
We got it all in here, when did you ever see an AM station play a music like this, huh?

[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.160]
Not these days

[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.700]
Not anymore, not the old days, yeah

[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.420]
You used to do that stuff in New York with Murray, the K and all those guys

[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.680]
Way back when before we were born most of us

[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.160]
Sonny Fox called, how do you like that?

[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.940]
What does Sonny want? Sonny coherent today?

[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.820]
What does he want? Is he on the phone?

[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.240]
Is he on the phone? No

[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.300]
Not on the phone, I thought Sonny would want to talk to Dion

[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.340]
You would think

[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.460]
He couldn't hold on to the phone along, he dropped it on the floor with Grandma Boone

[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.400]
Okay, thank for calling Sonny, nice to hearing from you

[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.140]
Anyway, if there are people who want to talk to Dion and just take a lot over and make him feel more comfortable

[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.560]
Because he's nervous as a packer

[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.040]
I don't understand why

[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.880]
Now I want to ask you seriously about this album, is it getting played?

[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.180]
I mean, you keep telling me it's on VH1 all the time

[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.100]
I don't watch VH1, but I'm going to start, so I can see it

[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.480]
The album is sensational, and I'm not just saying that because you're here

[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.460]
In fact, the first day that I played it, John Hambrick, who does the news on Channel 4, you know, Johnny's the news anchor on 4

[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.720]
He was in New York for a long time

[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.480]
Called in and he said, I got to know the name of that album, he said, what is it?

[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.880]
I'm going to go over to specs right now and buy it

[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.860]
And I said the name of the album is Yo Frank, he gets Dion's new album

[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.340]
Then the next day Gordon Stevens, who used to be on Channel 4 for about 100 years called in

[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.680]
And with the same thing, he said, it's the best album I've heard in here, I got to get the name of it

[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.920]
Well, you're the only guy playing it

[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.920]
Yeah, I don't understand that

[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.020]
But VH1's helping out a lot, I mean

[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.680]
But why aren't the stations planted?

[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.580]
Is because you haven't been around for so long?

[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.800]
I think it's a lot of what you've been talking about, they got the computers and they wait

[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.660]
Everybody's afraid to love it

[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.940]
This put your neck through this bill lies over at ETR, man

[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.180]
This is right up their alley, they should have this stuff on right now

[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.680]
Everybody talks rock and roll, but you are a real rock and roll disjunking

[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.300]
There's not many left

[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.120]
And I mean, the guys that take a step out on a little risk

[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.900]
Oh, a little gut feeling

[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.160]
And some balls is what you're trying to use to do in the old days

[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.040]
Well, that's rock and roll

[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.380]
That's pretty pathetic that these guys want to play at that

[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.880]
Yeah, I mean, you know

[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.800]
Now, I'm curious, you know, maybe I'm naive, but I don't understand like how these sessions come about

[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.200]
Where you get all these incredible people on the same album

[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.160]
You got Brian Adams, which that's a great cut by the way, drive all night

[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.880]
That's one that they're all great, but that's tremendous

[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.300]
And Paul Simon is on there on, written on the subway wall

[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.280]
And you got Lou Reed, Patty Smith, Mark Lennon, Keith Scott

[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.040]
Where do you drum up all these people to do a session?

[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:24.080]
Well, I tell you, I was at the rock and roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies

[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.320]
Before the ceremonies even got started

[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.380]
I was in the middle of the album that week

[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.060]
And Paul Simon came up to me at the dinner

[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:36.020]
Or right before the ceremony got started and he said, Deon, I hear you doing an album

[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.740]
I'd love to be a part of it if you got anything for me to do, give me a, I said, glad you asked

[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.360]
So he said, well, I have Saturday available, I'll come down so the whole day was, he came in

[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:53.460]
And you know, I had this song, I had the whole vocal done

[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:58.720]
Finished and everything, but that little star, the little segment in the middle

[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:06.420]
Slow down, Paul Simon came in, I just thought it would be a perfect part for him

[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:16.220]
And when he did come in to the session, it was very interesting because this guy is very versed in Duwap

[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:21.000]
He grew up with it, so he not only sang the lead on the song

[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.320]
He did all the backgrounds to himself, he did a five-part harmony background to himself

[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.840]
And he spent some time and it was wonderful

[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.540]
And I had one of my daughters at the session

[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.040]
And, gosh, he's never been out of Miami so she, when he came into the control room, she said,

[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.000]
You have a video out with what's his name?

[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:49.440]
And he said, Chevy Chase, she said, and you have a very popular album out, what's it called?

[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.020]
He said, Graceland, she said, you're a very popular singer, what's your name?

[00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:01.100]
He said, Paul Simon, she said, right, all you have such a sweet boy, he took it in a good spirit

[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.920]
Yeah, because she's great, he's terrific

[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.660]
Well, he was, I just felt, you know, it's stuff like that that makes you feel good

[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.480]
But that's why it's such a shame that people aren't playing this stuff because it's not just you

[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.800]
Which you do a great job on every cut, but you've got all these like legends like Paul Simon on there

[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.260]
Which is a one and a million thing to get you guys together on this

[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.960]
And it's an, and every cut on here brings something back

[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.060]
You know, you mentioned that before about taking you back

[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.420]
Every cut on here like on Yo Frank, he isn't that the one where it starts out like the wanderer with the same stuff

[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.920]
Every cut has got a little bit of something like this has got a little star by the elegance

[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.060]
It's got that little part in there that Paul Simon doesn't

[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:42.300]
And in every cut you find a little something that's a throwback to those good old days

[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.780]
And it's interesting because it's an 80's album

[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.240]
But a lot of elements of my music are my music is

[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.320]
Is black music filtered through an Italian neighborhood that came out with an attitude

[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:01.160]
In fact, in fact, it's a funny thing today they would call it fusion, but at the time

[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.860]
Like I told you about this Jewish neighborhood on the other side of Bronzoo

[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.680]
I went, I was passing by a synagogue when I was about 19, 20 years old

[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.900]
And I heard all this like ethereal music coming out

[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.080]
So I went in there and I met this can't his name was Cantor Rosembliss

[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.400]
You know something this is incredible, you know why I'm not making this up

[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.180]
But when I listened to a couple of the cuts I said Dion should have been a canter

[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.300]
And I could hear you trying these great Hebrew melodies

[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.520]
Because you've got that certain lill, certain quality in your voice that I hear in canters

[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.820]
I'm going to tell you where it comes from

[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.860]
I didn't know it until like today when I look back

[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.600]
At the elements that got into my music it's really, it's funny

[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.860]
I met this guy Cantor Rosembliss

[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:49.720]
His father was the original jazz singer in the canter in the jazz singer with Joseph

[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.860]
So he's playing the oldest father's records and I hear this, you know that's the...

[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.820]
So I went home, I mean I fell in love with this stuff, he gave me a handful of albums

[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:04.500]
And I started playing this stuff and I wrote songs like Little Diane

[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.500]
Going to cry and all these songs that...

[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.540]
The minor kind of influence, that kind of chanting

[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.360]
So what happened, I guess it's Jewish rock and roll

[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.540]
But maybe today they would call it fusion

[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.100]
That's why Bill Wise won't put on Jewish rock and roll

[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.120]
Anyway there's a mobile on here from the soft floor to group harmony association

[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.980]
Yeah, how you doing Andy Elisiduke?

[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:31.540]
Yeah

[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.020]
Yo, Diane, what's happening?

[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.020]
Hello Duke

[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.860]
How you doing? We really loved you when you came to our meeting

[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.440]
Your an official member of our club and love to have you come back

[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.220]
I just want to say God bless you for keeping the do-op alive even though it's 1980 stuff

[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.380]
Now how many association and that...

[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.980]
At Memories, Lounge and Miramar

[00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.460]
Well tell you why I appreciate you guys

[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.800]
A bunch of guys got up there and sang from their hearts

[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.420]
They didn't care about entertaining

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.240]
Man they just...

[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.420]
That's what it's all about, we go out in the back and just a couple of four or five guys gets together

[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.060]
And picks a couple of songs and outcome some beautiful music

[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.260]
Well I loved the way they presented it because it was the way I remember it

[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.420]
And the way I still am, see...

[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]
Let me tell you a story

[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.020]
These guys, you remember Shana and I, they came out and they all said

[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.080]
I became friendly with a couple of those guys

[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.300]
I think they should shoot all of them, really

[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.380]
Because that was the worst insult to my younger years that I ever saw

[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.800]
To me it was that kind of stuff that made me stop doing my records

[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.660]
Because I hated the way it was presented, it looked like a cartoon

[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:48.920]
When I was a kid and I was on a corner, that music was so much a part of me

[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.280]
And meant so much to me

[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.180]
And that was...

[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:55.160]
It's an ill insult to my younger years when I see these people get...

[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.200]
I have a mic now so I'm going to tell everybody

[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.460]
But it was an insult to my younger years to see these people goofing on themselves

[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.460]
And presenting it like it was...

[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.440]
Even though it's simple music, I don't like goofing on it, I take it really serious

[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.320]
So when I went up to the...

[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.300]
Your meeting there, you did a good job with it, I really appreciate it at there

[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.440]
Well we're looking forward to having you come back and doing some of your new stuff

[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.660]
And just a quick little story, I was in Dateland Shopping Center last week looking for your album

[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.400]
And I went into this place called Record Land

[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.480]
And I asked the young man behind the counter and I said where's your record department?

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.020]
He goes, there's a couple of racks left in the back, everything's CD

[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:38.960]
And I asked him if he had Yo Franky Deon's new album and he says, who is that?

[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.120]
And he's looking through the catalog trying to find your name, I said forget about it, I'm going somewhere else

[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.380]
The man has no taste

[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:51.280]
I mean it's a surprise, go over to stay away from that, go over to specs, they got plenty of work to do

[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.720]
Where I went, there was no problem, there was no problem

[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.040]
Deon, God bless you, look forward to having you come back to our group hominist association meeting

[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.600]
Have a good day, all right take care

[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.460]
Thanks Duke, 1147 at WIODD Honest here, what is 7?

[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:09.040]
Because I want to put on any of these calls that are like really pertinent, see 7 question mark, there's nothing on 7 there, Roger

[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.180]
Oh Veggie, Veggie

[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:18.420]
Oh yeah, now we're going to give you a chance, okay, this is one of your neighbors in Boko, and our chronic callers

[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.300]
Yes, how you doing?

[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:25.520]
Ordinarily we wouldn't put Veggie on, but since he and Deon both live in Boko, we want to prove that there may be hope after all, okay?

[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.620]
Deon, I'm a nice guy, don't miss any of them

[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.420]
I can't be here to redeem yourself Veg

[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:36.140]
Yeah, I just call it so your album is excellent and I'm glad that Neil played it because he turned me on to it, Deon

[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.180]
Thanks

[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:46.480]
I played all the time, I taped it, I played in my car, I played at the house, and it's great even to have you as a neighbor in Boko, even though I never seen him Boko before

[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:55.680]
Yeah, well he's going to tell you where he shops at during the show, so everybody can chase him around and win Dixie, you know, and get his autograph and follow him up and down the aisles

[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.540]
Yeah, I would be real pain in the ass

[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.200]
All right Deon, listen take care and enjoy your lunch, and thanks for letting me go on

[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:08.240]
Great call, Veg, best ever, okay? Thank you, he redeemed himself, I believe it wasn't great, but for him that was sensational

[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.600]
Is that like he's supposed to be on good behavior?

[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.120]
Yeah, he's on the work release right now

[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.980]
We got a lot of callers like that

[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:19.860]
Okay, we got anybody else, and these people all want to talk to Deon, right? Is that correct? Hollywood, hello?

[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:20.860]
Hello?

[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:21.320]
Yeah

[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.840]
Hi, I was on before Deon got there, so I had a couple things to say

[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.320]
Well we don't care about those, sir

[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:29.900]
Okay, wait, wait

[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.140]
You want to talk to Deon?

[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:32.640]
Yeah, I agree with you

[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.380]
Because if not he's going to come over to your house and punch you in a nose, sir

[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:41.560]
I remember Deon back when the Wanderer first came out, it'd be a great time to roll his skate, too

[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.840]
So now you get in the feel of our crowd

[00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.080]
Now he realizes that this is quite as awesome as he thought it was, okay?

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.000]
You feel better now?

[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.600]
Yeah, I've rolled a skate into that, man

[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.900]
Sure, to the Wanderer

[00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:00.400]
In fact, I noticed that Rich had his skate saw before when I put on just a few bars of it, he was just on the verge

[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.820]
And I said you're skating on thin ice, Rich

[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.140]
I was going to say great to punch, is that Deon provocateur?

[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.680]
Yeah, okay, sir, great call

[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.100]
You're not as nervous now, are you?

[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.020]
No, he's not, he realizes that's true

[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.960]
That's true to you of these minor consequences, you know

[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.180]
It's 11 before noon at WIOD, we're going to take a little break here, then we'll come back with some more of these very important calls for Deon

[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.540]
And listen, what do you expect?

[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.620]
There are a bunch of goofballs out there, okay? That's the world today

[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.560]
But you know, really, the music in the early 60s, I guess everything is relative to when you were growing up

[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.020]
And he's not paying any attention to what I'm saying, he's like in the twilight zone

[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.340]
But that was like a whole thing, it was a once in a lifetime thing

[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.360]
That's never going to come back

[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.640]
We're ever going to go through that again

[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.680]
I mean, today you've got all these plastic groups and all these freak-out groups

[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:49.240]
And everything is like cosmetic, everything's on video before it's even on record or on compact disc

[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:58.400]
It's hard for like second, third, fourth generation rock and rollers or you know, the kids today to appreciate

[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.360]
Or it's difficult for them to understand the time when there were no expectations, no rules

[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:10.260]
They didn't have all these computers, there was guys like you around playing what they liked and saying what they liked

[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:15.760]
And not to mention there were no monitors and we didn't get paid and the rest of it

[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:23.100]
But you know, a lot of people don't, you see the world was a lot smaller than I went on tour with Buddy Holly

[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:28.860]
Who was from Lubbid, Texas and Richie Valance, who was from the bodyo in the San Fernando Valley

[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.160]
Were you supposed to be on that plane?

[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.080]
I think, well they asked me to be on it

[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.820]
Yeah, but that's another story

[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:40.880]
The thing that I was trying to bring out is that at the time the world was a lot smaller than they had jets

[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:47.220]
So when we started this tour together, it was just all these different cultures and all the different kinds of music

[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.160]
And nobody came from the south and I came from an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx

[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:59.500]
So I would tell them stories about Joey Bones and Frankie Young-Kiunk and you know, he'd laugh like crazy

[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:06.300]
But you know, see in my neighborhood in the 50s, if you carried a gun, you were a gangster

[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:12.020]
When I got on tour with Buddy Holly, this guy had a gun, he had a shoulder host and I said, what the hell are you doing with a gun?

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.500]
He says, nobody's going to take my money

[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.920]
So I said, well you know, it was peculiar to me but then like I was very sheltered, I didn't know I was never out of the Bronx

[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.140]
Brooklyn was like a foreign world to me

[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.080]
So today I know everybody in Texas carries a gun, they mount them on the back of their trucks, you don't do that in the Bronx

[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:34.020]
So you know, it was a strange thing, it was kind of opening my world to get out of there for all

[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.940]
Again, now we understand why he came to Miami, you could feel at home because everybody had two or three guns in Miami

[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.180]
Okay, it's nine minutes till noon at WIID, if you're a big guy, we don't want to look at it

[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:49.700]
1155 at WIID, Dion is with us and we got a real celebrity caller on the bat line now, a gentleman who has great taste

[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.580]
Are you talking about me?

[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.080]
Who else, John Hambrick? You just mentioned your name, John, your ears must be burning

[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:05.860]
I just wanted to, when I heard that Dion was on with you, after a couple of weeks go, a couple of three weeks go, when you first played the album

[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:11.000]
Or the written on the subway walls cut, I went out and bought the album that afternoon

[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.620]
And I just had to tell you, I think this is the best album of the year so far

[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.340]
Yeah, I agree

[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:25.700]
I was out at, I have a ranch out in Texas, a small farm, just a cracker box operation

[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.820]
And my son is in college in Texas, and he's a fine jazz guitarist

[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.260]
And he plays rock and roll as well, I mean, he's just an all-around guitarist, a real fine musician

[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.280]
And I asked him if he'd heard this album, he said, no, well I had brought the CD with me

[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.660]
And I played it for him, and he then took it back to school to all of his buddies

[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.480]
And they are crazy about this album

[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:58.120]
So despite the fact that I heard you guys sing that it's not getting a lot of airplay here in South Florida

[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:05.180]
And I agree, I haven't heard it played here, I play it all the time, but I did hear it played twice, tell us

[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:11.520]
You know the truth of the matter is that they haven't released a single yet

[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.340]
No, they're releasing a single June 26th, so I'm...

[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.720]
What cut, what will be the single?

[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.920]
They're releasing a song on a call then The Night's The Still

[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.320]
I did a video with Patty Smite who sings on that

[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.840]
And Phil Speck the Fluent from England to be in it

[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.500]
And I got a lot of cameo guys like Barry Levinson and did Rain Man

[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:39.260]
He came by and Ruben Blades, just some friends from California

[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.560]
It was a fun video because I get a chance now, I get all the people I like

[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:50.920]
I'm doing a video, come on, it's a chance to have some fun and get something done

[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.680]
So he would happen with that, I'm excited because...

[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:02.480]
I really truly mean this, I'm not just saying it, of course it's just reflecting my individual taste

[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.660]
But I don't think there's a bad cut on that album

[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.460]
That's correct, you make it, it feels correct

[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.360]
No, it's true, most albums are rip-off because you go out and there are one or two really good cuts

[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.220]
And maybe the single which is a hit, and the rest of them are like filler

[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.480]
On almost every album you buy, this album has got everyone as a knockout

[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.580]
But you don't know the truth

[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:25.320]
It's essentially a theme album, despite the fact that you deal with various subjects

[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:32.640]
I think it's a beautiful blend of great lyrical imagery with contemporary arrangements

[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:40.520]
But the traditional progressions that I think you guys kind of pointed out, I'm saying it in a different way than the perhaps you guys did

[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:46.660]
It is not just one song but the entire album that just comes off

[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:50.160]
Well that makes me feel good because I really worked hard on it

[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:57.560]
I'll tell you the truth, Clive Davis came over to me, he saw a concert that I did and he said, Dion, you're singing better than ever

[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.000]
We feel you have a lot to say, well you're making album for us and I said I will

[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:07.940]
If I could make it in the tradition of the wander and run around Sue, I like writing about strong characters from the neighborhood

[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.640]
So I did things like Yo Franky and King of the New York streets

[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.060]
And I got a lot of help from a lyricist down here, his name is Bill Tuuy

[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.680]
You didn't write all the lyrics to this?

[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:24.720]
Some of the songs were good, but I have my partner in crime day, we work together on it

[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:31.480]
But what I wanted to say is I put a year into the writing of a lot of songs and I cut back to about seven

[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.160]
So I thought here I have a shot at bat, let me just relax and take a good cut at it

[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:44.660]
But I didn't take it lightly, I really worked hard at it and I had a good time doing it, I'll tell you

[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:50.800]
I'm glad that you said that, that you like all the cuts because I really gave it a lot of thought

[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:57.840]
And really took quiet walks on the beach and said, man I want every song to, I want to have a passion to sing it

[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.160]
Because it's got to get me to the airport and on the road, I don't like to leave home, I'll tell you right now

[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:08.280]
So I wanted something on the album to get me out of the house to sing, really, this is the truth

[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.340]
Well you did it, John, good hearing from you

[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.640]
Okay, you have great taste

[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.600]
I think it's a terrific album, thank you John

[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.320]
Thanks a lot

[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.840]
Okay, that's John Hamburg from Channel 4 who has excellent taste as we already know, Deans here

[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.240]
He's gonna hang around in the other half hour, whatever will feed you a little more food or whatever

[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.740]
And to replace some of the cuts, you've got at least four singles on the album that I can see already

[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.840]
If that's gonna be the first, you've got three more guaranteed

[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:34.560]
April Wartham has the new NYOD news, we're gonna come back with Deon at 1205 and Steve with his oil

[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.040]
With his schmutz drilling in the Florida Keys at two o'clock

[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.340]
You
