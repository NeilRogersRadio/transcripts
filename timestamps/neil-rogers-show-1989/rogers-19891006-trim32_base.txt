going to be on to so

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.700]
were really doing it all the way around by the way i want to say this on a

[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.100]
serious note before we start i had a note on the screen yesterday from some

[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.140]
caller that big wilson had passed away and i didn't put it on the year because

[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.820]
with all the cranks that we get i i'd like to verify something first but then

[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.180]
bill calder called me last night

[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.060]
to tell me that unfortunately was true and uh... he was really

[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.000]
a nice guy class act nice guy yes super guy yeah really was

[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.020]
and they was only sixty five

[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.900]
but i think between that weight and the smoking and of course this business

[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.300]
which is just uh...

[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.080]
bill said that he thought he'd done a broken heart really

[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.460]
and that which may have been exaggerated you know how emotional bill gets but

[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.620]
but uh... really he just uh... was crushed that he had to pack up and leave here

[00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.920]
and that nobody would hire him and

[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.000]
you see how that happens to a lot of the i have to help that is in truth that

[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.360]
was true you know bill is

[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.740]
and that's there all the time and i mean

[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.840]
for bill you just can't catch a break i mean we're talking about a real

[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.780]
talented guy i just can't get your break

[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.900]
well it's uh... if you could die of a broken heart

[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.980]
bill can get injured he must have been practicing

[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.040]
uh... you are brutal

[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.840]
brutal i know you the guy's working now i know i think it's great i think it's a

[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.340]
real time and he beggin me he says don't give my number when the book comes

[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.620]
in my state what credibility could i have not to give your number i think he's

[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.240]
been in long enough to really have a new year the summer book he was there

[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.860]
all three months we have to get in a course uh...

[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.320]
it was like a changing the guard they blew out the whole

[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.940]
but kissing uh... audience there the country audience

[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.220]
and then he had a start from all over again but i think he'll do about a one

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.340]
the one that's a big time but yeah i mean the extra actions most of the day

[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.240]
you get to the sports at night at the the fractions

[00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.100]
and their sports at night to be honest with you little overrated my opinion i

[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.280]
could be wrong but i don't think they're doing all that great

[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.400]
well i think sports town

[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.160]
now i i have to i have a hand i heard

[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.240]

[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.820]
well you like it because he you and he go up to the track together right on the

[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.020]

[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.820]
nothing all the right and he knows about now i care some good tickets to get

[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.460]
have you all yet really all he's like the king of the batteries

[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.800]
really is

[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.700]
not as much as hank though he doesn't know as much as hank

[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.700]
where i think so k-took nobody what you have to have a look at it i'm not

[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.560]
going into this i'm not going to get into a thing with my best friend because

[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.340]

indicated that you think that once baseball starts again he's going to be out

[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.320]
and i don't wish anybody even him i don't wish anything but i think it's

[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.640]
uh... the one thing i'll say in his behavior maybe learn drive talk is good i

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.280]
agree with you with that live talk is always preferable to the can stuff to sell

[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.400]
yes he the bruce way into any of that so you know that's fine i don't know why he's

[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.820]
chosen you know the last three nights to attack me over the you know the one car i mean

[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.360]
it's you oh for the last time you know it's yeah maybe he'd been listening to wlv

[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.740]
and that's the other thing that they should have gotten you over there he last night he caught

[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.800]
no i don't i'm the i'm a non person over there it's really funny they call one day they wanted

[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.100]
a comment on something on television and uh... so they see whoever they got at the paper

[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.860]
said well time jikers out television and they said guy thought about it for many goes

[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.240]
is there anybody else there

[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.040]
really so uh... it's really funny dick he goes on all night i've been listening working

[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.340]
like the last couple nights have been listen to him drive home

[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.020]
and you've gone on all night about how he has no idea what goes in this program he doesn't

[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.960]
listen to it he can't understand why anyone listens to it but he knows every single word that

[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.060]
said on this show every single like last night he's doing this routine with this chip monkey

[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.700]
guy got this little chip monkey character which is him talking to some kind of a voice box

[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.460]
they assume comes out like a chipmunk and he's going through the whole routine that went on in

[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.840]
this program i think i think it's a durable not a chip whatever whatever it is and he's talking

[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.360]
he's talking back and forth to the chipmunk you know i don't even want to use the talk to was

[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:33.600]
all right like a party yeah he's doing this whole routine he's telling the chip monkey

[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.020]
well i don't know anything that went on in the neorodia show and of course the chipmunks talk

[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.520]
well this is what they said this is what they said so like right now he's hanging on baited

[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.120]
bruh and he'll come on tonight and go i don't want to talk about that show i didn't listen to it but

[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.900]
meanwhile he said hi dick good morning how are you he's wound up like an old man

[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.860]
i think a total man said that i've been ripping me for nothing no because you wrote a really

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.420]
costed column i don't think i was a cost no i think it was honest but it was costed it would have

[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.220]
had to be you know what he was up you're up to an ass you said in essence he has no talent he's

[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.500]
a piece of crap i did not save it in essence and then he's just kind of like a temporary filling

[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.980]
and then he's a waste of time you know what he shouldn't buy a hell he was most upset about he was

[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.420]
at most upset that after i let him rip j n all i let him have his way said everything he wanted to

[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.940]
say that i gave them a chance to respond that upset him i mean here's the guy is in the business

[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.920]
he's the same guy that when people call in and attack him not only does he hang up on him but he

[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.740]
dumps it now i don't understand that yeah one thing that hang up like he's been doing that for years

[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.240]
because it seems to become thin skin but but you know then when you dump it i don't get that well

[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.500]
he yeah all he had last night was a sick of fast from up in uh parne bees we'll call him up and

[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.100]
he was practically begging for calls he was going on and on just i think it's always a real good

[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.820]
idea to start somebody on the nights when to play off in the world series are coming up that's

[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.940]
a good time to put the live nighttime programming on well you know you got that come but meanwhile

[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.540]
it died remember you're station what baseball did you a book one time yeah that's what i'm just

[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.780]
being sarcastic that's what i'm talking about he don't have anybody listening in there maybe five

[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.660]
or six well you got him watching on tv though they're distracted but i wouldn't worry about it

[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.380]
because blind michaert's Monday night and i think you heard that call yeah i was gonna call

[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:15.020]
yes i wasn't even closed michaert's like yeah we're gonna bring him in all the old jingles and he's

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.600]
gonna uh reminisce about all the crank calls he used to make it's gonna be terrific i talked to a

[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.280]
friend of mine michaert the other day the day you did the call and i said how come mine michaert

[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.180]
couldn't believe he didn't call finally he was listening to Craig that's why Craig's is fighting

[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.580]
now the time right all the time Craig takes his credit Craig puts some money here yeah i heard

[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.940]
Craig the other day was filling in in the afternoon for an extra hour and don't get me wrong because

[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:41.420]
i like Craig he's a super guy great job a couple weeks ago but the callers were like

[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:48.340]
mithuzla's grandparents i mean if the others got the oldest callers in history now wow Craig

[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.260]
and then you know some of the voices are remembered from katee days the grandly voice guys from

[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.120]
their two of them the baby sitter called and uh don't want to do almost ruined that we got into

[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.620]
a discussion i was on the show and oh you got a great i can't believe you let him go you gotta be kidding

[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:08.420]
do i really oh no no you kind of fired it up and you snooze about yeah and you just oh you know

[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.340]
they're nice people and everything else and see that's there are some people in the business and

[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:17.640]
Craig is one of them callers and other one they're just too nice and they don't they just don't

[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.220]
have it in them to just hang up on somebody and say get lost you know you have to have some sense

[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.240]
of self-preservation right when these hangers on come along i shouldn't put bill in there because bill at

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.280]
least you know choose some of these people out like lester but i mean Craig is just such a nice guy

[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.240]
you can hear the impassions in his voice you know he's trying to hurry them along because he knows

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.120]
he don't belong on a year but he just let these people to throw him yeah i said i said to him the day

[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.340]
i was there you know what's in the you know that voice and i said oh Craig don't tell me you have him

[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.640]
on and he said oh you know he's a nice kid and i want to you know i hate and that's it Craig is

[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.840]
too nice for his own good yeah if it's cost him a lot of money to be a rotten bastard like me

[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:59.960]
okay it's 1023 a wld with Tom jickel will be right back oh yeah 26 after 10 a wld with Tom jickel

[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.200]
yeah that's is true i read that in your column i didn't realize that because i don't pay much

[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.400]
attention to thinking farful but it is true that he was looking to try to create a contrile

[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.680]
thing here yeah now what do you think he got that from that contrived

[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.980]
truly or what he talks about came all the time constantly like this like joy he even talked

[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.780]
about the dean a lot last night didn't oh yeah Steve loves the dean by the way so that to give

[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.600]
your little bit inside is to where a house Steve has degenerated in the industry one thing you know

[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.500]
and i like Steve but the one thing you say about him that's true is he has the worst choice of

[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.120]
friends that have ever really done between side of the man and the dean and in this guy that's

[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:42.160]
going to be back in you know Lake Bahokie in New York or every game from uh what where he came

[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.000]
uh where he come uh mount kisco that right in the bro that's where he's from mount kisco in New York

[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.620]
he worked like a good guy v it's uh yeah but then he worked in mount kisco which is like you know

[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.100]
a flow out station or let's not spend four right on the big new farm full okay because it really

[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.340]
isn't worth it you know they would be like spending one hour for each listener anyway the book is

[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:07.280]
coming out at eleven forty five so we brought Tom in to make his predictions oh oh put you on the

[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.900]
spot today instead of like main bike and bike well it's like picking their horses out of the thing

[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.060]
here out of the newspaper look at me i had a great thirty cents out of dollar horses they wanted to

[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:21.620]
find and he's still running he's coming in right now yeah but i don't i is uh one Carlos

[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.240]
codex from the herald called me the yesterday at home you know why he's just obsessed with the show

[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.080]
and then he asked me so well i got any predictions i said i don't make predictions on the numbers

[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.580]
and he said well what do you think exciting what are you looking for i said nothing i don't think

[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.200]
some i don't think there's anything no we don't under do it as our book i don't think there's

[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.220]
anything exciting going on and i want to think significant nobody changed formats or

[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.100]
brightening great personalities or other than the one we've been talking about and he wasn't

[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.780]
here he wasn't here for the book and and in the summertime you know you got i think most of the

[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.800]
personalities in the market take their vacations during the summertime uh you also got the i think

[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.320]
it's huge which is always a good excuse by the way you know yeah people are good down yeah

[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.600]
i think i'm a book well i wasn't here for the two weeks uh and it's huge a little different

[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.120]
oh you got it wait a minute there's this celebrity caller i wasn't going to take any calls for

[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.800]
wobble we have a celebrity are you still there mr celebrity what do you do hang up

[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.560]
Johnny dog you can no wait a minute much more let me try this now he's probably gone hello

[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:27.060]
he's gone you know who it was who don cocks really yeah now when don cocks hangs up

[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.640]
why that this is uh he probably assumed we weren't taking any calls i just saw the first

[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.460]
time i've been here in a while that's any fox one call you never know sunny junior might get

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.440]
excited from where i love 94 sunny junior probably call but anyway you don't see anything exciting

[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.580]
well i think probably the the uh rock and roll stations to do a little bit better because summertime

[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:52.540]
kids are home or how one of five's gonna go down i think so well the the edr is claiming that

[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.500]
they were playing a dirty tricks campaign with them with one of their contest and that they had

[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.840]
a computer that they were dialing and every time they were trying to get requests or a contest that

[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.520]
they had their computer tie up the phone lines i don't know whether it's true or not but uh

[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.860]
they're claiming that they caught them and and now they're not doing that the numbers will go up

[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:14.100]
but they might have just seen the trends i think he the up okay um my goal is to cause in a hotline

[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.720]
just tell them it's uh cranking your rhythm okay we didn't call any of those people let's

[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.540]
still go on that's been going on all week long somebody calling all these sports people all over

[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.360]
the country uh like last Friday Wayne messimer who's right there in which i was tickled at sp2

[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.040]
i mean there were a couple that were kind of fun big chat called in and blend vermin but now you

[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.040]
know we get uh all these people that we've never even heard of calling in so just tell them audio

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.860]
and good luck to come do you think Hank could be doing that maybe i mean who else i who else is

[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:48.180]
connected to that i mean exactly i'm so glad he said that because i thought i was paranoid but you

[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.840]
know Hank i can't believe he's really mad at you i mean you guys were too good a friend oh vicious

[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.240]
he really is well i don't know i know see there's a thing like stuff i do on the air i don't i

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.040]
would never well i won't say never but i i can't think of it a case where i want to get somebody

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:10.460]
in a business fired or create a real problem for somebody but with Hank once you cross him man he's

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:15.160]
you're on his list and he'll just go to no i know came with he'll go yeah he'll go to the ends of

[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.300]
the earth to try to destroy you and get you fired and just uh he really he's a vicious person it

[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.860]
really is i've never seen with us it's kind of like fun but with Hank it's like venom i haven't seen

[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:30.420]
that's oh trust me but he is my best friend i hope so anyway speaking of good friends you know

[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.180]
the thing with hamburg is really getting me very upset i don't i think that's for real

[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.060]
yeah that's for real him in the wind until they find somebody yeah oh yeah he's gone

[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.740]
really he's gone he's just a question to win as soon as they find somebody they'll pay him off

[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:50.800]
and audio is jam right doesn't have a good hairdo uh i don't know did you don't know

[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.420]
what was that notice the point yeah thinking it over something you don't want to tell us well

[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.320]
it's not something i don't want it's just speculation it's not that could cause some problem

[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.540]
because it could be interpreted the wrong way but uh i think that yeah it's just a matter of

[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.680]
finding somebody to replace hamburg and then he'll be gone and i think it's unfortunate because

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.920]
you know what the best proof i have that that i'm right about this thing is when i talk to the

[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.140]
other stations they all say the same thing we can't wait for them to get rid of hamburg you

[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.320]
have the strength of the station oh exactly yeah there's a question about it yeah so the other

[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.940]
stations are more excited than channel four about getting rid of hamburg and it seems to me

[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.520]
they're losing their identity they'll it brasmer go who is outstanding and then they said all

[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.420]
over made a mistake now they're going to do the same with hamburg then they'll say we made a

[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.060]
mistake puttany's going over to channel 10 yeah he's gone they stuck weaver in the morning and

[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.080]
they put the guy with a weather map on his face in in the afternoon they're great uh in the

[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.620]
pub are just hates him with a passion and then they got a bunch of silly people they're laughing

[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.620]
and puking you know beside Tony i don't want to stay in of course Hank well yeah i shouldn't leave

[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.360]
Hank well Tony and Hank like i said a bunch of silly people are gonna hang for there when they

[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.680]
got there but if you think about it they have not made a good hire since they've been there

[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.380]
no the people they've hired have all been doos we do got to throw out the guy in from san francisco he

[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:11.280]
last uh... yeah yeah the guy who had a tooth problem here that that civil and jack david jacked

[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.160]
jack oh he was terrible you know quick the last time i filled in for cane i guess oh four or

[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.940]
five months ago and i had i had the dick level from channel four here and the entire hour was spent

[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.900]
with people just running down clif marison and he got really no backing from low ball you know he says

[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.520]
well you know you know you know you really hedged about it with it got so ugly that the clif marison

[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.360]
called up didn't yeah and he was upset and and i know people at the station said he was beside

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.200]
himself that that is the general manager of the station sitting here while people are running

[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.660]
them down he's not even defending him so that that was kind of ridiculous uh

[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.140]
tom do you think that john here brick is too good do you think that no i don't think no no i'm not

[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.140]

[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.420]
a long time and it's become it's become acceptable to say i watch and bishop and she's the best

[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.620]
she's not the best it's like it is it's like watching your great grandmother doing the news

[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.480]
dramatic he's too animated and he's yeah maybe i like maybe he's too animated for this market i

[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.780]

[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:52.660]
you okay 10 38 at w i'd do that Johnny dark did we say he was coming in today no was that a joke

[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:57.080]
about what because there was a lot of food coming or was it rich now then none of them are coming

[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.240]
to embarrass cuz then Tom would write something in the car that's here's the you want to do a

[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.680]
little research on Johnny dark as a man i don't know what he does i know from New York i mean i

[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.720]
didn't know i don't know what he does he hasn't worked in years now and yesterday he came in and we

[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.920]
fed him once and he said well that was okay but how about i have an Arnold's time out i'm not

[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.640]
joking we had to have a second lunch for him yesterday we're here on w a b c and he has one to know

[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.960]
you know w n b c n b c is he on any other one no yeah he's seen n b c for my best dummy he was there

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.860]
when i was growing up oh Joey Reynolds was on i was the way i was doing that i was it proof

[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:36.700]
of no no no no you're thinking of someone else dark was it w n b c for about eight years

[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.980]
and that would be in the 70s yeah the 1870s no he was somewhere in the 60s too

[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.320]
Ryan Deezer i came here in 72 i moved to Miami and said it's not really in my

[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.480]
here we're trying to keep an audience here okay i'll go through the history of Johnny dark

[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.620]
because nobody cares nobody even Johnny darks as long as he's eating he doesn't care

[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.480]
we bring in the food in today maybe Arnold will come by and think on white castle yeah

[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.180]
we're a royal can well whatever i think we're there yeah i bet you even though he was here yesterday

[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.060]
Wayne would be honored to feed Tom jikett today when he goes in he'll get a nice right up in the

[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:16.540]
sunsend I'm likely to win but give it a shot i was i stopped at a white castle in New York when

[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.180]
i was up there in vacation i had to get off the highway and go to the bathroom i mean it was

[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:27.800]
right through i'm telling you what kind of a show is that the dean will be on it too

[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.880]
you already ripped the dean so i guess we don't what did you say about like i'm kind of a

[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.780]
disease like a yeast infection yeah he's a radio yeast infection just let the oil come down

[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:43.340]
a bad thing just keeps coming back over and over and over again speaking of a bad dream you

[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.140]
mentioned something about wold you took a vicious shot at them during the break where did they

[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.320]
find this guy Charlie Manos he was a news kid with a real happy boy bob Charlie about

[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.160]
oh and he put him on because don't isn't that the only one you wake up first thing in the

[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.900]
morning isn't that what you want to hear hi amie balling you know he reminds me of you know

[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:08.600]
cliff claiming on she is the guy who knows really that whole show is just incredible annoying

[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.180]
would be like hearing some idiot cackling in the background for four i mean this is when i

[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.960]
earn my money now i feel like i've got to check these shows out from time to time just to see

[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.540]
what they're up to earn your money but you did a chance to watch a speaker last time i was

[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:27.980]
like a guy now yeah getting incredible reviews in fact if anybody saw it i saw selected moments of it

[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.660]
well i've defeated they probably noticed the resemblance between what's his name in rozan bra

[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:39.380]
not from the front from be hallis yeah no from oh no allis in rozan bra no no allis in a sidekick

[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:46.260]
sidekick deppy oh yeah i mean what's his name deppy deppy and he's getting it all confused

[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.620]
now isn't he you notice how when you watch when you listen to that station all the gender

[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.760]
identity is all word in there you can't figure out what's going on yeah i love it when they

[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.860]
talk about how they go out tonight clubs together and then trying to think what the

[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.620]
the parents might be in those situations yeah you know and and the other day i was saying something

[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.020]
by heavily they were doing that thing on that rape case and i was saying how deppy always

[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.840]
dresses tastefully well you know what's that what the real life it was i can't i mean you know

[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.960]
exactly it's a safe way to go people get lost anyway we don't want to do that we don't want

[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.100]
to make attacks because like i said the book is uh... this just isn't an exciting book we hope

[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.660]
to go up we hope to do about a 20 or 30 share and uh... anything sure that will be very disappointing

[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.020]
and we know that reneary will hold his own you always does he always still holds on to what he's

[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.680]
got and i don't know you know what can you say amazing like a legend is on top 15 years in the market

[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.640]
absolutely and he holds that there should probably be holding our own of course on this show

[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.720]
we're used to it probably that we're going pretty well to about two o'clock and then it's start here we go

[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.440]
let's see it takes a lot today to get him started

[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.680]
we better get over here wane he's getting vicious we better feed him something substance to do

[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.980]
yeah your fangs are out of you there is that you know what it is i haven't been here about nine ten

[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:07.160]
maybe you because you in the speed get along okay i'm right okay okay maybe you can accomplish

[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.620]
what the rest of us have failed okay because i don't want Steve to do badly i think still somewhere

[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.180]
in the back of his mind he believes i do or that there's some ego thing that's not there's nothing

[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:22.020]
in it for me for him to fail okay i want him to do very well because obviously if i come over here

[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.900]
and reneary and steve both do very well and increased off what they had before then it's good for

[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:32.360]
everybody and his nation does great but the problem is Steve will not listen to anybody and like

[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.060]
you said before he's kind of like one of these people if you say it's day he'll say it's night so

[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:42.460]
therefore the people he gravitates toward are the people that i would just barf like a rick citer man

[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:48.240]
and ellis and all these other yeah but i can't but not only that but you know i can't control who

[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.820]
his friends are because i have nothing to do with that but his show he insists like this week when's

[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:57.120]
day he had ellis rubin again with her to go on with the condolences which he made it a

[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:01.500]
interesting one into a miniseries yeah it was interesting the he'd wait like a 20-hour miniseries yeah

[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.840]
and then yesterday i couldn't believe it the man looks did you see him yesterday he looks like a

[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.220]
hundred years old now he's starting to look like one of the characters out of the old estimate no

[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:18.420]
that was wrong crunch oh i guess yeah and he's got this graying beard now and he looks like Moses

[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.660]
or something i think i was it Moses and grand here in citer man was and i i thought they had been

[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.960]
joined the citer man down citer man always uh he'd be up in the other giant out well he's up a

[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:36.760]
j-n-o isn't he is he but he's not oh well that means he might ever start to do that i mean how many times

[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.400]
and i i like feral i mean forget whether you like him or not i had nothing against him until the

[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.120]
other night well till i met him and then i realized how he really was obnoxious but the bottom line

[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.580]
is this topical stuff and like stations around the country like last year went up to wl

[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:56.280]
lessons in Chicago and they're doing the same crap with these boring topics and then you read about

[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.840]
another discussion on a board way in his own is way by the way from our own to throw castles here

[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.940]
in good shape but abortion and then how did we read our paper about how they got a show plan

[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:10.140]
on gun control and immigration and sure i mean what what is wrong with these people how much does

[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.020]
it take to convince these people that the public isn't has nothing left to say about these right

[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:18.180]
i think the book that comes out today will go along with it like fdl they forget that they

[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.860]
you know i mean they're not a lot of major talents available to put on a year doing talk especially

[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.480]
on a little station like fdl but at least if you're going to put and then they put cray gun doing

[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.760]
topics that's not his thing at all i don't know what i was on the one day we were talking about tv

[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.020]
and stuff but i don't you know i don't know what topics is that what he's doing yeah that was never

[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:41.020]
crags never having back used to get on top of the one of the games exactly like the guy with the

[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:46.880]
organ on 120 and his organ yeah and you know it was interesting you go back to i remember back to

[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.760]
the yeah you followed crags and uh right he did i did yeah yeah on camera right you tried to forget

[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.400]
before and he did ten now in the beginning he did noon to three and i did three to six men

[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.800]
Sidlervin came to us and he said well got a great opportunity for both of you i don't have any more

[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.960]
money yeah but i'm going to give you the honor instead of doing three hours a day of doing four

[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.240]
hours a day which was a k a t way of doing things the snoring way of doing things and so he was

[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.300]
doing ten or two and i did two visit i remember i'd be driving the work and and i could almost tell

[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.980]
where i was in the road by who was on the phone you know it was the baby Sidlervin or what what

[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.340]
what the cozy mom martin the guy with any audience on 100 you know that and then they'd all talk

[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.080]
about having dinner the night before which was great for those four people but the rest of the

[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.320]
audience for what the even in spite of that until they just totally took over the show like a

[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.060]
mortal school inspired that he had a fun show it's a good number and i like crags i think it's a

[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.320]
super guy but to put him on and to put on these other people doing topics and screaming and yelling

[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.800]
nobody cares i mean even like the thing with the topless bars in a four-water deal ordinarily that

[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.360]
may have been subject but nobody cares just a television no but nobody cares about it in this yeah

[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.460]
we don't care about it in purpose go to topless bars and they're sleeping in the daytime yeah

[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.420]
you said that all right let me do one more break here and then we'll get into the

[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:04.600]
release really start ripping some people it's 1046 at w i d the uncontribled tom jicca the radio

[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.460]
and tv and i heard a four-water deal news and sunset no he used to be much more mild mannered when

[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.220]
he worked for our client but but now that he's working for a much more open-minded organization he's

[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:18.360]
really letting it hang out so to speak we're working for the owner of the cubs yeah that's right

[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.640]
the tribute company team okay well it's about time you change your allegiance anyway that's why he

[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.480]
was glad he said that david johnson's coming back for the mess that should clinch it for next year

[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:34.580]
that should say it's okay that would have been it that would have been it can't get him like a

[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.700]
you know it's a little embarrassed that would have been that would have been such a yanky thing to do

[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:42.860]
to get rid of him after one bad yeah you know i just didn't want it that's just one bad here there's

[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.580]
just a feeling there's an ambiance there and i don't know he just let it get out of control there was

[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.540]
no control in that team everybody went their own way you know guys were going into taking their shower

[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.580]
in the fifth inning and going home and even even know it in fact mandage was pretty upset about

[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.100]
that because he said he likes to see the end of the game and you know Jimmy lead likes to shower

[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:05.900]
the guys anyway it's 1047 at the he did a whole show on that by the way about leaving now he said

[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:10.260]
that tadfoot probably is one of these people who never showered with the guys and i kind of

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.940]
wouldn't you think it was a little unusual if the president of the university went into shower with

[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:22.000]
the guys that was really especially that would you but that mandage you know those guys who went

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]
to michigan man they're all little strange anyway when you're proud of your home you wanted to

[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.220]
look it's best and stay in mint condition but there are three things to consider when it's time

[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.680]
to make home improvements they take time money and specialized skills so whether you've got a big

[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:40.320]
job in mind like maybe in debbie elis's house you can see that like remodeling your

[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.260]
inner bathroom or just a small shortage of lighting the doorways like replacing a door there you go

[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.720]
classic design builders can handle it i mean even a month and they don't come any better than

[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.400]
okay i'm sure you want to walk yeah why are you getting married yeah i just great idea that

[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.160]
you know when he was on the other he was talking to mike the other day and i i just had this

[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:06.260]
vision that there they would be at the old that tomorrow night and you wouldn't even be at i guess

[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.960]
would do the rabbi would go if there's anyone who has any reason that these this couple should not

[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:18.520]
be joined together the county clerk comes running in and goes thanks jack bennah that really

[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:24.940]

[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.220]
the twenty-seven he was on with mike yesterday i couldn't believe it the shameless way i know i

[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.340]
commented on this yesterday but it bears repeating over and over again they had him on the phone

[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:42.680]
that's what i heard him yeah and mike and henry and sonny and they were just all tinkling over here

[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.400]
i know he's like and he thought sonny and i'm going to be honest with you renery and him never

[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.440]
got along to begin with okay i'm sure that's i get that through the grapevine i don't want to

[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.620]
mention colder's name but i get that i get that through the grapevine from somebody who was here

[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.740]
at the same time but boy they just i can't understand it yeah when sonny said hey larry how are you

[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:06.780]

[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.400]

it has it's been in print yet and you guys broke the story well thank you very much but i'm

[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.620]
distressed and i like hambrick i was going to tell people that my mind they call them would be on

[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.600]
the radio ratings but i guess i'm going to have to make my job a good guy and he's a good talent

[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.980]
and he's getting a royal screwing he's too good for the market yeah okay well all three of them

[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:41.180]
were there last night and and as i understand it so was hambrick in the building at the same time

[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.920]
well a great touch of class well that would be in keeping with the way that handled the whole

[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.440]
yeah yeah okay okay appreciate it all right how do you like that for getting a scoop right

[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.100]
here i believe i believe i believe everything but the mic shnai to pot and i'm not saying that

[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.300]
it's not true just that's the thing that i find them hard to but christian is in a real great spot

[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.260]
now he's on the network now every morning at six thirty what would you want to come back to this

[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.280]
i mean isn't this the place you know he did he yeah one or all the way out to the world he's on

[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.480]
the network now and you know god knows what that could lead to he's in a great visibility spot what

[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.560]
would he want to come back to this where he knows he's in a tough spot there and he's going to be

[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.900]
bucking his old pal and i did just does that doesn't it go all out and yeah doesn't have a ring

[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:30.420]
to it all right he's old buddy she like Mike did she really yeah i mean as opposed to jerry

[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:36.140]
he's uh but no and like Mike hmm well that's all the information photographs very badly he looks

[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:40.080]
like a ghost there's no way they can make him up maybe if he could get jでしょう make

[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.480]
up people yeah hey we haven't talked about joie show yet know well it's coming on in five minutes

[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:54.100]
no i'm not so bad all i've seen in that program hi uh is it's beyond description isn't it well

[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.440]
if i mean people people attack me because they think i rip people just for the hell of it i do it

[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.520]
gratuitously and that's not true and there's haemberg's a good example i'm not gonna rip him the

[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.740]
guys that getting can and he's getting a screwings and excellent talent

[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:10.080]
iraq people deserve to be ripped in joy again alike in personly but i can

[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.240]
separate that from the fact that it shows how did you get that they go on

[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.900]
it was a good or failing on she was another one of these local tv stations that

[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.060]
just they got all the answers man why would they possibly put him on her

[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.120]
looking for that big build up for their eleven thirty news and they put on a

[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.940]
uh... uh... ag a giant bomb like that

[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.360]
yet there are people in the other people available to i mean stand would be

[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.640]
better than joeys true

[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.700]
all of the time on tv

[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:37.540]
well

[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.340]
uh... uh...

[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.860]
from a distance from a long shot for stand has kind of like a

[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.900]
bell a little to your image you know what it comes on

[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.800]
you know i mean yeah there are people they could put on there that was

[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.300]
carlaw and gregg you doubt the guy say so i mean he's that

[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:53.880]
i'm just think it

[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.520]
come on

[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.760]
with what you're going to be

[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.440]
yeah

[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.640]
well you do have a point

[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.520]
no but there's no point in putting any local show on unless there's some point

[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.140]
to it unless there's something there i mean like the something on seventeen

[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.240]
that's another one of these

[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.720]
like having done web all over again you know it's it's a way it's just a

[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.700]
waste of everybody that they could put an old documentary on and just

[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.140]
full of time and get the same twenty people watching if you're going to put

[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.360]
something local and do something different i mean joeys show you can't even

[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.060]
describe what it is that he does can you what did he do

[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.300]
besides you were trying to run around half naked in twenty years old again

[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.860]
what's the price of me about eighty and maybe got a shot

[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.120]
no matter what what else to say channel ten is the best run station in this

[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.280]
market has been for years and that's what surprised me they knew they were

[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280]
going to lose her aldo

[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.040]
and i'm surprised that they didn't have something better than joe to plug

[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.580]
in there because they really do a good job of programming that station

[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.360]
and

[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:44.920]
to

[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.800]
it's almost like the night before they lost her alb at a go

[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.980]
god what are we gonna do i mean that it looked at the front book

[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.140]
quattro in there they could put anything in the

[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.160]
game show you can't

[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.640]
black and white leave it to be there yeah that black and white gilligan's iron

[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.960]
we're not given too many ideas were on during these hours now that sure yeah

[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.140]
so we kind of like the fact that joeys on air if i we promote the hell out of the

[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.500]
show you how do you get the job i have what do you mean i know him

[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.540]
well he's these come in from time to time hasn't he

[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.120]
and get your chances yeah i'm coming up this is by the way

[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:18.840]
to it's several times i can't stand it what does that mean well i don't you

[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.200]
know some i i have i've never talked to the guy

[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.520]
i was going to do a piece on the show and the only reason i down him and you

[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.780]
know the idea and how it happened and i didn't do it because someone else at

[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.240]
the paper decided they were going to do it for whatever reason i got a

[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.620]
time to go feature story and that should become a rep I suppose any time now

[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.520]
uh... so before the shows that goes off that right now they better get on the

[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.840]
way i have a i have a feature in the sunday tv book called tjq and i and i

[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.780]
answered a question last sunday people asked me who is this guy joeian i

[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.140]
said you know what this was actually in the in the comment

[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.800]
when i got your question i answered it as quickly as possible because

[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.040]
i don't think right now i don't know what you're talking about

[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:00.220]
you know and uh... but uh... i think and the girl was writing this story if they

[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.020]
could write that he's vicious so yeah

[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.080]
thinking farful's got a point and despite everything we say about the end

[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.260]
and everything channelton that is number one in the rating and very well

[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.620]
ready yeah tremendously well run station if you think that they've been the

[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.460]
abc affiliate during abc's darkest time right still been the number one

[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.920]
station in town and they've been the number one new station in town after ten

[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.880]
years that's right i know what you got that is

[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.460]
that's it they do such a great job right water deal for example they do a

[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.640]
greater route they didn't have a lot of it but silly but they have silly but the

[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.200]
fact always got a fact that they don't believe you or they don't always please me

[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.460]
doesn't matter they do please the people the people they tune into what the

[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.240]
people in this market want they've been that way for ten years now that for

[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.080]
us got hard copy i think they're in a lot of trouble

[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.560]
that's a big yeah and for thirty with that is great that'll do it yeah i forgot

[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.620]
about that yeah that's going to put them over the time i think so and especially

[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.980]
if they bring if Glenn rinker comes back in man look at that is not going to be

[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.100]
yeah that guy sounded like you knew what he was talking about well then again i

[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.200]
was going to say but did you see him so strange but they do strange things over

[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.240]
it they could bring in Mike spindle to do the sports

[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.820]
to ob mayor to do the business news and rinker and i could all be sitting on

[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.280]
table and do like the micket and that's that's right

[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:13.500]
what rinkers rinkers about three feet tall what are you talking about oh yeah

[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.080]

[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.880]
and what i like the best when he right has to that wigs man he came it was the most exciting thing

[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.680]
i've ever seen in my life he came on the tv press tour and that wigs it was you remember the scene

[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.660]
in lacagra full where there's a dinner table and his wigs started spawning on sliding that's

[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.240]
what it reminded me of was that they drove last summer he was doing a show for showtime so he came

[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.320]
out and he did the he did the press tour and it was like the tour because it's like the worst

[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.980]
drug in the his is i mean it makes for Reynolds rugs looked really surprised

[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.180]
now there's a real talent for you isn't it okay i better keep my eyes on this because we're not

[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.980]
really i don't want to take these boring calls you know when my favorite show is going to be that

[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:09.000]
in the old days okay that's history nobody wants to do that but if we do have a celebrity like

[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.860]
Cox calling and we get rid of him real british this is the first or that other call was good though

[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:18.980]
yeah yeah very depressing very depressing i think everybody depressing but that's the

[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:23.600]
pricing well it's too late you know i would mount a campaign but it's too late isn't it i have

[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.900]
everybody i'll channel how we'll write them a letter into a logo what a jerk he is where did he

[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.900]
come from he came from Chicago he's not a jerk he's a bright guy and yeah but he's wrong in his

[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.780]
instance he doesn't know what the hell he's doing he doesn't know this market well he's not

[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:43.120]
calling all the shots exactly either he's very leery of people who come in from Chicago to run

[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:49.700]
a station but Disney came from Chicago okay yeah now that should be good i knew well he hired me

[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:55.300]
but that was only by accident he also hired farrell so he hired a bunch of and he's bringing the

[00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:00.280]
dean into the to pinch hit for steam oh that would be like putting yeah you know he thinks a lot

[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:04.800]
of you like i was gonna say i'd be like putting in Mike Balecki to pinch hit for Ryan Sandberg but

[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.100]
Malecki did get a hit last night yeah just in case you miss it it would be like Steve blast to

[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:14.760]
to pinch hit for mock great or Steve blast wasn't it these blasts the one who went lost his whole

[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.320]
life without getting a hit did he i think so yeah i think he was one of the guys i never got a hit

[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.540]
he's a guy that just woke up one day and lost it yeah he just hit it on he does the color on the

[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:29.240]
pirates not i don't know if you ever watched him on s3 20 yeah i do the most boring broadcast and

[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.620]
you know they don't have big crowds especially at the end of the season in Pittsburgh and it sounds

[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:37.440]
like they're in an empty room somewhere just talking to each other it's terminal it's awful

[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.360]
but anyway we don't want to get bogged on on that because i don't think we'll get a tv question

[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:47.460]
sorry i'm sorry i asked a tv question we're not changing the subject already no no no no i have

[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:52.120]
a question i mean it's okay i mean it really even when it's a boggy and that's on tv that is tv

[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:58.000]

[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.160]

[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.840]
everything to do with the fact of what a brilliant newswoman she is and nothing to do with the

[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:34.520]
fact that she's blind and blue i'm going to respond for to a lot of Hollywood i don't believe now

[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:41.920]
then afraid has brought me these prices before and i don't believe them okay so i'm not going to do

[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:47.020]
them that's how low they are but i would i would feel real bad if i gave money i found out

[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:52.380]
you made a mistake i mean he's got prices here that are so absurd that i just couldn't possibly

[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:57.360]
give money until i checked it out you know what i'm saying are you following me but i'll give you

[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.760]
mom serious there's something that it just can't be possible but if it is i'm going to take like four

[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.900]
hours out of the next week and just go on here and keep repeating them but whatever you do take

[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:10.400]
the green light and go to Toyota of Hollywood okay it's 1114 and w1 of the we're here with Tom jica

[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:14.600]
the radio and tv editor of the prestigious four-letteredale news and sunset and the why are you looking at

[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.240]
your wife i want to see when the ratings are coming in oh man this man is the man is the man is

[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:24.560]
the guy i know this is almost like you know you asked their first of all they're not going to come out

[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.080]
at 11.45 is that is that the time that they're sending him or is that the time that they're going to

[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:33.020]
be five i don't know can we find out about that is there anybody in the building listening

[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.220]
find out what time they're feeding him okay see because they come in a computer in the back

[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:42.860]
and it takes about 45 minutes for the computer to get all the information loaded you don't get

[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:48.120]
anything until everything is in there and then it starts feeding out printing out so it's

[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:54.340]
sometime between 11.45 and 12.30 on less the information is being fed at 11 in which case it

[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.180]
would start coming in so we'll find out what would you add or if i've never been here the day

[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.500]
they came in actually now this is exciting but it was when elected member the election night i was

[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:07.060]
here with you not here it was over at the other day at i and z oh no old d when it's down and

[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:12.820]
wld got it out loud you mentioned wld because quite frankly you made some horrible comment about

[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:19.200]
Charlie Mato's and you know which was understandable but can you explain me of course Dennis Collins I

[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.240]
just either are not enough negative things i could say about Dennis Collins or what he's done to

[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:28.500]
that place but this business is shuffling the deck and shuffling the deck remember they did that

[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:33.940]
in fact he was there too with with Lee at GBS they did the same thing they had this incredible

[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:38.700]
failure they were doing ones they had that big 50,000 watt signal and they just kept shuffling

[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:42.720]
around and shuffling around at Bebsmith and David Gold and the Dean and this one and that one

[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:48.660]
it was embarrassing no matter what the time that was over it is they had the same as true at

[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:53.880]
wld i mean that you know they they went up a little bit in this last trend because naturally any time

[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.960]
you make a major change like that people will sample although i will say this even though they

[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:02.940]
went back up a little bit their demographics continued going down their demographics are so old

[00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.720]
you can hear that the Dean is a teenager compared to their demographics so okay it's frightening

[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.880]
you can hear that whenever they go to the phone that's how long they can go on i mean i know you

[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:17.820]
like sandy personally but like well you want to know why sandy has not spoken to me i guess in

[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:24.180]
more than a year what what i don't know whether it's because i'm ng at the station or whatever

[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:30.280]
but it's like i've fallen off the face of the i've had no kind act whatsoever from her now

[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:37.460]
anything else i want you to take a look to your right you know i don't know i guess i'll just

[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:42.920]
assume this is coincident so okay because there it does happen to be food coming in again

[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:52.560]
that's hard for a castle so i never guess who just walked in oh good johnny dark oh good

[00:51:53.020 --> 00:52:02.060]
heaven well have a cedar too john near the food you said no with clear i believe i said he's

[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.920]
coming back to that i mentioned yesterday that tom would be here and that the tom had demanded a lot

[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:11.420]
of food and that we would come through as we always do and you thought i was joking what is that

[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:17.160]
for us is that a piece offering it's what it's rock scene tv you're going to want to fly is it a

[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:24.600]

[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:45.260]

[00:52:53.260 --> 00:53:00.100]
opinion of Brian feral this has something to do with Brian feral see music yeah now it's all slowly

[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:08.180]
filtering in oh yeah okay well we'll keep it in the not excuse me not today not with tom's

[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.420]
And when the numbers come in, I think it's going to have the trends going back a year

[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.040]
to like when we first came here, we'd exit it, and it'll be real interesting to compare

[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:14.040]
like the 0.6 they had in many 18 to 34 to the 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 or whatever.

[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.060]
Well, he didn't like this.

[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.360]
No, we don't like talking to those dummies.

[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.260]
We prefer the older people, the mature.

[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:20.900]
Right.

[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.500]
By the way, Tom, that's Mr. Alan Burmister.

[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.480]
Yeah, Mr. Dene.

[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.120]
Mr. Dene.

[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.200]
And then of course, the John Dean's going to be on with Dicking Farfool, so that'll

[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:32.740]
be really great.

[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.320]
Visiting.

[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.400]
All right, let's make that celebrity caller in a moment.

[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.560]
But first, we got some very important business here.

[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.820]
It's 11.22 at WIOG.

[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.640]
It's 11.22.

[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:46.440]
It's 11.22.

[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.440]
It's 11.22.

[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:47.640]
It's 11.22.

[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:47.760]
It's 11.22.

[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:47.780]

[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:47.920]

[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.580]
Well, that is a good point.

[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:50.580]
Anyway, it is a good thing.

[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:50.940]
Anyway, it is a good thing.

[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:52.960]
Yeah, 11.26 at WIOG.

[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:53.520]
A lot of people.

[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.100]
Well, amazing part of it though, in spite of what you just said about it.

[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.140]
All the talk stations or stations going to talk.

[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.800]
A lot of talented people not being able to get work.

[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:01.580]
Man?

[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.000]
I mean, we're talking about it.

[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.280]
I said, talented people.

[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.720]
It's just a joke, Stan.

[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.020]
It's just a joke.

[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:08.340]
He is.

[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.520]
So he's another one.

[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.200]
What happened to the national network?

[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.060]
He's still working on it.

[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:13.740]
It hasn't disappeared.

[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:14.440]
First, come on.

[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.600]
All right.

[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.920]
Now look, I'm telling you, give the man some time.

[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:19.260]
You don't do those things overnight.

[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:24.460]
This, for a guy who's been out of work for as long as Johnny Dark, this man has got more

[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.340]
shots than everybody.

[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.300]
I mean, it's one thing if you're working and you're doing pretty well, you can take some

[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:28.540]
shots.

[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:32.380]
But when you're like on the bread line, when you're at the soup kitchen and you keep

[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:37.880]
coming in to eat free every day, you're just not in a position to start jerking people

[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.240]
around.

[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:38.860]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.280]
Anyway, still we got about an hour or a little less than an hour to go and we're going

[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.320]
to be taking numbers out of a hat like they do over at Birch.

[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.280]
Maybe we'll get some celebrity callers on the line.

[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.760]
Some really important people we haven't heard from in a long time.

[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:52.480]
Yeah.

[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:53.060]
Wow.

[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.720]
Anyway, Tom, I have a question for you.

[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.280]
Something that's bothered me for a long time.

[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.160]
Oh, we got the celebrity callers today.

[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.260]
Like I said, people we haven't heard from in ages.

[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:06.480]
Now, when he suggested everybody run out and see pumpkin head, I did it.

[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:07.420]
Okay?

[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.020]
When he said, wait a minute.

[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.260]
When who suggested?

[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:10.680]
Steve.

[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.560]
Tom's best friend.

[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:12.500]
Oh, Steve.

[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:13.200]
Yeah.

[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.560]
Are you picking on Steve again?

[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:15.000]
No, I'm not.

[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:15.760]
I'll go ahead.

[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.480]
He's not here to that.

[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.200]
I just want to know what he based his elections on.

[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.840]
The movies he tells the most have got to be some of the worst movies ever.

[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.760]
Why are you asking Tom that question?

[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:26.700]
How the hell does he know?

[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.160]
He's got bad taste.

[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.480]
Tom already said he's got bad taste in friends.

[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.220]
So why should he have good taste in movies?

[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.460]
Tom, let me ask you about.

[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.520]
How bad is the movie victims or have you seen it?

[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:37.920]
I haven't seen it.

[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:38.820]
No, I have no plans.

[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.120]
I can tell you how bad that show was yesterday though.

[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:41.860]
Oh, God, it was horrible.

[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:44.060]
Who was this other guy he had on the yesterday?

[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.080]
He was ridiculous.

[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.960]
Well, he made punks seem like the rock of Gibraltar.

[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.400]
That's the other guy he had on.

[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.360]
And of course, I swear it looked like Moses in drag, man.

[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.520]
He looked, didn't he look about a hundred years old?

[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.660]
I can't believe it.

[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.660]
And he came in here and then of course I'm getting a car outside and Steve is telling me,

[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.840]
well, you know, Neil just ripped you for four hours.

[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.680]
You know, that would have made good television.

[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:06.440]
Yeah.

[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.000]
Yeah.

[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.380]
And maybe Bob can be on the Debbie and Alice show.

[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.620]
They can squeeze him onto the set.

[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.320]
Oh, Alice, that'll definitely be one of the top.

[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.520]
Yeah, I would imagine it.

[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.440]
So yeah, I'll be in for a day.

[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:16.880]
There you go.

[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.320]
Hey, what about Steve Love?

[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.820]
I want to see that.

[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.240]
What?

[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.560]
Can I ask a question?

[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:22.400]
What?

[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.760]
What would you don't do movies?

[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:24.680]
Oh, there's TV.

[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.700]
Why are you talking about movies?

[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:27.740]
I'm talking about Steve's show.

[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:28.740]
The only one is talking about movies.

[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.440]
Every time I want Steve's show.

[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.740]
No, you're thinking you got to see him.

[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.520]
Oh, you're talking Bill Cosford.

[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.040]
You don't know your answer from your elbow.

[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.380]
I've been on Steve's show twice.

[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.620]
What was the day with you?

[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.560]
And once was the day I hosted it myself.

[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.760]
He thinks you're Bill Cosford.

[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.180]
Oh, that's what it is.

[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.040]
No, if I was Bill Cosford, I wouldn't be here.

[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.300]
Oh, that's what it is.

[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:48.300]

[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:48.980]
Oh, you are.

[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.000]
I just can't believe you.

[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.060]
Chronic is one thing, but Chronic and Confused.

[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:54.780]
Paul Harvey Jr.

[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:57.060]
Listen, I finally figured out who's leaving.

[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.220]
They're recording my conversations with you

[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.720]
and leaving them on my answering machine.

[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:01.680]
Oh, you did.

[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:02.920]
Somebody's doing that.

[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:03.940]
Yeah, I figured out who it was.

[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:04.240]
Who?

[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.400]
You know, Ernie Moe's my lawn on the weekend.

[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:06.940]
Yeah.

[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.620]
And the day he came in for a glass of water,

[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:11.380]
I'm almost sure he copied out my phone.

[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.500]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.140]
I bet you have to stop for missing some of your photos.

[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:15.700]
I'm not sure.

[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.720]
I had no idea.

[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.700]
And I'd check out that toilet paper to see

[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.720]
which way they're hanging on the roller, too.

[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.160]
Are you going to read any of these numbers if he hasn't?

[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.000]
Oh, believe me.

[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.840]
They'll be some of the first to get on the air.

[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.360]
Trust me.

[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.260]
Depend on it.

[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.260]
I'll tell you what, though.

[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.400]
Ernie sounds good compared to you know what.

[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.220]
Hmm.

[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:32.820]
Compared to what?

[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:34.720]
Say it, Paul.

[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:35.280]
Richard.

[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:36.040]
Dick.

[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.120]
Oh.

[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.020]
Little Dickie.

[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:39.480]
Little Dickie.

[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:39.660]
Oh.

[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.580]
He is loud though.

[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.420]
You got to give him that.

[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:42.700]
Yeah.

[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.560]
You are a dad from working with Lee Fowler up there in J&O.

[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.860]
Radio for the heart of hearing.

[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.200]

[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:49.780]
Okay.

[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:50.700]
Good day.

[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:51.880]
Good day.

[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.740]
Oh man.

[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.780]
Talk about confused.

[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.660]
He thinks he's talking to Bill Cosford about movies.

[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.340]
I didn't know where that was coming from.

[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.460]
And this is supposed to be one of our semi-inducing.

[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.120]
That's Paul Harvey Jr.

[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.020]
Well, we used to have a better cholesterol liberty.

[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:04.640]
Wow.

[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.340]
Wow.

[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.980]
The audience is crumbling.

[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.400]
You know where James got him.

[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.860]
Tom Dernan today.

[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.420]
They'll be down here.

[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:11.760]
They will.

[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.160]
They will and I think some of them will be up there.

[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:13.160]

[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:13.160]

[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:13.160]

[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:13.160]

[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:13.160]

[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.960]
They were obsessed with this show, which I just can't believe.

[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.180]
Yeah, Derrick is a big fan, I know that.

[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.680]
And Johnson, he both thought...

[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.540]
Johnson did a race.

[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.280]
Did you hear that he called the race to make believe race for the Derby or whatever,

[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:24.760]
or whatever, whatever.

[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.560]
And he was using all the names of the people here instead of horses.

[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.200]
And at fact Rick was on the outside,

[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.040]
and the bird flying down the middle of the track.

[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:32.900]
I came in second.

[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:40.160]
Yeah, I can believe it. I mean he knew every character. Yeah, you're big in the press box. A giant in the press right? Yeah, huh?

[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:48.000]
Directly says that I jerk jerk. Well, dirt. That's a great American that now see now you're talking a guy from Michigan. Okay. Yeah, big harness guy

[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.320]
I got harness guy who knows what it's all about and Wally McElmory and Joe Marsch and Donnie Hall. He knows racing at it's you know what it was really something real.

[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:25.300]
Anyway, that reminds me. Pompano's opening tomorrow night. I'm going to do that spawn a couple of minutes, but you'll be up there. No, I won't. No, I'll be at the drugs tomorrow. No, I mean tomorrow, but I mean, you can't. Yeah, I have a friend who's really does really well up there. Really built, but strong. Yeah, he's a trainer. Oh, yeah. He's my bet. He's the guy who's sought me going to Pompano. He was my neighbor when I first moved in Miami. Absolutely. Yeah, he had a great meat last year. Oh, it's a lot of racing. He was my best my first best friend in Florida next to Hank. No, I mean before I even knew him.

[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:55.160]
Hank were you knew Hank now that's saying a lot of gold. Birker one thing about Hank Goldiger one thing about Hank man. He's just about everybody's best. Yeah, isn't it? Well, you're next. You're on the list. Do I want to take some of these calls about this? Well, this one might be good. Hello. I said no. Oh, you know, I guess what line it's on. Yeah, I said no. It's on a vocal one. What how could I ever guess? We have a mentioned a word about over here, which direction are they here? I get seven here over here. Mm-hmm.

[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.120]
Who does this? Yeah.

[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:06.020]
That's the end. I'm doing the way I'm making money. I know you're talking about GTR. Well, I forgot about them because the music quite a down a little.

[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:15.060]
Yeah, we got you. Couldn't he yourself? Yeah, boy, we better pray, especially with your keeper coming over a couple days. We better pray that GTR goes up a little bit because

[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:24.380]
wise is just not a happy camera. He's not a happy friend. Well, what a good name. Well, I didn't know if he knows numbers right away when they come in.

[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:33.440]
Maybe they're maybe the monkey. And the 18 to 34 male numbers. I sure hope we get those in today because you were right. No, seriously, that we were right on the edge in midday. Yeah,

[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:46.700]
of going ahead of GTR in 18 to 34 men. Now that would be embarrassing for that. That's why I'm advertising you. Yeah, maybe that's why they're cranking it up. We have a time to get some numbers. It's really difficult. Maybe they're trying to bleed into here and helps you bleed into that.

[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:58.220]
But you haven't already bleeding. I saw the numbers, but you have you haven't said anything about seven. We've talked about every even mentioned channel six, which is pretty amazing. Not a word about seven.

[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:05.200]
They're doing well now. They're trying to sell this show TV news. There would be like cops with a TV news show.

[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:14.500]
Right. Rick Sanchez apparently is going to be the star of this thing. I mean, it was incredible. I was going to take the dog out the other night. And I went to the window and I looked and there was Rick Sanchez was

[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:22.600]
purring in my window. Yeah. And the channel fan band was out there and I couldn't believe it. Well, they're going to do a they got a new show that they're also they've got in the works called

[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:29.400]
America's Unknown Mysteries. And what it is is that you call up and you squeal on your neighbors and then they come around and they catch you.

[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:36.660]
Exactly. And you know, they give you a good neighborhood. Yeah. Tom, have you seen the crime watch show they put on in place of it?

[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:46.280]
What was that? Yeah, seven, thirty. You know, the file is for it. Yeah. Holy to leader. Well, you got well, that's the, you know, they'll just keep putting these things on until they all burn themselves.

[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:57.620]
Boy, there must be about 10 of them now. You know, crime watch, crime, look, crime beat, credible. You got cop cop talk. Isn't it one of those really? Yeah, there's like a Sunday. I think Sunday, Sunday,

[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:07.680]
gross. That does a cop talk. Channel 10, I had it on for a while. And between that and the current affair and inside reporting inside story and outside. Yeah, story.

[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:22.140]
I'm a little bit for Tom. There is anything subversive. Well, they could be significant. Yeah, it might be. Yeah, it could be. Oh, my goodness. You want to go call them during the break? I'm going to do a break now.

[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:35.440]
Go right in there. All right. And you got a call for off the year after I do my spot. Okay, it's waiting for you from me. Oh, listen, we got things really cooking out. Okay. This time is on.

[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:46.100]
It's amazing news break. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Everybody hold on to your seats now, especially if you're close to the floor like Bob mayor. I like Bobby's in

[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:54.080]
this guy, but this is a for little stories. Anyway, this Saturday night, that's tomorrow night, the gates open and the brand new season of great harness racing at pump.

[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:59.280]
No park. John would like it up there. Even though he doesn't care about the racing because he loves free meals. Mm hmm.

[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:08.100]
Why are we back? Wow. That was that's right. It's a short break. Okay. You're going to have to say goodbye to a missing there on the phone. I got to run.

[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:23.620]
Tell her goodbye. Good to hear from you. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay. I'll see you Michael McCay. All right. No news yet. Speak is not available at the moment. Really? Well, but they just called you. Yeah, but now they're in a meeting.

[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:36.200]
Oh, what you already said where it was. You don't have to give me like he's nothing like you already said Channel 4. Oh, did I? Yeah. You got the message. Yeah.

[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:45.680]
Yeah. Coles say, DiClobo, but you said Channel 4. Yeah. Well, it's not Robo, but it's the person who will call me is now meeting with him and boo in a dog named the something. Yeah.

[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:58.660]
And Paul that really frosted my ass a little bit. He's going to be a denial. They are. How they're going to deny? Well, he's gone. His desk is cleaned out. Well, that we can trust that call. Oh, yeah. Believe me.

[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:09.900]
Hamburg should call us. He's called it. You know, they should. Well, it would be tacky. I would. I mean, I love to talk to him, but she's I think he would feel uncomfortable. I don't know. But I know I'm going to do that. I'd love to have money.

[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:17.240]
Yeah, but I just don't feel he's the kind of guy would want to do that. Maybe he is. I have no idea what his relationship is over there. But I'd sure love to have many.

[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:24.000]
If you would want to do that, he called about the Dion album that I heard. Yeah, he was obsessed and he ran right out and bought it.

[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:37.000]
And what can I say? Really? It's a shame. There's a guy is good. I don't I don't get it. I just I want to promise that it's in this market and a business in general, but especially in this market, if you're good boy, you've got a problem. Yeah.

[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:53.160]
That's why I've been able to stay on so long. I'm doing. The living proof. Yeah. Well, look at Ricky Tiki. There you are. I'm going to go. Can I read Richard? What's up to Johnny? Well, not bad enough.

[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:08.120]
Yeah, he is working on being bad though and trust me. He's pretty close. 21 to noon at W. I. D. So we covered all of TV stations that count, right? We channel two was even here filming taping or whatever that was all about.

[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:38.040]
The cost for did not show by the shocking, although it was interesting that Paul Harvig Jr. did call in with some movie questions, but just in case he had shown up, that would have been good. And you ripped Steve pretty good. You ripped a dicking far full in the ass. We covered W. O. L. D. Haven't discussed much about FM. There's nothing to say is there not a lot. I mean, talk about hot 105. I don't understand what that means. I see here's a big fan of hot 105 favorite. No, I just said that E. D. R. is climbing that they they had some dirty tricks.

[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:56.840]
Going. Yeah, and I heard something yesterday about how 105 night again. It's just a rumor. Yeah, and they used to say this about my show to some very reluctant to buy into these things, but somebody was telling me that they're having a great deal of difficulty selling time, even with the big numbers they've got because they're perceived as a black station.

[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:11.520]
And they don't think they're trying to be well, no, they're trying to get an enormous audience and pick up a lot of black listeners as part of that audience, but they're all they're trying to be like a mainstream station and they're being perceived as an ethnic station and they're not having success in selling mainstream advertising.

[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:26.820]
Now that's again, what I was told. I heard this just there. Everybody's not been from either. I wasn't able to confirm the sturdy tricks thing either, but they've brought us spots. Do they? He listens to the station. I don't know why that would be though, because black music is always.

[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:38.720]
He's been kind of on the cutting edge of what would become major music. Black music. No, this isn't black music that's like rock roll. This isn't like Motown. No, this is I don't know what it is. I can't describe it for you. Well, it's not heavy.

[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:51.060]
You're a mystery. Mister know it all over here. It just insists that it's just tremendous and it's marvelous. There is nobody else I talked to who has anything good to say about their music. Okay, because basically I don't hang you know, I don't know who those people are who listen to that stuff.

[01:10:51.540 --> 01:11:02.220]
But do they play like Paul Abdul and Janet Jackson and all the big hits? No, they play Karim Abdul Jbar. After six, though, it's on the walls. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:11.660]
So I'm a fan of it. And power is strictly still doing their ethnic thing in spite of all their protestation and I know Tanner and Cox are listening right now. Yeah, they go and heavy for the light.

[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:20.220]
I mean, that's the whole thing. But again, it's probably good business in this market and Zeta still on the air, which has got to be one of the most incredible.

[01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.320]
Yeah, talking by over there. Tom over there. I'm.

[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.460]
Are they still on the air?

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:37.120]
There's still on the air, barely. They're doing something this week about kids. They're talking to parents of kids who kill themselves or kill each other with guns or something like that.

[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:47.320]
Children who shot the radio. Maybe that would be a blessing to anyone. But that's what they're doing. They are still on the air though. Well, yeah, but that you see, they're where they want to be Neil.

[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:54.140]
They want those one floors and one five. That's what I would have. They had to five. They had to worry about billing a lot of projects like that.

[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.640]
A lot of projects. They all when you feel in a whole thing. Yeah, I do.

[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.680]
The figure is easy to cope with. Sure. I mean, taxes and yeah, you got to have a count. They count the money. They want to quiet.

[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:13.160]
But seriously, can you believe? I mean, I know what the answer is, but can anybody believe that Volger and Mark Keun are still the program directors of those two stations.

[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:19.440]
Stations that have had such phenomenal figure the last year or two that it's just it's mind-bogg.

[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:25.660]
When you think of where they were a few years ago when they had their joint talk when you were over there and on the FN, they had I-95.

[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.540]
Yeah. When they were doing almost all of them.

[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.560]
And then eight combined, maybe even more than that. And now, you know, combine what are they doing?

[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:40.700]
They were making some serious money. Yeah. And now, but that's what they wanted. They said that they didn't want.

[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:48.020]
And so they have, they have this mentality that no matter what they put on, except when they were doing all news, which they loved all news, even though they had.

[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:54.800]
See, right way back, they had big numbers with all news, huge numbers for a while, but then all news petered out. It wore its course.

[01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:02.540]
And no matter what they put on after that, they couldn't, the excuse was we can't spell it. No matter what it was, we can't sell it on the AM.

[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:12.000]
And how long can you keep saying that? They couldn't sell me. They couldn't sell Stan. They couldn't sell Jay Michaels. They couldn't sell Liz. They couldn't sell that. They couldn't sell Mike Time. Maybe they ought to get different sales.

[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:21.820]
Well, there you go. Maybe or maybe some different man. It wasn't normally not Norman Kent. Norman Kent. What are you over there for? No, Larry Kent. Larry Kent, right? Norman.

[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.380]
And Park was over there for a little while.

[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:40.240]
I'm a program. I'm having the air back. Right after they took away what the thing. I don't understand. This is a very strange market. I just, I continue to tell you, no matter what anybody says, the music on FM in this market for a major market is so prophetic that it doesn't.

[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:49.460]
When you go to Orlando and they've got an AOR station 96.5. I don't know the callers that puts anything here to shame. Oh, it shouldn't have said that.

[01:13:50.120 --> 01:14:03.100]
And they got an oldie station cool in Orlando, which is outstanding. Who will in Phoenix to this is a terrific station. Well, no, I'm just OK. This is with a seat. But regardless of what it's worth, it's not the beat. But it's great.

[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:16.020]
Cool. Cool. Cool. And Phoenix is one of the best oldie stations in the country. Yeah, it really is. But why? Why is it have to be that way? It's so frustrating. Now you get most new radios in your car. You have 12 FM pre-cars. But you got nobody with any guts here.

[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:21.940]
And you keep punching and punching and punching and finally you say, I'm just going to slap a paper of CD in here. I can't take this anymore.

[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:36.900]
Somebody does something he does. Some success with it. And then 14 other stations are copying it because they're not doing anything what they have. And then they just split the oil. She's a good example. Right. Three years ago, was it that she was doing five and six.

[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:45.280]
And everybody started copying she and how they were all doing one and a half. But I gave up trying to make any sense out of a Zator and wins win.

[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:59.260]
And like this guy, when they hit your eyes and thick as was screwing up there, when this guy next door here, every time a big record comes out, and it's like number one on the AOR charts, he won't play it like the Dian thing and the Roy Orbison record. And then what was the other one here recently that the polka he did play?

[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:15.120]
No, no, but there was another real thing or another one here in the last month or two. And he just he won't play or anybody can play music people wanting. He's got to find this. That is a point. I mean, you know, what imagination is that take? Yeah, you're right. I mean, if you know that people like it, I mean, what do you need a program director to play a hit for?

[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:31.000]
That's an excellent point. I'm going to remember that when the spike comes in here. No, we hope they do very, very well next door, not that we like them all that much, but especially since the truth is always. Yeah, and also to make everybody a lot more money and keep everybody a little bit calmer. Yeah.

[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:41.340]
But I don't I don't get it. I don't understand why FMI I travel all over the country and you can go even to medium markets and hear much, much better FM and you don't have to keep.

[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:50.560]
And the end of the music here is brutal awful. It is not a station that used to be decent just aren't anymore. In fact, I'll tell you at one time was a great stage.

[01:15:50.560 --> 01:16:06.120]
I'll tell you like FT all is a good example. There are am stations that also sound like you're in two egg or in pohoki like FT all is a good example. I mean, that sounds like a minor market radio station like a little league radio station or signal not too terrific.

[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:12.440]
Forget about they had 50,000 watts would it sound any better? Yeah, really just marginal.

[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:19.680]
Well, they're high or maybe a little league minor market sounding station too many stations. And how you tell me there's a new station.

[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:36.180]
I was on where in English. Doing what? What kind of power? 50,000 watts. Yeah. Now what's the station on 670? What the hell is that all about?

[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:49.560]
WFV. No, it would not be nice if you had a perfect perfect wait a minute. That's all I need to hear that all the audience can relate. They hear you babbling in the background.

[01:16:49.560 --> 01:17:04.000]
Explain this. WFV. Well, I mean, you can't talk for a half hour without a mic. Okay, he still see he feels that he knows something about this business and believe me, he doesn't. I don't care what he tells you explain this WFV 50,000.

[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:18.700]
What is it? It's Spanish speaking radio. Just what we need is another. You have any idea how far a station on 670, 50,000 watts gets out. You can hear them like a label in Jacksonville.

[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:47.780]
Yeah, okay. And do we really need a Spanish speaking station? They could be running. They could be running. What we're trying to do is get a station and go out of the way to Union New Jersey. Yeah, there's a lot of the Cuban, the Mary L people went up to Union New Jersey. So my point is that they're wasting a lot of power. They could be running a thousand watts and cover South Florida. It's fine. That's all. That's all. The other thing we gave him a mic for that. The other stations that are coming on this. All the clear channel frequency. For what? Like 880.

[01:17:48.260 --> 01:18:17.660]
I know. I know. And pen 30 and like I think 11 something or other. 11 or 3 or 4 more big ones coming. So. Probably all going to be espaniol. Oh my God. I thought I kept hearing about this assimilation and pretty soon we wouldn't have all these Spanish language stations and passage of time that would all go. I remember all of the things we started with. Yeah, I thought it would. I still say it all the ethnic stations and have their own book for a great title.

[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:47.640]
Yeah. And just have a book for English language, you know, non-ethnic station. I agree entirely with that. I don't see where the whole. Yeah, it is because I mean look. I mean, we do very well. I want to try to put it in perspective. You realize in date County that we have right off the bat 50% or pretty close to 50% of the potential population in date County. Well, not going to listen to an English language station. Okay. Exactly. Because an awful lot of them.

[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:57.600]
They don't understand it and a lot of them listen to the Spanish language because that's what they want to hear whatever the reason. 50% of the County is gone. So how the hell do we possibly do these numbers that we do?

[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:15.140]
You know, if that was all taken out of there, then you'd see the whole thing in better perspective. Yeah, because I don't think you're really competing for the same audience. I know. Two different. I mean, it's almost like baseball and football. It's like comparing what a baseball team does to what a football team does. It's just a different game. Well, that's.

[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:24.620]
I don't know why that it would benefit them to because then numbers would go up in there on you. You're that absolutely. And it would no question about the hell with the hell.

[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.780]
Is that hell? Yeah, the hell with the hell.

[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:38.460]
How many just calm down? Let's leave this happy stuff for Dicky Farball. Hey, we don't want to take any of his topics away. Speaking of that, we have been very remiss today.

[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:55.500]
At to this afternoon, filling in for Steve, who's out there looking for a job. What is Steve doing today? I don't know. Nobody's got a baseball card thing tomorrow morning down by my house. Maybe that's it. Maybe he's got this. I don't know what he's putting them all in nice little plate. Anyway, the Dean will be here this afternoon. And whether

[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:08.120]
he's on, no one needs to be on. Mr. Suspenders in their auto hang is had an extreme that the Dean will be on because if you look back in the book, the Dean is invisible. He's like Ray Maland in the invisible man.

[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:16.280]
But he's a good friend of W.I.O.D. The Dean's to naturally be having a good sense of humor. We're giving him an afternoon and hoping that that'll stop the calls to Disney for a while.

[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:27.780]
Anyway, two to two thirty is open phones to thirty to four thirty. We talk about censorship in the media and have they gotten out of hand at the TV that was fundamentalist Howard Kromas,

[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:44.160]
that I've analyzed about ten minutes, talks to Chris Haasford from the South Florida Coalition against censorship and at five p.m. Laura Van Wormer, who's one of those soap opera people, calls to tell us the real sexy lively and steamy dirt on almost everyone in the world of TV news.

[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:53.700]
This is on the Dean with the Dean TV news followed by Hank Gold digger on sports talk. Oh my gosh, he's working right on the eve of you on Kipper.

[01:20:55.220 --> 01:21:07.060]
Well, it's close enough for me. And then the Dicking Farful tonight, one of your favorites and the special segment tonight between eight thirty and nine o'clock actress Susanne Summers calls in to discuss the perils of bedwitting.

[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:11.180]
And then it now I'm going to what do you like in this like about Social Security?

[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.100]
You are you're just cool your name.

[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.420]
Although it does say that from ten to nine.

[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:26.060]
The not. Look at that. Look at the boy Jerry just goes out of there breathless. He doesn't know whether to scream.

[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:34.800]
I'm not going to be a banana. What the hell could I do? I try to put this big time talent on there and he just won't give me a chance. Well, we've given you a week and trust me. It's not getting any better.

[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:44.920]
Anyway, it's eleven fifty. W I O D citywide insurance agencies want to make sure you know that the new Florida law requiring minimum liability car insurance is now.

[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:54.800]
Okay, it's eleven fifty five or W I D rushing out of the control room. We've got a flash boy. This man has got a gigantic pleasure. I can see the way he's just the burrowling in here.

[01:21:55.720 --> 01:22:08.480]
Tom, we have a we have a vehement denial from Channel four. All right. Here's the story whoever they're claiming that that was a dirty trick by some and ten and they said that they have never talked to Mike Schneider as I suspected.

[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:22.400]
They have never talked to Grand Ranker. They have talked to John Palmer. The reason they're talking to John Palmer is because Hamburg has told them that under the circumstances he would like to leave as soon as they find under what's. Well, the whole thing how they got him twisted in the wind.

[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:31.900]
I mean, they didn't put it that way. That's what and how can they deny it? Well, but Hamburg is there. His office is not cleared out. He had a day off yesterday. He will be on the air tonight. That's the official word.

[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:42.040]
He was on the last night. Well, I saw him last night with my own four on the island. Maybe the lying about everything. He was on last night. Well, I don't know then whatever, but that's that's the word.

[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:51.460]
And I got it from someone that I trust and they said that they suspected that was a dirty trick by someone at one of the other stage. They admitted they are talking to Palmer. That's been in USA too.

[01:22:51.720 --> 01:23:00.580]
It's also been in the fort. Lauderdale News. Well, I just didn't get to that. That was the best. It's a living way to help out there and yell at the end of my sentence.

[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:09.420]
It was in the national enquire to I'm sure. Yeah, and in the star and the tatler too. Okay, Mr. Smarty. But anyway, that's it. So they are talking to the purple signal.

[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:21.560]
It was an interesting thing. John Palmer, you know, the guy is what he's a 56 57 years old. Tom is doing weekends at Palm Beach with that.

[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:28.520]
That's the bonus for talking about the 50th market and the kind of I understand John, first of all, John Palmer is not all that exciting to begin with.

[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:38.200]
I've had you who's on the WOLR now doing the news. Who used to be on the CBS morning show. What is his name? Oh, yeah. I wrote Smith. Well, and Smith. He's not that good. I like the.

[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:47.580]
I like the news better before when what's your name was on there? Sarah Kessler or whatever. She was good. She makes good. Yeah. Yeah.

[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:55.040]
Yeah. Oh, nobody can beat Sarah Lee. Yeah. Nobody doesn't like Sarah Lee. Yeah. That's true. Anyway, that's the word. Handbrook's well.

[01:23:55.180 --> 01:24:03.860]
I have four or a half years ago. There for a while, but he's leaving. Yeah. And it's very unfortunate. So they can say that it's, you know, maybe it wasn't dirty trick to try to give him a little stilth on the side.

[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:12.860]
But the bottom line is they try to replace him. Yeah, I didn't think that. Yeah. The Schneider thing never made me. Well, let's hope not. Yeah. Because he does. He looks like from the Boris Carlaw School of Brook.

[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:19.500]
He's got that real white pasting complexion. It looks like you're. You know, everybody else has got a normal skin color and he's white.

[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:27.020]
First of all, you know, like I said, he's got a much better position now at ABC. He's got national exposure. He got a kiss to ground that he worked.

[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:34.520]
Absolutely. He's not good. And the other thing is any station that brought my Schneider back would have to live with what he did on the way out.

[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:43.140]
And, you know, I would be the I guarantee I would write there would be no column after column. Yeah, I mean, there would be no, there would be like like you've I were to leave Zaden go to W. I would do.

[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:49.240]
There be no credibility. All the things I said about Disney, I have an management. He has cars. Well, you know, credibility.

[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.800]
But I mean, for those people that don't know when Mike Schneider used to be on Channel 10 and he left about three, four, five years ago.

[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.360]
And when he left, he said the reason he was leaving with this was in a fit place to raise his children. And you know, he was.

[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:11.620]
So it's not written. Yeah. And he was in New York. He went to New York to live in the subway with him. He really just dumped all over the area. And, you know, he happened to live in an area where there was virtually crime proof.

[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.800]
I mean, he was down in one of those rich, the subdivisions down in.

[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:23.580]
I cut a not color rich near saga, saga, Bayer over by. All kinds of talking about Germany. I do. He's like losing it. No, he was.

[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:31.720]
In other words, he lived in one of these real rich, he subdevelopments that had all kinds of security. It was just trying to stay as he was full of crap.

[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:37.860]
Yeah, I was trying to say it was going for the big bucks, but he wanted to try to be a prima donna and be holier than now.

[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:43.580]
So we try to come back with his tail between his legs now. He'd have no credibility. And the station would have to deal with that.

[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:49.460]
So that would be like the Dean saying he didn't like the people in Philly and he hated it there. And coming back here with his beer beer.

[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.660]
Yeah, that's right. And he'll be here at two this afternoon and just to don't forget it.

[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:06.220]
Okay, we got Chuck Meyer standing by old Chuck E. Meyer with a big noon W.I.O.D. news. Tom Jicke, the radio and TV editor, the four-water Dale news and sudden sentinels here causing more trouble than usual.

[01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:14.220]

All right, now, would you control yourselves? No, we're not playing spots. We're on the air.

[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:18.740]
Everybody just calm down a little bit. Take your stuff there. Mike's in here for 20 or 30. No problem.

[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.300]
Look at that. We got BLTs. Wayne just went crazy today. Thank you so much, Wayne, for Arnold's road castle.

[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:32.740]
We're just making this really dessert in puppet. Where's the location? Right off the I-95, but 125.

[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:39.640]
What about the block off the expressway? It's easy on and off, as they say.

[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.940]
Okay, 12.06. Tom Jik is here. The book is during these next to 20 minutes or so.

[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.200]
The numbers for the summer book, the arbitraron numbers are becoming in.

[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.300]
Going to take a while. Why? The word. It's going to take a while.

[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:57.160]
Let me say it again in the next 20 or 30 minutes. They will be coming in. I don't think so.

[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:03.960]
He just came in here and told you who told you that? Boy, Gary. Boy, Gary and Bill Wise.

[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.520]
He just came in here and said in the next 30 minutes, who? Boy, Gary. What did he tell you?

[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:14.040]
It's going to take a while. We know why Bill Wise is kicking the plug out every two minutes.

[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:18.960]
You don't understand. You see, you just refused. The man won't listen to anything I say.

[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:26.820]
I'm saying what he said started at 11.45. Okay. And because it's a whole book and there's that much information coming out.

[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:36.100]
It's going to take about 30 to 45 minutes. So about 12.30, which is 22 minutes and 40 seconds from now.

[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.920]
It will probably be coming. Give or take a couple of minutes.

[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:48.980]
Are you stealing from Chester's material now?

[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.020]
Oh, you can't do that well at all. I wouldn't make that sound again if I were you because people start to talk.

[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:03.140]
Anyway, so did we take care of you? Well, I can't chew and eat. I mean, come on.

[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:07.320]
I can do it. It's you and eat bad radio, but you can do it. That's right. What happened to that note?

[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.600]
Are you going to eat some of these because if you don't, I'm going to be really peered.

[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:16.580]
I've been thinking don't worry about what's on the year. This is that little special time of day on this show every day.

[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.560]
I'm right in the car and listening to you people doing this and going, God, they never did that when I was there.

[01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:26.440]
Well, we are today. Believe me. And I was really hoping it would be a honor that would come in.

[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:32.160]
Yeah. Well, he is. I love these things. Well, we love him and Bernadette. They've been great to us the best.

[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:36.060]
Boy, you almost can't even find the role of so much stuff on this.

[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:43.260]
Yes. Right. Do they actually sell these? Yes. Double bacon-neely. Right. Double-neely-burgr.

[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.040]
Jesus, I'm surprised that they don't have to become road jam. You know, the happy-winged royal-life map.

[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:53.180]
Yeah. And I'm going to become a Bruins fan part-time because they got to play your name Neely.

[01:29:54.120 --> 01:30:01.300]
I'm a Jersey devil fan this year. I got them at 25 to 1 in Vegas. So I took a small piece of the action on the devils.

[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:08.460]
By the way, I got these. Who comedy defenseman? Log is messed up. I know that's unusual. Mike Lee has got the same lifestyle.

[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.380]
Chris, we'll move on to the next hour. Okay. Just amazing. I beg your pardon?

[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:16.100]
I was a devil. I got to do it. Well, a lot. He don't.

[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:21.160]
Okay. All right. You want to take somebody's calls now? Because now we've covered all the things.

[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:25.640]
You know, they were talking about getting a hockey team here in Miami. Now, what would happen if they had a hockey team?

[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:29.880]
And the devils came in with the two Russian defensemen. Would they let them play into Miami Arena? No.

[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:37.600]
Well, I mean, they are. Nobody knows. You know, I caught balls. You know, all kidding. No, they're actually talking about bringing a hockey team.

[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:42.140]
You know, hockey is implored. I think you're wrong. You too. Yeah, I do.

[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:49.720]
I think hockey would do as well as the heat. Well, maybe. But then I'd have to give up this job to Brock Taster.

[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.240]
Yeah. Did you ever do hockey? Yeah. Yeah. The best. Yeah. Really.

[01:30:54.440 --> 01:31:04.240]
Yeah. Which team do you do? Rochester. I'm. I'm. Eric. Yeah. Now, Tom. Yeah. If. If we've talked about this on the show.

[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:10.400]
So if Neil did play by play on Miami, her came baseball just hypothetical. Mike Neil should be doing play by play.

[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:18.600]
Don't you think I should be color? Well, being the big baseball expert that you are. I mean, it would be a different type of a broadcast.

[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:24.240]
Yeah. You could sit down and smell off a three hour. He's going to this game over. You know, what are these in it?

[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:30.880]
We only play five sets in tennis. Why did they play nine innings? Yeah. Yeah. I would cheer out a new dimension to it.

[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:39.400]
Exactly. Until Fraser came up and physically removed him. It's 10 minutes past noon in WI. The numbers will be in surely

[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.740]
in spite of what some other people are trying to do. You know, some of that.

[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:49.840]
Trumbass makers who wander the halls looking for problems during the news break. They will be in momentarily.

[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:56.480]
They walked up to me and said it's going to take a while. Well, so what does that mean? That's all he said.

[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:06.620]
Well, he was more specific in here. Okay. Okay. I didn't know he'd been in here. I was just telling you what I was telling you that as you were giving me your usual snarly

[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:14.560]
rott and praby attitude. Well, you should write a column about putting up with his graph every day, boy. You think you've got problems.

[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:22.160]
Anyway, Toyota of Hollywood. I'm not going to give those other mental in gets to ask you why sure can't, but you know, you have to consider the story.

[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:30.420]
In the video, with Liberty and Justice Fraud. Okay. It's 1214 at WI. Thank you so much, John. I'll get carried away there.

[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:37.700]
And the magic moment is coming any second now. Well, we're sure going to have to clean this mess up before the dean. Oh, and boy, absolutely.

[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:41.000]
Leave it for the dean. Well, first of all, huh?

[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:50.260]
Oh, come on. What kind of a big style is this anyway? We know how far there you go. By the way, are you eating all of BLT's?

[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:54.840]
No, I haven't had a half a one. There's one. What did you have? You want a half? No.

[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:03.960]
Sure. No, thank you. Because we're sitting in front of your face. I don't want to be a cute poet. Well, I don't want to overdo today because yesterday, boy, I just went crazy in here.

[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:11.300]
What did he eat back in those days? No, real radio. We used to read poetry on the air. What I was on.

[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:22.180]
Of course it was on tape because I had better things to do like sleep. I need to listen to my other videos of my audience. I spend most of my time sleeping.

[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:32.600]
Okay, 12 or 10, 14, man, I'm telling you. I thought you were watching TV stations. They want to miss the bed. They would have their cameras over here when we passed them all the way late.

[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.640]
You say, pass in the hallway. I'm curious about that. Is he going to come in here while we're still here? I don't think he'll do it.

[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:45.220]
Are we going to do a cross over? Nick just loves the dean. Nick is, he does. He's obsessed with me. Are we going to do a cross over? No, I don't think so.

[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:56.440]
No, like Samian Mike, you might do a walk over another step over the body in the hallway. No, Alan, it's just a joke. Alan, don't get all emotional now. He's all right in his own disorder.

[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:04.880]
You know, Al, yes, Debbie, yesterday when she was going to bring in those sugar cookies again. I think he got his women mixed up. Certainly Debbie doesn't look like Sam.

[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:11.820]
Well, Alan has had his woman mixed up for a long time. But that's enough. That's a story.

[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:21.640]
Okay, it's 1215. Oh, here's somebody who wants to rip. Wait a minute. Is that something important? No. Something you're a little thing that Nick, we've already got one of those.

[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:30.580]
I'm not going to promote that kind of crap on here. Anyway, Steve was one of these appearances. Steve is appearing so much. He doesn't have time to sleep anymore.

[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:40.280]
Banner with the best. Huh? Thursday, October 12th at the JCC. What is that? The Jewish community college? I guess. Oh, it is. I was just kidding.

[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:54.040]
I was just making it up. The Jewish community center on centralized boulevard plantation 750 per person. And banter with Steve. I like what they do that one. They can listen to him for free every day. But I hope he made all of that.

[01:34:54.040 --> 01:35:06.680]
I like to be on the like the ball plays. You're going to sit at a table and find a lot of the two and three hours that throw more power to him. Okay, more power to him. I'm off for the talent in this business down with management and up with talent. Okay.

[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:25.500]
I will say this. I hate to say what you're here, but they've been. They've been really nice to me here. I know that sounds frightening, but I'm not the prior on beyond your wild. I've taken. I've taken some shots and they're like wildest dreams. I hate to say that because it, you know, it sprawls the image of the whole show, but they've really been great.

[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:55.480]
Oh, whoa. Why do you have to leave it open? You know, because otherwise they start expecting to know every now and then about what's good and bad radio? Here's a collar to rip Mr. Jika. Oh, I hate Tom jika. Really? Yes. Well, please go right ahead, sir. He's here. Let's write ready for your house. I don't know. He's from the Hink Goldberg School of Personality for a while. I know that. I like Hank a lot. Yeah. He's your best friend too. Second, right? He's not my best friend. He's a friend. Next to Dick Farrell. He's his best friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not a friend. I'm not

[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:25.180]
a friend. Yeah. Right. So what's your problem? You had a material ready? No, we were. What is this appointment? He was just trying to be an old drunk provocateur. Here's a hot 105 spy. Are you there? Yes. I am. Great. I knew. This morning I had an unusual experience. I had to take two high school kids to school, right? And the first thing they did in the car was put on hot 105. Something called the

[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:31.420]
work in Mindy show or something like that. I mean, Marlor and Mindy, Morgan Mallor. This was about the

[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:38.740]
filthyest radio really have ever heard. I mean, this makes Howard Stern sound like a choir boy. Talking

[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:45.820]
about all kinds of, you know, we had underdroers while slow dancing. Really? So now it's a

[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:51.760]
way of mouth. Time to call Dickie Fawful tonight. I mean, really, if the kids are listening to that

[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:58.020]
station, I think there's more to it than the music. I mean, this was just fact I drive into work after

[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:03.220]
that for about a half hour. I couldn't I couldn't take turn the station off. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. All right. You know,

[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:09.900]
Johnny Dark who knows nothing about the business. So they don't have kids listening. I guarantee you that next to power 96,

[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:15.120]
and they may even beat him in teams. I guarantee they're either number one or number two in teams in the market. Okay. Right.

[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:19.840]
But Johnny Dark says they don't have kids listening. It's the number one. What do you think is listening to that station,

[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:28.140]
Mr. Dork? Dark adults? It's the high school. The audience. Yeah. Since the in-laptime, I've had nowhere else to go. But

[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:36.920]
sure adults, the beans got over a hundred. Okay. Okay. Thanks for your report. Okay. You are. I'm telling you, the

[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:44.640]
main is so full of it. Adults are listening to that. Well, we'll see when the number will come. I guarantee you that the

[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:49.840]
biggest chunk of their audience in the morning is teenagers, but you know, you don't evidently. You don't

[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:55.840]
ever see the books do you? Well, then how do why do you just pick these things out of the air? We get the

[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.460]
numbers. I mean, very glad to show them to you. Although I'm not so sure you don't understand them, but I mean, they

[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:04.580]
they do come in and black and white. They're all there. They have this enormous teeny-bopper audience. All

[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:09.460]
the kids listen to hot. And I do agree that at night they have even more of these. They're wrapped up,

[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:16.720]
wrapped crap people listening to all that junk, junk they play. I said they're probably number two

[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:21.140]
to power or maybe even number one and while hundreds in it, those three stations ever,

[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:30.200]
truly all the teens in the market. What? Well, just barely ahead of all. I'm not touching that line with

[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:36.080]
the 10-foot pole. It's 20 past, little WIOD. Tom Jikaziri, Johnny Dark is here eating again,

[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:42.920]
which is just incredible. And look at this. He's putting all he puts the condiments on. You know,

[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:48.660]
Jay, look at that. He's squeezing out ketchup on the little Arnold's burgers and he's going to put

[01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:53.160]
them in calls on there. The man wants to push that on the Dean's chair. Yeah, squeeze some of that

[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:59.560]
on the chair before the Dean comes in because that'll really spice up the show. Okay, let's do a

[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:04.040]
little break now and this is quite a day at WIOD history and you're a part of it.

[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:09.220]
Doyle Aaron is right in the right place. Do I have his own TV show now? No. Yeah, it's on,

[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.260]
what does it call? It's on the Dave County cable system. It's him and some guy named Narlie.

[01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:20.600]
Dave County, you're talking about local access television. Is that I guess that? Yeah. Wow. Yeah,

[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:25.220]
I watched a few minutes of it. Anybody who walks in the studio can get that. They sit there and talk

[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:33.200]
sports and stuff and there's no commercials, right? No. I only watch them for a couple

[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:37.020]
of minutes. Hey, Tom, I got a question for you. Yeah. You mentioned the Palm Beach station.

[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:43.280]
How is the guy like that support cast on Channel 5 to stay there? I'm not that familiar with the

[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.660]
stuff. I'm still living in Miami. If anyone's got a house in Broward, they'd like to sell. Anyway,

[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:52.260]
but I mean, I'm still living in Miami. We're looking all the time. So I don't see that much

[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:58.440]
upon Beach Teller. Guys, name's Murphy. He's got this Wisconsin accent. And I mean, he doesn't

[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.280]
know he called hockey the ice cube tray. Yeah, doesn't know the names. Well, at least they talk

[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.580]
about hockey. I was watching Channel 6 last night and they do this foolishness where they got

[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:12.080]
their new sports guy and he's posing with the sunset high cheerlead. It isn't, spends about four

[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.180]
minutes still in that and opening night of the hockey season. He doesn't even mention that it happened.

[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.280]
No scores. No nothing. Great. Typical. I got one other question for you, Tom. Well,

[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:23.320]
on all you guys, you guys are mentioning how you wish some stations with like these

[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.960]
series like that one out in Phoenix. I mean, I would talk about some people. Where exactly

[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.920]
do you mean by that? I mean, what can they do differently? I mean, they just play the music,

[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:35.720]
right? Is that it? Yeah, it's kind of like pornography. You know, it's hard to identify, but you

[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:42.600]
know it when you see it. And the stations here, you listen to that cool and Phoenix and the

[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:49.720]
K-AIRs 101 in LA. They just really sound good. Their music playlist is good. Oh, yeah,

[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:54.020]
for example, you can tell like if you're driving in a car for a long time for an hour or something

[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:58.440]
and you punch up a station and you don't have to keep punching the button. When you listen to

[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:03.920]
magic, for example, or waxy, you have to keep punching it out and punching it out. We did well

[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:09.280]
because they played crappy music. But the numbers just came in, sir. So hold on tight.

[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:15.360]
I'll see you later. Bye. You don't know your ask from your elbow. Okay.

[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:22.420]
Okay. Here are the numbers, ladies and gentlemen. Just a minute now. What do you have?

[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.600]
A trumpet's flag. Yeah, probably stuck those in in racked junior over here, didn't they?

[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:34.800]
Who knows? Brodjers got so much stuff here, man. Oh, yeah, he did. See, I know his, the way his sick

[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:39.460]
mind works. Just a moment now. You got some time. All right. Here we go.

[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.140]
Oh, I was right about one thing. Number one, this is Monday through Sunday, 6 a.m. to midnight,

[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:54.060]
12 plus down from a nine, but still number one with an eight three hot 105, but down almost a point,

[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:02.740]
Mr. Dark. You know what I'm saying? Number two. I tried to read. Number two with a down from an

[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:09.080]
eight seven to a seven or four. And this one doesn't even really count. W life. Yeah. Okay.

[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:15.200]
So evidently, some people died over the summertime. Number three.

[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:25.920]
Up from a four seven to a five one, W I O D. Oh, number three. And if you take out a light,

[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.560]
that means we're number two because nobody counts life. Number four, no speak at English,

[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:37.180]
W QBA from a four four up to a five. By the way, let me see. No, okay. This goes all the way back

[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:41.920]
to the summer of 88. So we're going to be a dean coming today. We can compare what our numbers come

[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:49.760]
out. We can compare last summer to the summer. Well, that be a lot of fun. Okay. Number five,

[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:55.740]
from a five down to a four four, I bet Cox won't be calling back power with a four four.

[01:42:56.340 --> 01:43:01.520]
Okay. Now isn't that interesting in the summer? We wouldn't you think that they should hot add it.

[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:05.800]
How would do better, but they didn't. They should because there are more kids here in a lot of the

[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:11.140]
old. And they have all day to listen. Yeah. And we did better. Yeah. That's actually we.

[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.440]
Number six. Oh, wrong one.

[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.940]
Down from a five one to a four one. Didn't I also predict this? That's the one magic. And I said,

[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:30.180]
they did look at that. A full point drop to a four. Oh, he's happy about that. Wow.

[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:35.500]
Followed by WCMQ, which is an Ospigating Glase Spine. Well, I don't even know what that is.

[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:43.340]
Zeta Music Stage MQ. Three nine to a four. Followed by. Oh, it's still there.

[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:51.120]
Down from a four seven to a three eight. Why? 100.

[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:58.300]
Oh, we don't have to fire another program director there. You fire super day. We'll go to happen. Yeah. We did that last break. Didn't we?

[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:07.540]
We're okay, right? I'm getting lost. All right. Oh, my God. Dennis has done it again. He pulled one out of his head. He pulled that rabbit out

[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:18.040]
up from a two five to a three six W. Oh, D. It's right. We're right. We're waiting to lose demographics. Come in a little bit later on from the West Coast.

[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:22.940]
But boy, I'm sure they're going to say we've turned the corner him. They got it now. Oh, wait. Now where?

[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:31.600]
And Bishop's popular. Right? It's the second out. This calls for something very special because they're really doing it.

[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:40.400]
Okay. So a three six. That is. We got to give credit where it's. I mean, that's almost the drive somewhere they had a four eight.

[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:46.640]
And the demos are going to be different. All right.

[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:52.280]
Okay. Well, it's, you don't have to. How long does that go on? I wonder. I think it's an endless list. All right. No.

[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:59.380]
Thought would you relax? Life was down. I was, I gave that if you were paying attention, but as usual, you're busy filling your face.

[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:03.640]
When your blood pressure goes up high enough, it plugs up your ears and you can't hear it.

[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:12.140]
Followed by wacky radio mom B from a three eight to a three five joy state flat with a three four followed by

[01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:19.740]
kissed from a three two to a three three W. I. N. Z. Ladies and gentlemen, from a three two just a minute now.

[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:23.800]
Am I going to be able to find this in time pretty unlikely? Isn't it with all this?

[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:26.700]
Geez. I'll get a turn.

[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:29.920]
We go. We have a cart for every station in the market.

[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:34.020]
Kick and add with 50,000 watts.

[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:40.360]
All over South Florida from the keys to the Palm Beaches. Even out to the Bahamas.

[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.360]
This is W. I. I. Get from a number one with three.

[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:51.080]
I will W. Love. Number two four to a three.

[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:54.920]
Oh, there's all the people that I'm going to be favored. I'm so happy from a.

[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.720]
I don't know who we should talk about this. Better put your seatbelt on.

[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.660]
Wait a minute. Just a minute now. Yeah, exactly.

[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:10.840]
They haven't heard anything about me.

[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:17.300]
Yeah. Or a minute I want to line. Try to get up and you know, I'm here.

[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:18.580]
The light line.

[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:20.640]
Yeah.

[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:24.960]
Oh.

[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:33.480]
We don't have any, uh, rageswaters.

[01:46:34.380 --> 01:46:36.480]
We're not doing we have one of them.

[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:37.500]
I'm going to hide it. Yeah.

[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:38.700]
We do. Do you see them?

[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.960]
Yeah. That was fun. We had a bomb.

[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:46.480]
This is one of the things you could be bigger than those roller skating ranks.

[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:48.800]
We do those first roller skating ranks.

[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:52.000]
All right. Now it's total time.

[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:52.220]
Yeah.

[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.040]
The bomb.

[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:53.640]
We're in.

[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.240]
Down for the three five.

[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.540]
To a two nine.

[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:00.060]
Oh, G. T. R.

[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.180]
Oh, moving right along.

[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.200]
From a two four up to a two nine.

[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.060]
You're right monkey.

[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:09.080]
Did you hear what I just said?

[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:15.040]
She was an up to five to a two nine.

[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.840]
I do ladies and gentlemen.

[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:17.600]
G. T. R.

[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:18.340]
Ooh.

[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:19.660]
First time in history.

[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.840]
Or it's never

[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.360]
have a little bill.

[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.480]
Well, not being a good move.

[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:29.860]
I think they're going to be some really amazing sounds coming from this building.

[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.840]
Waxy FM from a three two out of it.

[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:38.360]
We two eight.

[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:38.900]
You hear that?

[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:39.840]
Waxy with a two eight.

[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:41.280]
That's our lowest number.

[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.140]
W. E. D. R.

[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:45.080]
This is going to shock you from a one four to a two seven.

[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:45.580]
Wow.

[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:46.300]
That's double.

[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:47.240]
And the big jump.

[01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:49.300]
Which goes back up even beyond in the winter.

[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.000]
They had a two five.

[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:52.580]
So they've gotten back a good chunk of that audience.

[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:54.120]
WQB. A FM.

[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.920]
Super cute to a two seven to a two six.

[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:58.060]
Zeta.

[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.600]
It a shocking ladies and gentlemen.

[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:02.820]
Don't tell me they broke it too.

[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:03.360]
Yeah.

[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:04.260]
Oh my god.

[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:06.660]
A one seven to a two five.

[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.400]
Well, one thing got you out of there.

[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:09.320]
Yeah, I got you back.

[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:09.580]
I got you out of there.

[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.660]
Well, it only took a year.

[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:11.780]
That's strange.

[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.000]
One seven to a two five.

[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.340]
Well, last number they had a two four.

[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:16.140]
That's a must.

[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:16.860]
Well, we were there.

[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:18.740]
It is a monster number for them.

[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:20.380]
And maybe if they continue with no commercials,

[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:25.780]
they can continue just the building like a giant WTMI

[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:30.460]
from a two to an intellectual two three WXDJ for a one seven.

[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:36.560]
They stayed flat W EAT WFT from a one four to a one one.

[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:42.620]
WQAM from a grand P WQAM from a point seven to a point eight.

[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.180]
Bill did it.

[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:45.680]
Well, we don't want to know.

[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.180]
No, just come on now.

[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.300]
WKT from nothing to a point eight.

[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.520]
They didn't show in the spring book.

[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.040]
And that's that's about it.

[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:55.940]
So that's the whole day.

[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.460]
That's Monday to Sunday, 6am.

[01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:59.940]
The midnight we'll get the day parts in the demographics shortly.

[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:01.880]
Super sure.

[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:02.420]
I don't know.

[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.680]
Let me just check that out again.

[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:07.680]
Of course, most people can't pick it up on a radio.

[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.380]
Oh, here's somebody with a bone to pick with us.

[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:11.460]
Hello.

[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.000]
Hello.

[01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:12.440]
Yeah.

[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.060]
How are you?

[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:13.600]
I'm from the...

[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:13.900]
Okay.

[01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:15.980]
What's your bones, sir?

[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:17.280]
Well, my bone is this.

[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:20.680]
I went out and I purchased Wolfgang Talks.

[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:21.580]
I love that name.

[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:21.960]
Yeah.

[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.180]
I personally bought these forces when you were too high recommend.

[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:26.880]
Excellent.

[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.360]
Everybody I've talked to loves it.

[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:29.420]
It is good.

[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:30.260]
I'm one hand.

[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:31.460]
But on the other hand.

[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.500]
Well, if you wash that hand fast.

[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:34.940]
Right.

[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:35.880]
Thank you for the...

[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:38.020]
For the business, John, didn't say those are not...

[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:39.160]
Right, so we're sure on time.

[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:39.560]
What do you want?

[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:40.920]
Well, I don't think it's worth 45.

[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.260]
You've got to buy two.

[01:49:42.380 --> 01:49:43.760]
You told me...

[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.400]
Now, two adults need one.

[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:46.300]
No, I did not.

[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.080]
No, I did not.

[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.880]
Some lady called and said that, okay?

[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:49.540]
Excuse me.

[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.060]
I said it's good for one person.

[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.260]
It is good for one person.

[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.320]
Well, so what's wrong with that?

[01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:53.900]
Well, because...

[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:55.720]
You want to eat for 275 a person?

[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:56.940]
No, because for four...

[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:57.800]
Call up FD, sir.

[01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.600]
We don't talk to slippers like you, okay?

[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:01.380]
You can't afford four and a half bucks for lunch.

[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:01.920]
Go to help.

[01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:03.380]
12...

[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:04.280]
Well, isn't that true?

[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:08.220]
He wants lunch and dinner, I guess, for like four and a half bucks.

[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:09.580]
He's...

[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.200]
Yeah, send him one of those as a little burger.

[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:11.700]
Okay.

[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.300]
It'll be in the mail along with a gift from my dogs.

[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.000]
Okay, so we've got the main numbers here.

[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:20.080]
We had a nice increased period of a five-one and W-I-O-D.

[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:23.060]
And we'll start getting the breakout, the day parts,

[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:25.160]
and the nitty gritty of that momentarily.

[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:27.120]
So I told you, didn't I say around 1230?

[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.620]
And you can maybe have a bunch of crap.

[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:29.860]
I did not.

[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:33.280]
I want to apologize now and retract your interpret remarks.

[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.860]
They were not in temperate.

[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.980]
I just really say it was going to be some time,

[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:39.540]
as if indicating when I said 45 minutes lap,

[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:42.240]
I wouldn't count my numbers before they hatch.

[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.380]
Doesn't that about what you said?

[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.560]
Why don't you run that throw-wise, what do you think?

[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:46.940]
Should've been a book.

[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.560]
I wouldn't go near him.

[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:48.800]

[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:49.600]
That is not correct.

[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:52.260]
Yeah, but we must have gone up in this day part,

[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.100]
because Tanner, the only time he called us was that time we had

[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:55.880]
in the...

[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:56.100]
Yeah.

[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:57.140]
What was it, the winner book?

[01:50:57.660 --> 01:50:59.480]
When we got re-askered in June.

[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.700]
In the spring book, when we got screwed, when we had...

[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:01.800]
Yeah.

[01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:05.940]
We were asked in one trend from a 7-6 to a 6-3 in the book.

[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:07.100]
Now, here he comes, wait a minute,

[01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.000]
before we take the break, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:09.760]
This is my cop.

[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.160]
Oh, man, 18 to 34.

[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:13.000]
Men, 18 to 34?

[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:13.620]
No.

[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.380]
Well, this is 6am to midnight.

[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:20.680]
Hot within 11-9 down from a 14-9 down three points.

[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:24.340]
GTR 9-7, key with a 9-1.

[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.180]
Oh, boy.

[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:25.540]
Cool.

[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.600]
With an 8-1, Zeta with a 7-2,

[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.600]
IOD AM with a 6th.

[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.760]
In many 18 to 34, 60, in the midnight.

[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:34.560]
Now, wonder where most of those men were.

[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:35.540]
We're going to have to take part.

[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.840]
Why would 100 with a 5-1, low with a 5-1, etc.

[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.940]
Okay, we're going to take a little break.

[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.920]
And obviously, the numbers are pouring in from the

[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.280]
West Coast and all over America, and we'll be right back.

[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:50.460]
The young de-feet is so far, but I have a feeling it's going to be...

[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:55.200]
The next will be a 25 to 54, I guess.

[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.120]
There's been so much time.

[01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:57.380]
I just got to take some time.

[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.300]
It's been so much shocking, he's already.

[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:00.500]
What?

[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:00.960]
Oh, sure.

[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:02.160]
But you're not listening to me.

[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:03.420]
It's going to take more time.

[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:04.800]
Of course, we still have an hour and a half.

[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:08.160]
But there are more different demographic things coming over

[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.360]
because it's a whole book, so there's a greater breakdown.

[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:12.020]
I told you it was going to take a while.

[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.840]
But obviously, the IOD dreams did very well.

[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:16.100]
We're very excited about that.

[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:17.400]
Now, let's see where we stand.

[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:18.900]
We had a 6th.

[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.020]
This is the entire station.

[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.100]
In many 18 to 34, which is a very young demographic for AM.

[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:25.960]
We were certainly far and away at the number 1 AM station.

[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:29.380]
At demo, number 6 in a whole market with a 6th.

[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.740]
And the next closest competitor, not on the second page,

[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.200]
WMBM had a WAPI.

[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:41.620]
Two WINZ had a .9.

[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:47.600]
WNWS had a .5 in 18 to 34.

[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:48.040]
Wow.

[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.140]
And we had a 6th.

[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:51.360]
That's the entire station.

[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:54.600]
So, trust me when I tell you.

[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.240]
There were audience has to be 90 and above.

[01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:56.580]
Oh.

[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:58.280]
There are audiences post mortem.

[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.400]
Now, I call it the Matlock syndrome.

[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.840]
You know, like, Matlock is a big successful show with big numbers.

[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:07.700]
They're all over like 55.

[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:12.100]
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, this is what they'll make big inroads this afternoon here

[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.520]
because there are audience, they have to remember Alan when he was like,

[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.440]
Oh, absolutely.

[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:17.720]
Yeah.

[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:19.720]
So, where's that going to leave Sandy?

[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:21.460]
That's what you're going to be talking to yourself.

[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:21.820]
You will.

[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:22.720]
Today, yeah.

[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.100]
Wow.

[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.680]
What a shame, Sandy.

[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:27.640]
I can't believe that she hasn't spoken to an over here.

[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:29.820]
It used to be like a chronic regular.

[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:30.420]
Yeah, sure.

[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:31.520]
And oh, yes.

[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:33.220]
What have I been from the station?

[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:36.420]
I'm sure that it's nothing.

[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:37.680]
I shouldn't have known as much.

[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:38.440]
Like, yeah.

[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:39.480]
No, I haven't.

[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:40.720]
Maybe more than a year.

[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.840]
Isn't it ironic that it used to be banned from over here?

[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.400]
Yeah, I've been banned everywhere at one time or other.

[01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:48.320]
In fact, I've been troubled.

[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.760]
And if you're thinking of getting a house to browners,

[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:53.060]
that the Fort Waterdale City Commission

[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:55.760]
may take you up to the topless bars now.

[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:56.980]
That could be next on the agenda.

[01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:57.620]
Well, that's a right.

[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.600]
I'll just use juice in my house then.

[01:53:59.760 --> 01:53:59.940]
Yeah.

[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:00.540]
I won't have an idea.

[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:01.340]
That would be a good idea.

[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:01.760]
Yeah.

[01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:02.480]
Okay.

[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:03.880]
Anyway, we're sitting here waiting.

[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:05.960]
I feel rather foolish because we should,

[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:07.620]
shouldn't we be getting some stuff in?

[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.060]
Or do you?

[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:09.780]
We wouldn't take a while.

[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:10.980]
Yeah.

[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:12.580]
You are.

[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.900]
Well, let's try to get past the paramedics

[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:16.440]
that's treating Bill out there.

[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:18.560]
And wouldn't you know, would you stop picking on him

[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:18.960]
all the while?

[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:19.900]
We'll say they're going to have,

[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.620]
they're going to have to do something.

[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:22.000]
Okay.

[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:24.540]
We want them to do well only so we don't have to listen

[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:25.580]
them bitch all the time.

[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.340]
No problem.

[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:28.920]
They don't have the hype and all the money off of the AM

[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:29.720]
in the future now.

[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.700]
But, uh, boy, that's incredible.

[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.400]
She has tied them down.

[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.340]
I guess we shouldn't be talking about that too much,

[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:35.640]
should we?

[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:36.080]
No.

[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:38.060]
Because I'll probably get a memo from Bill Wise

[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:39.900]
about, uh, if it's almost as bad as eating that.

[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:40.180]
Yeah.

[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.440]
Bad radio.

[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:41.840]
Yeah.

[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:44.100]
But you would never believe that,

[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:44.300]

[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.140]
We're just, uh, two nine.

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:46.880]
Oh, she's making a little bit of a comeback.

[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.140]
A big comeback.

[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:48.860]
Hmm.

[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.880]
And I say, I think love and love is fun.

[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.760]
I was afraid it was a two five.

[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.240]
We're going to stop and think about it.

[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:59.220]
Well, again, once, I mean, that is, I think you're seeing a

[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:02.480]
little bit of the music stations coming back in the summertime.

[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.300]
Well, on, you know, it, it seems like they're just spreading

[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:09.800]
out, but I bet you've added up the entire music audience.

[01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:12.020]
It's probably bigger than it has been.

[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:13.800]
It would seem that way.

[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:14.060]
Really?

[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:15.940]
But then, no, how do you explain how do you explain it?

[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:16.660]
What he's talking about?

[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.080]
I think he's just to be side himself.

[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:20.680]
He doesn't know whether to scream or eat a banana.

[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:23.100]
So many between the Hamburg thing and channel four.

[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.060]
And the amazing developments we've had already here,

[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:27.320]
he just doesn't know what to hell to do.

[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:28.680]
He just, nah, I'm trying to figure it out.

[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.160]
It's just ready to waste that time.

[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:30.680]
I'm running it.

[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.000]
He's been in his fingertips.

[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:32.880]
I'm trying to do that.

[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:33.820]
I'm trying to try it.

[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:35.000]
I'm just going crazy.

[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:36.300]
Yeah, I got to get copies of that.

[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:36.960]
Yeah.

[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:39.420]
Oh, you can, uh, yeah, you can have copies.

[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:39.780]
No problem.

[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:41.600]
Make extra copies for Tom back there.

[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.580]
Okay, he's a good friend.

[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:43.940]
I know you'll take it.

[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:44.400]
No, you got it.

[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:44.900]
Like the team.

[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:45.100]
Sure.

[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:46.420]
Boy, I feel like who?

[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:47.280]
Mike Disney.

[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:47.840]
Really?

[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:49.500]
Yeah, you know, I feel sorry for his sex.

[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.000]
Cheryl, I'm in here one day this week.

[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:52.980]
Cheryl, uh, when the book comes out,

[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:54.340]
she generally facts me.

[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.240]
Those page by page like 80 pages.

[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.700]
And I feel like, and then I go all up.

[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:58.760]
And I miss and watch.

[01:55:59.060 --> 01:55:59.420]
Yeah.

[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:00.720]
Well, that's all right.

[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:01.560]
It keeps her busy.

[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.180]
We like keeping Cheryl busy because she's

[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:04.920]
under a lot tremendous pressure up there.

[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:07.440]
Okay, should we take a collar too while we're waiting

[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:08.400]
for more of these to come in?

[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.140]
I feel embarrassed because they should be here.

[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:10.780]
We go.

[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:12.540]
What page would you get there?

[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:13.660]
One page he's bringing in.

[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.160]
One page.

[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:16.800]
This is 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:17.540]
Monday, to Friday,

[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:18.780]
and 18 to 34.

[01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:24.440]
Don't tell me Debbie,

[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:24.860]
be sure.

[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.000]
This is the moment, ladies and gentlemen,

[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:34.440]
that we've been waiting for.

[01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:36.280]
This is shocking.

[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:39.840]
Are you ready for this?

[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.840]
I'm going to turn that off because I can't stand it.

[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:46.660]
Number one, men, 18 to 34, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:50.280]
within 11, 6 here, W.I.O.D.

[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:55.680]
11, 6, number one in many 18 to 30.

[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.420]
And what did the Dean have last year?

[01:56:57.420 --> 01:56:59.540]
The Dean had a point four last year.

[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:03.400]
Yes, the Dean had a zero point four.

[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:04.720]
He's pretty proud of it too.

[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:05.200]
I know.

[01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:05.460]
I know.

[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.180]
You got 15 times the last year.

[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.420]
You impudent ass.

[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:12.020]
You really have a point four?

[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.200]
My hand, look at it.

[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:13.920]
Look at the sheet.

[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:14.480]
OK.

[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:18.000]
We're number one in many 18 to 34 on an A.M. station.

[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:21.280]
And as God forsaken, geriatric market,

[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:23.900]
it's the most incredible thing in history.

[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:24.860]
30 times for you.

[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:29.220]
And we beat him by over two points, by the way, WGTR.

[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.220]
Huh, shocking.

[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:32.720]
I know.

[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:34.260]
They had a 9.5.

[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:35.820]
A 9.5.

[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:40.700]
W.H.T. with a 9.1 dropping from 11.3.

[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:43.800]
We also beat H.T. in many 18 to 34 in midday, John.

[01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:45.480]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:50.340]
Followed by T with a 7, power with a 8.1, Zeta with a 6.9.

[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:51.980]
I think those numbers are perfect for them.

[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:57.620]
Love with a 6.5 and Y 100 with a 5.

[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:01.660]
We're number one in many 18 to 34 on an A.M.

[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:03.040]
Stinking radio station.

[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:03.800]
How do you like that?

[01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:07.440]
Even though I don't know anything about the business or anything about the market.

[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.900]
What was said that?

[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:09.400]
The Dean.

[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.200]
The Dean said that.

[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:12.220]
And the Dean knows.

[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:15.520]
And Little Dicky Farco probably said that too.

[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:16.480]
Didn't he say that?

[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.780]
He doesn't have any idea why anybody listens, etc.

[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:19.420]
It's something like that.

[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:20.140]
Well, he doesn't listen.

[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.700]
He just knows everything that he does on it.

[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.920]
Well, he just has these psychics.

[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:24.240]
Well, that's why he had the psychic on him.

[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.400]
Right now, he doesn't have to listen.

[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:27.980]
He can just get the drift of it, so to speak.

[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:30.520]
And drift, I think, is the operative expression in his case.

[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.700]
So I think what if we do a cross over what the Dean,

[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:35.320]
we should ask him about those numbers.

[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:37.060]
You can do it, OK?

[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:38.300]
You stay and do it.

[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:40.160]
Do it in all kind of style.

[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:44.140]
From a point four to 11 something is 30 times the audience.

[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:45.600]
30 times?

[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:46.320]
11.6.

[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.760]
So it's 30 times the audience.

[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:51.920]
Hmm.

[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:52.980]

[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:55.660]
Well, you ask him about it.

[01:58:55.820 --> 01:58:56.320]
He grabs it.

[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:59.080]
Yes, you ask the question on me.

[01:58:59.080 --> 01:58:59.940]
You dummy.

[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:05.280]
It's 1244 at WI of the even Johnny Dark has grabbed the microphone now.

[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:08.380]
He's almost expired from overeating here this afternoon.

[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.660]
I just wanted to make an observation.

[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:12.300]
Yes, I think that this is the bird's book.

[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:13.020]
Yeah.

[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:18.900]
Have you remembered that?

[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:21.360]
There's a lot of bird's ashes.

[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:25.580]
I don't think you can discount the Alex Benefactor.

[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:25.980]
Yeah.

[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:27.060]
Exactly.

[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:29.000]
Boy, where's Alex when we need him?

[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:33.560]
And of course, there's two weeks that I was on by myself when we had 15s and 20s.

[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:37.160]
That could have had a little something to do with it too, but we don't know.

[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:40.380]
The bird is obviously a part of this, probably like the point six.

[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:44.680]
Well, that would still be, you know, the Dean that point four.

[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:45.900]
Thank you, Tom.

[01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:49.140]
A very astute observation.

[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.200]
Now we know why he covers radio and C.L.

[01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:52.460]
Yeah.

[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:53.300]
Thank you, Tom.

[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:53.860]
Very much.

[01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:56.600]
Boy, I mean, Bingo.

[01:59:56.600 --> 02:00:00.780]
So he just jumped right there and picked up on that immediately while the rest of us

[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:02.680]
would still be fumbling around with our cigars.

[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:05.080]
So anyway, that's really shocking.

[02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:07.420]
Boy, do you see the look on Boigiery's face when he came in here?

[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:10.560]
The same guy who gave me the memo on its bad radio to be done the year.

[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:15.080]
Now he's beaming and bringing me cigars, which this is a perfect one for Boigiery's

[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:15.720]
depository.

[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:16.380]
Wouldn't that be great?

[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:18.520]
It looks like that in stand measure with C.L.

[02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:19.260]
Yeah.

[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:20.460]
Trust me.

[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.540]
And 11, 6, number one.

[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.120]
We finally, we not only did we BGTR in many 18 to 34,

[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:28.000]
maybe, but we'd beat them by over two points.

[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:28.560]
Mm-hmm.

[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:29.680]
I just mentioned that.

[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:30.980]
Is that the first time in number one?

[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:31.560]
In that demo?

[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:31.700]
Yes.

[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:32.120]
Demo driving.

[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.220]
Yeah, we were number two.

[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.400]
Well, let me put it this way.

[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:36.040]
The Dean was number 27.

[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:38.380]
Tied for 27.

[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.840]
When we came here, we went to number four in that demo.

[02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:43.960]
The number three, number two, and number one.

[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:46.300]
So we've increased one ranking each time.

[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:48.480]
And next book, we're going for number one half.

[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.100]
So that's the Dean, of course, number 27, not a bad number.

[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.600]
If there were 900 stations in the market,

[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:55.780]
that wouldn't be too bad, right?

[02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:57.340]
Oh, how was that number?

[02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:58.120]
Am I on?

[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:00.000]
How was that number compared with your I&C number?

[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.320]
It's very close, isn't it?

[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:02.560]
I don't remember I&C.

[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:04.480]
I have a lobotomy since that time.

[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:06.580]
I'm trying desperately to forget that entire experience.

[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:07.360]
I don't know.

[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:07.960]
I don't know.

[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:08.900]
Many 18 to 34.

[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:10.040]
I don't know.

[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:11.060]
I don't know.

[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:11.560]
Pretty close.

[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:14.480]
I think on Zeta, we had like 15 or something.

[02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:17.060]
Then we 15 or 16 in many 18 to 34, maybe.

[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:17.540]
I'd think so.

[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:18.420]
Well, we can tell.

[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:19.320]
Oh, yeah.

[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:21.320]
Um...

[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.340]
I don't remember.

[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.700]
What the hell is this?

[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:25.580]
You know how you trace the Dean, you know,

[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:27.400]
the numbers midday should trace the Zeta numbers.

[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.880]
Oh, this is in the morning.

[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:30.260]
But these are Gonzer's numbers.

[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.380]
That's why I was a little confused when I looked at Zeta.

[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:33.180]
Gonzer?

[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:34.360]
Three, nine last summer.

[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:36.300]
Now that he's gone, they got a sticks number.

[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:37.580]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.060]
So the Gonzer factor may be helping Zeta, of course,

[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:42.720]
in the fact that they're not running any commercials.

[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:44.400]
It's commercial free and listener free.

[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.620]
That's what they're looking for.

[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:47.540]
And I think they're well underway.

[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:50.560]
So GTR, boy, look at that.

[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:52.040]
Oh, boy.

[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:52.840]
They had black summer.

[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:56.640]
They had a 19.8 in many 18 to 34 in midday.

[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:58.160]
And now it's a nine five.

[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:00.880]
And what can I say?

[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:02.740]
I know there was some other great music in here

[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:03.820]
that I was hoping I would find,

[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:05.660]
but I can't find anything that I want now.

[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.820]
Roger's just...

[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:07.540]
Oh, here it is.

[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.560]
You don't think they would take offense to this, do you?

[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:20.580]
It was those whole tickets.

[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:21.940]
Like that's what did.

[02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:24.140]
That's what helped you turn the quarter, baby.

[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:26.820]
Those whole tickets, what goes around.

[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.280]
Come on, the round.

[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.280]
Oh, yeah.

[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:32.160]
Okay, let's do a little break here.

[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:35.360]
It's 13 to 12 minutes, so one will be right back.

[02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:37.240]
The sports collection.

[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:38.880]
And the number one sports fan.

[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:41.460]
Announce another big free autograph session.

[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.920]
Fan, you can get a free...

[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.960]
Hi, this is Larry King.

[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:51.600]
And they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:52.140]
Yay!

[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.920]
Okay, prof 51 at WID.

[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:57.100]
You're right, they are coming in very slowly today.

[02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:58.800]
I told you, you ignored me.

[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:00.480]
And gave me...

[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:01.740]
Well, you were right, as usual.

[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:04.920]
But so the only thing we have for this state part

[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:06.840]
is that one page, but it's sure good enough for a...

[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:08.380]
Why don't we just stop looking at them right now?

[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:09.760]
Okay, just go home.

[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.860]
Anybody got a match, by the way?

[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:14.000]
I got this great cigar here from Boy Geary,

[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:16.220]
who said it was in Louisville,

[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.980]
where you used to use these as depositories.

[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:21.340]
And he should know too, boy.

[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:23.880]
But here we are, number one, 18 to 34.

[02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:24.720]
Aren't you impressed?

[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:25.480]
I'm impressed.

[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:26.700]
Okay, you can leave now Tom.

[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:28.660]
Okay, I'm going to give my copy.

[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.340]
I've got a good up in the paper and get this written.

[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:31.680]
What?

[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:33.260]
No, you're not leaving now.

[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.620]
I really don't start giving us this below

[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:38.080]
and you're going to stay right here until the dean comes in.

[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:39.780]
Okay, and yeah, when you're talking...

[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:41.420]
Because I'm sure you guys don't really...

[02:03:41.420 --> 02:03:42.880]
You've really riddled it.

[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.440]
Once before, when we had this kind of a crossover,

[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:48.120]
did they have like someone waited outside?

[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:49.420]
Well, we left it.

[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:51.860]
Yeah, that happens with me a lot.

[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:53.920]
When Steve follows you, you know, you're going to have like,

[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.180]
yesterday, couldn't speed come in,

[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.480]
but we both avoided speaking to each other like crazy.

[02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:59.620]
He was waiting for me to speak first

[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:01.740]
and I was hoping he wouldn't and it worked out great.

[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:02.720]
Oh, I spoke to him.

[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:03.060]
Did you?

[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:04.660]
Well, last night.

[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.720]
But no, that doesn't happen.

[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:09.540]
Of course, Ciderman has been out there at times.

[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:10.940]
So there are these people I just...

[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:11.860]
Oh, I don't speak to him.

[02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:13.160]
Try to avoid like the play.

[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:15.740]
Well, is the dean going to have Alice Rubin on today?

[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:17.580]
You could see it in the next few shows since Wednesday.

[02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:19.980]
Well, no, as a matter of fact, Bob Kunst is going to be on.

[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.180]
He's going to be on.

[02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:21.520]
He's going to be on.

[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.080]
Having fundamentalist Howard Kromas,

[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:24.300]
who's a real piece of work.

[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:25.800]
And meanwhile,

[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:27.180]
Ron, this other guy,

[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:28.080]
Ron, thinking of it,

[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:30.480]
did you see, you know, Alice's latest thing

[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:32.280]
with the satellite where he's going to sue the dolphin?

[02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:33.780]
You know what he's going to do with that?

[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:35.900]
He's going to wind up screwing all of us, you know how?

[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:37.460]
Because what's going to happen is

[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:40.260]
the NFL is going to demand that the games be scrambled everywhere.

[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:42.080]
And so everybody who gets to

[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:44.360]
send these bars to think that being smart

[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:48.060]
higher in him to get an order

[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.560]
that the dolphins can't order the game.

[02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:49.800]
Right.

[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:51.060]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:53.300]
They're going to scramble every one of the NFL games

[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:54.980]
and then nobody is going to get anything.

[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.460]
Well, when Mr. Disney brings the numbers in,

[02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:00.720]
then we know that it must be something very meaningful.

[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:03.200]
This is...

[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:03.840]
What is this?

[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.460]
So six to midnight, this is 2554.

[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.480]
Hot went from an 8-8 to an 8-9.

[02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:12.460]
Magic from an 8-4 to a 6-8.

[02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:14.820]
That's almost a point and a half plus drop.

[02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:17.300]
Life from a 4-6 to a 5-2.

[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:21.520]
Followed by Joy, gloves 94-37 to a 4-8.

[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.180]
One, that's a single book.

[02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:24.540]
That's a good book.

[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:24.680]

[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:25.160]
Give it a go, Rich.

[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:26.220]
Now to go back down.

[02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:26.660]

[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:29.220]
CMQFM 5-4 to a 4-6.

[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.220]
W-I-D-4-3 to a 4-2.

[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:34.000]
So we stayed about flat there in 25 to 54s.

[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:36.580]
Zeta from a 2-7 to a 4-1.

[02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:38.900]
Boy, they have a turn in the corner there at Zeta.

[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:39.300]
Finally.

[02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:41.800]
GTR 45 to a 3-8.

[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:43.800]
Pissed forward to a 3-8.

[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.000]
Followed by QBA, Waxi, QBA AM.

[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:50.160]
EDR with the 3-3.

[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:51.700]
Power with the 3-2.

[02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:53.620]
And down it goes.

[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:58.660]
All the way down to QAM from a 0.7 to a 0.6 waves with a 0.6.

[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:00.440]
Where is the WLD on there?

[02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:01.500]
WOLG?

[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.660]
25 to 54, you expect to find them.

[02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:05.820]
They were at 1-2 to a 1.

[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:07.340]
Just behind Radio Marti.

[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:09.380]
Just ahead of W-O-F.

[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:11.960]
And wins, let's see.

[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.980]
Wins from a 1-3 down to a 1-2.

[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:17.600]
So their demographics are pretty ancient.

[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:18.420]
That's okay.

[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:20.520]
With Zeta?

[02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:21.560]
What do you mean by?

[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:21.860]
Five things.

[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:23.940]
What does that mean?

[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:25.640]
Sometimes people say that they got a fluke.

[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:26.280]
Is that what you're saying?

[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:28.160]
Well, but it's good though.

[02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:29.580]
It'll keep them going for another month.

[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:31.340]
You see, that's the way this business works.

[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:32.280]
I don't have to tell you.

[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.060]
But they justify.

[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:34.440]
Boy, we've turned the corner.

[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:36.980]
We've got rid of all those pain in the ass personalities.

[02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:38.680]
We're cranking out the music now.

[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:40.160]
And we're really doing it.

[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.300]
And they are doing it.

[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:42.440]
What?

[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.100]
We can't, well, we can't say it on the internet.

[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:45.200]
We mean nobody.

[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:45.460]

[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:46.700]
Ladies to do in the best.

[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:47.240]
Yeah.

[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:50.200]
We have nobody with a match in this building.

[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:51.620]
No, I don't buy that for a second.

[02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:52.820]
With a lighter, with a match.

[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.660]
With anything for this wonderful cigar.

[02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:57.040]
No, I'm trying to sit here and smoke to celebrate.

[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.260]
They smoke for the environment.

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:58.680]
Yes.

[02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.280]
Well, here's it.

[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:00.600]
That's what Gary Lawrence used to say.

[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:01.440]
Look what happened to him.

[02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:02.420]
Mm-hmm.

[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:04.560]
Yeah, remember he was fanatic about that.

[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:04.860]
Mm-hmm.

[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.620]
Remember the hot one out 25.

[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:09.540]
Hot went up 25 to 54.

[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:10.960]
From what?

[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:12.340]
888-289.

[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:13.400]
Oh, that's cool.

[02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:14.260]
Oh, that's man.

[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:17.320]
You think he had stock emitters.

[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:20.260]
You would think that he's creating his station in Maine

[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.700]
for a piece of hot 105 and a piece of apple pie.

[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:26.240]
And he said he would trade it for either one of those.

[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.160]
Probably preferably the apple pie.

[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:31.040]
Especially if it had to use an ice cream on it.

[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.820]
And maybe a little ketchup from one of those countries.

[02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:34.800]
Well, 55.

[02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:36.020]
Tom Jik is here.

[02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.820]
And I'm hesitant to take any more calls

[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:39.280]
because I know that they're coming rushing in.

[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:39.740]
Look at Lynn.

[02:07:39.880 --> 02:07:41.480]
She looks like she knows what planet she's on.

[02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:43.140]
Oh, she wants food.

[02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:44.340]
Do we have some?

[02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:45.220]
You don't want these here?

[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:45.460]
Do you?

[02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:48.140]
These are kind of like, oh, thank you so much.

[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.460]
Look at KT coming through.

[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:51.560]
And I sure hope they're going to spend some money.

[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:52.740]
Wouldn't that be nice?

[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:54.440]
Please, take all you want.

[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:55.940]
They're here just for you.

[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:00.300]
These are the slowest they've ever come in though, isn't it?

[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:02.880]
It's also like creeping and crawling in here, man.

[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:05.320]
It's just a very slow process.

[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:06.040]
So that's good.

[02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:08.240]
It'll keep some people hanging around for the one to two hour.

[02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:09.680]
The book's still on David's wife.

[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:10.140]
What's that?

[02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:11.680]
What do you talk it off the air?

[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:12.360]
It's a thing.

[02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:13.460]
It's just really is.

[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:14.420]
That's a strange thing.

[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:16.440]
You know, they're always the right two, three, two, four,

[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:18.400]
two, seven, all of a sudden up to four, one.

[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.780]
I mean, yeah, almost one.

[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:21.660]
If the book's just in for all right.

[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:23.740]
Yeah, it'll go back down next time.

[02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:24.280]
Good.

[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:25.900]
It'll, no, it'll balance out.

[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.120]
Trust me.

[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.740]
Yeah, whenever you see a major jump one way or the other,

[02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:35.240]
I'll blow it down and there's no logical reason for it.

[02:08:35.300 --> 02:08:37.560]
You just have to figure that maybe just where the books,

[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:39.120]
you know, they fell in the right, they're right.

[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:39.860]
No, it's correct.

[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.360]
So look at this.

[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:46.200]
A request for a feast from Australia.

[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:47.880]
Next, there's the annulment.

[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:50.440]
Australian rules football people.

[02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:53.580]
The Foster's Cup people are going to bring in a bunch of food.

[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:54.800]
So we've been delighted.

[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:55.860]
This is from Bill Mullin.

[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.580]
We were like, that's like tilegating.

[02:08:57.860 --> 02:08:58.640]
What is tilegating?

[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:01.720]
And they bring in some koala bears and something.

[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.540]
It's going to be great.

[02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:03.560]
That you might go roomy.

[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:04.160]
Yeah.

[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:05.640]
So that'll be next Thursday.

[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:06.160]
That's terrific.

[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:07.380]
I think I have an appointment.

[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:08.780]
No, that'll be a terrific deal.

[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:09.260]
No problem.

[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:13.000]
So we're sitting here kind of stalling for time and killing some time,

[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:16.400]
I guess, because we're just waiting for more good news here, right?

[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:19.220]
More of those good numbers, boys and girls.

[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:24.240]
And I know that, well, where are those morning numbers already?

[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:24.660]
Yeah.

[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:25.800]
See for Uncle Mike.

[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:28.780]
And we want to see a caller had a little increased there

[02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:30.320]
to keep him pacified and calm,

[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:33.520]
so I can feel free to call him later and not get screamed at.

[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:35.080]
We want to see buttles numbers.

[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:36.480]
We want to see old Greg there.

[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:37.640]
We know he had a big comeback,

[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:39.220]
which I know, please, as you know, end.

[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:40.380]
Alice, of course.

[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:41.940]
Alice with those giant, with those,

[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.620]
well, they had to do well, 12 plus.

[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.920]
Again, their demographics are horrendous.

[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:47.120]
They're just like the end of the world.

[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:48.980]
But that's another one.

[02:09:49.140 --> 02:09:51.100]
See, WLD, that'll be another station.

[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:52.120]
That'll say, oh, look at this.

[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.980]
We're turning the corner of the 12 pluses way up.

[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:57.080]
Do you know, end of the graphics are the US-Tide KAT.

[02:09:58.480 --> 02:09:59.860]
That's 25 to 54.

[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:01.120]
Yeah, for the entire week.

[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:02.560]
Yeah, with a what?

[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:03.260]
0.5.

[02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:04.640]
No, one.

[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:05.200]
No, one.

[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:05.360]
No, one.

[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:06.960]
Is this Mike Gun?

[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:08.140]
No, it is not.

[02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:08.880]
They're making a difference.

[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:11.380]
You know, the Wexy meets QAM.

[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:12.920]
Wexy.

[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.880]
That's a religious station.

[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:15.540]
I don't know if you have to.

[02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:17.560]
That doesn't have to offer a gospel religious

[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.360]
with a signal worse than FTL.

[02:10:19.620 --> 02:10:19.760]
Wow.

[02:10:20.420 --> 02:10:21.740]
Look at their end, WS.

[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:25.700]
They go from a 20 to a 1A to a 1FOR to a 1-2 to a 1L.

[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:29.340]
Yeah, I would say it's a pattern, wouldn't you?

[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:30.660]
Yeah.

[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:31.980]
Yeah, I would say it was a different.

[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.380]
But Charlie Meadows will make that difference in the morning.

[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:35.260]
You'll see time.

[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:36.600]
We'll get those morning numbers.

[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:38.260]
Why?

[02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:48.840]
Okay, well listen, that's good about doing it for this hour.

[02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.240]
Apologize the last few minutes of dragged little bit here.

[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:52.640]
They say on the Joy Reynolds show.

[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:55.400]
But, wow, listen, you can't have everything.

[02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:57.620]
The numbers are coming in slowly but surely.

[02:10:57.860 --> 02:10:59.760]
I guess it's kind of like covering the date election.

[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:01.520]
Yeah, you'll then know all of the sudden.

[02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:03.760]
You get that for your weight all night pony kind of.

[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:05.660]
You get that great back in the before you add computers

[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:06.920]
when you actually use to get votes.

[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.420]
Yeah, no, I like that.

[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:09.100]
That was fun.

[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:10.680]
And the presidential elections void

[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:12.520]
step their B-actual numbers on there.

[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:14.140]
Now they come on, they got a check mark.

[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:15.180]
Okay, it's all over.

[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:15.960]
This one, one here.

[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:16.620]
And this one, one there.

[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:17.640]
Go home, it's all over.

[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:18.440]
No fun anymore.

[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:20.140]
They really have taken the fun out of it.

[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:20.320]
Yeah.

[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.400]
And it's a lot harder to fix this way too.

[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:22.920]
Sure.

[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:25.080]
Anyway, that's going to do it for this hour.

[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:26.660]
We got Chuck Meyer standing by.

[02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:27.240]
Chuck, of course,

[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:29.120]
and part of the great WIOD family

[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.580]
that had this powerful five one in the summer book.

[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:33.420]
And we're delighted to have him here

[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:34.360]
because he's an honest,

[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:36.520]
a goodness human being and eats a great meal too.

[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.480]
And we'll be back with the one at two hour.

[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:39.760]
And then, of course, the Dean.

[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:41.140]
The Dean.

[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.360]
Probably on his way.

[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:44.060]
Probably on his way right now.

[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.560]
And he's the Dean and the limousine

[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.600]
on his way to the studio right now

[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:49.200]
to fill in for Steve this afternoon.

[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:50.320]

[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:50.320]

[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:59.240]
I'm going to be here.

[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:00.320]
I'm going to be here.

[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:00.840]
I'm going to be here.

[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.760]
Oh, I forgot it's the big one to two hour.

[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:03.780]
I guess we can live without that.

[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:05.360]
Now, although we do have,

[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.200]
well, we have some reaction,

[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:08.120]
though, from the people at GTR to the book.

[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:11.640]
But we just want to play a little piece of it on the ear.

[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.100]
One of the six WIOD Tom Jik is here.

[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:17.380]
Now, of course, Tom immediately is going to come.

[02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:18.560]
And this is like the analysis

[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:21.420]
of staff to the elections or after the incident.

[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:22.240]
Instant analysis.

[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:23.340]
Martin Agransky.

[02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:25.400]
Bolli, you've got teeth.

[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:28.120]
The way you're not just going out in the glass.

[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:28.480]

[02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:30.460]
Speaking of that,

[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:32.800]
I think we ought to mention he'll be following on his.

[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:34.120]
He is.

[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:34.120]

[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:37.640]
Boy, Alan, I hope you're listening right now.

[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:40.240]
Remember, Alan, you and I just go back a long time.

[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:42.620]
I've taken two-year jobs now, but it's not my fault.

[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:43.980]
But it's Jika.

[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:46.280]
The one is really just unmerciful here.

[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:47.520]
Just a vicious attack.

[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.240]
I can't believe it.

[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:50.520]
I'm thinking on a guy with that age.

[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:52.960]
I'm just expecting him to be here.

[02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:54.080]
It's like taking on grandpa.

[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:56.080]
He's the Dean.

[02:12:57.740 --> 02:12:59.360]
None of it all done out of love.

[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:02.080]
I believe I could get up and just walk on in here now.

[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:02.900]
And he would do the...

[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:04.160]
He just turned him loose, man.

[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:05.000]
Do the whole thing.

[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:06.960]
Yes, Damey.

[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:09.480]
None of us would be here if it wasn't for the Dean.

[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:10.320]
That's for sure.

[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:11.680]
That's right.

[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:14.840]
He's got like the Arconi of Talk Radio, don't you understand?

[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.000]
It's what Steve said.

[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:17.160]
Steve said yesterday.

[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:19.520]
I heard he would have the Arconi was doing it.

[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:20.980]
I'm not happy. I've got to show it to you.

[02:13:21.020 --> 02:13:21.620]
All right, just a second.

[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:26.500]
We got 25 to 54s now, 6 to 10 AM.

[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:31.880]
And Hot had a 960, they went up a point.

[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:35.660]
They've been going up and up and up and 25 to 54s.

[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.880]
They ought to just be making millions of dollars and retire

[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:38.980]
and close the thing down.

[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:42.900]
Magic went from a 7-9 down to a 5-8.

[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:45.880]
Good enough for a second, but for that's a big drop.

[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:47.900]
25 to 54s.

[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:49.980]
QBA of 5 AM.

[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.200]
CMQ FM of 4-6.

[02:13:52.520 --> 02:13:53.520]
No speak at a English.

[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:56.960]
We can see that assimilation really shows up.

[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.640]
Joy with a 4-6.

[02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:00.400]
That's up a point.

[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:01.680]
Life with a 4-5.

[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:03.040]
That's up a tensive point.

[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:06.120]
Radio Mambe from a 5-2 to a 4-4.

[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:07.520]
Waxy with a 4-3.

[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:12.380]
Kissed Zeta in the morning, 25 to 54 from a 2-4-1.

[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:14.980]
And I bet you the Colonel is going to call him and say,

[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:17.200]
see, I told you so, but it's too late.

[02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:21.380]
Because most of that, the crew was there during most of this.

[02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:24.340]
Now it's like they went from a 17th to 10th.

[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:25.960]
Love from a 3-4 to a 3-8.

[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:29.580]
Adamoy Greg is Greg in town or is he off again?

[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:31.520]
You know when it comes out, he generally lays low.

[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:34.240]
GTR from a 5-2 to a 3-8.

[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:40.240]
Y100 from a 5-2 to a 3-6.

[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:42.480]
IOD 5-2 to a 3-5 in the morning.

[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:44.100]
Mike, what can I say?

[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:46.200]
EDR182 a 3-3.

[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:47.560]
It happens to the best of us, Mike.

[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:49.520]
A power from a 2-9 to a 3.

[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:51.960]
She from a 1-9 to a 2-2.

[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.920]
And the winds from a 2-0 to a 1-6 in the morning, 25 to 54.

[02:14:57.420 --> 02:14:59.860]
1-6, I think that's the lowest in their history.

[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:01.680]
W.S. News from a .9.

[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:03.280]
Alice brought that way up to a 1.

[02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.980]
See the Charlie Metta's face.

[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:09.000]
See the last of Charlie Metta's?

[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:10.380]
He brought those young people in.

[02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:11.920]
They like hearing people on helium.

[02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:12.700]
Come on in.

[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:13.540]
What is it?

[02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:14.480]
This guy.

[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:16.200]
Yeah, come on in.

[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:17.580]
Our condolences to you.

[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:18.740]
It's got to get better now.

[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:19.960]
Has to be better.

[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:20.860]
Or he looks like he's...

[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:22.120]
You beat us, man.

[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:22.760]
19 to 30.

[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:24.600]
Oh, not even dressed by two points.

[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:25.160]
We know that.

[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:26.020]
We have to get back to that.

[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:28.840]
That's right.

[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:29.760]
We got a great combo.

[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:30.300]
Okay.

[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:31.340]
Absolutely.

[02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:33.380]
We're going to have those pimple spots on here.

[02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:34.400]
Those acne spots.

[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:36.700]
Those pepoons still doing acne statin.

[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:37.640]
We can get him on here.

[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:39.160]
What is that that he's saying?

[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:40.860]
It's a 25 to 54 morning.

[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:41.960]
Mornings.

[02:15:42.140 --> 02:15:42.680]
You already had...

[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:43.500]
Oh, I just have that here.

[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:44.800]
Is that all that is?

[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:45.920]
What else but that one there?

[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:48.460]
Oh, I'll get...

[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:49.280]
Okay, let me see that.

[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:50.160]
Can I see that?

[02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:53.020]
Because you're handing it to a man who hasn't got any idea what any of it means.

[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.000]
Well, it'll get better, Bill.

[02:15:55.020 --> 02:15:55.680]
It'll be great.

[02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:56.080]
Look at that.

[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:58.420]
Even Joey just stopped by to congratulate us.

[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:00.800]
10 to 3.

[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:01.200]
10 to 3.

[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:01.480]
Here we go.

[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:02.280]
3 to 7.

[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:04.220]
Okay, you ready?

[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:05.640]
This is 25 to 54.

[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:06.900]
Hot from a 9 to a 9, 1.

[02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:07.600]
Flat, right?

[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.500]
Wouldn't you call it flat?

[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:08.980]
I would.

[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:10.380]
He would get hysterical.

[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:11.980]
Magic 8 to 7 to 3.

[02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:12.920]
Followed by life.

[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:13.360]
Love.

[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:15.020]
3, 4 to a 5, 3.

[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:16.060]
How do you like that, Irene?

[02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:17.780]
Stick it to him, Irene.

[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:18.940]
Joy.

[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:20.820]
GTR 5, 2 to a 4, 2.

[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:23.320]
And he afternoons Zeta from a 2, 7 to a 4, 1.

[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:27.860]
I have a feeling that those diaries at Zeta just fell in the right places.

[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:29.920]
KISS 4, 2 to a 3, 9.

[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:31.640]
Waxy 5, 0 to a 3, 8.

[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:36.680]
CMQ FM, IOD 3, 9 to a 3, 7, 25 to 54 in the afternoon.

[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:38.540]
Well, what did we do?

[02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:41.460]
We went from a 6, 4 to a 6, 9, and 25 to 54.

[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:44.660]
Power 4, 1 to a 3, 5.

[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:51.600]
How about our, let's see, Y146 to a 3, 1, feet to 8, flat, same number.

[02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:56.040]
WNWS, now here's where they're really doing a 3 to 7, 25 to 54.

[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:59.920]
Now that's Sandy's on the afternoon with those sugar cookies, a 1, 9 to a 1, 2.

[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:00.400]
Ah.

[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:02.920]
Oh, huh?

[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:04.120]
Picture.

[02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:06.280]
Wins from a 1 to a 1.

[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:08.300]
Consistency is their by-word, okay?

[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:11.560]
And the motivation station even cracked it with a 0.6.

[02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:12.280]
Good, Lauren.

[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:15.200]
I sure wish we'd get the 12 plus numbers for the day parts.

[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.720]
That would be real nice if we ever got that.

[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:18.960]
Wouldn't that talk to you, V?

[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:21.760]
How come we're getting 25 to 54 day parts first?

[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:24.420]
Is there some special reason for that?

[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:27.940]
Wouldn't you think we would get the 12 plus day part numbers somewhere sometime?

[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:29.500]
It must be holding them on for last.

[02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:31.540]
Anyway, we have a break to do here.

[02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:34.840]
It's 12 minutes after one, Tom is busy analyzing all of these numbers.

[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:37.980]
And of course, waiting for his third best friend in the world to show up.

[02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:38.840]
The day.

[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:39.260]

[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:43.460]
I bet you.

[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:45.340]
Now, have you ever spoken with him?

[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:46.720]
Have you ever had any dealings with him?

[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:52.060]
No, I haven't had the pleasure.

[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:56.560]
Although I suspect it will happen.

[02:17:56.760 --> 02:17:57.100]
Maybe.

[02:17:57.380 --> 02:18:00.160]
I think people have made the topic of the first half hour today.

[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:03.040]
Anyway, when the urge for seafood.

[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:05.320]
No, this Johnny Dark was on with a bad guy.

[02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:07.780]
It's 1 to 4 to 8 at WIOD.

[02:18:07.980 --> 02:18:10.100]
Tom Jicke was our guest for the first three hours.

[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:14.500]
But now he's hyperventilating on cheeseburgers and he's just making Dean-like sounds.

[02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:19.660]
I think I was fairly on target here.

[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:22.860]
I said that Hobbit would probably go down a little bit, which in some demos they did.

[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:23.860]
12 plus they went down.

[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:25.960]
I said magic would take a hit, which they did.

[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:28.960]
I said we would do pretty well, which looks like we did.

[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:32.600]
And what made you think of our third three?

[02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:35.680]
I just think their music is deteriorated badly.

[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.160]
When you keep hearing Bobby Vinten records on there.

[02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:41.600]
At one time, they really had fine tune.

[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:42.800]
They're not on the market though.

[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:45.620]
Well, yeah, no, they're dying on the vine.

[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:48.900]
But they've lost a lot of it because they keep screwing around with the music.

[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:51.560]
And all they got to do is drive up to Orlando and listen to Cool.

[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:56.720]
And they get a good idea on what happened to the program director, relatively new within the last one.

[02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:59.080]
I sure hope he's not the guy that's putting on the Bobby Vinten record.

[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.900]
And is that Bill Stedman?

[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:02.920]
Well, he's a perforator.

[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:06.780]
Well, if he'd stopped making phone calls to Waxie and paid attention to business, that might help.

[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:07.360]
Look at that.

[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:09.800]
There was a little onion on there that Lee would never put up with that.

[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:11.320]
I don't understand that either.

[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:13.440]
It was crazy that he called Waxie.

[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:14.680]
Well, it was it for real, you mean?

[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:17.180]
Yeah, I just know what happened to be a put on.

[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:18.680]
Yeah, he would never do that.

[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:20.520]
Unless he's going to work over there.

[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:22.880]
And of course, we don't want to leave it out.

[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:24.420]
Yeah, we have to.

[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:26.040]
We talked about what's going to happen to Waxie.

[02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:27.080]
They're being bought.

[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.480]
We keep hearing things.

[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:29.400]
They're building bonds.

[02:19:29.880 --> 02:19:30.040]
They're being bought.

[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:31.480]
Yeah, it has.

[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:33.260]
Well, the Y-rollers people still working there.

[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:34.860]
They were all supposed to be gone a month ago.

[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:39.080]
Well, no, the company that brought them has a history of not changing things that are working.

[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.120]
And you believe that?

[02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:42.100]
Well, you think that that's going to be...

[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:43.400]
Well, it's not the company that...

[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:44.040]
Wait, it's a big name.

[02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:46.380]
The Lee's think is what by Ricky and New Kelly, isn't it?

[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:47.160]
I don't know.

[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:48.060]
I don't know for me.

[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:48.300]
I don't know for me.

[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:52.660]
But anyway, it's not like it's not one of these companies that wants to know Steve's numbers.

[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:54.640]
Well, first of all, the only number we've got.

[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:56.920]
I don't know why we can't get those 12-plus numbers.

[02:19:57.440 --> 02:20:02.440]
All I can tell you is 25 to 54, Steve went from a 3-7...

[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:04.980]
I'm sorry, from a 3-9 to a 3-7.

[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:08.340]
And now that's yours, or an hour that sports talk, right?

[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:08.680]

[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:14.520]
And W's news had a 1.2 down from a 1.9 and W's had a 1.

[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:18.360]
So even though he dropped to a 2-10, he dropped to 7-10.

[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.180]
And now that I have it at his home, he's channel 10 news.

[02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:23.980]
Yeah, now I think that is unconscionable.

[02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:27.700]
The fact that there's cymbal casting channel 10 news hours a day.

[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:28.180]
It's ridiculous.

[02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:29.080]
It's just ridiculous.

[02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:31.060]
It's not just ridiculous, but it's unconscionable.

[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:33.200]
Major market radio station, big signal.

[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:36.680]
And they're taken 2 hours out of 24, that's a 12.

[02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:38.420]
That's 8% of their broadcast day.

[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:42.760]
And all they're doing is slapping on a television station and claiming that 2 hours.

[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:43.780]
They're not paying for it.

[02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:44.400]
It's outrageous.

[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:44.800]
Yeah.

[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:48.120]
It's just an affunt to our sensibilities in the industry.

[02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:49.380]
What are we starting to do with it?

[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:51.180]
The 7's right next to here.

[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:52.640]
Can you imagine how cheap that was?

[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:53.680]
Just try to 10 can, of course.

[02:20:53.740 --> 02:20:53.940]
Yeah.

[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:54.820]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:55.580]
I can't believe it.

[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:56.480]
It's a 10 line.

[02:20:57.020 --> 02:20:58.820]
Which is how I tell you, well, these sound larts.

[02:20:58.820 --> 02:20:59.120]
Look at that.

[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:01.200]
They've already got the same change.

[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:01.300]

[02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:02.020]
It's a crime check.

[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:03.440]
A channel WOLD.

[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:05.540]
Have you heard how they degenerated again technically?

[02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:06.320]
How bad they sound?

[02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:07.140]
The WOLD.

[02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:08.920]
I don't think they had to have it off.

[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:10.420]
Well, they had cleaned it up for a while there.

[02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:12.720]
And now they've got that real muddiness back in their signal.

[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:14.400]
I don't know what they're thinking about.

[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:15.260]
Can't they hear that?

[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:16.920]
I mean, don't they understand it?

[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:18.240]
I don't get it.

[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:20.160]
So we're still waiting for the 12 plus.

[02:21:20.260 --> 02:21:22.180]
And I would beg anybody back there.

[02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:23.580]
What the hell is going on?

[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:24.240]
Told you.

[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:26.080]
Why don't we get the 12 plus numbers?

[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:27.100]
I mean, those are the ones.

[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:28.260]
Those are the meat and potatoes.

[02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:30.320]
I mean, granted, we like these younger demographics.

[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:31.960]
It's great because that's what it's all about.

[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:32.900]
That's where the money is.

[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:35.620]
Well, here's 7 to midnight 25 to 54.

[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:38.080]
Hot with a 12-9.

[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:38.740]
And what up again?

[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:39.900]
I'm glad Johnny's out of the room.

[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:41.880]
Imagine it to stay flat with the 6-3.

[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:44.380]
EDR went way up to a 5-5.

[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:47.100]
To be a wife.

[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:48.580]
12-9.

[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:50.700]
Waxy from a 4-8 to a 4-0.

[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:52.340]
Love 3-5 to a 3-9.

[02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:52.600]
What?

[02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:55.460]
The Dean-1.

[02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:55.600]

[02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:55.960]
Did he hear?

[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:57.340]
The Dean is intangible.

[02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:58.200]
He's a building like no James.

[02:21:59.060 --> 02:21:59.420]
Woohoo!

[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:01.700]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

[02:22:02.020 --> 02:22:02.380]
Yee!

[02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:04.100]
Ha!

[02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:05.800]
Oh, this is hard.

[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:06.620]
3-8 at night.

[02:22:07.180 --> 02:22:08.340]
This is 25 to 54.

[02:22:08.380 --> 02:22:09.800]
This is all, look at that.

[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:11.720]
W-1, a D from a 1-9 to a 2-8.

[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:14.600]
We were really doing it until we put Dinky Farcollon.

[02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:17.740]
But these are 25 to 54 are mean.

[02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:19.920]
It was, for example, way till you find Wichner on here.

[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:21.540]
Man, that's got to be an almost...look at that.

[02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:22.160]
Go the way.

[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:23.100]
He had a big increase.

[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:24.280]
He's 0.8 to a 1-1.

[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:25.320]
And it is on the last page.

[02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:27.380]
Tied with radio as swavvy and BCG.

[02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:29.000]
Woohoo!

[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:32.300]
He's got those young demographics, ladies and gentlemen, all tied up.

[02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:35.640]
And if you ever unties them, maybe they can get to the radio and turn it on.

[02:22:36.260 --> 02:22:37.580]
No, can't you...would you...

[02:22:37.580 --> 02:22:40.560]
Can somebody go back there, find what the 12-plus day-parts are?

[02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.220]
I mean, why it's 120 already.

[02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:42.820]
All day-parts.

[02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:43.860]
And we still don't have that.

[02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:45.760]
And we don't have any of the day-parts, 12-plus.

[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:46.760]
That's...yeah.

[02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:47.860]
No!

[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:48.660]
Monday, yeah.

[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:50.360]
Monday for Friday, day-parts.

[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:51.140]
Not Monday through Sunday.

[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:52.000]
There is no such thing.

[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:52.900]
Monday through Friday.

[02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:53.660]
No!

[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:56.160]
The man knows nothing.

[02:22:56.620 --> 02:22:57.960]
I'm just...the man is frightening.

[02:22:59.420 --> 02:23:02.300]
I don't...I want Monday through Friday, day-parts.

[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:03.900]
Monday through Sunday is only...

[02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:05.780]
Nothing about the business.

[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:08.020]
I'm serious.

[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:11.040]
This man really believes, you know, something he owns a statement with me.

[02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:12.300]
Yeah, what's the thing with hide?

[02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:13.840]
I mean, the guys got a...

[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:15.200]
It's hard for a hot man.

[02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:17.020]
There must be some chick that works over there now.

[02:23:17.420 --> 02:23:18.080]
Oh, yeah.

[02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.500]
I always love those kinds of things.

[02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:20.920]
Should we put this mobile collar on?

[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:21.180]
Hello.

[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:22.560]
I think you ought to put me on.

[02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:23.000]
Okay.

[02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:24.860]
Put me on for...

[02:23:24.860 --> 02:23:25.600]
There's Heaven to you.

[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:26.580]
What's your story, sir?

[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:27.500]
Well, I'll tell you.

[02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:29.460]
It's annoying to be listening to that...

[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:29.820]
You're right.

[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.220]
You know, listening to that W-I-O-D-R-E-S-G-D-W-O-L-D.

[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:36.020]
And have them, uh, spinal casting the news.

[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:38.220]
And they're telling you, and here's the film,

[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:39.900]
you're thinking, what in the hell?

[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:41.540]
You know, when tell these people, this is radio?

[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:44.540]
Yeah, and I like when they show the weather map is my favorite.

[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:45.760]
I'm so...

[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:46.600]
Too bad they don't have one.

[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:46.900]
I will.

[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:47.900]
Let's go to the scene.

[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:48.400]

[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:50.260]
Who's holding my knife on this idea?

[02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:51.580]
I don't understand this.

[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:52.120]
It's incredible.

[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:52.660]
Listen to me.

[02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:53.120]
I've got to say...

[02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:54.680]
Front to our sensibility here.

[02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:55.280]
I've got to...

[02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:56.660]
I've got a PSA for you.

[02:23:56.780 --> 02:23:58.540]
This is definitely a traffic update.

[02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:00.280]
I'm on the June road.

[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:02.740]
I'm actually at where the June meets a bird road

[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:03.540]
at Crowgable's High.

[02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:04.880]
You could never be there.

[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:06.640]
I'd say those are the little girls on the lawn.

[02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:07.120]
It's incredible.

[02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:10.480]
I'm sitting here, and there's this red chupette

[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:14.340]
that's coming south on the June doing about four miles an hour

[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:15.580]
through the traffic intersection.

[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:18.560]
And there's this red sign on...

[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:20.720]
This white sign is red lettering on top of the car.

[02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:22.280]
I swear to God it says,

[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.480]
West Indian driving school.

[02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:28.900]
And I'm thinking, who in the world is going to let this guy teach them to drive?

[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:29.640]
What Indians?

[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:30.260]
You want the...

[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:32.140]
You assert you want an answer to the question?

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:32.460]
Who?

[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:33.840]
Can he drive?

[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:36.160]
That's not...

[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:36.500]
I need...

[02:24:36.500 --> 02:24:37.540]
I got to ask you something else.

[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:40.500]
I'm not sure I don't want to be repetitious.

[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:42.780]
If someone else is already mentioned to you, just let me know.

[02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:44.880]
Or you're just like full of it, aren't you?

[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:46.920]
I really have floating with that music.

[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:49.140]
I had a radio act in the morning.

[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:50.420]
And while I'm...

[02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:52.780]
I like lifting the mic, but when he starts playing those records,

[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:53.720]
I got to hit the dial.

[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:55.780]
Yeah, let's get that music off in the morning.

[02:24:56.060 --> 02:24:56.180]
I'll stop.

[02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:57.040]
I agree with you.

[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:59.880]
He tells in the audience that it's your record.

[02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:00.940]
It's definitely...

[02:25:00.940 --> 02:25:01.860]
No, it's not my record.

[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:02.680]
I mean, I know your tape.

[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:05.080]
Boy Gary, it's Boy Gary put all that music on you.

[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:05.480]
I...

[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:07.780]
Anyway, I slipped over to Alice, and...

[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:09.180]
Well, he needs you.

[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:10.780]
Well, that geek over there that's...

[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:12.660]
His sidekick is absolutely incredible.

[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:12.960]
Yeah.

[02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:15.580]
And anyway, I'm not sure if anyone heard this or not,

[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:18.980]
but he was reading an article about a lady who's been married the most time...

[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:21.080]
The thing of the lady in the country, she was married 21 times.

[02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:26.520]
And she quoted her as saying she was looking for the right man,

[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:29.100]
and he struggled and said, join the club.

[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:30.100]
Oh!

[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:31.960]
I almost fell.

[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:32.340]
The club?

[02:25:32.380 --> 02:25:33.120]
You must have said that?

[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:33.560]
Yes.

[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:34.700]
Oh, Alice?

[02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:36.460]
Oh, I don't believe that.

[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:37.100]
Yeah, I do.

[02:25:37.620 --> 02:25:38.640]
I wish I had a picture.

[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:40.560]
And he usually sticks a little toe here in the area.

[02:25:40.820 --> 02:25:42.140]
Who said, join the club?

[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:42.520]
Yeah.

[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:45.400]
Well, anyway, I'm out of material.

[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:48.120]
Well, let me tell you, you certainly covered all the bases here.

[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:48.700]
I think so.

[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:49.580]
Just like the Cubs.

[02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:51.300]
Well, I fell and looked at an ankle out of the club.

[02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:51.620]
Okay.

[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:53.120]
Watch out for those West Indians.

[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:53.700]
See ya.

[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:54.120]
Thank you.

[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:54.840]
Thank you.

[02:25:55.940 --> 02:25:57.400]
You think of the job?

[02:25:58.880 --> 02:25:59.280]
Okay.

[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:00.260]
I'll say.

[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:02.080]
Haven't played that in a long time.

[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:03.640]
You want to be a fiscal word now?

[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:03.900]
Yes.

[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:06.040]
The printer is out of ink.

[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:13.840]
Now only that's a copying machine that broke because the truck is making me a copy.

[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:14.380]
That's right.

[02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:15.620]
This is big time radio.

[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:17.220]
The printer is out of it.

[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:18.580]
You would think they would think about that.

[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:19.320]
And they don't have it.

[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:20.140]
That's right.

[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:21.640]
What do you mean that's right?

[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:23.180]
This is going out for it.

[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:24.900]
They don't have any.

[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:31.620]
Tell me like the doll is lining up for the kickoff.

[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:32.380]
Send the insomang.

[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:33.260]
Anyone bring a ball?

[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:34.300]
Jesus!

[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:35.940]
Someone got it with the bloody good stuff.

[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:37.740]
Excellent analysis, Tom.

[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:39.420]
Stingerly.

[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:42.940]
If there's anybody at any other station in town where they got some ink who's got some

[02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:44.660]
numbers 12 plus bill.

[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:47.500]
Bill Tanner, give us a call, Bill.

[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:48.720]
We need you.

[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:49.380]
You believe this?

[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:50.640]
I can't believe it.

[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:52.160]
You would think it would.

[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:57.780]
Wouldn't you think since they knew that today was the big day that they'd have some ink laying around?

[02:26:58.740 --> 02:26:59.900]
See what we're talking about.

[02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:04.820]
Or maybe they could like use blood in there instead.

[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:07.420]
I'm sure that Bill is probably splitting in one wrist already.

[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:12.340]
He could probably give a couple of quarts and we could do the rest of the numbers in red.

[02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:13.340]

[02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:14.900]
That's...

[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:16.220]
It's 123 now.

[02:27:16.580 --> 02:27:20.100]
Are you telling me that by the time we go off the year we will not have the 12 plus numbers?

[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:21.520]
And sound good now.

[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:25.720]
They could get them on the phone instead of the computer.

[02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:26.680]
They could get them on the phone.

[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:28.000]
I mean, this is bogus.

[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:28.760]
This is unacceptable.

[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:32.260]
I mean, these are interesting, you know, marginally.

[02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:34.300]
But there's a lot of stuff there.

[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:35.300]
We want to find out.

[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:36.960]
What are they doing back there?

[02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:38.220]
Just think of a show you'll have a month.

[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:38.900]
No, seriously.

[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.040]
What are they doing back?

[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:40.920]
Are they running around?

[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:42.640]
They just know.

[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:43.500]
What?

[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:45.980]
No, I'm asking a serious question.

[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:46.980]
What are they doing?

[02:27:46.980 --> 02:27:49.920]
They're just sitting there looking at the empty screen?

[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:51.580]
They sent somebody out to get more ink.

[02:27:55.980 --> 02:27:58.180]
I feel like I'm just serving glen.

[02:27:58.180 --> 02:27:59.380]
I'm just thinking of something else.

[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.380]
Well, what else can you say?

[02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.320]
They sent somebody out to get more ink.

[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:06.020]
Who do they send, Nick?

[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:08.840]
Loading.

[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:10.340]
Loading, yeah.

[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:11.600]
Wow.

[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:15.600]
I know who they should send.

[02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:16.740]
Yeah.

[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:17.740]
Oh, kidding.

[02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:20.360]
Oh, this is just so typical, you know.

[02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:22.380]
And I think we're going to do pretty well in here.

[02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:22.760]
I don't know.

[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:23.380]
I could be wrong.

[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:25.020]
And I guess we'll never find out.

[02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:26.720]
I have to wait all weekend.

[02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:30.100]
Well, it's nice we at least got the 18 to 34 men page.

[02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:30.360]
Isn't it?

[02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:31.420]
We got just the one page.

[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:33.100]
We don't want to go overboard in that demographic.

[02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:34.320]
But we are number one there.

[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:35.960]
So that's nice to say.

[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:37.860]
Anyway, if you want to lose a ton of weight.

[02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:38.220]
I know.

[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:40.000]
Leave for nicolones under a lot of pressure.

[02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:42.840]
It's very offended by Tom's intempered behavior.

[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:45.920]
It's 28 past one at WI of the end.

[02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:49.260]
And Tom just gave us a report from the sales duper room back there

[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:52.560]
where they're working feverishly to get those numbers for us.

[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:53.660]
They didn't go out and buy ink.

[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:55.860]
They brought a whole new machine in there.

[02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:56.940]
So they did.

[02:28:57.460 --> 02:28:58.380]
And is it doing anything?

[02:28:58.780 --> 02:28:59.380]
They're hooking it up.

[02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:00.480]
They're hooking it up.

[02:29:00.940 --> 02:29:01.720]
It was by far.

[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:03.300]
I'm sure they put this with some mystery up.

[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:04.060]
What are they called?

[02:29:04.260 --> 02:29:04.820]
What are they called?

[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:06.420]
Those machine life support systems?

[02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:08.980]
Are you sure they're not just going to get up to the FM transmitters?

[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:09.800]
That would have been wise.

[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:10.200]

[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:12.240]
No, that's what that be.

[02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:14.720]
Are there a lot like long tubes hanging from it?

[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:16.560]
You've got about four people.

[02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:17.400]
They're hanging around.

[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:18.060]
They're all moving.

[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:19.620]
And we guys underneath it.

[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:20.660]
One guy's behind it.

[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:22.720]
Yeah.

[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:25.120]
Anyway, what an exciting day.

[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:25.920]
I predicted this.

[02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:26.200]
Didn't I?

[02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:28.880]
That today would be chaotic and exciting and record breaking.

[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:31.520]
That this would be a day that would live in the anals of infamy.

[02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:34.340]
And I think this ought to make the best of by next week.

[02:29:34.540 --> 02:29:35.540]
Oh, I would think so, yeah.

[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:38.960]
And I predicted it would take a while to get the book, if you recall,

[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:40.560]
a Debbie Ellis Fire Report.

[02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:41.500]
Hello.

[02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:43.100]
Are you gone?

[02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:44.380]
Well, that would be.

[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:46.040]
Well, they probably couldn't fit onto the phone.

[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:46.760]
That's a problem.

[02:29:47.380 --> 02:29:49.160]
It was too big of a call for us to handle.

[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:51.200]
So we're sitting here with this stuff here.

[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:54.540]
I think John ought to go back there and keep close eye.

[02:29:55.060 --> 02:29:56.800]
So that somebody runs up here.

[02:29:56.940 --> 02:30:00.000]
I'm not trying to push anybody around, but I'd like to get that 12 plus on you.

[02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:01.180]
We only got a half an hour.

[02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:02.620]
Do you think we're going to get it?

[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:04.360]
Yeah, I've got to get a call and written.

[02:30:04.660 --> 02:30:05.580]
No, you're not knowing it.

[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:08.800]
Bill, the bean comes at least close to that time.

[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:10.460]
I don't think he's coming in here until we get out.

[02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:13.060]
But I do have a lot of stuff to schlep out of here.

[02:30:13.140 --> 02:30:14.440]
So I may have to make a couple of trips.

[02:30:14.940 --> 02:30:15.100]
Hmm.

[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:16.100]
Right?

[02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:16.740]
Hmm.

[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:20.640]
So when you come back in here to get more stuff, will there be an open mic?

[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:22.140]
Anywhere you?

[02:30:22.460 --> 02:30:23.440]
No, there won't.

[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:24.660]
There's not an open mic.

[02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:26.860]
The D1 is going to sit with any of this.

[02:30:27.060 --> 02:30:27.840]
He won't have any of this.

[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:29.540]
No, I won't.

[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:31.680]
Should we take a call or two here while we're waiting to kill?

[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:35.460]
I feel like the last 45 minutes that's all we've been doing is basically killing that.

[02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:36.060]
That's true.

[02:30:36.440 --> 02:30:39.240]
No, maybe we'll put this a best of on.

[02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:40.640]
One day when there's a 1 o'clock car.

[02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:43.500]
Already taking shots at everybody in a market that there is to.

[02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:46.420]
And of course, I'm sure they must have the morning numbers.

[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:51.820]
I wish I get that morning QAM number 12 plus just so call it will be, you know, the product.

[02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:54.680]
He probably just make a more paranoid.

[02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:56.560]
I know he's probably got it already.

[02:30:56.760 --> 02:30:59.660]
I'm sure that their machine didn't run out of ink at QAM.

[02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:00.640]
No, they probably get it.

[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.940]
I know if they made cappin, they don't let that people see this.

[02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:03.960]
Yes, they do.

[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:06.700]
They're telling you a Crocomal Archaeocate.

[02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:07.640]
They call it a little.

[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:08.140]
They call it a little.

[02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:08.740]
They call it a little.

[02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:10.380]
Well, they don't let it see the number.

[02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:10.760]
I don't know.

[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.360]
You got some of the here we've gone.

[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:14.200]
Just relax.

[02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:15.160]
6 p.m.

[02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:16.020]
What do we got?

[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:16.900]
We got everything in here?

[02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:17.620]
No, it's mornings.

[02:31:19.220 --> 02:31:19.820]
It's coming out.

[02:31:21.550 --> 02:31:22.350]
Okay, great.

[02:31:23.170 --> 02:31:24.150]
Well, look at this.

[02:31:24.310 --> 02:31:26.810]
There's nothing wrong with that from a .6 to a .8 car.

[02:31:27.810 --> 02:31:28.450]
33%?

[02:31:28.750 --> 02:31:28.930]
Yeah.

[02:31:29.430 --> 02:31:30.790]
I'm not sure nothing wrong with that.

[02:31:30.970 --> 02:31:31.670]
No, not at all.

[02:31:32.090 --> 02:31:34.250]
In fact, it was down when he got here to a .1.

[02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:35.610]
So he's up to a .8.

[02:31:35.730 --> 02:31:36.790]
There's nothing wrong with that.

[02:31:36.930 --> 02:31:37.990]
He's the only thing they've got over there.

[02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.430]
Exactly.

[02:31:39.210 --> 02:31:39.630]
Yeah, probably.

[02:31:39.850 --> 02:31:40.670]
All right, let's go.

[02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:42.450]
What the hell have we got?

[02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.950]
Oh, this is mornings.

[02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:44.610]
Yeah.

[02:31:44.670 --> 02:31:45.990]
How did Uncle Mikey do here?

[02:31:46.090 --> 02:31:46.770]
Where the hell is he?

[02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:48.570]
Probably not.

[02:31:48.570 --> 02:31:49.550]
Oh, he's on the first page.

[02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.930]
I'm going to go.

[02:31:49.930 --> 02:31:49.930]

[02:31:49.930 --> 02:31:49.930]

[02:31:49.930 --> 02:31:49.930]

[02:31:49.930 --> 02:31:51.050]
Oh, boy, I'm panicked.

[02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.970]
There, I panicked.

[02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:53.770]
Okay, hothead and 8-1.

[02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:55.050]
Three tenths of a point drop.

[02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:56.710]
QBA is 6-9.

[02:31:56.830 --> 02:31:57.850]
It's a big increase AM.

[02:31:58.070 --> 02:32:00.050]
So that the simulation factor is definitely worth it.

[02:32:00.530 --> 02:32:01.890]
Life stayed flat with a .6-9.

[02:32:02.050 --> 02:32:02.730]
Time for a second.

[02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:05.050]
In that interesting, QBA AM in life.

[02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:07.910]
Those two, they're like two thorns in the side of the entire industry.

[02:32:08.010 --> 02:32:08.670]
They're always in there.

[02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:10.130]
They mean nothing to anybody else.

[02:32:10.290 --> 02:32:11.170]
Well, I suspect, yeah.

[02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:13.090]
And I think there's the same factor of work in both.

[02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:16.370]
Well, life is just there because it's on in all offices.

[02:32:16.750 --> 02:32:19.170]
And I think QBA is, it is an ethnic loyalty factor

[02:32:19.170 --> 02:32:21.930]
with people who might not be listening to it,

[02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:24.850]
put down that they are listening to it because they feel that it's there.

[02:32:24.850 --> 02:32:25.690]
Yeah, it was their voting.

[02:32:26.650 --> 02:32:29.090]
Well, just the radio mom B was fourth also, by the way,

[02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:30.550]
with a 5-8 down from a 6-3.

[02:32:30.750 --> 02:32:33.090]
So second and fourth in the book are,

[02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:35.170]
no speaking English and sixth also.

[02:32:35.710 --> 02:32:38.570]
Fifth WIOD in the morning, Mike from a 5-9 to a 5-2.

[02:32:38.770 --> 02:32:42.070]
So he got a third among English language studies writer.

[02:32:42.570 --> 02:32:43.990]
And you know, he got a fluke drop.

[02:32:44.270 --> 02:32:45.010]
He'll go back up.

[02:32:45.130 --> 02:32:46.550]
He always, he's always right around the sticks.

[02:32:47.130 --> 02:32:49.310]
CMQ FM from a 3-5 up to a 4-2.

[02:32:49.530 --> 02:32:51.610]
So there's no question that the people are blending right in

[02:32:51.610 --> 02:32:53.570]
that this Spanish radio thing is just a fact.

[02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:57.010]
Why 100 from a 5 down to a 3-8 in the morning?

[02:32:57.470 --> 02:32:57.870]
What?

[02:32:58.690 --> 02:32:58.690]

[02:32:58.910 --> 02:33:00.310]
See what happens when you're far as super cute.

[02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:01.030]
Yeah.

[02:33:01.870 --> 02:33:03.730]
See what happens when Johnny Dark Coss,

[02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:05.650]
super Davis job and why 100?

[02:33:05.850 --> 02:33:07.350]
I think they're going to be calling you at home.

[02:33:07.470 --> 02:33:08.690]
Not to offer you a job either.

[02:33:09.130 --> 02:33:12.110]
I'm magic from a 4-9 to a 3-6 in the morning.

[02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:13.430]
Yeah.

[02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:15.630]
That's a very sweet floor work.

[02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:17.310]
Yeah.

[02:33:18.810 --> 02:33:20.350]
Burk before but not to Dean.

[02:33:20.430 --> 02:33:21.090]
That's a different birth.

[02:33:21.630 --> 02:33:23.410]
A kiss from a 3-1 to a 3-6.

[02:33:23.610 --> 02:33:25.310]
Power 3-5 to a 3-4.

[02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:28.850]
Wins from a 4-4 to a 3-1.

[02:33:29.010 --> 02:33:31.010]
That's the lowest 12 plus number in the morning

[02:33:31.010 --> 02:33:33.010]
that I can ever remember on WIENSA.

[02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:33.830]
I didn't understand it.

[02:33:34.210 --> 02:33:35.050]
And abomination.

[02:33:35.730 --> 02:33:36.830]
Yeah, well didn't snooze.

[02:33:36.890 --> 02:33:37.530]
It's not that.

[02:33:37.630 --> 02:33:38.750]
To our sensibilities.

[02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:40.210]
Well, actually they should go.

[02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:41.670]
I haven't got this news yet.

[02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:44.770]
But snooze isn't really doing the news like they used to anymore.

[02:33:44.770 --> 02:33:49.770]
GTR Hermannemid Queen from a 3-6 to a 3-1 in the morning.

[02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:51.570]
12 plus.

[02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:54.870]
WS dues from a 2-3 to a 3.

[02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:58.130]
So the Alice didn't have that increase but again all over the age of 100.

[02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:00.090]
As the demo was pointed out,

[02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:01.470]
Wax D3 to a 2-9.

[02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:05.150]
Zeta from my 1-2 in the morning to a 2-5.

[02:34:05.490 --> 02:34:05.810]
Ah!

[02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:06.710]
Oh!

[02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:07.630]
Huh?

[02:34:08.410 --> 02:34:08.890]
Shocking.

[02:34:09.650 --> 02:34:10.770]
They got it right where they wanted it.

[02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:14.170]
ADR from a 1-3 to a 2-4.

[02:34:14.690 --> 02:34:16.370]
Love from a 2-4 flat.

[02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:18.130]
Q1-7 to a 2-0.

[02:34:18.770 --> 02:34:20.650]
QBA 2-3 to a 1-9.

[02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:22.710]
Who else are we interested?

[02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:25.050]
F-T-L-18 to a 1-5 in the morning.

[02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:25.770]
12 plus.

[02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:27.710]
WS-DJ.

[02:34:28.650 --> 02:34:29.550]
Just about off the air.

[02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:30.990]
K-E-T with a 1-3.

[02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:33.190]
One-3 to a 3.

[02:34:33.610 --> 02:34:34.610]
Yeah, for these right here.

[02:34:35.090 --> 02:34:35.810]
They were 1-3.

[02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:38.630]
So that's the mornings 12 plus.

[02:34:38.750 --> 02:34:39.270]
Now we're waiting.

[02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:40.290]
Next should be.

[02:34:40.490 --> 02:34:40.890]
It might be.

[02:34:41.090 --> 02:34:41.530]
It could be.

[02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:43.630]
And it will be as soon as it comes in here the midday.

[02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:44.430]
And we'll get afternoons.

[02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:45.570]
We'll get it all straightened out.

[02:34:45.690 --> 02:34:46.390]
Nice to see you.

[02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:47.690]
If you're all nice doing business with you,

[02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:49.510]
are they comatose on the FM?

[02:34:49.730 --> 02:34:51.050]
Are they having I know?

[02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:52.690]
It's just one book, right?

[02:34:53.410 --> 02:34:54.370]
Yeah, She knows, boys.

[02:34:54.530 --> 02:34:55.570]
She's seen him come and go.

[02:34:55.650 --> 02:34:59.190]
She's seen the panic and the hysteria and the blood dripping

[02:34:59.190 --> 02:35:00.650]
from the wrists and all that other stuff.

[02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:02.370]
Like, it's just one rating book, isn't it?

[02:35:02.370 --> 02:35:03.470]
Yeah, I mean, you don't have to.

[02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:04.770]
We can party tonight.

[02:35:05.090 --> 02:35:05.550]
Oh, yeah.

[02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:06.570]
You know, it's funny.

[02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:07.290]
You should mention that.

[02:35:07.290 --> 02:35:09.770]
But remember, it guy handed over at the Carroll City,

[02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:11.410]
even when the book was bad.

[02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:12.710]
These dev ratings party.

[02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:13.870]
Yeah, the book is that.

[02:35:14.170 --> 02:35:16.510]
And they'd go into toilet, you know, on both states.

[02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:17.930]
They were having a ratings party.

[02:35:18.170 --> 02:35:18.890]
I guess that's true.

[02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:19.950]
I don't understand that.

[02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:22.090]
But what do I know about them, huh?

[02:35:22.830 --> 02:35:24.510]
So anyway, we did.

[02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:28.570]
So the station went up to a five one that's overall.

[02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:31.190]
And Mike, what is that six?

[02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:34.210]
I think we can do a six.

[02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:36.550]
Well, on the floor now they've picked out articles here.

[02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:37.830]
I think our okay and the doll.

[02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:38.130]
Yeah.

[02:35:38.810 --> 02:35:41.850]
Dicky Farco can really put it over the edge.

[02:35:41.970 --> 02:35:42.350]
Don't you think?

[02:35:42.510 --> 02:35:46.310]
Well, yeah, when Monday night is proctologist.

[02:35:46.310 --> 02:35:47.850]
So they behind all our problems.

[02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:52.590]
You are really cool.

[02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:56.870]
I think it would be great for you to be a guest in that show tonight.

[02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:58.550]
That would be, but you better do it soon.

[02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:02.090]
Like in the next month, I think, just to be sure.

[02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:05.270]
Now, you could be on Joy Reynolds Show and Dicky Farco

[02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:06.390]
in the same day, brother.

[02:36:06.530 --> 02:36:07.490]
Real same time.

[02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:09.890]
Okay, it's 135 at WIID.

[02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:11.670]
I think we'll take this little break here.

[02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:12.990]
We'll do it on time for a change.

[02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:14.550]
So Mike doesn't have to get hysterical.

[02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:18.010]
And then when we come back by that time, it's just a real good day.

[02:36:18.310 --> 02:36:20.370]
We might be right out of ink again.

[02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.730]
Yeah.

[02:36:21.450 --> 02:36:23.630]
We'll see if the durable got his way out.

[02:36:24.010 --> 02:36:24.810]
We'll be right back.

[02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:28.530]
Okay, 138 at WIID and exhausting.

[02:36:28.770 --> 02:36:31.010]
Here, let me tell you one more time about Toyota of Hollywood.

[02:36:31.010 --> 02:36:32.590]
We give you those incredible prices.

[02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:33.510]
We tell you about the new.

[02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:36.390]
We won before the hour and we're sitting here waiting desperately.

[02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:39.110]
This is kind of like it is like covering the data elections.

[02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:42.630]
The data elections are usually fast.

[02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:43.210]
The pony hair.

[02:36:43.450 --> 02:36:46.570]
Upset stomach and we're just getting a little bit of the time.

[02:36:46.570 --> 02:36:47.430]
We got the 12 plus.

[02:36:47.550 --> 02:36:48.810]
Now we need midday and afternoon.

[02:36:48.810 --> 02:36:49.790]
We need both of those.

[02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:51.310]
We've only got 20 minutes to do it.

[02:36:51.370 --> 02:36:52.470]
Are we taking up an office pool?

[02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:53.350]
I think so.

[02:36:53.550 --> 02:36:54.390]
Now, you're getting nervous?

[02:36:55.350 --> 02:36:55.590]
No.

[02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.070]

[02:36:56.350 --> 02:36:57.470]
I need to do an hour to the job.

[02:36:57.870 --> 02:36:59.510]
Johnny Dark is back there on the job.

[02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:02.730]
Anything is a guarantee that it'll get screwed up there.

[02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:04.770]
They have food back there.

[02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:07.630]
Well, he asked me if we wanted day parts Monday through Sunday.

[02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:09.990]
He doesn't seem to understand.

[02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:13.710]
Monday through Sunday is like the overall station number that he goes to the weekends.

[02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:17.550]
When you start getting into day parts, it's Monday through Friday and the weekend is a separate number.

[02:37:17.710 --> 02:37:19.910]
I mean, any any chmero was that.

[02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:24.650]
You know what also what's strange is why Avatron breaks those into 10 to 3 and 3 to 7.

[02:37:24.850 --> 02:37:26.330]
Which is about every roll of the station.

[02:37:26.470 --> 02:37:27.970]
You know, does 10, who does a 5 hour?

[02:37:28.050 --> 02:37:28.810]
You know why they do that?

[02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:32.290]
Because 3 to 7 is considered afternoon drive.

[02:37:32.290 --> 02:37:35.370]
Now, see, in this market, it's hard to relate to it.

[02:37:35.430 --> 02:37:40.190]
But like in New York and Chicago and LA, drive time is all the way to 7 o'clock.

[02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.670]

[02:37:41.210 --> 02:37:45.710]
In this market, really, it should be your right to the 6th and 6th to 10 in the morning.

[02:37:45.850 --> 02:37:50.210]
And to believe me that 2 to 3 hour, I don't want to say this, especially with Steve Avatron or wherever he is,

[02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:52.170]
2 to 3 hour kills us.

[02:37:52.350 --> 02:37:53.250]
I mean, just absolutely.

[02:37:53.470 --> 02:37:56.450]
Well, the only until the alley's come out.

[02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:58.530]
Well, even so, but we still have to live with that number.

[02:37:58.710 --> 02:38:00.110]
I mean, 10 to 3 is our number.

[02:38:01.310 --> 02:38:02.550]
Just like that first hour.

[02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:03.310]
Yeah, but it's the airport.

[02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:04.490]
That's still here.

[02:38:05.170 --> 02:38:06.070]
Well, no, that's true.

[02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:07.230]
There's no question about that.

[02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:09.250]
Well, I'm trying to be controversial.

[02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:10.990]
You know, we're trying to be like Dickie Farcle.

[02:38:11.470 --> 02:38:12.710]
Okay, we're still waiting.

[02:38:13.050 --> 02:38:13.050]

[02:38:14.590 --> 02:38:15.930]
Well, I can't do that.

[02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:19.050]
It's the end of the week and I'm just trying to conserve for the ball games this weekend.

[02:38:19.050 --> 02:38:20.730]
Okay, I'm trying to be nice and calm.

[02:38:20.890 --> 02:38:25.130]
Tomorrow I'm going to be at Pompano Park watching the game and plunging at the same time.

[02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:26.390]
So that ought to be really important.

[02:38:26.390 --> 02:38:27.790]
I'll be running the same thing.

[02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:29.130]
I didn't drug run into my name.

[02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:29.570]
Run into my drug.

[02:38:29.570 --> 02:38:30.570]
Yeah, Pompano, yeah.

[02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:31.310]
What is it?

[02:38:31.430 --> 02:38:32.190]
Name's Castle Mike.

[02:38:32.310 --> 02:38:33.290]
He's in the fourth race.

[02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:33.730]
No, he's in the fourth race.

[02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:34.430]
No, he's in the fourth race.

[02:38:34.530 --> 02:38:34.910]
You know what?

[02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.950]
I'll tell you.

[02:38:36.330 --> 02:38:37.210]
You talked about it before.

[02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:39.450]
There's another one that I own.

[02:38:39.550 --> 02:38:40.810]
This is the first time I've ever owned drugs.

[02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:41.530]
It's all one litter.

[02:38:41.970 --> 02:38:43.490]
And I have one named Coster Critic.

[02:38:43.890 --> 02:38:44.670]
It's named for me.

[02:38:45.430 --> 02:38:47.790]
And it'll be running in Fragler next month.

[02:38:47.930 --> 02:38:50.250]
If you want to give next dog, you need to name it the Dean.

[02:38:51.170 --> 02:38:51.530]
30.

[02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:53.410]
That's a great test.

[02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:55.770]
He could run till he's real old too, I bet.

[02:38:55.970 --> 02:38:56.130]
Yes.

[02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:57.170]
How about Mr. Dean?

[02:38:57.450 --> 02:38:57.970]
Very low number.

[02:38:57.970 --> 02:38:58.570]
I'm sorry.

[02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:02.390]
Very low number.

[02:39:04.610 --> 02:39:05.810]
The number's players.

[02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:07.110]
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

[02:39:07.130 --> 02:39:07.770]
You're right.

[02:39:08.610 --> 02:39:09.570]
Okay, 142.

[02:39:09.690 --> 02:39:10.030]
We're still.

[02:39:10.090 --> 02:39:13.330]
I can't believe the last hour and a half of this show, they're sitting here killing time.

[02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.810]
This is the slowest trickle.

[02:39:15.350 --> 02:39:19.730]
But Johnny Dark Ladies and Gentlemen has got a whole pile of stuff.

[02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:20.950]
I want whatever you got.

[02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:24.390]
Okay, just don't, no, no, I want 12 plus.

[02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:28.790]
12 plus, I mean, two Friday, six, six, four.

[02:39:28.990 --> 02:39:30.130]
Okay, look at this.

[02:39:30.390 --> 02:39:32.030]
Look at the way this is pointed out.

[02:39:32.370 --> 02:39:33.550]
Look at the way this is pointed out.

[02:39:34.170 --> 02:39:36.410]
Yeah, it's first of all, it's printing double size.

[02:39:36.810 --> 02:39:38.330]
Six a.m. to midnight, 12 ply.

[02:39:38.350 --> 02:39:40.170]
I have a current figures that are printed first.

[02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:40.690]
Okay.

[02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:42.350]
Oh, this is a mess.

[02:39:42.650 --> 02:39:42.790]
What?

[02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:44.710]
It's a mess.

[02:39:45.730 --> 02:39:47.450]
We already got this anyway.

[02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:48.650]
What the, we don't want this.

[02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:49.450]
This is useless.

[02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:51.290]
We've already got this.

[02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:52.690]
You're going to get this plus six to midnight, right?

[02:39:52.690 --> 02:39:53.430]
No, we don't.

[02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:54.930]
That's the first thing we got.

[02:39:55.390 --> 02:39:56.390]
We had a 5-1, right?

[02:39:56.530 --> 02:39:57.190]
Let's see what it's in.

[02:39:57.330 --> 02:39:57.830]
Come to ID.

[02:39:58.810 --> 02:39:59.510]
What is this?

[02:40:00.730 --> 02:40:03.030]
No, it's the first number printed out as a current number.

[02:40:03.350 --> 02:40:03.430]
Okay.

[02:40:03.930 --> 02:40:05.430]
5-1, that's what I just said.

[02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:06.730]
We already got this.

[02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:08.230]
I'll take that one with me then.

[02:40:08.690 --> 02:40:11.130]
Oh, yeah, but you're going to go nuts trying to read this.

[02:40:11.570 --> 02:40:12.210]
Let me give me the good one.

[02:40:13.090 --> 02:40:14.010]
Give me the good one.

[02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.810]
I'm going to get a compliment.

[02:40:15.010 --> 02:40:16.590]
All right, just relax now.

[02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:18.270]
What you want to leave is know what you're trying to say.

[02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:19.230]
Oh, here you go.

[02:40:19.330 --> 02:40:21.690]
There's, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

[02:40:21.690 --> 02:40:22.750]
I think a bit very slowly.

[02:40:22.990 --> 02:40:24.130]
Oh, man, slowly.

[02:40:24.310 --> 02:40:24.950]
It's the word for it.

[02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:27.330]
And here's men and women 25 to 54.

[02:40:27.490 --> 02:40:29.310]
But what about the 12 plus, John?

[02:40:29.770 --> 02:40:30.930]
We got 16 minutes.

[02:40:32.490 --> 02:40:34.670]
Boy, okay, 25 to 54.

[02:40:34.830 --> 02:40:36.470]
What do we got in men here at the afternoon?

[02:40:36.850 --> 02:40:37.670]
Okay, W.I.D.

[02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:38.330]
We're number one.

[02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:39.690]
Is this my fault too?

[02:40:39.970 --> 02:40:40.330]
No.

[02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:42.070]
I'm just trying to motivate you.

[02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:42.890]
You're our only hope.

[02:40:43.970 --> 02:40:45.050]
We got a 12-1.

[02:40:45.170 --> 02:40:46.970]
We're number one in men 25 to 54.

[02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.990]
How okay is that all right?

[02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.430]
Midday.

[02:40:49.170 --> 02:40:51.410]
What is the mic doing in men 25 to 54?

[02:40:51.410 --> 02:40:53.210]
I'm worried about a 480s number five.

[02:40:54.090 --> 02:40:59.810]
And Steve in men 25 to 54 has Steve Steve.

[02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:01.730]
A 6-5.

[02:41:01.890 --> 02:41:03.970]
Number three went up from a 5-9 to a 6-5.

[02:41:04.470 --> 02:41:07.830]
So it's in women, I guess, that we had a little problem there.

[02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:09.990]
Let's take a look now.

[02:41:10.410 --> 02:41:12.390]
25 to 54 women in the morning.

[02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:15.790]
Renery is 50.

[02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:18.270]
That's from a 3-5 to a 2-4.

[02:41:19.290 --> 02:41:22.530]
And we are like nowhere's, man.

[02:41:22.690 --> 02:41:24.950]
We have got in women 25 to 54.

[02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:26.550]
We're not even on the second stage.

[02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:32.130]
2.2 down from a 2-4 or 16th in women 25 to 54.

[02:41:32.290 --> 02:41:34.090]
See, I told you there are no women listening to this show.

[02:41:34.330 --> 02:41:35.250]
What are they listening to?

[02:41:35.810 --> 02:41:36.590]
God only knows.

[02:41:36.730 --> 02:41:37.710]
What are they listening to?

[02:41:37.890 --> 02:41:39.090]
Joy, 9-9.

[02:41:39.210 --> 02:41:44.350]
Hot, love, magic, life, red to kiss.

[02:41:44.730 --> 02:41:45.710]
So that gave you a real good idea?

[02:41:46.110 --> 02:41:46.490]
Nothing.

[02:41:46.490 --> 02:41:51.470]
And in the afternoon, Steve women 25 to 54 also is like desperate.

[02:41:51.650 --> 02:41:52.010]
A 1.

[02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:53.310]
A 1.

[02:41:53.470 --> 02:41:55.870]
So those ladies are kind of like slipping away.

[02:41:56.050 --> 02:41:56.630]
And you know something?

[02:41:57.150 --> 02:41:57.330]
Tough.

[02:41:58.330 --> 02:41:58.570]
Right?

[02:41:59.450 --> 02:41:59.910]
The break.

[02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:01.470]
Just a woman just a hard woman.

[02:42:01.650 --> 02:42:02.550]
I have to get in tattoos.

[02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.310]
Yeah.

[02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:07.770]
Well, no, the bottom line is it's tough getting a, especially a younger woman.

[02:42:08.070 --> 02:42:08.070]

[02:42:08.650 --> 02:42:09.610]
They don't listen to talk shows.

[02:42:09.770 --> 02:42:12.350]
The men is the important thing and we're just knocking them dead.

[02:42:12.850 --> 02:42:14.990]
Isn't that the way we're supposed to rationalize it?

[02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:15.810]
Huh?

[02:42:16.290 --> 02:42:16.450]
Oh.

[02:42:17.010 --> 02:42:17.690]
We are.

[02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:18.810]
That's what it's all about.

[02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:21.050]
That's where the dollars are, my friend.

[02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:21.550]
Get that right.

[02:42:22.570 --> 02:42:24.410]
Now I'm still 145.

[02:42:24.410 --> 02:42:25.170]
We're still waiting.

[02:42:25.290 --> 02:42:26.750]
The audience must be on pins and e.

[02:42:26.770 --> 02:42:29.130]
They must be ready to blow their brains out at this point.

[02:42:29.470 --> 02:42:30.630]
Because I know I sure am.

[02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:31.970]
This is ponderous man.

[02:42:32.290 --> 02:42:32.730]
Ponderous.

[02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:34.010]
As Casey would say.

[02:42:34.470 --> 02:42:35.990]
It is leap in ponderous.

[02:42:36.970 --> 02:42:37.690]
It is a drug.

[02:42:38.050 --> 02:42:39.690]
Well, I did give you that, right?

[02:42:39.930 --> 02:42:40.050]
Yeah.

[02:42:41.250 --> 02:42:42.030]
Look at this.

[02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:43.430]
Look at the way that's printed out, man.

[02:42:43.430 --> 02:42:45.450]
You have to be papi.

[02:42:46.470 --> 02:42:47.730]
Just to read this.

[02:42:47.850 --> 02:42:51.130]
With glasses, four inches thick, I just can't believe it.

[02:42:51.270 --> 02:42:52.230]
Look at the twirling.

[02:42:52.410 --> 02:42:55.030]
Well, I guess that will be something to nail on the wall or something.

[02:42:55.490 --> 02:42:56.910]
We got the morning 12 plus.

[02:42:58.110 --> 02:43:00.170]
Now we're just waiting and waiting and waiting.

[02:43:00.350 --> 02:43:02.350]
The only other thing we got, we got Renere's number.

[02:43:03.270 --> 02:43:06.590]
We got Caulder's number form, which he went up to a point 80s on his way.

[02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:09.870]
A woman that listens is on one.

[02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:11.090]
Who would think so?

[02:43:11.090 --> 02:43:12.970]
A woman that listens.

[02:43:13.490 --> 02:43:14.370]
What does that mean?

[02:43:15.190 --> 02:43:15.590]
Hello?

[02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.350]
Hello.

[02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.950]
Hi.

[02:43:17.330 --> 02:43:17.730]
Hello.

[02:43:18.070 --> 02:43:18.570]
You listen?

[02:43:18.930 --> 02:43:19.850]
Yes, I do, everything.

[02:43:20.490 --> 02:43:21.270]
Well, thank goodness.

[02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:25.450]
Is that it?

[02:43:25.810 --> 02:43:26.250]
Well, that's it.

[02:43:26.350 --> 02:43:26.930]
She only listens.

[02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:28.190]
Is that why you called it?

[02:43:28.190 --> 02:43:28.630]
No, that's why.

[02:43:28.810 --> 02:43:28.930]
No.

[02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:30.130]
No, it's the women who listen.

[02:43:30.310 --> 02:43:31.050]
But they wanted me to.

[02:43:31.270 --> 02:43:32.390]
Well, they don't admit it.

[02:43:32.530 --> 02:43:32.610]
No.

[02:43:32.970 --> 02:43:35.310]
Why is it like some kind of a disease or something?

[02:43:36.130 --> 02:43:36.770]
No, not really.

[02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:38.510]
So we have a lot of closet ladies.

[02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:39.650]
I guess so.

[02:43:39.650 --> 02:43:40.110]
Yeah.

[02:43:40.370 --> 02:43:40.770]
Okay.

[02:43:40.850 --> 02:43:41.890]
Well, I think you've got a good point.

[02:43:41.890 --> 02:43:43.750]
We're going to have to try to open that closet, right?

[02:43:44.330 --> 02:43:44.870]
Try it.

[02:43:45.090 --> 02:43:45.390]
Okay.

[02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:46.670]
Thank you.

[02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:47.110]
You're welcome.

[02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:47.470]
Bye.

[02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:48.310]
Well, she was here.

[02:43:48.530 --> 02:43:48.930]
She was a little...

[02:43:48.930 --> 02:43:49.710]
Well, well, yeah, very...

[02:43:49.710 --> 02:43:51.650]
She didn't want her voice to be recognized.

[02:43:52.130 --> 02:43:55.810]
And I guess in the female crowd out there, it's a closet kind of a thing.

[02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:57.470]
An old bag.

[02:43:58.530 --> 02:43:59.210]
What is this?

[02:43:59.370 --> 02:44:01.630]
An old bag that wants...

[02:44:01.630 --> 02:44:02.790]
I'm getting a message here.

[02:44:06.210 --> 02:44:07.010]
Caulder's number.

[02:44:08.410 --> 02:44:08.810]
Numbers.

[02:44:08.810 --> 02:44:10.390]
I already made a call of his number.

[02:44:10.610 --> 02:44:12.490]
He went up from a point six to a point eight.

[02:44:12.750 --> 02:44:15.090]
And on QAM, that's a massive morning number.

[02:44:15.350 --> 02:44:15.490]
Okay.

[02:44:15.570 --> 02:44:16.190]
I mean, that's good.

[02:44:16.250 --> 02:44:17.430]
He's only been there a short time.

[02:44:18.190 --> 02:44:19.590]
And he's getting close to a one.

[02:44:19.770 --> 02:44:20.690]
And they've got nothing to promote.

[02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:22.090]
And the best promotion is down here.

[02:44:22.250 --> 02:44:23.010]
Oh, trust me.

[02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:25.210]
There's been no ad rate promotion.

[02:44:25.730 --> 02:44:27.370]
The only promotion he's got to be on this show.

[02:44:27.490 --> 02:44:27.490]

[02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:30.610]
We've given him a more on-year promotion here than they have on the year over there.

[02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:32.230]
Which is, there's a lot about them, right?

[02:44:32.610 --> 02:44:32.910]
I guess.

[02:44:33.170 --> 02:44:33.790]
I mean, you wonder.

[02:44:34.470 --> 02:44:35.670]
How do you get known?

[02:44:35.890 --> 02:44:37.810]
How do you even...

[02:44:37.810 --> 02:44:39.450]
How do people know you even there?

[02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:41.410]
Well, you have to go over the track with me, I guess.

[02:44:42.430 --> 02:44:44.490]
Anyways, one for seven is W.A.D.

[02:44:44.490 --> 02:44:44.610]
Huh?

[02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:46.090]
Yeah, how did Lester do?

[02:44:46.490 --> 02:44:47.310]
Where's Lester's numbers?

[02:44:47.810 --> 02:44:48.630]
Is he on here?

[02:44:48.910 --> 02:44:50.570]
I think he beat the motivation station.

[02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:52.950]
I just can't believe this.

[02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.630]
Like, here it is.

[02:44:53.770 --> 02:44:56.570]
It's like, when did these start coming in an hour and twenty minutes ago?

[02:44:56.730 --> 02:44:57.530]
They started up to twelve.

[02:44:58.390 --> 02:44:59.350]
An hour and a half or two.

[02:44:59.590 --> 02:45:00.750]
The first ones came over there.

[02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:04.730]
And here we are still waiting for twelve plus midday and afternoon drive and night.

[02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:07.030]
And that is shocking, isn't it?

[02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:10.910]
Are they the ragging it out to the bitter end here or something or running?

[02:45:11.070 --> 02:45:11.670]
Or a cook counter here?

[02:45:11.730 --> 02:45:14.850]
Johnny was on his way to the back and somebody had some dessert back there.

[02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:18.150]
He's cake or something and I would be happy to see him again, you know?

[02:45:18.650 --> 02:45:19.630]
He may be hearing the numbers.

[02:45:20.010 --> 02:45:20.350]
Is he coming?

[02:45:20.670 --> 02:45:20.770]
Yeah.

[02:45:21.270 --> 02:45:23.150]
Oh my gosh, wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:25.890]
If he handed, we may not be able to get him.

[02:45:26.610 --> 02:45:27.630]
We're not going to get him.

[02:45:27.810 --> 02:45:28.270]
No, what?

[02:45:29.090 --> 02:45:31.310]
You may get midday in time with this, but...

[02:45:31.310 --> 02:45:32.190]
What, why is that?

[02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:33.570]
What's coming over now?

[02:45:34.350 --> 02:45:35.370]
6 to 10 a.m.

[02:45:35.370 --> 02:45:36.590]
6 to 10 a.m.

[02:45:36.690 --> 02:45:36.810]
Why?

[02:45:36.890 --> 02:45:37.590]
That you already have.

[02:45:38.490 --> 02:45:39.850]
What, they're doing twelve plus again?

[02:45:40.090 --> 02:45:40.250]
Yeah.

[02:45:40.930 --> 02:45:42.110]
Why are they doing it again?

[02:45:42.210 --> 02:45:43.150]
We've already got that.

[02:45:45.730 --> 02:45:46.510]
Oh, okay.

[02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:49.350]
Let's take our last break, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:45:49.350 --> 02:45:51.670]
We're going to really hold our collective breads here.

[02:45:52.010 --> 02:45:55.530]
But of course, if those numbers come in, I'll come rushing back in during the Dean show.

[02:45:57.190 --> 02:45:58.510]
No, I don't think so.

[02:45:58.610 --> 02:45:59.270]
I loved it, don't you?

[02:45:59.550 --> 02:46:01.450]
Oh, I can imagine.

[02:46:02.370 --> 02:46:04.230]
149 at WIOD.

[02:46:04.830 --> 02:46:09.390]
Chuck Meyer here, how do you spend your Saturday mornings hitting the snooze alarm eight or ten times?

[02:46:09.790 --> 02:46:14.390]
That's cool, but if you want to get an early start on your weekend, why not join me for the weekend magazine?

[02:46:14.910 --> 02:46:16.830]
Every Saturday morning, 6 to 10 a.m.

[02:46:16.830 --> 02:46:23.130]
We have the news, weather, sports, traffic, beach reports, entertainment calendar, and interviews with people from all walks of life.

[02:46:23.130 --> 02:46:25.010]
It's all geared to the South Florida lifestyle.

[02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:29.590]
So if you're heading for the beach, the mall, grandma's house, running the dog, you're taking a jog,

[02:46:30.010 --> 02:46:35.750]
keep the weekend magazine in mind, Saturday mornings, just before the Vesta Rogers on 6 to 10 WIOD.

[02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:38.190]
6 to 10, South Florida.

[02:46:42.790 --> 02:46:46.590]
Here's something that the greater percentage of the public agrees with.

[02:46:46.930 --> 02:46:50.030]
The Honda Accord is one of the world's great automobile.

[02:46:50.930 --> 02:46:51.750]
That's a fact.

[02:46:51.750 --> 02:46:56.570]
Now for the other percentage, the new Honda Accord has been changed.

[02:46:57.130 --> 02:47:01.110]
It's 100% different because it was re-engineered and improved.

[02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:06.550]
The newer Accord is bigger and better than ever, and looks every bit the part.

[02:47:07.050 --> 02:47:11.150]
There's more room inside with more space between the front and rear passengers.

[02:47:11.770 --> 02:47:19.230]
The ride is more comfortable over the longest distances, and the car is more responsive under all driving conditions.

[02:47:19.230 --> 02:47:26.970]
The new Accord was redesigned to create an entirely new car, one that raises the quality of driving,

[02:47:27.310 --> 02:47:29.230]
and is more tuned to the driver.

[02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:31.750]
You will have to drive it to believe it.

[02:47:32.190 --> 02:47:36.030]
The new Accord from Honda just go with the percentages.

[02:47:41.230 --> 02:47:44.130]
First time at the Jets 45, where's the lane on Play-Fake?

[02:47:44.130 --> 02:47:46.610]
Drops the Pro. What's left got a man down there?

[02:47:46.890 --> 02:47:48.070]
It is hot. What's that?

[02:47:48.790 --> 02:47:53.190]
The ECBs also express around Christmas only $7 with three parties.

[02:47:53.770 --> 02:47:57.370]
First bus leaves two hours before, and last bus leaves one hour before Chicago.

[02:47:57.890 --> 02:48:01.630]
The main boarding location is in Gania at 5440 Ravenswood Road.

[02:48:02.010 --> 02:48:05.410]
For other possible boarding sites, call 357 8400.

[02:48:06.450 --> 02:48:08.410]
The speed is 8400.

[02:48:15.210 --> 02:48:17.490]
Alright, 151 at WI. We've got eight minutes.

[02:48:18.210 --> 02:48:20.290]
John is going to be, well, we really appreciate this.

[02:48:20.290 --> 02:48:22.710]
John is getting more exercise today than he has all he does is eat.

[02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:23.610]
He said all he does is eat.

[02:48:24.290 --> 02:48:26.570]
He's trying to put on his best to go here.

[02:48:26.650 --> 02:48:31.670]
And he's rushing back there again to see if we can't at least give midday.

[02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:34.630]
Why would they be running morning 12 plus?

[02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:37.530]
And we already had that. We already went through it with a fine tooth comb.

[02:48:38.010 --> 02:48:39.290]
It must be an unbelievable stuff.

[02:48:39.390 --> 02:48:41.170]
So, have we got an important call on here? Hello?

[02:48:41.570 --> 02:48:42.590]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:43.130]
Yes.

[02:48:43.310 --> 02:48:46.830]
It isn't that the ladies don't get a phone, they do.

[02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:49.810]
They just can't get through. I try many, many times.

[02:48:50.190 --> 02:48:53.170]
We listen to you all the time, and I know many ladies would do.

[02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:55.270]
But the line is always busy.

[02:48:55.870 --> 02:48:56.670]
I can just try.

[02:48:57.190 --> 02:49:00.390]
He does not take the calls from Miami, really?

[02:49:00.690 --> 02:49:01.170]
Who doesn't?

[02:49:01.170 --> 02:49:02.730]
Whoever answers the phone?

[02:49:02.910 --> 02:49:03.630]
Oh my goodness.

[02:49:03.950 --> 02:49:04.870]
Can you knock for me?

[02:49:05.230 --> 02:49:05.550]
Okay.

[02:49:05.930 --> 02:49:08.250]
So, let's start taking those calls from Miami, Mike.

[02:49:08.410 --> 02:49:08.910]
That's right.

[02:49:09.090 --> 02:49:09.410]
Okay.

[02:49:10.210 --> 02:49:11.410]
Okay. We will welcome you.

[02:49:11.710 --> 02:49:12.070]
We will welcome you.

[02:49:12.070 --> 02:49:13.230]
We will for you 100%.

[02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:15.750]
Okay. You are going to be listening to the Dean this afternoon now?

[02:49:15.990 --> 02:49:16.570]
Well, possibly.

[02:49:16.830 --> 02:49:17.090]
Okay.

[02:49:17.410 --> 02:49:18.350]
Have a great day.

[02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:18.730]
Bye.

[02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:21.330]
Well, I think we saw that problem.

[02:49:21.890 --> 02:49:23.850]
Eight minutes before the hour, we are counting down.

[02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:25.110]
We have seven minutes left now.

[02:49:25.290 --> 02:49:26.210]
Boy, this is amazing.

[02:49:26.210 --> 02:49:27.110]
This is amazing.

[02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:28.650]
Don't you think they are doing this on purpose?

[02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:30.130]
Maybe we could do what they do.

[02:49:30.550 --> 02:49:30.930]
What?

[02:49:32.650 --> 02:49:34.110]
What is going on?

[02:49:34.770 --> 02:49:36.690]
This is just starting now on the day numbers.

[02:49:36.930 --> 02:49:37.590]
Just starting now.

[02:49:38.190 --> 02:49:39.230]
He should be near the top.

[02:49:39.270 --> 02:49:41.330]
Well then you can tell us what they are.

[02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:42.330]
They're got near the top.

[02:49:42.330 --> 02:49:44.510]
Certainly going to be in the top three or four.

[02:49:45.150 --> 02:49:45.670]
Twelve runs.

[02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:47.490]
I mean it'll be another three.

[02:49:47.610 --> 02:49:49.150]
Oh this is like a game now.

[02:49:49.330 --> 02:49:51.710]
This is just going to be a little bit too.

[02:49:51.950 --> 02:49:53.650]
It's like dragging and he's dragging.

[02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:55.110]
It's a little wise running that.

[02:49:55.390 --> 02:49:55.530]
Is he?

[02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:58.390]
No, he's inside the machine now.

[02:49:58.490 --> 02:49:59.230]
It's going to be down to the one.

[02:49:59.230 --> 02:50:00.910]
You remember once upon a time in America?

[02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:01.970]
Sure.

[02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.730]
At the end of the movie.

[02:50:03.350 --> 02:50:05.090]
At the garbage truck.

[02:50:05.290 --> 02:50:07.430]
It was being ground up inside the machine there.

[02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:11.310]
Spike Wise is with the sanitation people right now as we speak.

[02:50:11.630 --> 02:50:13.930]
So we may have to run over time.

[02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:14.510]
That's it?

[02:50:14.650 --> 02:50:15.830]
No, I don't think so.

[02:50:16.270 --> 02:50:18.650]
Of all days I don't think today would be today.

[02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:19.690]
They did that.

[02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:22.290]
I tell them to hunt me and bring me never left the air until we had a work.

[02:50:22.570 --> 02:50:22.950]
Well.

[02:50:24.350 --> 02:50:25.150]
Back in the day.

[02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:28.230]
Nothing more disgusting than listening to some self aggrandizing.

[02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:31.430]
Pump is as talking about his numbers.

[02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:32.130]
Of you.

[02:50:33.170 --> 02:50:35.270]
Those of us who are old pros.

[02:50:35.530 --> 02:50:38.210]
We don't need to worry about ratings and numbers.

[02:50:38.550 --> 02:50:40.250]
We know who's number one.

[02:50:42.250 --> 02:50:43.110]
Oh god.

[02:50:43.330 --> 02:50:44.290]
I can't wait for it.

[02:50:44.690 --> 02:50:45.890]
I'm going to take extra time.

[02:50:45.930 --> 02:50:47.550]
I'm going to drive home by way of Jackson.

[02:50:48.350 --> 02:50:50.890]
Just to make sure I can pick up the whole show today.

[02:50:50.930 --> 02:50:51.710]
It's going to be incredible.

[02:50:52.410 --> 02:50:52.690]
Okay.

[02:50:52.770 --> 02:50:53.850]
Now it's one fifty four.

[02:50:53.970 --> 02:50:56.210]
That clock is ticking away frantically now.

[02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:58.350]
Another woman on the line.

[02:50:58.530 --> 02:50:58.750]
Hello.

[02:50:59.090 --> 02:50:59.710]
Hi, Neil.

[02:50:59.710 --> 02:51:00.430]
How are you?

[02:51:00.650 --> 02:51:00.970]
Great.

[02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:02.230]
Probably a man to recast.

[02:51:02.850 --> 02:51:05.610]
You know something I have been trying to call you for about three weeks.

[02:51:05.810 --> 02:51:07.790]
I was at the fix and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

[02:51:07.810 --> 02:51:08.650]
I met Johnny Dork.

[02:51:09.070 --> 02:51:10.690]
Spend so much for my car for me.

[02:51:10.850 --> 02:51:10.990]
Wow.

[02:51:11.130 --> 02:51:11.950]
You got it on everybody.

[02:51:12.270 --> 02:51:12.770]
That's our lean.

[02:51:13.230 --> 02:51:13.810]
That's right.

[02:51:14.170 --> 02:51:14.750]
My role lean.

[02:51:14.930 --> 02:51:15.050]
Good.

[02:51:15.170 --> 02:51:15.690]
How are you?

[02:51:16.010 --> 02:51:16.210]
Fine.

[02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:19.850]
And I can't get through to tell you how much I enjoy your show.

[02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:21.230]
I mean, I keep diary in the line.

[02:51:21.230 --> 02:51:21.650]
It's busy.

[02:51:21.810 --> 02:51:24.050]
I realize that you're a very busy man and you're very popular.

[02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:26.810]
So that's okay because nobody wants to hear how much you enjoy the show anyway.

[02:51:27.010 --> 02:51:28.110]
But I mean, we appreciate it.

[02:51:28.110 --> 02:51:28.730]
I really do.

[02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:29.990]
I never really enjoy it.

[02:51:30.110 --> 02:51:32.030]
And I really tried many times to get through.

[02:51:32.210 --> 02:51:33.470]
And I just get a busy signal.

[02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:37.610]
So I just wanted to let you know that you got a lot of nice listeners out there and their women.

[02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:38.610]
And they're nice.

[02:51:38.910 --> 02:51:40.230]
Well, we're excited to hear that.

[02:51:40.470 --> 02:51:40.810]
Okay.

[02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:41.550]
Thanks, Arlene.

[02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:42.050]
You're welcome.

[02:51:42.210 --> 02:51:42.610]
Bye-bye.

[02:51:43.350 --> 02:51:45.670]
Now it's one fifty four thirty late boy.

[02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:46.670]
You've never been on anything.

[02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:50.530]
This is like, oh man, cutting it we got four men, four and a half minutes.

[02:51:51.650 --> 02:51:53.210]
It's how long could it possibly take?

[02:51:53.210 --> 02:51:54.510]
I think it's go so slow.

[02:51:54.990 --> 02:51:56.570]
It's the slowest machine I've ever seen.

[02:51:56.730 --> 02:51:57.450]
I'm going to check you.

[02:51:57.530 --> 02:51:57.950]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:51:58.090 --> 02:51:58.570]
Oh my god.

[02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:59.950]
Another run to the back.

[02:52:00.130 --> 02:52:00.490]
Wow.

[02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:04.350]
I have never seen this man put such energy out.

[02:52:04.350 --> 02:52:04.990]
This is loyalty.

[02:52:05.250 --> 02:52:06.770]
The button's behind the call of duty.

[02:52:06.810 --> 02:52:07.010]
Yeah.

[02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:07.910]
Brunch or something.

[02:52:08.010 --> 02:52:09.670]
Yeah, we'll have to get him some food someday.

[02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:13.950]
Like Monday, no doubt.

[02:52:15.230 --> 02:52:18.290]
But boy, this is really right down to the...

[02:52:18.290 --> 02:52:20.210]
I better be good now after all of this, huh?

[02:52:21.250 --> 02:52:23.310]
Speaking of women, how you doing with the doc lady?

[02:52:24.030 --> 02:52:24.050]
Going?

[02:52:25.250 --> 02:52:25.930]
Oh, really?

[02:52:26.130 --> 02:52:26.570]
That's just great.

[02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:29.510]
And how about Robin?

[02:52:30.570 --> 02:52:30.770]
No.

[02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:33.250]
Wow, Mount Jazeal Fernandez.

[02:52:34.210 --> 02:52:35.130]
He'd like to start.

[02:52:35.150 --> 02:52:35.270]
He'd like to start.

[02:52:35.610 --> 02:52:36.390]
He'd like to start.

[02:52:36.390 --> 02:52:36.870]
Yeah, he would.

[02:52:37.290 --> 02:52:38.770]
Can you do me any good there, Tom?

[02:52:38.910 --> 02:52:41.330]
Well, I don't need anybody in the home.

[02:52:41.390 --> 02:52:42.210]
I'm a good buddy, Hank.

[02:52:42.370 --> 02:52:43.150]
I promised him.

[02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:46.930]
He's not here.

[02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:47.110]
He's not here.

[02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.370]
He's not here.

[02:52:47.570 --> 02:52:48.070]
He's not here.

[02:52:48.350 --> 02:52:49.930]
He's not here.

[02:52:50.610 --> 02:52:52.070]
Oh, I keep track of her.

[02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:52.410]
Yeah.

[02:52:52.910 --> 02:52:54.090]
Hank is not her type.

[02:52:54.330 --> 02:52:54.550]
No.

[02:52:55.430 --> 02:52:56.050]
I don't know.

[02:52:56.170 --> 02:52:56.350]
He's driving.

[02:52:56.930 --> 02:52:57.290]
155.

[02:52:57.490 --> 02:52:57.790]
45.

[02:52:58.490 --> 02:53:00.270]
I drive a bit too, and I'm not her type either.

[02:53:02.650 --> 02:53:03.370]
Almost 156.

[02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:05.270]
We have three minutes and counting.

[02:53:05.490 --> 02:53:06.670]
Johnny Dark is not here.

[02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:06.930]
He is.

[02:53:06.970 --> 02:53:07.630]
I see that head.

[02:53:07.790 --> 02:53:09.350]
Oh, he's got something to say.

[02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:10.130]
I have the number.

[02:53:10.450 --> 02:53:12.070]
Rip, rip, rip, right off the machine.

[02:53:12.290 --> 02:53:12.570]
What do you mean?

[02:53:12.670 --> 02:53:13.370]
I have all of them.

[02:53:13.470 --> 02:53:15.030]
What is that they're not still working on?

[02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:17.770]
Where is it?

[02:53:17.930 --> 02:53:18.410]
The first number.

[02:53:18.410 --> 02:53:20.310]
Oh, well, that's fine.

[02:53:20.430 --> 02:53:21.170]
That's all we wanted.

[02:53:21.310 --> 02:53:22.190]
Don't get all that out of shape.

[02:53:22.450 --> 02:53:22.810]
Midday.

[02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:24.410]
Number one, W.

[02:53:24.750 --> 02:53:25.110]
Life.

[02:53:25.270 --> 02:53:28.050]
Life list with a down from a 10, 6, 2, and 8, 4.

[02:53:28.650 --> 02:53:30.510]
As I told you, number two, W.

[02:53:30.510 --> 02:53:32.090]
I.O.D. up from a 6, 3.

[02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.650]
It was seven.

[02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:34.550]
Whoa, seven.

[02:53:36.750 --> 02:53:37.110]
Wow.

[02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:38.530]
You're supposed to say, wow.

[02:53:39.130 --> 02:53:40.790]
No, Tom Chitka said that.

[02:53:40.990 --> 02:53:41.810]
I don't say wow.

[02:53:42.050 --> 02:53:42.770]
When he did the D.

[02:53:42.770 --> 02:53:43.690]
They would say, wow.

[02:53:44.310 --> 02:53:47.910]
I thought from a 6, 2, 6, 7, and QBA AM.

[02:53:48.050 --> 02:53:48.390]
Joy.

[02:53:49.490 --> 02:53:51.850]
Magic from a 5, 5 down to a 4, 5.

[02:53:52.250 --> 02:53:54.530]
Power with a 4, and that's about all we got.

[02:53:54.670 --> 02:53:56.270]
You can leave the building.

[02:53:56.370 --> 02:53:57.770]
Holding up two fingers like Nixon.

[02:53:58.230 --> 02:53:59.070]
I'm number two.

[02:53:59.470 --> 02:53:59.890]
Oh, wait a minute.

[02:54:00.050 --> 02:54:00.470]
Here's W.

[02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:02.150]
Snues with a 39.

[02:54:02.690 --> 02:54:04.630]
No, that's, yeah, 39.

[02:54:04.930 --> 02:54:05.290]
That's Debbie?

[02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:06.690]
Yeah, from a 25.

[02:54:06.970 --> 02:54:09.230]
The only problem is they're all over the age of 400.

[02:54:10.290 --> 02:54:11.490]
While 100 with the 3.

[02:54:11.650 --> 02:54:12.810]
7, gloves with a 3.

[02:54:13.070 --> 02:54:13.390]
6.

[02:54:13.530 --> 02:54:14.750]
So probably we'll wait.

[02:54:15.050 --> 02:54:16.050]
The GGR from a 3.

[02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:16.910]
7 down to a 2.

[02:54:17.070 --> 02:54:17.190]
6.

[02:54:17.290 --> 02:54:18.610]
So that's what we've got at least here.

[02:54:19.010 --> 02:54:21.330]
So we'll take the 7 and run home with it.

[02:54:21.410 --> 02:54:21.810]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:22.130 --> 02:54:22.410]
7.

[02:54:22.690 --> 02:54:23.810]
That's your biggest number here.

[02:54:23.930 --> 02:54:24.690]
No, we have a 7.

[02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:25.430]
3 in the winter.

[02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:29.450]
We got really jobbed in the spring when that June month in there down to a 6.

[02:54:29.470 --> 02:54:29.730]
3.

[02:54:29.790 --> 02:54:30.930]
And now we're back up to a 7.

[02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:31.910]
Great.

[02:54:32.130 --> 02:54:36.590]
Which considering all things equal, can I say to the Alex Bennett factor there for a week?

[02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:38.290]
I think, well, what are you?

[02:54:39.410 --> 02:54:39.770]
Huh?

[02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:40.770]
There they go.

[02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:41.990]
Well, that's not there.

[02:54:42.170 --> 02:54:42.510]
Not there.

[02:54:43.010 --> 02:54:43.370]
No.

[02:54:43.850 --> 02:54:45.690]
No, it's not shopliver.

[02:54:46.330 --> 02:54:47.510]
Well, anyway, thank you very much.

[02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:47.850]
I appreciate it.

[02:54:47.950 --> 02:54:51.990]
I know you'd like to get out of here about a minute and a half early because you might want to encounter the Dean in the hallway.

[02:54:52.290 --> 02:54:52.690]
Oh, yeah.

[02:54:53.570 --> 02:54:55.010]
I'm saying the Dean.

[02:54:55.230 --> 02:54:56.310]
The Dean is out there.

[02:54:56.310 --> 02:54:57.270]
The Dean is out there.

[02:54:57.470 --> 02:54:58.810]
The Dean is in the hall of the Lord.

[02:54:59.370 --> 02:55:00.090]
She's on the Dan.

[02:55:00.190 --> 02:55:00.590]
What is this?

[02:55:00.810 --> 02:55:02.230]
She with a 2.6 midday.

[02:55:02.830 --> 02:55:04.730]
Zeta from a 1.7 to a 2.6.

[02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:07.350]
The GGR factor is gone and that must be helping them.

[02:55:08.410 --> 02:55:09.830]
Yeah, I don't get that.

[02:55:09.870 --> 02:55:10.950]
I don't know where that's coming from.

[02:55:11.710 --> 02:55:12.430]
I.N.Z.

[02:55:12.430 --> 02:55:13.630]
A 1.8 up to a 2.

[02:55:13.690 --> 02:55:16.950]
They're definitely on the road to recovery and that's about all you need to know in midday.

[02:55:17.090 --> 02:55:17.290]
Okay.

[02:55:17.430 --> 02:55:18.310]
So that takes care of that.

[02:55:18.370 --> 02:55:20.390]
We got a whole packet of crap to take home here.

[02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:21.990]
And stay tuned now.

[02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:24.170]
We've been having a lot of fun with them all day long.

[02:55:24.330 --> 02:55:25.690]
And far be it from us to be.

[02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:26.630]
Oh, look at that.

[02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:27.370]
It'll all fell.

[02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:28.950]
It'll all fall on the floor.

[02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:29.950]
I think that's an omen.

[02:55:30.170 --> 02:55:31.250]
Did you get the answer in the number, sir?

[02:55:31.490 --> 02:55:32.010]
Not yet.

[02:55:32.610 --> 02:55:33.250]
12 plus.

[02:55:33.450 --> 02:55:33.630]
No.

[02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:36.110]
You want us to stay on for 15 minutes?

[02:55:36.110 --> 02:55:38.910]
I'm sure Steve's people would love to hear what they are, but we don't have them here.

[02:55:39.030 --> 02:55:39.770]
We'll go on Monday.

[02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:41.330]
And we can't do that.

[02:55:41.350 --> 02:55:42.690]
The dean is in the hallway.

[02:55:43.130 --> 02:55:46.630]
You know, he's been getting ready for this.

[02:55:46.770 --> 02:55:48.450]
I'm sure for days now.

[02:55:48.610 --> 02:55:52.190]
So stay around for Alan Burke, ladies and gentlemen, a legend that is on mind.

[02:55:53.230 --> 02:55:57.010]
And that, of course, we got sports talk tonight at 605 with Hank Goldiger.

[02:55:58.790 --> 02:56:02.970]
And followed, of course, at 8 o'clock tonight by the unmentioned, a bull, Dickie Farcoğlu.

[02:56:02.970 --> 02:56:07.150]
And Tom Strill doing hour on me, but I've been doing a long time on Tom Jicken.

[02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:08.530]
Tom said that he won't be listening.

[02:56:08.530 --> 02:56:10.610]
And I'm sure the most of the rest of you feel the same way.

[02:56:10.890 --> 02:56:12.210]
OK, have a great weekend.

[02:56:12.330 --> 02:56:13.810]
We'll see you Monday morning at 10 o'clock.

[02:56:13.810 --> 02:56:16.650]
We'll have a further compendium of all of these really.

[02:56:16.810 --> 02:56:18.350]
I have my Monday column in the fourth.

[02:56:18.890 --> 02:56:19.550]
Lord, what are they?

[02:56:19.870 --> 02:56:20.750]
I'm sentinel.

[02:56:20.850 --> 02:56:23.210]
It's the cost only a quarter at your favorite newsstand.

[02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:26.950]
And the coin box, et cetera, on your front lawn, even when you don't order it.

[02:56:27.250 --> 02:56:30.090]
And stay to now for Chuck Meyer with the two o'clock news.

[02:56:30.090 --> 02:56:34.530]
And have a great weekend in a solemn holiday and the Go Cubs.

[02:57:02.930 --> 02:57:04.090]
WIOD, Ryan Fortwaterdale.

[02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:10.450]
Steve Canard, next after this news break on New Thought Radio 610, WIOD.

[02:57:11.050 --> 02:57:11.710]
Pind up.
