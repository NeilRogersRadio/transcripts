[00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:00.920]
okay

[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.760]
so i'll run to those phones

[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.880]
for the phone

[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.200]
oh wait a minute one just lit up now is a lot more exciting when it was

[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.460]
blank

[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.280]
but uh... may take a little while to get all of the stuff by chest okay but you

[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.740]
finally

[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.180]
reach a point

[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.080]
where you've taken enough crap

[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.140]
and you say hey this is gonna stop

[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.720]
now i don't know how many people heard the insipid garbage that was on this

[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.540]
radio station yesterday afternoon

[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.760]
and i'm being very kind when i use the word garbage

[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.900]
it it always shocks me how many different ways i will say this that the

[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.280]
various host in this market

[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.540]
see i mean if if i'm going to sit here with allis or somebody on other

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.000]
station

[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.620]
that's great that's fun we have a lot of good fun to and we don't make a whole

[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.280]
show out of it in fact we really do it for more than a few minutes of the

[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.680]
time

[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.700]
and uh...

[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.500]
we never invite the audience to participate all the ones in a while of you

[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.340]
know some of our spies will participate

[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.820]
or there'll be a huge shot here and there but we don't

[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.900]
we don't orchestrate an entire we shut that stupid thing up

[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.780]
you can't say that

[00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.360]
always had shot it off

[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.980]
it all that's what he was that that he said something to

[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.740]
that word would have applied very well to what i heard yesterday

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.920]
for four hours

[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.800]
uh...

[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.980]
and you know everybody's been getting along real well and i thought everybody had

[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.440]
their place in life under control you know we all do our own thing

[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.600]
and i think i said several times that one of the joys been on the station is

[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.760]
that

[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.420]
it's not like you're holding up the whole operation like we were at certain

[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.080]
other places it like everybody's got their own very large audience mike's got

[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.840]
his own unique wild huge audience in the morning

[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.900]
and we certainly got that going here in in the midday to know question about

[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.980]
that they might have mail it rich to her near that he got from the mail should

[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.700]
indicate something

[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.600]
and steve has got a big audience in the afternoon and sports talks got it so

[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.580]
thing and yeah there's a certain amount of crossover

[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.260]
but i got to be honest with you i don't

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.020]
think it's all that great

[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.980]
really i really don't know i really don't

[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.700]
which is fine

[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.340]
i mean if it was a struggling station if i can use that word then it's a

[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.000]
different story but it's not at station that's only going to get better and

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.280]
better and have a big audience

[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.040]
assuming of course that each individual can put his or her ego in its

[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.960]
proper perspective

[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.420]
all and be a part of a whole team as opposed to

[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.080]
something else

[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.700]
ego

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.000]
but started to say that it's amazing to me over the years how many different

[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.620]
ways people can

[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.440]
twist and manipulate so as to orchestrate the audience in due an entire

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.340]
program of neal Rogers bashing

[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.920]
nothing else about stand i spoke to stand is morning by the way in here

[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.140]
are very good friends and always will be in sply out we've had our moments

[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.160]
and the stand is okay and hopefully he'll be back on here like he should be

[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.300]
some day soon somewhere

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.140]
but uh... i remember that one show that he did over at winds when we were

[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.860]
on a data

[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.220]
uh... but at least at least one thing he was honest about it okay he went on a

[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.720]
year and he said we're gonna bash neal for four hours today which i never have

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.900]
forgiven for was a tasteless right grotesque thing

[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.360]
and uh...

[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.700]
it was that his intentions i don't think we're for the way it turned out but

[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.820]
naturally once you open up the door for that uh...

[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.980]
it becomes self-evident what's gonna happen

[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.900]
and it's no it takes no talent to do that i mean that takes no style or

[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.100]
flare talent whatsoever

[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.600]
is to preside over an entire program

[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.040]
where the purpose is just to invite the audience to bash a particular

[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.580]
individual whether it's another talk host on your own station

[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.140]
or whatever it might be

[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.980]
i just can't envision i can't imagine going on here and saying okay let's

[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.920]
um...

[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.120]
rippley foulard today for four hours okay never done it

[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.980]
we've never done it never invite anybody to call in a rep other talk show host

[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.360]
although as i said some of them do

[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.720]
and usually when i do it not always but usually

[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.760]
like with leave for example i don't have any hard feelings with leaf

[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.400]
foulies is pretty good guy when we used to call us we still some good fun on

[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.620]
here

[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.800]
and i harbor no ill feelings toward them on where they are there i mean he did

[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.200]
destroy her help destroy w snooze but that's

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.940]
it wasn't done out of malice it was done out of the confidence okay and there's

[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.560]
a big difference

[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.760]
no seriously not to be there you go again with that can't be man they ripped you

[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.540]
and i see us today and i'm telling you if you would have heard any of it you

[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.800]
would be apoplectic i'm so glad i was busy

[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.880]
yes now the one thing that we've done consistently since i came here somebody

[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.220]
calls in wants to rip mic wants to rip steve i tell them very quickly

[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.640]
could i

[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.480]
call them if you got a problem okay

[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.220]
we're not going to play that game

[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.320]
and i don't sit in a listen to ten minutes of it and then turn around say

[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.100]
well jay you got it all wrong and it's really unfair you know because that's

[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.820]
that reminds me of what surely spellburg used to do when i was a k team many

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.480]
many moons ago and i first came to the market

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.040]
and she would let somebody just rip me and i mean just us doing assault a

[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.700]
personal assault at every kind of slanderous crap in the world and then after

[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.300]
they've been on for five ten minutes rambling and hating and spewing she said

[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.080]
all that's not talk about him let's talk about something intelligent

[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.180]
but of course not she let them get out here you know when they totally ran out

[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.280]
of steam at no more venom dispute at that point

[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.660]
she would say oh well we didn't really want to do that but she made a point of

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.760]
letting it all go on the air

[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.280]
and what i heard yesterday which allegedly was a discussion of this movie talk

[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.280]
radio not it's kind of difficult i've a discussion of a movie talk radio

[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.800]
because nobody's seen it is not yet

[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.480]
there's been private screenings with some of the people in the media including

[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.040]
steve of scene at i haven't seen it but

[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.700]
how can anybody discuss it

[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.480]
or the character in it

[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.820]
when they haven't seen it

[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.980]
i mean i discussed rainman after i saw it just come out of short time and it

[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.440]
took you notice it took a while sure it's not too many people had seen it yet

[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.080]
but at least it was in the theaters which is a good start

[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.140]
what followed thereafter was um... nearly four hours

[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.580]
of bashing new rodges and glen hill

[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.860]
now one of the things i kept hearing is that this program has no substance

[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.040]
now these are all these great pseudo intellectuals out there who are so bright

[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.080]
and we love those topics and uh... that's always just garbage

[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.360]
which of course if that's the case then they don't need to be listening to it

[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.340]
because we're not changing

[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.340]
we're not changing

[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.360]
and i love the way steve likes to engage some of his car's in this all yeah

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.360]
nearly as the greatest when you see those topics and i wish once in a while he

[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.200]
go back and do that

[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.660]
it's not gonna happen okay it just isn't gonna happen

[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.040]
and some of you who are too immature to understand

[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.460]
this is a different show

[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.280]
there are no heavy topics in a mic renery show

[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.760]
and if you told mike well i think tomorrow you ought to come on and discuss

[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.920]
uh... brain surgery

[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.880]
he'd laugh at you okay because he's not gonna do it

[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.840]
he's very successful doing what he does

[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.360]
and nobody complains about that

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.040]
amazing

[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.580]
and were very successful doing what we do here

[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.760]
and i hate to break the news to you but when the bird first came on the show

[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.700]
back in the spring

[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.900]
two years ago all we had in the in the daytime was a nine share on w i n's it's

[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.420]
only had a nine four or five is a good number okay

[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.800]
a nine is be it on her to on a m radio

[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.660]
that heard of an fm radio to be honest with except maybe for life

[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.560]
and then in the morning on zeta that year when a lot of these old far its

[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.180]
weren't listening

[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.640]
all we did was beat every morning show in the market

[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.020]
the last book that we were there every one of them okay

[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.720]
including some people have been on the year for many many years

[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.360]
thirteen yeah

[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.940]
twenty five fifty four we beat him the last trend we were at number one eighteen

[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.440]
thirty four i mean for a talk show regardless of what bandids on i have those

[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.440]
demographics we have this huge audience and i like to have to go through and

[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.940]
repeat all of this because i don't like to do a lot of self-serving

[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.360]
stuff i really don't

[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.200]
and i find it terminally boring to hear people one after another of these

[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.260]
butlickers calling and uh... this ingratiating thing i've talked about this for

[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.040]
years where the uh... with the callers feel they have to ingratiate

[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.440]
themselves with a host it's disgusting

[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.780]
but evidently there's a lot of substance to it

[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.540]
now evidently because that's what i heard for four hours yesterday and all

[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.180]
these people are so disbruddled

[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.620]
that there's no substance on this program in your cackling in my whatever it is

[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.180]
we do here

[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.960]
uh... boy they sure got a lot of substance yesterday

[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.460]
it was that juvenile

[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.940]
which near type stuff i used to hear it over there all the time i'd be driving

[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.600]
home at midnight

[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.240]
when i worked at snooze at night

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.860]
i'd hear how come you're so nice and he's so mean i mean it's for these for

[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.720]
these people are going through their second child

[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.440]
and most of more pretty old to by the way most of the colors there was one twenty

[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.280]
year old pinhead

[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.440]
uh... who is

[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.400]
you know singing the virtues of the alan birchow and how it was so much more

[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.420]
interesting this one

[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.540]
well because alan used to have topics

[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.100]
uh... my god

[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.500]
a lot of this i would be audience and i've been saying this for many weeks and i

[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.980]
try not to say too often because naturally somebody enjoys the show it's

[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.660]
fine we don't care where they come from

[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.100]
oh yeah we got that idiot calling again i can dish it out but i can take it

[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.360]
let me say it again

[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.840]
i can take all the ripping in the abuse by people on the stations which means

[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.940]
it doesn't mean i'm not going to give it back because if it is worthy of it i

[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.280]
will

[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.960]
but not on this station

[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.240]
not on this station

[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.340]
and not to let people go on for five and ten minutes and put some of them on a

[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.900]
hold and carry them over and ripping and tearing and telling us what we ought to

[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.120]
be doing and what we should be doing that that's not a talk show

[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.920]
that's not substance it's not a talk show

[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.780]
it's not anything but swill

[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.680]
and as i said before and this includes s i herch the insurance guy out there

[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.100]
called in again yesterday which prompted me to call about twenty to five

[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.820]
if you don't like the show don't listen

[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.920]
and i just had a guy before i came on the air who knows

[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.220]
side very well

[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.820]
and tells me he listens every day of course they all do

[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.640]
every one of this man is so filled and he started out with this particular

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.020]
call which is what really got me that's when i had to call on the bat line

[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.880]
and he started out about how well no question the two shows are different

[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.960]
steve niel is one thing you do want like like he was an objective

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.000]
caller many started ripping into you about a cackling idiot and i kind of crap

[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.620]
and then by the end of the call he had worked his usual venom and hysteria

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.520]
and emotion up to the point he was just uh... mouth breathing with his hate

[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.300]
but the man can't stop listening he's been calling with hate calls for our

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.220]
not how many years

[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.760]
and this applies to anybody else out there you don't like to show we don't need

[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.900]
you go away

[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.140]
the only show in this

[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.560]
community i'm sure maybe in america where people are invited

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.760]
to go away

[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.800]
because i don't want to punish you i don't want to hurt you if you are harmed by

[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.240]
the show

[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.560]
if you're wounded by the show if you're insulted by the show if you don't

[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.380]
understand it if you

[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.580]
disappointed if you feel there is any substance that we ought to be talking about

[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.320]
some real original things like capital punishment and have a few rabbis on

[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.060]
forget it because it isn't gonna happen

[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.880]
but don't waste

[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.060]
your time

[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.680]
and the good airtime

[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.540]
calling to ingratiate yourself with mother host so that you can rip this show

[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.980]
for five or ten minutes

[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.520]
and rip glimps for five or ten minutes if you don't like him

[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.880]
tough luck he's not going anywhere he's there be here

[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.160]
and it's a lot more than just laugh but you only hear some of you what you want

[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.120]
to hear that's correct

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.560]
you only hear what you want to hear and you're all experts what time of your

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.580]
shows on okay all you experts out there when the hell is your show on

[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.540]
when you get your such experts out there on programming and radio when you get

[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.980]
your show you can have any side kick it's likely

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.340]
anybody have made the out of space queen on whatever you want okay

[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.080]
and i hear a lot of these mouth breathing goofballs out there all i got to do is

[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.820]
hear a voice on the radio right away that got one hand in their crotch and

[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.040]
the other with a finger somewhere

[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.880]
i mean some of you people are pathetic it's just a radio show

[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.880]
that's all just a radio show

[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.920]
and like i've always said about the chronic regulars

[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.440]
where they got no life

[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.040]
they got a real problem

[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.600]
a real problem i've never encountered any

[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.380]
chronic regular over the years that i've been on the air that's almost thirty

[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.560]
who didn't have serious serious problems

[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.100]
because to those people it's not just a radio show it's their life

[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.280]
right and i got news for you baby it's a job to me

[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.740]
and when i walk out of here at two o'clock by a minute after

[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.860]
i don't remember a god damn thing that happened in a previous four hours

[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.300]
as i've got all as i pushed the door

[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.040]
that's like closing the door on the program all the job it's a radio show

[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.080]
and the other ones of you out there who think you're set like the this miserable

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.060]
bag that called in who was allowed to go on a great like well she works with

[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.980]
people and she knows human nature and all that nil he's so hate

[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.240]
full and he's so full of hate

[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.720]
yeah that's why we raised thirty five to forty thousand dollars for the

[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.620]
Camilo's house okay or they didn't talk about that because i'm no i'll

[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.480]
they somehow left that out are you serious and the overwhelming majority of

[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.900]
that money by the way came from the morons who listened to this radio show

[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.560]
okay i know that nobody with a brain could ever listen to this show

[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.840]
nobody with any humanity could ever listen to this show but it must come as a

[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.000]
great shock to you that the overwhelming majority

[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.380]
of those dollars came from the listeners of this program

[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.440]
it's twenty minutes past ten at w i d i got a lot more to say but we got to do a

[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.860]
break you know life goes on life is not just monologues alone as bob

[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.020]
lanceter would say now we got the time straightened out here it's going to be

[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.040]
noon to three a week from the center day the 14th of January that's

[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.180]
Stephen are going to be a Toyota of Hollywood now more with neo-roger our new

[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:49.420]
stock radio six ten w i o d we're here in homes to show you that miraculous new

[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.680]
product polyderma we pick the oldest lady we could find and apply just a

[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.980]
little dab of polyderm honor rubbed it in real good and just look at the

[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.300]
amazing results oh my i look and feel like i'm 20 again but wait let's put grandma

[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:09.220]
through fifty consecutive washes so wait no i'll have it all my hours later

[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.220]
will dry her up and she still is young looking as ever

[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.260]
and just look at that shine polyderma is made from an exclusive formula

[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.780]
ex out sixty plus that combines the facial molecules and leaves you with young

[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.360]
looking skin again and gives a hard coating that lasts and lasts for weeks

[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:35.760]
polyderma caution too much polyderma plighted one time can create undesirable results

[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:47.480]
polyderma what was that well we had to chop the end off because it uh... talked

[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.720]
about the uh... station this was originally on years and years ago

[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.420]
those are friend caprita needs to be a way that it just died well it talked about

[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.000]
glove signing for and we didn't want to leave that on there but why didn't why not

[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.460]
eliminated starting at polyderma before that word

[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.460]
oh as opposed to like in the middle of polyderma

[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.600]
uh... it was quite like that

[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.680]
sorry oh boy i'm gonna start screaming these ahead of time although we do appreciate

[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.800]
getting them on car because we don't have any place to double our material so we

[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.020]
got stuff always in in the hopper you know that well here someday if we live

[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.580]
long enough but uh... yet we need everything on car yeah so when you send

[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:28.160]
this material so you know still some cards from some radio station make sure we

[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.700]
get them on car

[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.940]
by the way the number one prime time uh... tv show last recording to

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.740]
ac nielson the care and carpenter sterile be done

[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.380]
that's a pride i don't even have no substance

[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.880]
on this program it seems to me we discussed that

[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.180]
that we played some carpenter music at like one day the day after it was on

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.640]
and it seems to me that if somebody objectively listen to the show even though

[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.000]
we don't do topical radio far from it and we don't claim to

[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.160]
that uh... actually even by accident we get into a lot more topics than some

[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.100]
of the shows where they claim to be very heavily topical oriented

[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.300]
where every time they have open phones basically turns out to be a breast

[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.560]
beating uh... how wonderful i am or let's rip niel for four hours

[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.220]
uh... what is your favorite steve can show by the way

[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.920]
it's ten twenty seven at the wi-w day no i i just uh... i i got to be honest with

[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.320]
you i felt i knew that the day was coming sooner or later

[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.520]
and it just happened it just happened yesterday and i've restrained myself long

[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.360]
enough and i keep hearing it i you know i hear it in bits and pieces

[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.500]
and even yesterday somebody called in fact i think it was the first call yesterday

[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.840]
right out of the box and they started wonder rips the exit

[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:44.080]
knock it off okay i don't want to hear it and i don't right i don't want to hear it

[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.080]
it sucks

[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.200]
and as far as dishing it out your damn right boy anybody else in a market who does

[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.920]
not work on his station i'll be delighted to rip most of them because most of

[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.820]
deserve it okay there are a lot of amateur hour people on here in this market

[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.100]
it's a bush league town with a lot of bush league listeners too and especially

[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:08.240]
bush league callers and listening to some of those voices and then hearing

[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.140]
sigh i mean that was that was just the

[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.360]
crowning blow to me that was just the um... the straw that broke the moose cows

[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.940]
back incredible so most of these were old most of

[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.700]
more old yeah uh... who are forced to listen to frozen dials up in

[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.300]
years i would say forty five plus crown i'm not saying forty five is all because i'm

[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.780]
forty six but i mean most of them were well up there

[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.900]
and that's another thing that they seem to be having a little culture shock and going

[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.560]
through and i don't give a damn what anybody here says the name of the game

[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.280]
in this business is twenty five to fifty four that's the demographic the people want

[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.960]
yet people younger than that that's fine and if you have some older that's okay too

[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.100]
but nobody buys those people okay we don't have any

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.820]
polident commercials on this radio station we are going to have any okay

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.940]
we don't even have effort and

[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.260]
and so i know it's a little painful and like when i tell nick i don't want to keep

[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.480]
here in these old voices and i don't want to hear them i really don't and i hear

[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.880]
too much of that on this radio station and that's one of the things that they

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.060]
brought us over here for was to bring some living and breathing people back to

[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.400]
a-m radio on the age of a hundred and it's got to happen

[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.880]
because you're never going to maximize your potential this is a business i hate

[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.460]
to break that news to you it's a business you're never going to maximize your

[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.540]
potential when you deal with people a hundred years plus it just ain't going to

[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.220]
happen not the audience that anybody wants i mean

[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:41.620]
anybody and also notice you know that always the audience is always going to do

[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.300]
this pitting the one against the other i mentioned that when i called steve on

[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.560]
the areas today they just love to do that especially in this market because

[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.940]
they're like little children and they have to create this hostility and then sit

[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.440]
out there and take the joy and oh look at this they're fighting bye bye bye yeah

[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.500]
this is what they really love and i noticed that when a lot of the

[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.880]
carers would call it and immediately ingratiate themselves with a host

[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.480]
but then so that they would have more time to be allowed to say but the other

[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.120]
one you know he saw terabyte rips the old people and it's disgusting

[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.060]
one guy even called in and made this comment about um

[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.020]
when i do the disclaimer about being an old fart it doesn't necessarily mean

[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.660]
age he says that's like calling somebody a nigger but saying that uh

[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.960]
some of them are like white people or something like that what yeah

[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.440]
and it was allowed to go uh

[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.760]
and the response was well i don't really rag on old people that much steves guest

[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.960]
by the way today will be jamey swartz the nine year old being kicked out of viewpoint condos

[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.040]
who was on the today part of this part too about

[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.940]
nailed white the old parts and the prunes i keep hearing that word coming up

[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:48.180]
any afternoon prunes a lot and that thing we got in there prunes a lot or that boobs a lot

[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:53.200]
but anyway um that's the subject and it's amazing to me but it seems to me when i

[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.360]
hear that shows and i commended steve yesterday i'll do it again i think he's doing a great

[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.420]
job on that subject it's picked up national exposure it is a disgusting thing and that's the syndrome

[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.500]
we talk about so it's got nothing to do with who's nicer to old people or who's stereotypes

[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.460]
it's got to do with the reality of life here in south florida and when somebody is doing a series

[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.140]
of shows on the very subject but then would like to suggest that it's only neo who rags on the old

[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:20.340]
people then there's got to be something very wrong somewhere okay somebody isn't listening to the

[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:28.920]
sound of his own voice all right so i think you know it's easy to be lazy i'm going to be honest

[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.420]
people think well you know these guys come in here they do no preparation they don't have to read

[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.260]
the papers they don't bring up topics uh you know we had a guest yesterday and we probably won't

[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.080]
have another one for six to nine months you know Tom's always a fun guest but we don't have guest

[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.740]
basically but it's not easy to come in every day and to try to do different things and to try to

[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.920]
get people uh you know in a good mood and get them laughing especially in this time where everybody

[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:56.520]
enjoys being miserable to begin with and that's one of the reasons they resent your laughter is

[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:03.640]
because they can't stand hearing somebody having a good time absolutely too bad yeah tough

[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:10.940]
cookies okay like i said if you don't like it goodbye right now reach over to the radio find

[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:16.100]
something else put your hand somewhere else okay find something else to occupy your time

[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.980]
but don't assume that because you're going to call up Steve are you going to do this you're

[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.580]
going to do that we're going to change the show it isn't going to happen and we're not going to

[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.500]
have a lot of serious guests on the program or guest period we don't do that anymore all right

[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:36.520]
i did that for years and i finally felt embarrassment i looked back at my guest counter and i realized

[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:41.220]
i kept having the same damn people on over and over again and one of the reasons that happens this

[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:46.200]
is in New York or Los Angeles this is this is a bush leg it's a big hick town who the hell you

[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.320]
going to put on here in this town there's nobody here and that's why you wind up hearing the same

[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:56.280]
ponderous people over and over and over and over again to the point where you could just puke

[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:03.900]
when you hear their name because it's boring and the first sin in being on the year is boring the

[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:12.760]
audience okay 1033 at w i o d and i want to tell you about the armadillo cafe now trust me you don't

[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.000]
have to trust me stop by there yourself and you'll agree with me that this is one of the finest

[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:24.980]
now we don't want to be bitter ronjure 1038 at w i o d and uh it really you know the people and i

[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.180]
guess people follow the lead of the host okay because i did hear several of these people yesterday

[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:35.660]
who were playing their little amateur psychology oh and that bothers me okay because it's this arrogant

[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:41.320]
condescending kind of view of life like well i'm so uh next bird in life and i have all the answers

[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.600]
and all this other crap and like i've told you people before you don't know a god damn thing about

[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:52.060]
any of the people you hear on radio or television you don't know them and just like i keep using the

[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.240]
example of sandy patent who came across this little mistweet of the radio with sugar cookies

[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:04.900]
michael sugar cookies and all that in syphids syrupy crap and was according to most of the people

[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.960]
who worked with her in this building one of the biggest pain in the butts who ever came down

[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:14.580]
the pike in his business so it goes to show you that what you hear is not what you get okay it's a

[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:22.680]
radio show it's an act it's a stick and i hear these people going on and i know yes he's filled with

[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.040]
hate and i've studied human psychology but but but but you can be you don't know crap okay you don't

[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:36.700]
know from nothing so as i said if you're disgruntled if you're unhappy don't waste your time with this

[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.420]
show okay go to your favorite show stick with it find something else to do the rest of the day

[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:46.160]
and we'll all live happily ever after okay but don't give me this song in a dance about how we have

[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.500]
to be like Steve or we have to be because it's not going to happen it's never going to happen

[00:23:53.580 --> 00:24:00.240]
in a million years it isn't going to happen okay and it wouldn't be good for the station for it to

[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:06.620]
happen because we don't want to save this all day and for you if you're excited about hearing

[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:12.320]
the topics you know that have been done eight million times more power to you okay that's not my

[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:17.560]
cup of tea i'm not into it anymore i'm not only not into doing it on the year i'm not into even

[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:23.460]
listening to it because i've heard it all there's nothing more to be said about abortion there's

[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.360]
nothing more to be said about capital punishment there's nothing more to be said about all the other

[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:33.000]
list of trite tried and true topics did it have been on why do you think on the tv talk shows now

[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.980]
they come up with something more bizarre every day because they're burned out man they got nothing

[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:43.800]
left donny you mudwrestling in the middle of a ring with some wild women mudwrestlers whoever thought

[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.400]
they'd come to the day they'd see that but hey if like he said if that's what it takes that's what

[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:56.200]
he'll do because all the other stuff's been done eight billion times so if you enjoy the humor on

[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.620]
his show if you have a good time if you enjoy the entertainment and they're just a ton of people

[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:07.300]
out there who do great and if you don't go away i wish you a happy life i wish you no ill will okay

[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.820]
just go away we don't need you because for every one of you there'll be five or ten other people

[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:18.700]
who will discover it probably by accident or by word of mouth and they'll replace you

[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:24.320]
and will all live happily ever after but see that's a problem in his town because happy is not a

[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:33.480]
word that's supposed to be there not happily ever after miserably ever after and don't give me this

[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.080]
crap about how i generalize or how i stereotype because the fact is that all too many of the old

[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:45.480]
people of this community behave like barbarians they behave in a way that is totally socially

[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:51.760]
unacceptable okay they're driving their behavior in restaurants their rudeness the way they

[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.540]
conduct themselves on these shows i i honestly thought that w gb s had made a comeback yesterday i

[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.520]
really did because it sounded like that same old malcontent crowd again who didn't have anywhere else

[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.960]
to go and suddenly found that you know that that one share of the audience when they were on the

[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:11.940]
year doing talk when Jefferson pilot just aborted that radio station here's a station that at a

[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.360]
50,000 watt daytime signal the best signal at anywhere a radio station in the entire state and

[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:28.640]
they were doing ones ones kind of reminds me of a hundred thousand watt FM that does the same thing

[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.260]
well that's another story it sure is but i'm talking about a station with a signal like i'd be

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:39.100]
heard over all the whole two thirds of the state and they were doing ones and that was mr.

[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.820]
Collins and mr. Fowler in their infinite wisdom pretty sad commentary when you got that kind of a

[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:50.240]
facility and you can't do anything with it and you got to go and buy a successful already established

[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.680]
station in order to have a winner and of course we see what's happened to that place

[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:04.620]
during their reign okay but the rampant jealousy that exists in this community in this business

[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.560]
that's what really gets to me it's pathetic it's embarrassing and i've said this many times before

[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.940]
and i'll say it again i don't care what anybody else makes it doesn't it doesn't affect me in any way

[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.740]
you know like i told you more down he made twenty two million dollars last year that's not an inflated

[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:27.040]
figure that's accurate more power to him he made fifty two million i don't be grudging a dime of it

[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:34.520]
Larry King has made a fortune since he gave them the good con job over there at mutual okay

[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.140]
he's probably making over a million bucks a year and with with all of my negative feelings and i

[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.860]
got a lot of them about Larry and the things that he's done to people in spite of all of that i

[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.860]
don't be grudging a dime of it i hope he makes ten million because i you know people deserve it

[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:51.840]
management jerks you around enough in this business you get a chance to make it go for it

[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:59.600]
but i hope i got the message across and i hope i don't have to do it again and on those days when

[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.540]
people haven't got a show and it didn't make any difference who it is whether it was Stan on that

[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.320]
infamous day in fact i used to make the comment i wondered if he could remember and get through an

[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.560]
entire show without mentioning my name and it could never have no it never happened couldn't do it

[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.480]
just they couldn't do it like a bunch of old hands bunch of old fish wives

[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.640]
out at neil in the bar in the cacle and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.800]
well what the hell kind of a show is that is that substance is that stimulating is that entertaining

[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:34.000]
is that interesting again if it happened in an isolated case oh i guess it could be funny it could

[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.080]
be a lot of things happen for a couple of minutes but to make an entire program of it over and

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:46.740]
over again and then i heard the comment also made yesterday and i guess it was in a tongue in

[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:52.600]
cheek wave some caller about one of my listeners who came over and now listens to Steve

[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.520]
and a comment was well in spite of all the terrible things that neil used to say about me used to

[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:03.720]
and i'm sure was said tongue in cheek and humor but the amazing part of it is there were a lot of

[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.140]
things said about me before i came here on that show that were not said in humor at all no

[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.180]
i can recall the show with mr x and bob quinst one day that i heard in the car and i just

[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:20.500]
i was in shock i'm not talking just about a professional criticism or the guy shows socks or whatever

[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:26.500]
like i'm talking about the lowest the basis the most grotesque personal attack that i've ever heard and see

[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.780]
i believe in this business you have to know where to draw the line and you can have fun with

[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.580]
things and you can joke about things and if there are people who think in like galeson can't take it

[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:41.600]
that's their problem that is their problem but when you really start getting down dirty and personal

[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:47.060]
and nasty and when you don't even know what the hell you're talking about is those individuals didn't

[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:54.660]
then it's a horse of another color okay but when i came here i forgot all of that or i tempted to

[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:01.740]
and i still intend to do my best to continue one of those circumstances but that doesn't mean i'm

[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.740]
going to sit still for four hours in the old rogers bashing anytime somebody don't have a show

[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.520]
or something else useful to talk about because i thought that that audience were also

[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:18.040]
area-dite also educated also intellectual that they didn't have to stoop to that okay that they could

[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.920]
discuss all of these important things going on in the world for example the episode that took place

[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.600]
with the libyans the other day i mean you know people are some people are wondering if we're

[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.180]
going to have world war three because of that it would seem to mean maybe that would be something

[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:37.200]
that would be discussed on a topical intellectual show as opposed to oh that bird his life he's

[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.540]
disgusting he's revolting and i used to love the listening deal but i just i can't anymore it's

[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.660]
the what does he do a ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba one after another after

[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.500]
another odd nauseam disgusting revolting wrote test

[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.380]
and if i sound a little pissed this morning i am boy i'm foaming at them out

[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.080]
because i'm getting tired of it this show is not a subject of conversation on any other show on

[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.240]
this radio station they want to talk about us any other stations that's great we can make sure

[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.140]
they give the frequency and the time that we're on okay and make some mention the name a lot of

[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.820]
times but there's still a lot of people don't know where we are yet a lot of them

[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:20.380]
hmm i ran into some young lady the other day she said oh but he never saw before in my life

[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.800]
she said uh love your show my husband turned me on to your show and he's really upset he can't find

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.400]
where you are don't know where you are and i had a teller well there hasn't been a word about it

[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:36.140]
outside the radio station it hasn't been one word true that's true someday there will be i'm sure

[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.520]
there really if we live long enough there will be good but i'm going to get this all out of my

[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.720]
system today anyway because i'm just in a surly squirrelly mood about that stuff you know

[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.900]
and i think we've been very you know again i want to pet myself in the back but i think basically

[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.300]
we've tried very hard to promote the other shows on this station there isn't a day that goes by that

[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.260]
we don't give many many promos for steven what the guests are and yeah we'll have a little fun

[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:05.520]
with it from time to time but not in a venomous way i hope he gets a six or a seven in the next

[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:12.460]
i hope mike gets an eight and i hope we get a nine absolutely okay i hope sports talk gets a 20

[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:19.780]
what are we here that's great that's what it's all about but this very clever manipulation it goes

[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.800]
on to orchestrate something i mean if you don't want to hear it all you got to say hey we're not

[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.460]
going to talk about it that's all that's what i do people call in want to rip mike you know

[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.700]
like mike showed don't listen to it he don't need to he's got more listeners than anybody in the

[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.620]
market in the morning he's got more than he can handle okay he doesn't need you

[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.440]
same with the show but here that kind of behavior yesterday with that audience man and just

[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:48.460]
bunch of butt kissing butt sucking butt licking douchebags that are just want to

[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:53.740]
ingratiate themselves for the great opportunity of just ripping and shredding and tearing and

[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.940]
and again jealousy okay and i got news for i hate to break the news for this show is going to be

[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:04.740]
real successful on this station just like it was on wins and just like it was on zeta just like

[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:13.420]
it was on w and w s real successful even without some of those who i'm sure turn the radio off 15

[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:18.540]
20 minutes ago didn't they no they didn't see that's what the story come on every one of them is

[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:24.820]
listening that's what i'm so they must go away masochists folks there's another talk show on it

[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:29.880]
this time it does talk exactly every day the sweetest most wonderful lady just ask roger he'll tell

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:36.280]
she is the sweetest lady in the history of mankind that's saying what do you give it a try

seven ninety on the a m dial wol d all right check it out believe me try it you'll like it i love it

[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.100]
and if you have trouble sleeping man you want a quick nap in the middle of the day time there's

[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.880]
nothing better anywhere absolutely oh we're not going to take another break this all right oh

[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.740]
fantastic because i'm really full of it today i mean full of it i'm usually full of it but more

[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:16.520]
so today than ever because it gets pretty stinking ponderous you know what i'm saying

[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:22.120]
that every time you turn on the radio people are orchestrating like like and i didn't hear it but

[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.980]
you told me about that show with ernie and then johnny dark gave me one version and we had all this

[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:33.140]
so but the bottom line is neo roger is not a topic for a talk show any more than ernie sochen is

[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:43.980]
a topic for a talk show maybe concentration camps are a topic but see that's the difference i

[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.020]
mean to have a little fun with somebody as a throwawayer for a couple of minutes that's one thing

[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.800]
to be like the band leader and to be whipping and flagulating the audience in on a one-hand saying

[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.960]
oh don't do it don't do it but let him go on for ten minutes and ripping and slashing and tearing and

[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:06.220]
that's that's just crap is what it is unadulterated pure crap so let me again and i thought we had

[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:10.300]
already said a lot of this let me say it again we're not going to be doing heavy topics

[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:16.040]
we're not going to change the show for steve his listeners or anybody else it's going to be just

[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.800]
what it has been for the last two years with usually a much lower stress level i don't know i'm

[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.040]
saying it because my head's about ready to blow off but with a lower stress level and like

[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.000]
livable you know and people want to have a good time and enjoy some of the stuff we play in the

[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.340]
stuff we talk about we're not going to be discussing brain surgery we're not going to solve the

[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:39.060]
problems of the world on occasion we'll do something worthwhile like raising all of that money

[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:45.120]
for chameleus house or anything else worthwhile it comes along we'll do our best and that's it

[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:50.280]
this program is not the answer to the problems of the universe it's a radio show

[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:56.280]
and i hate to break the news to you the other programs aren't the answer to the problems of the

[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:02.840]
universe either even though some people in their own ego maniacal uh mines may believe it

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.580]
they're wrong they're absolutely wrong

[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.100]
there reminds me of that mike seagull stirrace to tell you know after we got the um

[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.420]
and it was mostly his campaign he deserved the call the local measured servicing

[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.060]
defeated with a petition right southern bell

[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.000]
so now we're being tackled next the next seriously the next night he came on he was so

[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.960]
and of course this is a man totally humorless totally without any sense of humor

[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:34.500]
takes himself a thousand times too seriously he used to do six to eight of w snooze before i came on

[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:41.020]
and he came on that night to announce and he was breakfast flushed with his own success and we

[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.280]
we got the we beat the phone company and now the next we're going to solve the problems of the

[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.780]
medical problem and then we're going to work out the problems of the legal profession and

[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.880]
and he meant that that was the frightening part he wasn't joking he was serious

[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.420]
i mean now that he had pulled off this tremendous coup he was now going to pray and again i

[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.660]
i guess that's fine if you're one of those people who really want who is a crusader that's great

[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:05.280]
i used to do a lot of that stuff too until i realized i was talking to myself

[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:12.820]
like that show with dr tyson on cocaine hello doctor i'm taking selfie

[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.220]
that's what this town is all about so don't give me all this crap oh you know what go people

[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:25.000]
the bottom line is the majority of you who don't like me or don't like this show our bigots why

[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.980]
did you just admit it okay because i heard some of that stuff in there yesterday too and you

[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.920]
know something i couldn't give a good god damn less if you're home of phobic then i'd look in

[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.620]
the mirror because you probably got a problem with yourself okay because what i do in none of your

[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.020]
business all right what anybody else does as long as they're not hurting anybody it's not in your

[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:49.560]
business so don't try to intellectualize your bigotry in fact some of the mouth breathers who

[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:56.180]
just worded out you know at least they're more intellectually honest than the pseudo intellectuals

[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:01.040]
who come on and are giving us instructions and amateurs psychology and telling us how we should

[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:08.580]
be living and at least your normal and blah blah blah blah stick it up your butt okay you morons

[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:14.300]
don't start feeding me all this pseudo intellectual crap because that's all it is you just a bunch of

[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:22.100]
bigots and you just can't believe you just can't handle the fact that here's this this middle

[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:29.620]
aged bald aging fat faggot who's on the air in Miami saying any god damn thing that he wants who's

[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.560]
been so successful and has got the top ratings in the market and just run circles around anybody

[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:42.840]
else on the air you can't stand that can you it drives you crazy including some of the people

[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:52.360]
at another station i want to mention wold do i all guess i just did anyway let me just mention this

[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:58.300]
because we promised Joe Johnson that we would mention this is great this is weird i like this yogurt

[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.320]
or burst i thought for a minute i thought it said yogurt or bus

[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.460]
with wio they were almost at the end of the first traumatic hour here

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.180]
and every line's lit no now somebody dropped off and they've expired when i went into that last

[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:20.500]
little burst they put it out so anyway that's the bottom line oh look at that next got those

[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.900]
bizarre bifocals on today doesn't he look really a pseudo intellectual today

[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:29.800]
first what is that all the procedure yeah correct i got to get that pseudo intellectual crowd

[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.060]
now i'm serious i have seldom heard and i've heard a whole bunch of those shows and a lot of them

[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:41.500]
by the way have been on this station thankfully however mostly before we came here and i

[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:47.200]
didn't really think i'd hear it again but yesterday's was one of the all-time greats it was

[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:54.140]
really incredible because it just never stopped i mean i would say the three out of every four calls

[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.360]
basically were the same thing and they kept saying that this show all we did was the same thing

[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.400]
every day and each one of them was saying the same thing including the ones who were bashing you

[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:09.900]
they don't like you tough goodbye he's not going anywhere all right he's not leaving

[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:16.100]
and i'm not going anywhere i'm not leaving okay so i know this is a tremendous shock to your system

[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:20.180]
and you're going to have to make a tremendous adjustment in your lives but that's the way it goes

[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:26.500]
that's the way the cookie crumbles okay it is just a radio show and that bag that was held on she

[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.740]
was held on through two breaks through a newscast she's on for a half an hour and a grand she was a

[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:36.300]
little bit of fun but she ain't fooling me i know exactly where she's coming from and who's pulling

[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:42.440]
her wheels okay i know what that call was all about i'm not going to do something about this yeah

[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.980]
do something about it turn the dial okay save yourself a lot of grief because nothing's going to

[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.620]
change oh she's going to do something about it yeah she's going to do something about it like

[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.180]
stick her left arm all the way where the moon don't shine okay up to her throat she can tickle her

[00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:04.020]
tonsils all right but i have never heard such a whining bunch of cry babies in all my life as

[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:11.340]
i heard yesterday afternoon who just look and it's always the same core of people who sees they

[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:16.360]
just see the opening there and they seize any opportunity to keep repeating the same old crap

[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.480]
over and over again and as you say the sad part the part that is the most bizarre the most

[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:26.520]
ironic is the baking quote chapter and verse of every word that is said they are all listening

[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:33.880]
right now as i speak and getting duly indignant and outraged and great i'm glad we provide you a

[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:39.480]
service thank god that we're here okay what the hell would you do if i ever disappear you

[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:46.800]
wouldn't know whether to scream or eat your kid about that okay oh so that wraps up our first

[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:52.500]
traumatic our field is like bob lancer tonight one of those long emotional monologues

[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.620]
the sky is falling the sky is falling and then every 90 year old old fart would be on the

[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:05.380]
phone are you right you right i get my my polo then the becoming the phone is they were making

[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.400]
guttural sounds with bob and but anyway i've seen it all you know and uh

[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.140]
gale brightest any by now she's a butch-tapper image a little bit she's going to really do a tremendous

[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:19.760]
job with a new well she had a little problem i'm gonna show a couple of weeks ago but uh i don't

[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.660]
think she's going to be interfering in anybody's life at any time ever as a matter of fact she's

[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.360]
got the eleven o'clock news and we'll come back with our number two at eleven o' five steve with

[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.780]
jenny swartz and part two of that condo hysteria at viewpoint condos that's a two this afternoon on

[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.940]
six ten w i o d okay now listen to gale is still listening in the newsroom gale we want you to

[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:45.480]
have a good day it's eleven o' six at w i o d we're back for a second hour here on a wonderful

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.180]
Thursday everybody is happy and i just heard a incredible sandy paton stir which we're not

[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:55.860]
gonna repeat on the air nor will we divulge the source of the story but it was really incredible

[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.160]
anyway moving right along let's see this somebody expired in brower during the news break

[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:04.800]
which is fine because we haven't taken any calls yet and may not and the book disappeared too good

[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:13.120]
okay five two four w i o d in brower there it goes and the book a two seven eight nine four six three

[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:19.540]
two seven eight w i o d and we'll start and and let me just say this i'm gonna preface it right now

[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:24.580]
this is gonna be a uh cane bashing show if you think we're gonna do that you're crazy because i'll

[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:29.020]
hang up on you so fast you won't know what hits you we don't do that on this show and we shouldn't

[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:34.200]
be doing it on the station but as i said at great length unfortunately there are sometimes people

[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:39.700]
come in they really have nothing to talk about and it's very easy show i guess to uh you know

[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.340]
orchestrate let's rip niel and the bird for four hours you know which is basically what happened

[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.260]
here yesterday until i called and then all of a sudden there was kind of a change of heart

[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.900]
of a little bit later to the call uh where are we going Miami hello hello niel how are you great

[00:43:53.900 --> 00:44:00.140]
gug and glad how you doing buddy cousin i like that you like that um you know that what really

[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:06.320]
amazes me about these people niel is and you really hit it right on the head is all it is is a radio show

[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.520]
i mean what what is everybody getting so they got the easiest job in the world they got to sit at

[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.660]
home and listen if they don't like it hey cruise over the winds hit the quam jam with merlin

[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:23.720]
jam with quam that's it hey listen they might pick up on it you might get some early jam with quam

[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:29.540]
that's not too bad you know i mean what's so hard and all they do i mean these people are nothing but

[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:34.920]
hypocritical self-righteous douchebag yeah and then they think they think they will amaze me as they'll

[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:40.700]
call one host and they'll tinkle all over them and rip somebody else then like in a half hour later

[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:45.000]
and i've actually heard this half hour later you hear them on the show of the person that they

[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.740]
were ripping doing just the opposite because they want to hear the sound of their own voice on the

[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.900]
radio yeah they've got like an incredible yearning to listen to a show you're in

[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.920]
yeah you know what i mean yeah they yearn to listen to something they hate it doesn't make sense

[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.500]
well good luck to them sir trust me they're all out there everyone even signs listen to you right now

[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:07.640]
i want to run a topic by you for the hell of it okay David Brinkley yeah okay i mean i'm not

[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.880]
going to usually bash the older people but this guy is like he deserves to be off the air wouldn't

[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.960]
well david died ten years ago but he's still you know considering that he's still doing pretty well

[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:21.260]
i like i like david brinkley but quite frankly you're right he's he ought to be he seems a little

[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.320]
female he ought to be in retirement counting his money and having a good time but he just he's

[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:30.500]
like martin aggransky that martin was on until his last tooth fell out and then they finally sent

[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.760]
martin out to the pastor you know i was watching the guy during the elections and uh i'm getting

[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:40.440]
like fog around my eyes watching him and his eyes are red and he's blanking and his skin's washed out

[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.920]
well they're gonna they're gonna uh NBC is looks terrible NBC's gonna hire back they're gonna

[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.840]
put him on with michael gillin and uh water chronis and they'll have winking blinkin and nod

[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.060]
together again man some bull listen have a wonderful day and we'll tell you a good life all right we'll

[00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:57.040]
tell david you said hi take care okay i like david brinkley but he's right david should have

[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:03.040]
retired a few years ago there's it's like in baseball you know stand musil hung around too long

[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:09.020]
Ted Williams knew when to quit all right he quit when he was on top stand musil hung around too

[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.600]
long it was embarrassing because it was a shadow of his former self and he just it was became

[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.520]
pathetic watching a formerly great player trying to go out there and hit he just couldn't do it

[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.880]
and i see so there are some you know like do caucus he's not running again for governor he knows

[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.420]
he's a bomb and uh he realized he made an absolute fool out of himself and uh he's you know he's not

[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.900]
gonna run for president again he just has to say that as a good excuse for why he's not running

[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:35.040]
for governor again probably because he's afraid he's gonna lose anyway although he did carry

[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:42.740]
Massachusetts not by a lot oh we have a radio celebrity on seven hello Neil yes how you doing

[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:50.320]
okay it's mark marzli hey mark i got a classic old bag story for you i mean this one we'll put

[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:58.480]
blue hair on your chest right to president uh my any hello hello my daughter yes okay like uh

[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.040]
if you invite somebody to your house oh you buy somebody into your house and you find that you

[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.920]
don't like them that you dislike them would you invite them back again no no would you invite them

[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.720]
back and tell them how much you dislike them no why didn't all the people just turn the radio on

[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.520]
a different side i thought i'd said it maybe i somehow long line misted but no but you know what i'm

[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.200]
saying now i see the bottom line is they love it but they don't want to admit it see they love

[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.320]
it in a perverse way because they love to hate or whatever kick it is that they just there's

[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.640]
something there that they can't live without but they don't want to admit that so they have to

[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:34.180]
keep going through this big herang and they they feel once they do that it lets them off the hook

[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.520]
you know it's it's almost like a guilt trip but as long as they say that they hate me then it makes

[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:42.100]
them feel better and it's some kind of an excuse for them listening they could sleep better in my

[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.900]
pro it's like this the bag that Steve had on for a half hour yesterday was going on about well she

[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:52.100]
has to do a research you know yeah she's doing research we got a research with anyway uh i got a problem

[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:57.340]
i do my problem is i can't turn it off mm-hmm because i like it so i want to tell you so you

[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:04.980]
have a good question but okay bye it is a phenomenon they they hate you they despise me more

[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.900]
well you know i i um had this interview the fact the uh AP photographer the young lady was in here

[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.700]
this morning and they did a thing with some talk host around the country because this movie is

[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:19.420]
coming out mm-hmm talk radio which i thought was the topic of yesterday's show but nobody has seen it

[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.500]
but anyway and she was asking me all these different questions she was very nice from the Dallas

[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:29.760]
newspaper and um and i told her i said that you know there are the ones who hate you the most are

[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.120]
likely to be there every single day they're the most loyal listener and we just shocked you

[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:39.300]
couldn't understand that we don't understand it either but it's true it's a fact now who whose

[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:44.560]
message is this there was only a handful of anti-neil and bird call is that your message because

[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.100]
i heard the entire program and if you're going to try to sell me that uh you can go sell a Brooklyn

[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:54.200]
bridge to my Disney okay because you're dreaming i heard every single call on the entire show

[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:59.260]
from the time i went yeah a little yeah i think more like the john homeschool

[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:07.760]
this man is just dreaming it's uh 18 past 11 at w-i-o-d for waterdale hello hi how you doing Neil

[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:56.680]
to talk about ancd's operation and do something useful okay but get out of my life while you miserable

[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:02.500]
nasty old farts or is it prunes i forget it i don't want to steal anybody else's material okay we

[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:13.000]
do have an open-line in date if you move quickly now 751 w-i-o-d 751-9463 anti something on four well

[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.740]
that's good hello hello yes who is this who are you calling i'm calling my disney oh well this

[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:24.280]
is not my disney this is near Rogers well i certainly don't want to speak with Neil Rogers

[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:29.600]
well that's great calling my disney to complain about you oh in other words you can't just turn it off

[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:36.760]
you have to make it complaint is that what you're saying i have it said on w-i-o-d to make me up in

[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:42.440]
the morning let me say this i know that that that's that's wonderful that's wonderful but it

[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.200]
ten o'clock if you don't like this show you can change the dial we are going to substitute another

[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:51.220]
program of your choice it's not like it's not no we're not it's not like going into a Chinese

[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:59.320]
restaurant one from column a are entirely disgusting absolutely that's right you know something let

[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:05.420]
let me make you an invitation okay to go away no no you you're not listening though you said

[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.600]
i wasn't listening to you let oh there she goes she just another wonderful and that that was

[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:15.580]
that was the quintessential call all four hours of that yesterday afternoon okay now you can go

[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:20.200]
ahead and call my disney but i got news for you he ain't going to take the call he's not going to

[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.680]
bother with you bill wise might take the call but unlikely that probably take a message they're

[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.140]
not interested lady don't you understand if you enjoy mic in the morning great he's got an

[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:34.620]
enormous audience as i said before but this i this frozen dial syndrome doesn't sell okay just

[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:41.080]
doesn't play the idea that you set the dial you don't set a radio dial like you set a clock

[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:46.420]
you don't you know like a big clock you have one of those big old time clocks and you set them

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:50.380]
with a little you don't have to set your radio i know it comes in the shot but you can just reach

[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:54.800]
over and turn that dial and twist it all around or twist whatever you want ma'am okay

[00:51:55.540 --> 00:52:00.560]
so i think is really what your problem is that's what i love now why would some moron be calling

[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:06.080]
for mic disney on a talk show okay shouldn't that be very obvious to you man that by calling the

[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.640]
talk show you're not going to get to the general manager at anybody in management okay

[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:17.580]
so you can take your complaint and you can stick it where the moondone shine okay lady go away

[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:23.880]
and don't give me this pretend you know she's obviously listening oh yeah wow but did you know

[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.120]
there's another hit and run artist too she couldn't handle it because she had no comeback when i

[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.960]
asked her why it is that she couldn't change the state no no we've had this before that is not

[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.620]
an acceptable solution did you notice that is no solution you can change the station oh see that's

[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:40.920]
that's the argument they have got to use for the fact you know to cover up the fact that they're

[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:46.440]
so embarrassing i mean can you can you ever imagine you know flip it across on the cable

[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:52.020]
on tv coming across the show and of course let's face it every day there are hundreds of shows

[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:56.960]
that you just despised if you would never watch but instead of continuing to flip the dial

[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:08.080]
stopping picking up the phone getting the phone number making the effort to call in and tell them

[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.800]
i don't like that show i want you to take it away i want you to put something on that i like

[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.520]
that's what it is i would tell you the men and the white coats would be at your door is so fast

[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.620]
that you would know whether to scream or reach your key to you know what i'm saying mobile

[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.340]
is this a car phone or is this a joke no this is a mobile okay that's what i thought i said

[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:36.160]
how you're doing is it real yeah first of all i like to say god forbid people if you don't like

[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:42.640]
the show don't call don't listen second of all i like to have a great show i love the bird i love

[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:49.300]
his laugh great okay another thing i like to say is that the cute big car wash over there on

[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:57.620]
Hollywood for for one yard bunch of dish bags their rude i like what's that great call all right

[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:05.600]
have a nice day and a good life and a good time 23 past 11 a w idea interrupted myself in mid-sentence

[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.200]
because i have that mobile phone syndrome you know i see car phone on there and i don't want these

[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.080]
poor suckers to have to run up a big bill or hang up or you know i did just went right to that it

[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:19.300]
was worth it though he's a good guy just a little overwrought they probably ripped his uh

[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:25.940]
car antenna off or something minor like that or his phone antenna anyway this Sunday boy a lot of

[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:31.680]
people gonna be out there and love new from your phony company it's yelling and it's cheaper than calling

[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.560]

after seven p.m a three-minute yell from sunrise over to tamrak costs only a dollar but you may

[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:04.140]
have trouble getting through during peak yelling hours

[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:15.880]

[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:28.000]
of four which is mind-boggling for talk show and Alan if he had like four people under a hungry

[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.800]
listening to a show as a miracle so it it goes to show you need degree to which all the

[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:37.320]
vultures out there perceive this as an opportunity to rip me so and i hear here was the one kid

[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:40.640]
trolling for boys on either so let's get it never happen it's never happening never gonna happen

[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.940]
and anything that's in the humor there are those who would like to twist and manipulate only

[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:48.580]
because of their terminal homophobia and their bigotry and they're not fooling anybody intelligent

[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.760]
i mean when the only people they can fool are the ones who have never even heard the show

[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:56.420]
then what does that tell you and i'm not an idiot i just finished my first semester of college

they can't oh i know and i love the laugh go ahead and put up okay you guys have a good day bye bye

[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:27.700]
1131 at w1 out d we have a couple of open lines now a little crisis here on the show one in day

[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:36.040]
and one in brown we have uh no date i guess seven to five one nine four six three should give them a

[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:40.980]
lot more slowly so that those intelligent people like the sooner we'd like to a woman new ones

[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:46.400]
mic disney because she wants to complain about my show because we're gonna take this show off and

[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:56.100]
put something on the chelice okay dropped it hmm for i'll tell you we have just it it's like

[00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:00.200]
you know we went along there at fm and we had you know our moments here i mean it was not a better

[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.320]
roses especially last few months working for those people over there but the car is by and large

[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:10.300]
we didn't have nearly as much of this am i right i mean not nearly as much of this most of the people

[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:15.580]
seem pretty happy you know pretty happy campers yeah but when you get back on a m again one of the

[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:23.220]
uh liabillonies is you have these frozen dial a m old farts but you can't turn the dial because

[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:28.920]
the dentures keep getting in the way well obviously something is preventing it because not a

[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.320]
solution although we don't want to bash those old people because we don't want to get a reputation

[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.480]
i don't forget steve is going to be a doing condo kid part two this afternoon i just mentioned that

[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:41.940]
in passing even though he does not attack prunes or old farts or people who are barbaric in their

[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.260]
behavior and treat young people like cattle he does not do that eleven thirty two

[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:53.060]
i just can't believe it i just can't believe it i thought we were given them a solution

[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:58.040]
changed the channel but obviously that doesn't hold no don't you understand her dial is set

[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:03.720]
it doesn't work her dial is set on six ten she gets up to it so therefore whenever you wake up

[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:08.500]
you i don't think she actually moves i think the bed is right next to the phone i forgot you

[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.560]
i don't think she can move far enough to reach the radio dial it is probably the problem and now in

[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.680]
that case i we do have a crisis i do understand for those of you who've done now what we might do is

[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.580]
we might send spike on spike just kind of hangs out he not doing too much and we'll send him out to the

[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:29.060]
homes of people who cannot reach their radio is to change the dial create and he will personally lock

[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:34.700]
it in any other station of your choice only problem is uh he's going to have to come back in the

[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:40.020]
morning because then you want to hear mike yeah so he'll come back around five fifteen

[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:46.740]
and he'll have it a paper out you know and he'll make the rounds and he'll just change your dial

[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:51.200]
and everything will be fine okay you expect to see him two three times and maybe give him a

[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.420]
little lunch on toyota of hollywood steven are going to be there a week from the Saturday that

[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:02.320]

[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:20.880]
the dial is stock i i find it's very easy to get the dial on stock which is usually take a cup

[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.400]
of uh... prun juice yeah uh... two and a half of metamusell just throw it up room good you drink it

[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.140]
that moves you and you have to run away from the radio you have to listen to what's going

[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.780]
i want to tell you something that you may have just done her the greatest

[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:38.020]
to be a senator because i don't think she's had a bm in at least twenty years okay that's probably

[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:43.800]
what it is you get very uptight when you have that pressure that pressure is terrible yeah it'll get to

[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.080]
him it's like having an excendrary stomach in your uh... in test and that's what it is that's

[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:54.680]

eleven thirty eight twenty two before noon by the way speaking to soap operas and i've been forgetting

[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.360]
to mention this a roman did another public service for me because by

[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.160]
that name which made me think of days of our lives

[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.700]
holly is back on the guiding light now that doesn't mean anything to anybody except those of us

[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:54.480]
who are ancient okay holly was one of the characters in the early years for many years she was

[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.460]
ed bowler's girlfriend okay i think they were married at one time i don't remember

[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:04.860]
how it powers girlfriend all you know it born no well anyway uh... and all of a sudden they brought

[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:09.820]
the same actress back she's been off that show for years and years did you ever watch guiding light

[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:16.020]

[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:21.260]
little tv in here i'm telling you to enrich your life tremendously but anyway uh... holly was one of

[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:25.680]
the no see i used to when i was in high school i lived right up the block from the school so i'd

[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.640]
come home every day for lunch at about twelve thirty and that was when the soap operas were all fifteen

[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.800]
minutes and that's a long time ago okay that's almost thirty years ago she looks pretty good for

[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.440]
uh... you know middle-aged lady okay she got to be in her fifties easy and um... she's back

[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:48.400]
wow and it's so rare that they bring back the same actor or actress in you know in a role she came

[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:54.360]
back to town you know that's a storyline and it's shocking but you're obviously very

[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.580]

but that that evidently is part of the reason that we will not be hearing again from mr fallor

[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:52.340]
on the show is that he's now going to be the competition you know i saw a was over a gtr yesterday

[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.940]
because you don't contribute anything to the show i was cackel like a hyena and a moron you never

[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:58.240]
Glenn close or not all right that's i'm very good she's in guiding light okay and that's one of the

[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.580]
things they do to try to get you know how competitive that's become now to try to get big numbers

[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.860]
i see good the big battle air is general hospital in fact didn't general hospital have rick spring

time ago he was on that show well you just you know i don't even watch him here okay i'm not i'm not

[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.400]
i watch i watch guiding light on the days when alan michael is on a show because he's kind of an

[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:30.260]
interesting guy but you know but i don't really watch so same or used to years ago when i worked

[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.920]

michael's was on that show no alan michael alan michael so gay alan michael's isn't on any

[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:45.940]
show and that's a way it ought to be okay well you're in an area new show called crank for your life

[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.600]
i don't know soap opera so you're in an area you're right i had nothing about this area so i

[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.560]
shouldn't challenge okay so so see the audience you know nothing about sports you dislike most

[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:58.920]
sports you know nothing about soaps you did not see the Karen Carpenter stir it up i'm a mess

[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.560]
you're a wreck you're a wreck you really are you need to start the reorganizing your whole life just

[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:06.900]
to satisfy that segment of the audience out there that hates your guts boy do they ever

[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:11.300]
boy and the thing about that they despise the most is that a lot of the stuff i say isn't funny at

[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:18.780]
all i mean you continue to see there you go cackling hysterically well and if they don't like it

[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:24.740]
they can drop dead okay that's what he did that's him he can't help himself all right he was born

[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.740]
with a little somewhere up in his brain there's a little thing and he just keeps cackling

[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.660]
can see you know there was a little egg in the family many years ago i don't want to get young

[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:37.560]
knee allowed to have to play the whole thing but when the egg hatch there was a little mental

[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.420]
thing there that had to do with cackling and gurgling sounds and well i don't know you're funny to

[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:46.520]
me i don't know that i don't think i should apologize even though i'm a terrible guy and i hate

[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:53.220]
full person oh yeah oh boy does that give me when they start that that psychoanalysis man when

[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:58.260]
they starting with that amateur analization of everybody and everything and they've got any

[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.260]
idea what they're talking about and of course when we were at zeta and on those rare opportunities

[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:06.120]
when i would tune in and amazingly enough most of the time when i would tune in the afternoon here

[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:11.020]
i was the subject of conversation even when they were guests i'd be the conversation and i

[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.840]
would keep hearing steve saying oh you know he's such a non-happy person he doesn't have any

[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:22.080]
life and about and except for a casual meeting at a chinese restaurant a couple of years ago

[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.500]
standing i were up there and steve and his wife were there except for that i hadn't seen this man

[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:33.240]
in years or had any contact with him and he had somehow he knew that i was this terrible unhappy

[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.900]

there will be a lot of pressing going on in the building and we'll get you back to a normal side

[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:39.400]
but she's just emaciated and i know her mom listens and is very concerned about her yeah and

[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:44.840]
justifiably so she is just a shadow we've only been here a couple of months she's a shadow

[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:11.840]
i was at pompinolestine i love betting on the harness uh race and i have six to five shot with

[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.820]
bruise ranger on the rail were you there last night yeah i had the horse too and he got locked in

[01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:20.360]
behind a dead horse what about that that's racing what was he waiting for to go past that horse

[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.380]
well first of all if he pulled he wasn't gonna get past the horse anyway i mean i would like to

[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.720]
have seen him pull because i had to one horse too but um he didn't have the horse to get out

[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.260]
that's the reason he didn't pull in the backstretch he'd have been out in the air he'd have been

[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:36.620]
right where he finished anyway nowhere but the race went in 59 and one and the one horse if you

[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:40.880]
noticed the two was the horse didn't have much of a driver but he got to lead and if you if you

[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.840]
look at his lines about i don't want to board the audience but he was the best in the race and he

[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:50.600]
paid a hell of a price and we got we got sucked in there on a stiff yeah i get it's true and if you

[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.020]
notice that one horse i don't want to sound like i've got it in my brain but he only one one

[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:57.780]
one horse one race in his life oh yeah they were they were all dogs but the reason we all got

[01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:02.300]
sucked into it is because McDonald had been driving it and now Bruce Ranger was on it but Bruce

[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:07.600]
has had a rough couple of days yeah okay but he'll be he'll be back why feel a little better about it

hey listen misery loves company we all plunged our brains out and tonight will be another night

[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.780]
okay okay

[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:21.960]
he did feel better now he does feel better and no i didn't have the same horse and uh he got locked

[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:26.540]
in behind a dead horse but if like i said if he'd have pulled forget it uh it had been all over

[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:33.020]

is reading a book based on a hit song don't worry me happy do they give the name of it

[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:48.060]
no but what i think is going to happen is now when you see the commercials on channel four they're

[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:55.780]
going to offer the book with it because people understand their little stupid hey listen i want

[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:59.200]
to tell you the best way you know the there are all different versions of the spot and there are

[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.120]
a few different ones but the the main spot where Betty White is in there and all is there

[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:11.080]
the fun way to do that is mute the TV turn the sound down and watch it with the sound off and

[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.280]
you will you will swear that you've lost your mind you'll swear that you've gone you know on a

[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:26.760]
single person that they've had and they all mouse the words to the song yeah that's the one yeah

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:31.540]
that's the one oh yeah do you mean you've only seen it once that's the first time i saw it

[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:34.640]
well you must be living a real shelter like i see it when the set isn't even on

[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:40.180]

[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.580]
that the guy and the girl on their tiny what's coming on at night that's just this week

[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:58.540]
but oh that's just this week yeah they probably are a little upset that they have to stay so

[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:05.720]
late and do that yeah just like the people on the news they'd have to come back at two 30 in the

[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.420]
morning and do the news over again yeah yeah we're like so many people praying it for in the

[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:14.440]
morning i couldn't believe they were still marching and they won't let him do any updates either

[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.000]
they make him read the same damn stinkin old news that they read at 11 30 and they're pretty

[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.680]
picked as Sally said she's gonna uh revolt about it and make the same uh flow Sally is pretty

[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:27.600]
holding out that you know can i have to use some advice new yes sir this is the show for advice

[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.740]
and psychological counseling and amateur psychology you came to the right show people that

[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:36.720]
i tend to meet life that i respect a lot i'm a young guy yeah i've always said to me that

[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:41.520]
that people in this life or in this world really aren't worth you know they're not worth

[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:48.800]
getting upset about or they're they're not worth having uh problems with it do you find that to be true

[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:54.540]
i don't i don't understand me you can make that blanket statement but in other words if you're

[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:58.520]
going to worry about what do the people think that's definitely true to how with other people if

[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.320]
they don't like you tell them to drop right on just don't worry don't live your life for other

[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:07.720]
people right trust me and the problem that's piece of amateur psychology i can give you thank you

[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:12.600]
and the problem that i think when people are calling any complaining about your show if they don't

[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:16.880]
have a problem with you they really have a problem with themselves that is correct very very unhappy

[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:22.420]
people in their life very unhappy their lives are so unfulfilled and there's really nothing exciting

[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:28.920]
going on that they have to uh become like these honest listeners and get involved in something

[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:32.460]
they have no control yeah we have somebody in a building i'm not going to mention her name but we

at the Viewpoint Condo's, the update is coming up this afternoon and they're having a big

[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:42.540]
meeting on it tonight. Hopefully we'll resolve some of this. And put an end to this barbaric

[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:46.220]
behavior. Okay, Miami, hello. Hey Neil, how you doing?

[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.440]
Great. Hello, Glenn. Hi. I just want to tell you a true horse story that happened a couple

[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:53.260]
of years ago. You remember Youngcrasse Raceway? Have you ever been up there? Yeah, I've been there.

[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.760]
All right, there's a horse up there that goes back 1970. The horse's name is Captain Dean.

[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:02.480]
Dellens goes driving him in the stretch. My friends got about $100 on the nose to win.

[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.640]
The horse comes to within, I'm going to say a hundred yards or maybe a hundred feet

[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.000]
of the finish line and dies dropped dead. Yeah. All right. I've seen that. It happened. I was with

[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.900]
the guy next day. Now if you remember in the older days before they had to computerize

[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:21.280]
totes, they used to have wind plays and show windows, $50. Yeah, you have to go to one window.

[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:27.400]
He goes to the window to the next race. He's really destroyed. He says, I want $100 to win on the

[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.180]
four. The guy looks at me and says to win, he says no to live.

[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:38.320]
True story. I got news for I've been on a few including a couple last night. I don't think they made it.

[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.200]
Well, they're still running, right? Yeah. He also said to me very famous words. I'm going to the

[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.820]
track today. I said, good luck. I hope you win. He says, not I just want to break out even. I could

[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:53.260]
use the money. Yeah. Very well put. Have a good lunch. I'm at a material and enjoy. Have a great

[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:58.280]
life. 11 past noon at W.I.D. All right, here comes the moment ladies and gentlemen that

[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.240]
have been waiting for all of your lives. Probably a lot of people eating lunch now. Sure.

[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:05.360]
Sure. And lunch is not complete without your teeth and a glass.

[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:22.220]
Maybe another tablet. That was pretty good for a start. Maybe a two tablet.

[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:28.240]
Okay. Now this is for those of you shleppers out there that can't even afford your own

[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.680]
effort. And what we're going to do every day is a public service of W.I.O.D. We're going to be

[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.040]
dropping these tablets in a fizzing glass. And if you hold your teeth close to the radio

[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:44.020]
by the end of 30 seconds, man, they will be like whisker clean. Okay. Trust me. Here we go.

[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:46.740]
Nothing.

[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:56.320]
Oh, does that smell good? You know what smells like peppermint? Does it? Is this peppermint

[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:00.760]
flavorment, effort and yeah? Boy, that's good enough to drink. Want some rich?

[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:07.020]
Well, I'm telling you, if this does to your insides, what a cadoodie or teeth man,

[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.220]
this is better than a barium animal, isn't it? Wow. 1239 at W.I.O.D. here's good old Chuckie

yesterday. I knew you're going to say that, but let me just say this to you. You know,

[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:25.780]
we shouldn't have to be defended because the entire discussion shouldn't take place in the first

[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:30.340]
place. Really? I'm going to I'm going to invent some kind of electronic contraption that

[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:35.080]
will wipe W.I.O.D. off the dial for these old douche nozzles.

[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.320]
Well, evidently, they need some help because they just can't quite reach that radio boy.

[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:46.860]
They're trying desperately, but they just can't quite reach that darn. Yeah, it's like interference

[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.640]
from their wheelchairs or something. Yeah, from their walkers. Yeah, well, Neil anyway, listen,

[01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:54.840]
I'll give you my phone number when you worry. Call me. I'll make you happy. Okay, Chuckie. Good

[01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.160]
like. Okay, well, 1239 at W.I.O.D. there's no way. Oh boy, look at this speaking of chronic.

[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:07.360]
Hello. Eddie, hang up. Hello. Now. Yeah. How you doing? Who is this? You don't know me. I'm not

[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:13.180]
a chronic first time call, but it says Cox. Huh? It says, this ain't done Cox. Oh, oh man.

[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:18.620]
But anyway, while I get you, listen, I got one question for you. But first, there's more point

[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:24.360]
about this dialogue and discussion this morning. You said it. The call said it afterwards. If they

[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:29.800]
don't like the damn program, turn it on. Yeah, get a life and find something else to do. That's

[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.840]
right. Unbelievable. Listen, quick question. I'll let you go. I'm going to do some gambling.

[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:39.960]
I'm feeling plunged in this weekend. I'm going out on the boat. First time. Okay. Now,

[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:44.800]
buddy, tell me blackjack. The best shake for my money. No. I found the other day. There's a new

[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.960]
game out there called Caribbean poker that paying two to one. You know, I don't know anything about

[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:55.880]
poker and I don't like blackjack. I like roulette. I love the slots, but that's a sucker, but you're

[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.540]
never going to win on that. But the roulette's pretty good. If you got patience and you sit there and

[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:03.600]
you get a little lucky and you know when to get up and walk away, roulette, you got a good shot.

[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.780]
That's the number one. No one any game one. No one to leave. No one to fall, but my

[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:11.080]
Kenny's address. That's correct. Okay, Neil. I'm out in the material. Okay.

[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:15.480]
Good one. Winner's theus. Good luck to you. 1246 and WIOD and Openline in Palm Beach. If you're

[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:22.920]
really hurry now. 655-946-3-655 WIOD. Ocox is on seven.

[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.980]
I am iconic now.

[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.800]
David. An understatement. Hey, guys.

[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:29.740]
We've been out here.

[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:30.920]
Don O'Brien.

[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.140]
Yeah, really?

[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:33.540]
Hey, Neil.

[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:33.780]

[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.700]
Listen, we've done O'Brien.

[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:36.780]
Why are you shouting?

[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.580]
I see Caleb over here.

[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:39.400]
Why are you?

[01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.420]
No, not you, him. He's shouting now.

[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:42.860]
He's got Lee Fowler to see.

[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:43.580]
Yeah, well, Neil.

[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:48.320]
As soon as we put constant, every line was lit up. All three day lines just went out at the same time.

[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.560]
We had every line in the board lit. We put this guy on. Every line in day just went out.

[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.940]
Well, I have that effect on people.

[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.200]
Maybe Neil, I have an idea for your old folks.

[01:31:57.620 --> 01:31:57.620]

[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:01.480]
Have them tune to me for one afternoon. I'll give them some audio adjustment.

[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:02.000]
Yeah.

[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.660]
I'll rattle their brain.

[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.880]
They can't listen to F-M, unfortunately.

[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.340]
They don't know how to switch the band.

[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.500]
They can't even switch from one station on A-M to another.

[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:14.700]
They can switch the band.

[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.400]
You're really great.

[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.320]
Yeah, that's true.

[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:20.160]
Well, I thought if we could give them like a little hour of power therapy, you know?

[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:21.560]
Yeah, they need an hour of...

[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.420]
They need to power animals what they need.

[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.940]
Well, there's something people would think that that's what happens when you listen to us.

[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.420]
And...

[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:29.000]
And...

[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:35.320]
Anyway, I just thought it'd be fun if we had them tune over and rattle their brain for an hour or two.

[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:38.340]
Right. Well, I'm sure that my friends next door at GTR will be just delighted

[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:41.640]
by inviting everybody to listen to Power N-E-Six and feel that we just love them.

[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.520]
Listen, make me an Arminer, alright?

[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:43.920]
Yeah.

[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.820]
Yeah, you know, they're not any problems.

[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.820]
You know that they're on tape.

[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.160]
They've never been here since we came here. They're both on tape.

[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:56.020]
Well, maybe that's part of Spike's idea of how to do that, you know?

[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.580]
Yeah, that's Spike Boy. He's in your fact.

[01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:58.940]
He was here today for a couple of minutes.

[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.020]
I hope he saw the building.

[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:00.680]
Yeah, saw him.

[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.300]
No, I just have to have lunch.

[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.760]
You know, and it starts about 9.30.

[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.520]
And it ends about 4.30 and then they come in and they gotta go and coffee break and they...

[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.420]
Okay, Don, well, listen, it's here been a lot of fun.

[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.040]
Nice talking to you, Neil.

[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:13.480]
Bye.

[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:16.420]
12.48 at WIOD.

[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.100]
We have both the Palm Beach lines open.

[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.440]
Now it's true. As soon as he came on air, boy, the lines emptied out like there was a

[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.720]
bubonic plague on air.

[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:27.060]
And nothing personal, Don, it just the way they emptied.

[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.700]
Open line in Boca, 278 WIOD.

[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.320]
And in Palm Beach, 655 WIOD.

[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.720]
I guess the Marving Friday probably would be the last day.

[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.000]
We will be speaking in these hours through a lot of people in Palm Beach.

[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:41.380]
Because we, be it on Noon to 3, we can't handle that.

[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:44.800]
In fact, if you miss, good.

[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.240]
And you live in North Broward or Palm Beach and you can pick up J&O.

[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.920]
You can be able to tune over there immediately at Noon.

[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:54.700]
And you'll probably hear most of it repeated on the leaf hauler show from Noon to 3.

[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.080]
So it'd be a good way for you to catch up on what's going on here.

[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:00.040]
Toyota of Hollywood would like to invite you to come back.

[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.740]
The company too at WIOD got a mobile in date.

[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.080]
Hello.

[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:03.620]
Hello.

[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:04.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:05.080]
How you doing?

[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:05.720]
Okay.

[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:06.400]
How's the bird?

[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.080]
Okay.

[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:07.980]
That's good.

[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:08.580]
Okay.

[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.740]
Okay, okay.

[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:11.080]
I know.

[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.760]
They still try to be number three.

[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.260]
No, they're trying to be number 33, sir.

[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:15.720]
Thirty.

[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.420]
I think when the book comes out next Tuesday,

[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.960]
I think they're going to be getting real close.

[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.100]
Well, if they don't make it, I have just the person they can bring in.

[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.060]
And they'll just put them right where they should be.

[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:24.420]
Yeah.

[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:25.560]
Big Wilson.

[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.820]
Oh, that'll do it.

[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:27.180]
Okay.

[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.220]
Yeah, I don't know.

[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.860]
I don't know why no one else has grabbed him up in this market.

[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:33.740]
Even J&O has got the other three biggies.

[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.860]
Yeah, they got the title lineup now, boy.

[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.220]
Between Mike Miller and DeLie and Jeff Charles.

[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.380]
Why don't think we can handle that?

[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.940]
Boy, I'll tell you, big Wilson is next, so that's it.

[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:46.260]
Mike Miller is pretty sure he's doing a poll on which soda is your drinker.

[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.400]
That's, uh, that should be good.

[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.460]
And Lee Fowler will follow it up to see if the poll would come.

[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:52.620]
Yeah.

[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:55.140]
And then Mike's going to do a petition drive to get

[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.620]
National Hockey League team in West Palm Beach.

[01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.400]
All right.

[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.320]
That's too much.

[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.080]
That they're really going to do well up there.

[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:02.240]
I'm sure.

[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.640]
Yeah, they're going to, uh, they're going to kick some serious ass up there.

[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:05.340]
You can be sure of that.

[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:07.120]
Let me, let me, let me, let me.

[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.340]
And would you have Charles working up there?

[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:11.380]
If nothing else, at least find out where the good drug supply is in Palm Beach County.

[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.700]
Well, I don't take some of the pressure off of Dave and Broward.

[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:14.020]
Yeah.

[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:15.280]
That's for sure.

[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:20.540]
Let me tell you about the contrived debates that Steve Kane always had.

[01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:21.120]
No, I don't, sir.

[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:22.460]
I don't want to do that.

[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:23.920]
You really don't want to do it?

[01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:24.440]
Not at all.

[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.060]
No, I don't.

[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.160]
I really don't want to do it.

[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.000]
I'm not going to do it.

[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.560]
And we've gotten almost three hours without doing it.

[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.140]
And I'm just not going to return in kind what I heard yesterday.

[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.140]
Because it's Bush League.

[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:36.100]
It just doesn't have any place, but have a wonderful day.

[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.100]
1254 at WIOD.

[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.840]
We have an open line in date at 7519463.

[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:43.540]
Bokeh, hello.

[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:44.460]
Nail Bird.

[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:45.040]
Yeah.

[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:45.860]
I'm a long, I'll ask them.

[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.180]
This is a high-go to your Armenian.

[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.020]
And I just want to tell you that those people.

[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:49.640]
What the hell is that?

[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:50.960]
What are your Armenians saying?

[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:51.800]
Shalom, I'll ask them.

[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:52.580]
What is this all about?

[01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.660]
I have a couple of friends that are here.

[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.280]
Okay.

[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.640]
Those people out there, those douchebags,

[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.880]
who were picking on you yesterday,

[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.180]
made her blood turn to whiskey,

[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.960]
so that 100 bed bugs get drunk on me.

[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.180]
No, don't say picking on me.

[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:03.120]
That sounds rather true.

[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:04.860]
And they have some mizurka in their belly button.

[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.800]
And they made her enemies get cramped in their legs

[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.440]
while they dance on their graves.

[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.880]
May a child be named after them soon.

[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:11.500]
Yes.

[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.220]
And may your first child be a masculine child, sir.

[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.880]
It's 1254 at WIOD right down the middle of the board.

[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:18.700]
Just all empty down.

[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.800]
And they'd 7519463.

[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.140]
It's funny.

[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:22.460]
We were going along fine.

[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:23.600]
Don Cox called.

[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:25.280]
All of a sudden now we got a little problem here.

[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.480]
In Broward, you know, it was just so proper, lady.

[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:29.600]
And not a one-heter feel back.

[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.160]
Because I enjoyed her called tremendously.

[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:33.860]
And the amazing part of it is

[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:37.060]
she actually responded to something that I said.

[01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:37.620]
Yeah.

[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:38.820]
Now that's a rarely.

[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:41.740]
See, another thing about these pseudo intellectuals,

[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.240]
who all you'll then bring up topics,

[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.580]
I used to do those heavy monologues.

[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.640]
And I go on for 35, 40 minutes to get my blood pressure up.

[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.680]
And the top of my head felt like it was going to blow off

[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.040]
from high blood pressure.

[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.060]
And I get all worked up to,

[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:55.360]
and you'd punch up the first call.

[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.420]
Oh, you know that Dr. Yahed and Leslie,

[01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.120]
oh, what was his name?

[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.240]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:03.020]
And that would be the first call.

[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:03.980]
It would get worse from there.

[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.620]
There would be nothing in any way, shape or form,

[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:08.980]
responding to what I said.

[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:09.920]
And it was the same on Z.

[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.640]
Remember, there would be those foolish days

[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.880]
when I would go on and rant and rave and pound on the table

[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.180]
once in a while just because I had something on my mind.

[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.540]
And the lines would all get lit up and you think,

[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.240]
boy, I really got these people going today.

[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:22.000]
And there would be not a single response.

[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:24.900]
So at least the lady talked about soap opera.

[01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:26.160]
Maybe she bored a lot of you,

[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:28.600]
but at least she responded to something I mentioned, okay?

[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.240]
And she deserves several points for that.

[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:32.060]
That's true.

[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:32.960]
You know you're right.

[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:34.800]
Steve and his daughter.

[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.560]
And as somebody who knows the name of the daughter

[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:37.720]
that was Ed's first wife,

[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.820]
oh, and I know you're really excited about that.

[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:40.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:41.820]
See, the reason I'm doing this now is

[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:43.640]
because you'll probably be begging us

[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.460]
to do an hour or two on Upstate New York tomorrow

[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:47.460]
by comparison.

[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:49.640]
And maybe even a couple of hours on sports.

[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:50.520]
Yeah.

[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.040]
Well, mobile in Boka.

[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:52.500]
Hello.

[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.220]
Hello, Neil.

[01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:53.720]
Yeah.

[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:55.760]
Good afternoon, right?

[01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:56.300]
Good you up there.

[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:56.920]
How are you doing?

[01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:58.100]
I beg your pardon?

[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:00.040]
I say, how is things going for you?

[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.040]
Everything, it couldn't be better.

[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.280]
Right, that's wonderful.

[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.040]
We like hearing from happy people, sir.

[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:05.820]
Well, I got a lot of fun.

[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:07.400]
Why we don't get a lot of calls from Boka.

[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.640]
Yeah, Boka's a heck of a jam.

[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:09.920]
Let me know.

[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:10.300]
It is.

[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:10.680]
I know.

[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.900]
It's got those great strip shopping centers, man.

[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:13.500]
It's fantastic.

[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.420]
It's better than oral springs.

[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.100]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.260]
Anyway, I have a little condo store,

[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.940]
if we, I think you'll get a kick out of it.

[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:20.120]
Yeah.

[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.880]
This is a famous condo called

[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.520]
Windmore Village.

[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.400]
Have you ever heard of it?

[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:26.960]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:27.560]
Once or twice.

[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:27.820]
Yeah.

[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.240]
Once, didn't appearance there.

[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:29.780]
Yeah.

[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.220]
Good job.

[01:38:30.220 --> 01:38:30.520]
Yeah.

[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.040]
And we had one demugs to give away.

[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:33.340]
Yeah.

[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:34.900]
WLNZ, one demugs.

[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:35.920]
I have a question for you.

[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:36.480]
They didn't, sir.

[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:37.880]
Let me just tell you the rest of the story.

[01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:39.660]
Very briefly, they descended upon me

[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.420]
like I was giving away $100 bills.

[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.020]
I was going to ask you where I was going to attack.

[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:45.900]
And when the last one disappeared,

[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.840]
they disappeared just as rapidly as they had come.

[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.460]
It was like the birds in Alfred Hitchcock.

[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.700]
You know, they, all of a sudden, they all

[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.840]
descended and they disappeared.

[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.240]
And can I have a one demugged?

[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.180]
They didn't even know what they were.

[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:57.660]
But they knew they were free, sir.

[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:58.880]
And that's what was big at Windmore.

[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.460]
Anyway, this is a quick story.

[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.660]
My parents used to live over, not wonderful development.

[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.240]
And my father still works.

[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:10.640]
And he came back to the condo there one day from work.

[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:13.140]
And he went over to that community recreation area

[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:16.200]
with the community pool and the hot tub and this barn.

[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:16.740]
All that stuff.

[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.200]
The community and I'm a band-tie.

[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:18.540]
Yeah, whatever.

[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.760]
Well, anyway, he jumped into that hot tub.

[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.820]
And a woman ran over and said,

[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.800]
you have to get out of there immediately.

[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:27.520]
Because the sign on the wall says,

[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.480]
everyone must shower before they enter the hot tub.

[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.220]
And he said, well, you know something,

[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:33.300]
you're right, and I apologize.

[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:36.580]
Next time I come down here, I will be sure to shower.

[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:39.760]
And she stepped three steps into the hot tub.

[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.220]
And she said, if you don't get out now with shower,

[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.140]
I will urinate right into this hot tub.

[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:45.600]
Great.

[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:46.920]
Yeah, that's a true story.

[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:48.920]
And along with the whole, she did.

[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.960]
She urinated in the hot tub at Windmore.

[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.300]
And I hope she's listening.

[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.700]
Because lady, you're crazy.

[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.580]
And my parents moved out of there.

[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.240]
Just recently.

[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.180]
I'm glad they did.

[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.320]
I used to hate to go to the other room.

[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:03.560]
Now, let me ask you this question.

[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.120]
Was that enough to get him out?

[01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:05.820]
Did he get out?

[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:06.620]
He was...

[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:09.620]
He probably warmed the water up a little more.

[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:10.580]
Yeah, he probably stayed in.

[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:11.660]
Who didn't get out?

[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:13.240]
How do you think they get those tubs hotter?

[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:13.880]
Windmore, sir.

[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:16.160]
I don't see the old lady's pee in the hot tub.

[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:16.680]
There you go.

[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:18.700]
I don't know.

[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:19.900]
Anyway, have a great day.

[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.160]
Burge a great, I love you.

[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:21.920]
Thank you, sir.

[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:22.260]
Thank you.

[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:23.020]
Why the story?

[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:25.240]
How come all these people seem to be satisfying?

[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:26.160]
No complaints.

[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:26.920]
No complaints.

[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:28.260]
They're not hostile toward you.

[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:31.260]
The only sourpuss we had was one old bag today

[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:33.280]
that called two different times for Mike Disney,

[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.700]
who is called the talk show line,

[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.840]
to speak to the general manager.

[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:39.860]
Other than that, everybody seems to be happy.

[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:40.400]
Oh, you know.

[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.000]
No complaints.

[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:43.660]
Those people never ever call you so many of them.

[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:44.840]
You know, they only...

[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.300]
You know that.

[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:45.700]
Oh, yeah.

[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.260]
They don't have the balls to stay in their face.

[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.680]
They've got to find that opening that I talked about.

[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.640]
And then, worm their way in there

[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:54.340]
and just rip the door open so that they can do their thing.

[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:56.060]
And if somebody invites them to do it,

[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:56.940]
they are.

[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.680]
Somebody orchestrates that

[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.760]
and gives them an opportunity to vent their spleen

[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.720]
in a short take advantage of the last time, especially.

[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.120]
Well listen, be that as it may.

[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:07.240]
Don't forget Steve has the Hurrod 106 at WIOD.

[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.720]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:10.360]
As we start our fourth and final hour

[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:11.760]
on a wonderful Thursday.

[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:14.940]
Just glad to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:15.640]
Tickle to death.

[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.780]
Happy is a pig in stock.

[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.700]
And that Palm Beach number,

[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:20.920]
if you move real fast,

[01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:23.240]
it's 655 WIOD.

[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.040]
655 946 330.

[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.160]
Oh, we have a list of guests that we have set up

[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:32.760]
for the next three months during the last break we decided.

[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:35.200]
We probably ought to have some very, very heavy guests.

[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.520]
Now, is the sink and float lady on that?

[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:40.140]
Sink and float lady.

[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.180]
The first one on the list,

[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:42.040]
you've been in the punch.

[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:43.600]
She was the first one on my list

[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.820]
was the sink and float lady.

[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.060]
That's what I'm interested in.

[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.100]
And if I could probably get a big tune in the audience

[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.560]
and win more, just the guy mentioned it just in the last hour.

[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.920]
I'll probably get a gigantic calling audience from win more.

[01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.580]
Well, we have the sink and float question.

[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.360]
No question. No question.

[01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.000]
Now we're going to be doing a show on brain surgery for seniors,

[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.260]
which is going to be very exciting.

[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.460]
That's coming up a week from Wednesday.

[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.160]
Let's start this hour and four,

[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:06.940]
Lauderdale. Hello.

[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:08.060]
Lauderdale.

[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:08.480]
Yeah.

[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:09.260]
How you doing?

[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:09.840]
Okay.

[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.420]
Listen, I was listening to you show this morning.

[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.940]
What I was wonderful, sir.

[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:17.540]
I was a little upset to hear how upset you were this morning.

[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:17.800]
Yeah.

[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:18.780]
But, uh,

[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.220]
but, uh,

[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:21.220]
I'm trying to be better.

[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:22.820]
Okay. You're trying to articulate, I understand.

[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.460]
I'm thinking up for you.

[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:24.980]
Yeah.

[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:26.600]
I get a little nervous when I speak.

[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:27.620]
You know, question.

[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:28.640]
A lot of pressure.

[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.260]
I just want you to know that you're the king.

[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.580]
You're number one.

[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:33.600]
You're the best.

[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:37.520]
And I don't think you should let these douchebags get you upset.

[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:38.720]
Okay, sir.

[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.720]
I'll take your advice.

[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.120]
107 and WIOD.

[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:42.460]
And enough butt licking already.

[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:43.500]
Okay. It's, uh,

[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:45.280]
Palm Beach is not there.

[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:45.580]
It goes.

[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.000]
It's,

[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:46.260]
Tinkos.

[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.440]
Well, you really can't tell for sure because you know how they ring

[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.100]
alternately.

[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.200]
No, they really do.

[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:52.320]
And I still haven't gotten used to that.

[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.880]
One day, I guess I will get used to that.

[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:55.920]
But they like flicker a little bit.

[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.060]
And then they stop.

[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.120]
In fact, Palm Beach, when Palm Beach stops,

[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.640]
it stops for good like now.

[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:03.740]
It flicker just a little bit.

[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:04.480]
And then it just stops.

[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:07.100]
Because a lot of the people when you're calling in Palm Beach

[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.360]
they're, you're not cold are you?

[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:09.260]
No, I'm okay.

[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:09.880]
I'm okay.

[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:12.580]
I can see my breath, but that's all right.

[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:13.120]
It's not distracting.

[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.680]
I just heard you laugh when I got your head.

[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.260]
It's so cold.

[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:16.380]
When I came in this morning,

[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.560]
do I look cold?

[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:19.140]
It was, and you know, I like it cold,

[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:20.920]
but he had it so cold that you could,

[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.440]
that water would have frozen.

[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:23.500]
That's on the table right there.

[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.000]
I mean, because I'm trembling a little bit,

[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:25.700]
do you get the impression?

[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:27.740]
I thought maybe it was those calls that did it to you.

[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.320]
It was.

[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:29.880]
That abuse.

[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:30.500]
Yeah.

[01:43:30.780 --> 01:43:30.920]
And then,

[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.160]
okay, that's Palm Beach line.

[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.440]
Let me give the number one more time

[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.380]
because we never give up.

[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:36.420]
I don't know why we just never give up on it line.

[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:37.620]
655,

[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:38.780]
WIOD.

[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:39.740]
Four-larterdale.

[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:40.000]
Hello.

[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:40.880]
Hello, Neil.

[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:41.300]
Yeah.

[01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:41.680]
Hi.

[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.880]
Have you heard about the Elvis contest

[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:47.680]
from the Royal Elbe Station in the Midwest?

[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:48.220]
No.

[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:52.000]
Oh, well, I thought Albee might be interested, you know?

[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.100]
They do it by...

[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:54.760]
Albee sure.

[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:55.620]
Yeah, I'll be sure.

[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:56.100]
Oh, yeah.

[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:56.500]
For sure.

[01:43:57.300 --> 01:43:59.080]
They do it by, you know.

[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.740]
It's find the way you said Albee,

[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:01.620]
like it was one name.

[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:01.900]
Yeah.

[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:04.080]
Somehow Albee and Albee sure

[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.200]
seemed like two different places.

[01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:08.820]
Albee seems like he might be from Milton, Florida.

[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:09.220]

[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.280]
Oh, that's...

[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:11.040]
Albee, Presley.

[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:12.140]
That's like a distant cousin.

[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.660]
All right.

[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.820]
Well, anyway, they do it by how you found

[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.460]
and how you looked.

[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.200]
That might be a problem for him.

[01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:21.480]
And, you know,

[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:23.660]
and how you do the pelvis.

[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:25.040]
You know, the pelvis.

[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:25.540]
Yeah.

[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.380]
Okay, listen, I have a wonderful day

[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:28.680]
and all of that stuff.

[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:30.160]
Okay, 109 at WIOD.

[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:31.680]
You know, who's this note from?

[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.280]
That's from you.

[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.340]
And you're giving this to me like it's your serious?

[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:36.800]
I just spoke to him.

[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:38.740]
Steve said, well, what are you speaking for?

[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:40.420]
And what are you like the mediator now?

[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.080]
Steve said he stuck up for me on a show yesterday

[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.280]
did not hear the show this morning.

[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:46.920]
Well, the first part, the last part is neither here nor there.

[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.880]
But as I said, when you give people five and ten minutes

[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.560]
to bash and rehash and say basically the same thing over and over again

[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.240]
and rip people and then you say,

[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.200]
oh, but you know, and you defend it.

[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.800]
That's, uh, that doesn't do the job.

[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:01.320]
Here he comes.

[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.820]
He's walking down the hallway right now.

[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.440]
And it's just, I don't want to rehash it

[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.100]
because we did a whole traumatic first hour.

[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.700]
It's 10 minutes past one at WIOD.

[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:10.860]
We have an open line in Broward.

[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.360]
524-9463.

[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:13.660]
We had a couple of people today.

[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.700]
And they didn't even bash anybody, but they just,

[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.740]
it seemed to me that that's where they were going.

[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.000]
And I just stopped them at the pass and I said,

[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:21.820]
have a wonderful day.

[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:22.500]
And about them.

[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:24.520]
But Steve just entered the room right now.

[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.760]
He's got an emotional look on his face.

[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.800]
He's wiping, washing his hands with holy water.

[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:32.600]
So that means obviously we have a serious moment coming up.

[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:34.580]
Now what's going on?

[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:34.900]
No.

[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.640]
I walked in the door.

[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.460]
Everyone told me we were attacking me or something.

[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:39.580]
Oh, it's not attacking you.

[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.580]
I was telling you.

[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.420]
When you were making trouble.

[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:42.480]
I was telling it.

[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:44.240]
You told him I was attacking me?

[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:46.820]
Yes. He said you kneel, got on, and was attacking me.

[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.100]
No, I didn't attack you.

[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:50.660]
I responded to the attack on us.

[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:53.540]
That took place for four hours yesterday on your show.

[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:54.400]
I responded to that.

[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.360]
Oh, we got a lot of nasty calls yesterday.

[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.140]
You're looking at me that way for.

[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.240]
Well, you got a lot of nasty calls because you let it go on.

[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.740]
See, I really believe that if you don't,

[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.120]
because I get, like we had one little while ago,

[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.100]
I wanted to talk about your show.

[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:11.160]
I said, I don't want to talk about it.

[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:11.700]
And I hung up on it.

[01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:12.300]
But I love it.

[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:12.680]
They have to.

[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.280]
Don't you know, I know you don't, you don't like it so much.

[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:15.760]
I love it.

[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.340]
Yeah, I love it.

[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:20.000]
If I'm doing it to somebody like Alice, who's on another station,

[01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:23.680]
I don't like it when it's with me or with him.

[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.280]
I mean, it calls about the bird yesterday.

[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:27.720]
We're just, it's got to an epidemic where it was like,

[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:28.520]
they were all old.

[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.000]
They're people we don't want listening anymore.

[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:30.540]
I understand.

[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:31.580]
We don't want it to.

[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.140]
I stood up to you guys.

[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:34.140]
What are you, what are you,

[01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:35.400]
you angry at me too?

[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:36.340]
I didn't hear it.

[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:37.120]
Oh, I heard it.

[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:37.360]
I heard it.

[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.960]
While I called you guys, I mean, yeah, I was a great call.

[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:41.380]
What's their complain about me?

[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:44.540]
Basically, what they top of the show wasn't,

[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.940]
you know, wasn't you and Neil the time we were talking about talk radio.

[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:48.940]
So this movie yesterday and we got,

[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:50.160]
but nobody saw it.

[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.280]
So I know, I know, we were talking about the nature of the business and stuff like that.

[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:55.820]
The nature of the thought was not a bad show.

[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:56.700]
You thought it was a bad show?

[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.360]
I thought it was an abortion.

[01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.820]
Of course, you're against abortion.

[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.900]
So you're very, very against abortion.

[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:04.620]
But I just am not into that and it's happened so many times.

[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.460]
Maybe I'm getting to the point where I just, you know,

[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.960]
have I'm saturated with it because it's happened on a lot of shows.

[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:09.720]
That's just yours.

[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.560]
Or you do show a few weeks ago.

[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:12.980]
Don't you love when people attack you?

[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:15.300]
And the way I love that, when I'm not on this, my favorite,

[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:18.300]
my favorite part of the other stations is fine.

[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:22.280]
My favorite parts of your show when people call up to attack me have always been.

[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.120]
But they don't, we don't let them do that here.

[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:28.660]
Well, you know, but I mean, I, what I'm trying to say was I like it when they hear that on this show.

[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.240]
Yeah, you're a little bit down then.

[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:31.600]
Yeah, call now and again.

[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.000]
Well, it was a, but not really.

[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.000]
That was the strength of my mental always being.

[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.160]
Because it became the topic.

[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:36.700]
Well,

[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:39.940]
I don't, I don't want to begin the topic of the whole show.

[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.100]
See, whenever they have the opportunity and it never all appears like I said this morning,

[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.440]
like the old WGBS.

[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:47.960]
I mean, every misfit caller that was ever invented.

[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:51.420]
Well, I feel a lot of these people, I think a lot of these people have to be straightened

[01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:52.040]
up because they don't.

[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:53.220]
They're not going to be straight.

[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:53.840]
What you do.

[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.880]
Well, they're not, they don't want to be straighted out.

[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.380]
They're all listening right now, including society insurance.

[01:47:58.420 --> 01:47:59.800]
It's not, it listens every day.

[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:04.080]
It's as I continue to say, it's not, I don't do the show for the call as I do it for the listeners.

[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:08.720]
And I think that people are confused some, you know, in many ways between what you do and what I do.

[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:09.420]
No, I don't think so.

[01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.440]
I don't think, I don't think they're confused at all.

[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.820]
I think that the people who hate me with a passion and there are many of them,

[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:21.440]
sees those opportunities to pretend that they're confused or pretend they don't understand or whatever,

[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.100]
but the bottom line, in fact,

[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:27.800]
Si was a classic point, which is why I called right after that call because he started out,

[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.420]
if you remember.

[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:32.180]
And he said, well, you know, there's no question you guys do two different shows.

[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:35.840]
Neil is one show, you do another show, but that bird, that cackling idiot,

[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:36.400]
blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:40.520]
And then by the end of the call, because science is a very emotional, angry man.

[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:41.480]
I don't know what is problem.

[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:42.340]
He's got some problems.

[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:46.220]
And he gets hostile and his blood pressure rises by the end of the call.

[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.060]
Like disgusting filth and hell.

[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:51.240]
And he was talking about, you know, I must say, you know, quite frankly,

[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:54.400]
I didn't know the, I didn't know, I didn't know these kind of things.

[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:56.160]
But if they do, I won't let them go on the air.

[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:56.700]
Oh, they do.

[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:57.220]
Tremendous thing.

[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.400]
Well, I think it's the poorest thing.

[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.820]
And it will not all happen in the same trough.

[01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:03.920]
It will not walk in evidence of that.

[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:04.480]
It will.

[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.000]
We're all not happening again.

[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:09.020]
I don't think you know, I think you liked it like I like it.

[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:09.360]
No, I don't.

[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:09.660]
You're wrong.

[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:10.080]
Okay.

[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:11.400]
No, I hear it on the station.

[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:12.100]
Now I know.

[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.440]
But let's get to the serious thing that I heard on the way in here.

[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:20.900]
You know about this business just when you think you got it made and everything said,

[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.720]
that was the serious career is said.

[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.400]
Well, I missed that.

[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:23.960]
Oh, okay.

[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:24.840]
I'm talking about.

[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.140]
We didn't say I did a monologue.

[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:26.920]
I was in a movie.

[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:28.260]
Bob Lasseter would have been delighted.

[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.620]
I went to see a movie this morning.

[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:30.840]
Oh, Debbie does, uh, Davey?

[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:34.320]
No, this is a thing you'd be sure to miss called the, uh,

[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:36.280]
I missed the lockout that,

[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.360]
what was that one last night?

[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:38.200]
Games would move.

[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:39.920]
Oh, Mississippi burning.

[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:41.500]
Great.

[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.300]
That sounds like a good idea.

[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.800]
Unbelievable film.

[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.040]
Unbelievable film.

[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.420]
But I forgot the title.

[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.380]
I blocked out the title of the thing with James with this morning.

[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:50.960]
It's opening today.

[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.700]
Be sure to miss the top of the question.

[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:55.880]
Oh, it was the way if it hadn't been for, uh,

[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:58.240]
if it hadn't been for the critics in the audience in their

[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.000]
sarcastic remarks, it would have been painful.

[01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:01.940]
But anyway, what is it?

[01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:02.740]
A show about zits?

[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:05.740]
No, it's a show about drugs and James Wood plays it.

[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.180]
It's awful.

[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:07.040]
It's time to...

[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:07.760]
I got to remember the,

[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:11.160]
the upper, the helper, the something...

[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.780]
The, they come by the way at the Toyota of Hollywood.

[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:19.160]
They told me the other day that they have a small new vehicle coming out of the,

[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:22.820]
the thinking and put it on the market that you can actually drive in James Wood's zits.

[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:26.740]
You can actually get right on there and zip right through.

[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:26.920]
You're still...

[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.100]
I have something serious to discuss.

[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:28.200]
Yeah.

[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:29.040]
Can I get to it?

[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.300]
Just when you think you've got it made in this business.

[01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:33.300]
And all of a sudden I figure I'm...

[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:37.520]
Yes, we're all along and all of a sudden I'm up against the F Charles again.

[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:38.580]
I try to...

[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:39.180]
I was on the hard day.

[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.140]
I get away from this car.

[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:42.000]
I mean, I destroyed my career.

[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:44.360]
All the people I want to hear are material from the previous two hours.

[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.560]
I'll be turning Leon at noon.

[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:46.480]
Those late risers.

[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.960]
I mean, but going up against Charles with that point,

[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:51.360]
oh, oh, oh, whatever that he had,

[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.220]
he would have been a much better lead in over here.

[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.040]
You do know that.

[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:55.360]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:56.160]
Powerhouse.

[01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:56.880]
Well, I told him.

[01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:57.520]
I said, you know what?

[01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:59.680]
But I said, if we can't get Jeff, we'll settle for now.

[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.240]
I think they probably ought to give us six over there, don't you?

[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:06.240]
That's two for Miller, two for Fowler and two for Charles.

[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:07.320]
Oh, what happened to...

[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:07.820]
The...

[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:09.680]
Oh, I'ma said something we can give me in trouble.

[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:11.100]
I was going to say the best guy at the station.

[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.260]
What's happening to...

[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:15.060]
I mean, next to Lee, the best guy at that station,

[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.400]
Dick Farrow, what happened to Dick?

[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:16.940]
Is there a doubt?

[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:17.220]
I have no idea.

[01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:18.040]
I guess he's history.

[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:18.920]
He must be out.

[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:19.720]
I can't believe it.

[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:22.180]
I'm probably starting to big thing up at Century Village up there.

[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.380]
And now you...

[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:26.600]
Because they did the same thing to Port John Broward.

[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:27.500]
I don't know what you're like.

[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.340]
But now you can go up against Fowler now.

[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:30.000]
I know.

[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:31.840]
That's the word we've already conceded.

[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.540]
Just when we thought we had the whole market right in the palm of our hand.

[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:37.980]
So anyway, these miserable misfits that you had on yesterday

[01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:39.280]
since you're trying to...

[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:39.660]
It won't...

[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.800]
No, I'm telling you, it won't happen again.

[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:43.840]
Anybody attacks you off, say, Uncle Neil doesn't want to hear this.

[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:44.520]
Let him call.

[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:45.860]
Oh, you're inviting to call here.

[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:46.120]
Oh, no.

[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:49.100]
Because it's amazing, except for one old bag

[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:53.280]
who is wonderful, a who called today who is calling allegedly for Mr. Disney,

[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:53.820]
not for...

[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.660]
I'm a call-in line, which is generally the way you do it.

[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:57.400]
Call a talk show line to get the general manager.

[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.080]
And she even called a second time,

[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.240]
but hung up before we could get her mouth to start moving.

[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:03.560]
But other than that, everybody seems happy.

[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:06.060]
They don't hate him today and they just...

[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:06.900]
Well, you're going to...

[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:09.420]
You know, these were just a bunch of mouth-miss answers.

[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:10.260]
That is correct.

[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:10.840]
Right.

[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.580]
The GBS...

[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:12.120]
Why make you deal?

[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:13.580]
I won't permit those close-ups.

[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:14.420]
I'm a GOL-D.

[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.700]
I don't permit people to attack me because I like that.

[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:18.300]
I will permit people to attack me.

[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.060]
I would like that.

[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:19.940]
You will like that.

[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:20.440]
I love it.

[01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:20.940]
I love it.

[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:22.940]
I mean, you can defend me like I defend you.

[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:23.440]
No.

[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.940]
If you believe it...

[01:52:27.020 --> 01:52:28.920]
I mean, I wouldn't want you to gratuitously defend me.

[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.340]
Yeah, but it wouldn't be any fun doing that.

[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:31.200]
If they say something...

[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.000]
If I agree with them,

[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:32.420]
would make it even more interesting.

[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:32.680]
Oh, no.

[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:35.820]
I mean, if you got to say what you really feel like I do,

[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:37.280]
how do you like that, bum?

[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:37.980]
I think it was...

[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:39.240]
I think it was this guy you were talking about.

[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:40.160]
Who's the guy you were talking about?

[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:40.880]
The insurance guy?

[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:41.440]
Si.

[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:44.540]
Who kept saying that I was being nice to you just because you worked here?

[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:44.720]
Yeah.

[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:45.920]
You got to really...

[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:45.980]
You got to really...

[01:52:46.060 --> 01:52:46.800]
You mean me every day, yeah.

[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:48.640]
In other words, the man was calling me a liar.

[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:49.980]
He got to see me every day.

[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.460]
In a show about talk radio,

[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.600]
we'll turn into a Bash-Neil Rodgers show.

[01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:53.860]
Yeah.

[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:55.100]
And that's what Ernie Granger...

[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:56.480]
Granger's...

[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:56.480]

[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:56.560]
And an entire show.

[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:57.640]
That come early in the day.

[01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.320]
Granger and an entire show where I was the topic.

[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.300]
And I didn't know where they were.

[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.160]
The more they...

[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:02.160]
The more they bash you,

[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:02.940]
or me or whatever,

[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:04.740]
that he wasn't on Saturday morning

[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:05.800]
because I don't have good concentration

[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:06.740]
that early in the morning.

[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:08.860]
And Ernie's very big in a concentrate.

[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.440]
I mean, how long do you think a show would last?

[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:12.600]
Bashing Ernie.

[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:13.060]
For you...

[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:13.760]
I mean, you know, like...

[01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:17.600]
No, I can't just stain it.

[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.400]
I've tried, but after the first two or three minutes...

[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.160]
Well, that's what I'm saying.

[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.140]
Because once you see one death camp, you've seen him.

[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:23.980]
Right.

[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:25.180]
And once you've lost a sock,

[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.080]
what can you say?

[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:26.760]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:30.040]
You ought to get Ernie together with that weirdo

[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:31.280]
that you had on the phone at Waco.

[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:32.040]
What was the name?

[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:34.480]
The one from California that Nazi law.

[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.180]
Oh, oh, right.

[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:37.400]
What would that be a show?

[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:38.140]
What great programming.

[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:39.280]
Why didn't I think of it?

[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:39.940]
And Ernie could say,

[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:40.740]
I've been there.

[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.580]
I've seen him.

[01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.580]
I counted the body.

[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:43.400]
You know, and you would...

[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.620]
You would embellish him as you went along

[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:46.460]
because he's got a wild imagination about it.

[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:46.600]
Right up there.

[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:47.320]
But he's a...

[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.000]
He's an incredible...

[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.120]
He is a real student of the Holocaust.

[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.460]
I mean, not just a student,

[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.700]
but I think he like lives it.

[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:53.780]
You know what I mean?

[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:56.060]
I'm talking with the idea of doing a show with René-Roy.

[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:57.400]
When he goes home in 30-30-5,

[01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:58.180]
Lord and I,

[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:01.340]
when he goes home and tortures his wife and I turns on the gas and the stove,

[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.320]
that's getting a little bit carried away.

[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:04.340]
But he can't help it.

[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:05.080]
He lives it, you know.

[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:06.300]
You're having Laurie...

[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:09.560]
Well, I was thinking that this is still in the formative in the...

[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.520]
Oh, Mrs. René-Roy.

[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:13.320]
Mrs. René, Mrs. Ocean and Laurie,

[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:14.200]
on the tipana,

[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:15.820]
what it's like to be married to talk to a host.

[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:16.700]
I thought that would be cute.

[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:20.120]
Well, why would you have René-Roy?

[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:20.360]
Well, this...

[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:27.340]
I don't know what to say.

[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:28.140]
How can you...

[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:29.320]
How can you be so cruel?

[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:31.780]
It's a one-nineteen at WIOD.

[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:34.120]
And on Saturday the 14th of January,

[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.640]
we will be at Toyotohari with Tomlaken Foodie.

[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.780]
Boy, this is Attorney Traumatic here,

[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.660]
all of a sudden, 22 minutes past one.

[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:41.320]
By the day.

[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.620]
At WIOD.

[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:44.620]
Quite a day.

[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:45.060]
Boy.

[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.040]
Poor Sharon, everybody's just...

[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:48.460]
Pull me up.

[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:49.800]
Well, anyway, moving right along.

[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.220]
What happened, all of a sudden?

[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.720]
I don't understand what happened.

[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:54.680]
We're all just sitting here.

[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.220]
Okay, we got somebody on a payphone and Broward.

[01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:57.480]
Hello.

[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:58.540]
Yeah, hi, Deal.

[01:54:58.540 --> 01:54:58.820]
How are you?

[01:54:59.120 --> 01:54:59.420]
Okay.

[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.600]
I had a wonderful story about old people.

[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:03.700]
The other day I was sitting eating lunch,

[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.480]
you know, long-distance silver.

[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.760]
And when I parked my new truck,

[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:11.720]
I left plenty of spaces on either side of it.

[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.820]
And behind me, it was late in the afternoon.

[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:15.260]
Behind me was about 10 spaces.

[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:15.980]
There was no cars.

[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.640]
It was on senior eating this lady,

[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:19.860]
this old big Ford,

[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:21.880]
decided to pull in next to mine

[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.580]
and take all half the story of my truck.

[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.120]
And Roshita says,

[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.840]
she's back up and starts to leave the parking lot.

[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:32.060]
And then decides that she must have been hungry.

[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:33.780]
So I think she pulled back in and parked.

[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:37.360]
And I went out there and I said,

[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:38.620]
why did you do that?

[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:40.220]
You know, you just spoke on other spaces.

[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:43.040]
Why did you have to try and squeeze next to Michael?

[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:43.240]
Yeah.

[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:46.000]
Well, I usually park in that space every day.

[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:47.340]
Was your answer.

[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:49.100]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:50.480]
That's her private property.

[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:52.320]
I think probably if she would paint her name,

[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.500]
you know, on the end of it there,

[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:54.960]
that would probably be a good idea.

[01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.720]
So I went out and she was like a space mountain somewhere.

[01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:58.680]
She really was.

[01:55:58.820 --> 01:55:59.260]
I don't know.

[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:02.180]
Anyhow, she proceeded to walk right past me

[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:03.960]
and go in and order her lunch.

[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:06.820]
And get it and sit down.

[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.380]
There's about four people in the restaurant

[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:10.440]
so I do this also.

[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.560]
So they called the...

[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:12.620]
How bad was it?

[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:13.740]
It's $900.

[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:14.500]
Hmm.

[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.760]
You know, so you were probably like

[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.640]
infringing over a little part of her space.

[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.860]
No, because next to me, on the other side

[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:23.900]
was a wide handicap space.

[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:26.940]
So I always park a little close to that

[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:28.180]
because those spaces are real big.

[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.100]
Yeah, you drive a Mac truck and those.

[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:30.780]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:33.800]
And you know, I just trucked my joy six months old

[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:34.800]
and it's a Bronco.

[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:36.400]
It's like $19,000.

[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:38.220]
So I'm trying to take care of it.

[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.240]
And so the guy at the restaurant tells me

[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:42.220]
she comes in every day

[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.460]
and is in real pain when back

[01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:48.080]
and she sits in this one booth only.

[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.200]
And if somebody happens to be in it,

[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:51.760]
she'll go over and ask them to leave.

[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:52.120]

[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:54.600]
And she sits and talks, so she...

[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.420]
What does she ever name on a booth, too?

[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:57.100]
I don't know.

[01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:59.160]
I mean, they wish they could get rid of this woman.

[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:00.120]
So...

[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.740]
So eventually the mother...

[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:04.020]
That's probably the lady who's also called earlier.

[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.160]
Got our 6, 10 frozen on her A&M doll.

[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:07.360]
And he has one station, too.

[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:08.540]
On a radio.

[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:11.800]
So the police room finally comes,

[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.040]
Mars cycle police room.

[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:15.420]
And she won't go out to talk to him.

[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.220]
So he has to come in and sit with her

[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.800]
and she says, well, I didn't do that.

[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:20.580]
I wasn't even there.

[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:24.160]
And meanwhile, my black paint all over the front of her car.

[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.160]
And so he gives her a ticket and finally

[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:30.540]
gets the information and the witnesses and all that.

[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.800]
And she decides, because she had assurance,

[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.160]
which surprised me to know in.

[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:40.680]
And she said, well, I want to pay you, I don't want...

[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:43.020]
I assurance, to come to me, to know about this.

[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.720]
And I'm sure you probably don't,

[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.060]
because the people in the restaurant told me

[01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:47.760]
that she wasn't driving so well,

[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.680]
and that he took away her wife.

[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.120]
Wonder why.

[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:51.220]
And...

[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:52.620]
It's just...

[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:55.360]
She casually, after that, got up and finished her lunch

[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.460]
and drove home.

[01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:59.840]
And the only good part about it was she did give me a check

[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:01.000]
the other day and it was good.

[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:03.380]
And I trucks me a fix now.

[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:04.420]
But this lady,

[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:06.940]
does not belong on the road.

[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:07.580]
Yeah, well,

[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:08.860]
she went on a company, sir.

[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.080]
My grandfather's 91.

[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:10.580]
Yeah.

[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:13.620]
And six months ago, he got a six-year license in the mail.

[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:14.100]
Excellent.

[01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:14.760]
You know,

[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:17.100]
and he drives, he's a pretty tough old guy,

[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.740]
but you don't want this man on the road

[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:20.080]
and you certainly don't want to be.

[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.740]
And how the state can do this.

[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:22.640]
Yeah, very easy.

[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:23.920]
It's called incompetence, sir.

[01:58:24.180 --> 01:58:25.160]
And he's called incompetence.

[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:26.380]
Well, listen, I wish you the best of luck

[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:28.060]
and stay out of that diner, okay?

[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:29.380]
I know where her space is now,

[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:30.280]
and I'm sure I'm not going to...

[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:31.600]
Okay, good luck to you.

[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:33.240]
125 at WIOD.

[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:34.300]
We have an open line in Broward.

[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:36.320]
524-9463.

[01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:37.280]
Miami. Hello.

[01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:38.680]
Hi, gang.

[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:39.280]
Yeah.

[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:42.500]
I was up at Sky Lake Mall a few weeks ago.

[01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:43.780]
No, one of you sound a little depressed.

[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:46.200]
No, there was a movie there.

[01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.440]
It's called Dominic and Eugene.

[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:48.860]
Oh, yeah, I heard about them.

[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:49.680]
My mother's saw it.

[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.140]
I really?

[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:52.480]
In fact, my mother's comment on Rainman,

[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:53.820]
which infuriated me,

[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.020]
she said,

[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:56.800]
it was a little long.

[01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:57.460]
Oh,

[01:58:57.740 --> 01:58:58.920]
that was all she had to say.

[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.800]
The acting was good, but it was a little long.

[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:02.640]
Like an egg timer.

[01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:03.580]
When you go into a movie,

[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:04.680]
it should be an hour and a half,

[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:05.680]
and at the end of the hour and a half,

[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.960]
the little alarm should go off to wake you up,

[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:09.060]
and then it's time to go home.

[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:10.240]
You know, and you killed a couple of hours.

[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:11.360]
But you're perfect,

[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:13.500]
but we can't expect mother Rogers to be perfect.

[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:13.880]
Yeah, all right.

[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.180]
I'm a perfect idiot, right?

[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:19.800]
Anyway, there was a song that was starting up,

[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:21.960]
while there was a pool room scene in Dominic and Eugene.

[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:23.220]
Yeah, I know it.

[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:23.740]
The eye-n-eye.

[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:24.880]
There were two bars.

[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:25.780]
There was...

[01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:26.940]
Can I say this?

[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.200]
An excited kidder ran through the crowd?

[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:30.440]
Really?

[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:32.580]
Yes, they were.

[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.180]
It was very recognizable.

[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.240]
The crowd, and there were very few in the crowd.

[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.000]
There were under 65, I believe.

[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:41.340]
No, they were...

[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:42.680]
They'd laughed along with the movie,

[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.000]
the way the rest of people did.

[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:44.920]
Really?

[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:46.940]
Of course, if I play that song,

[01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:48.120]
it may be Apple Plucky, friends.

[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:49.660]
No, very few are.

[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:53.200]
You've got a violent local minority that are just...

[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:57.460]
You know, God knows why they love you so much.

[01:59:58.420 --> 01:59:58.740]
Really?

[01:59:59.500 --> 01:59:59.820]
Yeah.

[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:02.240]
And Glenn, you're semi-wonderful.

[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:02.940]
Thank you, Sarah.

[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:03.500]
Okay, sir.

[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:05.540]
Have a good life, and don't bother comments again.

[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:06.480]
Okay, Jackass.

[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:08.820]
127 at WIOD.

[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:10.340]
I don't have any idea what his story was.

[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:11.440]
We have an open line in date.

[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:12.360]
I think, did I say that?

[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:13.200]
Or am I...

[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:13.820]
I'm losing it.

[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.700]
There's a cut, very confusing there.

[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:17.260]
It's like, I don't know what just happened.

[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:18.240]
And you're showing me.

[02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:19.260]
Who came in and cheered at that?

[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:21.120]
I was visiting somebody in a hospital,

[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:22.080]
and they wouldn't let her in,

[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:23.180]
and Steve went running out,

[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:23.880]
and they're just...

[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:24.620]
I mean, there's no emergency.

[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:25.660]
I don't want anybody to panic,

[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:26.920]
but it was just strange.

[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:27.360]
Why not?

[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:29.700]
I don't think we got through to Steve at all.

[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.220]
I think he was rather oblivious.

[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:32.120]
Am I wrong?

[02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:32.780]
That's Steve.

[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.660]
I think he was a little oblivious

[02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:35.720]
at the point I was trying to make.

[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:38.320]
It's not like I'm thin-skinned,

[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:39.580]
and I don't want people ripping me on air,

[02:00:39.660 --> 02:00:40.520]
because it goes on all the time.

[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:43.060]
But I don't think it's a topic for a show,

[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:44.560]
especially on this station.

[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:46.200]
Yeah, I don't think he...

[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:47.980]
You're right, I don't think I got the message.

[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:49.840]
It's just like, it's a gratuitous kind of thing,

[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:50.880]
and if I don't want him to do it,

[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:51.520]
he won't do it anymore.

[02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:52.580]
That's not the point.

[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:53.560]
It just...

[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:54.080]
And not only that,

[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:55.500]
it wasn't in the least bit entertaining,

[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:56.640]
because it was the same thing,

[02:00:56.820 --> 02:00:59.200]
over and over and over again.

[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.380]
Just different variations on the same thing,

[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.060]
but they all sounded the same.

[02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:06.200]
And it was basically the same thing.

[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:08.140]
Either I'm disgusting and grotesque,

[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:08.840]
and it all like me,

[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:11.300]
or you're a cackling idiot,

[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.620]
and they've been listening to me for years,

[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:13.140]
et cetera.

[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.000]
Now, I don't know where they just came from.

[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:17.460]
This is part of this AM crowd again,

[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:19.060]
and they've lost us for a year.

[02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:21.740]
But what about the year that I was on I&Z

[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:23.220]
and the daytime from 10 to 2,

[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.180]
doing the same stuff?

[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:25.640]
That's what I don't understand.

[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:26.580]
Puzzled at that.

[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:29.860]
Because you were there most of that time.

[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:31.120]
We're doing the same kind of stuff,

[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.060]
even wilder and wackier and whatever.

[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.640]
And they just...

[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:37.580]
It's like in their minds that never happened.

[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.680]
I mean, how many substance are your soul, Rodgers?

[02:01:40.940 --> 02:01:41.300]
Any what?

[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:41.960]
Substance.

[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:42.780]
Substance.

[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.440]
There's a substance in this call,

[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:47.820]
but federal law prohibits us from naming it.

[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:49.140]
Okay, it begins with an S.

[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:55.320]
Okay.

[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:56.020]
Rodgers.

[02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:56.800]
Okay, Rodgers.

[02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:56.800]

[02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:57.880]
Okay, Rodgers.

[02:01:58.020 --> 02:01:59.660]
You all better save y'all, Mr. Macho.

[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:01.380]
This is one of those guys going down to the wrestling

[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:02.540]
every Wednesday night,

[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:05.040]
and watching a bunch of panties and tights

[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:06.300]
running around, tumbling and grappling

[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:07.420]
with each other in a ring.

[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.700]
Mr. Macho.

[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:12.460]
751.

[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:13.820]
WIOD and THADE.

[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:14.740]
We have an open line there.

[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:16.820]
If you move quick, we can get in with our last wonderful call.

[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:17.520]
We just came in.

[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:19.020]
Was he going?

[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:20.060]
Everyone was in such a good mood

[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:22.480]
until we had that little episode a few minutes ago

[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:25.020]
where we rehashed all of this good stuff.

[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:27.120]
We don't have any substance on this show.

[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:28.280]
So we talk about nothing but

[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:29.620]
frivolity and foolishness,

[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:32.060]
nonsense, and that's what it is.

[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:32.800]
And if you don't like it,

[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:34.220]
you can stick it in your ear, okay?

[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.840]
Or wherever else it might fit.

[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:37.820]
My macho friend.

[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:39.540]
Anyway,

[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:42.180]
it's 133.

[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:43.660]
April War of the Mistani by now.

[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:45.220]
And we don't want that guy to tune out now

[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:46.980]
because one of the things that all the macho guys

[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:48.240]
do when April comes over the headlines

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:50.180]
where they immediately grasp their crotch.

[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:51.100]
Mm-hmm.

[02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:52.960]
And then they get up and they run out

[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.120]
into the hallway and then all the women

[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:55.200]
who are crotch watchers

[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.300]
that will have something to look at.

[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:57.460]
Okay, so anyway, April is here

[02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:58.740]
to stimulate the minds,

[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.000]
the brains of our intellectuals

[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:01.420]
and the audience,

[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:02.300]
and we'll come right back.

[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:08.240]
That's when it's a little off.

[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:09.280]
Happy day.

[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:12.260]
I think if I could kill it,

[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:14.280]
it would be fantastic to kill this up.

[02:03:15.220 --> 02:03:16.020]
Back to the beginning.

[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:17.260]
I gotta wait for it.

[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.260]
And then played both of them at the same time.

[02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:19.940]
Good, good.

[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:23.460]
Of course, God only knows how much it is done.

[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:25.960]
Oh, 30 seconds.

[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:27.000]
All right, we'll wait.

[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:29.020]
136, let's go to Miramar.

[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:29.400]
Hello.

[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:30.520]
Hi, Neil.

[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:31.040]
Hi.

[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.540]
I'm a first time caller.

[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.100]
I met you at the ice cream shop

[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:35.060]
the last year.

[02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:36.140]
I'll be darned.

[02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:37.000]
You know, the ice cream shop

[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:37.900]
that isn't there anymore.

[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:38.920]
That isn't there anymore.

[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:40.500]
They really knew their business, didn't they?

[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:42.280]
There was no one in there.

[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:43.440]
Yeah, they had no clue.

[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:44.480]
They had no clue.

[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.480]
Well, I wanted to call and tell you that

[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.840]
I have enough substance in my life in other ways

[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.360]
that I love this show because it is frivolous

[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.000]
and doesn't have any substance.

[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.820]
Yeah, and we don't claim to have any substance.

[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:57.380]
I mean, you know, if a show claims

[02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:59.940]
to be substantive and re-tackle of the issues

[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:00.740]
and there's nothing there,

[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:01.620]
then you can rip it.

[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.780]
But we don't make any claims to have any substance.

[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:05.180]
This is escape.

[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:06.360]
This is total escape.

[02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:06.960]
It isn't.

[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:08.020]
It's wonderful escape.

[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:09.500]
Everybody needs to escape.

[02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:10.560]
I know I sure do.

[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:13.020]
The old people need to escape.

[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:14.280]
They just don't know it.

[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:15.240]
Oh, I wish they would.

[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.080]
Oh, God.

[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:17.720]
I'll go home and pray.

[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.320]
And I'd like to say to Glenn

[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.760]
that yesterday I heard the show yesterday.

[02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:26.120]
And I want to say to Glenn that I identify with him.

[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:29.740]
I feel like that he is like one of the audience out there

[02:04:29.740 --> 02:04:33.320]
and he can respond to you and laugh like we would laugh.

[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:33.820]
Mm-hmm.

[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:34.680]
That's it.

[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.360]
I just laugh.

[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:36.660]
He makes me laugh.

[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:37.560]
It's not fake.

[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:38.500]
It's not funny.

[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.480]
Well, I feel like that I really did

[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:42.880]
if I would be and I'm missing you

[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.740]
at the ice cream shop last year.

[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:46.620]
Oh, I was there one time.

[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:49.080]
Maybe you were one time and he was inside

[02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:50.300]
which was his first mistake.

[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.680]
And he got squeezed by a pressure with a crowd.

[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:55.180]
I'll put up against the ice cream.

[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.240]
What would you call it?

[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:56.860]
The...

[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:57.800]
What's it called?

[02:04:58.720 --> 02:04:58.960]
Yeah.

[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:00.900]
He got squeezed up against the counter

[02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:03.380]
and just surrounded squashed.

[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.140]
And what's it called?

[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:05.040]
Yes.

[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:06.980]
What's the ice cream?

[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:07.440]
Yeah.

[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:08.020]
Yeah, I bet.

[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.760]
Well, that's what I wanted to call and tell you

[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:12.920]
about that I love you show.

[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.300]
And it's just an escape for me.

[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:15.900]
Thank you.

[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:16.920]
That was a nice tinkle.

[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:19.600]
And you didn't even do it in the hot tub.

[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.100]
Mm-hmm.

[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:20.860]
Have a nice day.

[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:21.620]
Thank you.

[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:21.920]
Bye-bye.

[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:23.500]
138 at WIOD.

[02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:24.420]
There's an open light in brown.

[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:25.620]
If you move real fast now,

[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:28.300]
524 at WIOD on your heavy substance station.

[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:31.820]
We have more substance on issue.

[02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:33.180]
And if you got a big shovel man,

[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:34.400]
just you can collect it.

[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:36.100]
So we got that all straightened out.

[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.640]
This rich man, he is just...

[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:41.360]
Maybe he ought to be like my bodyguard.

[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:42.720]
Like that, would that be unique?

[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:44.560]
That would be incredible.

[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:46.900]
Yeah.

[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:48.300]
That's the word.

[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:52.340]
In fact, you know, when the girl from the AP came this morning,

[02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:57.020]
I thought I was driving in and I heard Mike and Henry were talking about her being here.

[02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:59.900]
And I thought, wouldn't it be fun if you posed to the picture

[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.020]
in order that you were made?

[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:01.700]
I would be tremendous.

[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:02.720]
You could have been all over the country.

[02:06:03.240 --> 02:06:04.040]
You almost did that one.

[02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:05.220]
Yeah, we can all...

[02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:09.260]
This was when I was doing hurricanes baseball for channel 33 a couple of years ago.

[02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:13.840]
And that was at the time when Rich bought up 700 pounds of food from Valeniz on the first night.

[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:15.680]
And I said, you know, greasy and I would love to eat,

[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:18.160]
but not while we're on television, but everybody else picked out.

[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:21.780]
And I had been invited and never came off anyway,

[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.900]
but I've been invited by some...

[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:25.720]
Who was it from the Herald?

[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:27.700]
Some reporter, not Lucy Cooper,

[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:30.180]
but some other restaurant lady from the Herald.

[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:31.720]
She wanted me to eat at...

[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:32.100]
Where was it?

[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:32.860]
The Rask...

[02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:36.600]
Oh, the round table on Helen Dale Beach and a little of our.

[02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:37.540]
We were supposed to meet there.

[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:41.440]
And as it turned out, it never materialized, but we had it all set up and then Rich

[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:42.580]
chickened out at the last...

[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:46.900]
Never materialized, but we had it all set up and then Rich chickened out at the last minute.

[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:49.500]
But he was going to go there and present himself as me.

[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.380]
And he was going to have a photographer with her and they were going to write a thing about me

[02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:57.640]
and restaurants and a rascal house and Helen Dale and the old people and this and that.

[02:06:57.980 --> 02:07:00.000]
And it would have been one of the great putons in history.

[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.920]
And of course, you know I would just love to give a little stilts to the Herald,

[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:06.640]
after what they've done to me over the years, but it just never quite came off.

[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:08.920]
But there's always the next time.

[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.380]
Port of Miami.

[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:12.360]
Good afternoon Uncle Neal.

[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:14.120]
Are you coming or going?

[02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:17.540]
My coming? Well, at the pens of Pound Witch Inn, we're talking about it.

[02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:17.860]
Exactly.

[02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:22.600]
Anyway, it's just been a long time since I talked to you, an old former co-worker

[02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:25.120]
and a long-time listener.

[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:25.760]
Really?

[02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:27.000]
Now you get one guess.

[02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:29.100]
I don't have any idea what it is.

[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:30.180]
Stuart Ellie.

[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:32.140]
Oh my god.

[02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:35.200]
Well, I guess that answers that first question, former.

[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:39.500]
Now did they used to call you boy wonder years ago?

[02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:40.420]
Uh, seventy-five.

[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:41.940]
Among many other things, yeah.

[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:42.340]
Yeah.

[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:44.080]
I remember when you were boy wonder.

[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:45.140]
Hi, yes.

[02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:46.300]
Yeah, the girl.

[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:47.020]
So have you kids been?

[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.400]
What an incredible show.

[02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:49.800]
What does that mean?

[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:54.680]
Boy, I tell you, if there's a dumpster outside, I'd like to unload a few people.

[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:55.400]
Uh-huh.

[02:07:55.720 --> 02:07:58.300]
But, uh, no, I just called to say hello and it's been a long time.

[02:07:58.480 --> 02:07:59.240]
Sure has.

[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:01.580]
Nice to hear you kids up and around.

[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:02.740]
What are you doing these days, Stuart?

[02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:03.900]
I hope you got out of this business.

[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:06.760]
No, I hate to tell you I got back into it in May.

[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:07.920]
Oh god.

[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:12.040]
I'm working for the former Sunifox radio station.

[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:12.880]
Oh yeah.

[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:13.360]
Yeah.

[02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:14.280]
Why?

[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:18.580]
It won't be sunny over there in the mornings anymore.

[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.500]
Well, I won't elaborate on that.

[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:21.100]
But yeah.

[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:22.700]
Sunni will be all right.

[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:25.440]
I'm working a part-time full time there.

[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.220]
Great.

[02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:29.180]
And uh, you're like kind of the Johnny Dolan of Y 100.

[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:29.540]
Uh-huh.

[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:31.300]
Oh, gee, thanks Neil.

[02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:32.500]
Well, I wasn't a knock.

[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:34.100]
Johnny's over here at GTR.

[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:34.740]
He's a good guy.

[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:35.620]
He shows up everywhere.

[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:37.020]
He just won't go away, you know.

[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:39.260]
Well, he's a survivor.

[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:41.980]
It's only been three stations in 14 years.

[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:43.040]
I mean, that's pretty good.

[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:44.140]
It's all over the place.

[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:50.460]
Anyway, it's good to hear you and Glenn and uh, good luck with everything.

[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:51.340]
Thank you, Stuart.

[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:52.040]
Cheer up a little bit.

[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:52.880]
Well, you thought that'd be.

[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:53.400]
I'll try.

[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:54.620]
Okay, enjoy your late.

[02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:55.000]
Bye.

[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:56.660]
Stuart Elliott.

[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.760]
Now, he was also at the ice cream store.

[02:08:59.060 --> 02:08:59.960]
Well, he came by, yeah.

[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:01.780]
With his brother, I think, or with somebody.

[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:02.580]
That's right.

[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:03.220]

[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:03.560]
See?

[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:03.980]
Yeah.

[02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:07.520]
So the last lady you called, we met at the ice cream store in Stuart Elliott.

[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.340]
We didn't meet him, but he came by the ice cream store.

[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:12.180]
And I was about to say, and I got sidetracked,

[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:16.720]
that the best promotions that we ever did were the ones that had nothing to do

[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:18.780]
with INZ or Zeta.

[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:21.780]
The best things were the ones that Stan and I did spontaneously.

[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:23.500]
Those two or three at the ice cream store.

[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:25.900]
And it was funny because we just used to start, well,

[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:27.740]
we're a whole bunch of reasons why we started going over there.

[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:29.360]
That little girl Michelle was working there.

[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:31.160]
Brian and that other kid working there.

[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:33.540]
Who just happened to be fantastic young people.

[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:34.280]
It looked very good.

[02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:36.320]
We've always said that looking is not the sin.

[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.440]
And we used to joke about that.

[02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:41.040]
And then all of a sudden, it developed into like a cult thing.

[02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:43.280]
And we started hanging out over there and meet a lot of listeners.

[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:46.400]
And then we announced formally.

[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.440]
And I never forget that were you there the first night?

[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:49.760]
No, the second time.

[02:09:49.940 --> 02:09:51.260]
The first night was in the rain.

[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:51.700]
Yeah.

[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:52.740]
We were legitimately at least.

[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:53.500]
I was there.

[02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:54.600]
That was the second night.

[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:57.200]
It was pouring rain the night I was there.

[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:58.520]
There were these two thousand people there.

[02:09:58.520 --> 02:09:59.740]
And you were jammed inside.

[02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:00.940]
I never did get inside that.

[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.580]
Now you couldn't get anywhere near the inside.

[02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:06.140]
We just surrounded crushed up against the ice cream company.

[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:08.260]
It was like a stormy August night.

[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:10.580]
There had been tornado warnings in the city.

[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:12.820]
It had tornadoes and it was just pouring.

[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:14.360]
Harrenda's night.

[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:16.760]
And I go up there to Lauderdale Hill.

[02:10:17.180 --> 02:10:18.700]
And there's like two thousand people.

[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:21.620]
I know it was in this little shopping center.

[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:24.080]
Yeah, in a strip shopping center that's in receivership.

[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:24.760]
Yeah, it did.

[02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:27.280]
And the ice cream store has long since been out of business.

[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:28.700]
Most of the places in it,

[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:29.600]
Plasma have been out of business.

[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:33.440]
And then we did the one where we drove up in the Ferrari.

[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:35.200]
I was in there that day.

[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:36.300]
They drove me up in the Ferrari.

[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:39.040]
And Beth was there that night.

[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:40.360]
Well, Beth was there.

[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.640]
It was quite an occasion.

[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:45.240]
And she was rubbing up against Dave and trees.

[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.500]
Dr. Deathmell, Dr. Deathmell, we haven't heard from him in a long time.

[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:53.380]
He's got his act together.

[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:56.200]
And not that we're complaining.

[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:58.180]
I mean, we just hope he's well and he's out there.

[02:10:58.200 --> 02:10:59.500]
He doesn't have to call. We're sure he's fine.

[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.120]
A 144 at WIOD.

[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:03.800]
But anyway, the ice cream store thing for great.

[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:04.340]
Yeah.

[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:05.220]
Right at night.

[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:06.240]
That's for nights.

[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:07.140]
And it was chaotic.

[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:09.060]
And I like that when it's a little bit chaotic.

[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:11.060]
The only one that the station did,

[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:12.960]
that really turned out with a huge turnout

[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.520]
was at the Broward Mall.

[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:16.740]
No, not the phone place.

[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:18.020]
No, you're going to say the telephoto.

[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:19.640]
That was incredible.

[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:22.780]
And also at the Zoom, remember that?

[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:23.980]
And nobody could find us.

[02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:24.200]
Right.

[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:25.300]
David Lee.

[02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:27.740]
And they were very hostile about that.

[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:28.340]
The station good.

[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.080]
Wow, we had this big day out there.

[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:31.520]
We had the concert in Richard Marx.

[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:32.280]
And we had a big time.

[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.040]
But we went out there and froze our buns on, by the way.

[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:37.240]
I mean, it was freezing.

[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:38.560]
And they had us under this little tent.

[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.320]
And they put us in a place where nobody could find us at all.

[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:43.560]
And then the next morning, we had all these people calling and saying,

[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:44.680]
we drove all the way down there.

[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:47.400]
And when the metro zoos like going to South America,

[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:48.680]
I mean, it's in the middle of nowhere.

[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:50.200]
And we couldn't find you.

[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.380]
And nobody knew where anything was going on.

[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:54.440]
Remember the wind whipping through there?

[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.080]
They had a few hundred.

[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:55.820]
Like it was yesterday.

[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:56.580]
Reason.

[02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:57.300]
God.

[02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.620]
Absolutely freezing up on a little platform.

[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:00.880]
And under that tent.

[02:12:01.060 --> 02:12:02.120]
And then some of the people came by.

[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.760]
Wondered why we were a little sour that day.

[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:04.780]
We were signing those pictures.

[02:12:05.740 --> 02:12:06.980]
By the way, those pictures.

[02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:08.680]
Haven't we're supposed to get?

[02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:10.600]
Okay, let's go to Lauderdale.

[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:10.900]
Hello.

[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:11.700]
Hi.

[02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:12.840]
Hi.

[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.300]
This is my first time listening to you.

[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:15.880]
Really?

[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:16.480]
Yeah.

[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:17.840]
What a shock, huh?

[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:18.300]
Yeah.

[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:19.940]
Our friend of mine.

[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:24.200]
Listen to you every day at work.

[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:24.780]
Right.

[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:28.260]
And I run to Carl and tell him that I'm listening to him.

[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:30.000]
I'm listening to you guys really.

[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:31.160]
And you guys are a joke.

[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:32.920]
You're great.

[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:35.860]
But he turned me on to you guys.

[02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:39.000]
What is this guy's first name?

[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.240]
His name is David.

[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:40.900]
Oh David.

[02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:41.380]
Oh David.

[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:43.220]
David is a real douchebag.

[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:43.500]
Yeah.

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:44.480]
Great.

[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:45.180]
Okay.

[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:46.180]
Well, I was a good call.

[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:47.260]
It's 146.

[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:48.040]
I got it.

[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:48.880]
146.

[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:50.180]
It's a W-I-O-D.

[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:56.840]
Oh, and I think he's probably out there confused wondering

[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.900]
why she's hearing that dial tone in the phone right now.

[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:01.580]
And I realized it was your first time.

[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:01.920]
Okay.

[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:04.440]
But there are certain words, you know,

[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:05.700]
that we would prefer avoiding,

[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:07.320]
and a seriously avoiding.

[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:08.440]
Like the one that you said,

[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.500]
let's start it with an S.

[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:11.720]
And we can't say that.

[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:12.200]
Oh.

[02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:14.020]
There are occasions when we were like,

[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:15.300]
why she was happy, you know.

[02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:17.760]
And she was having a good time.

[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:18.040]
Oh yeah.

[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.620]
So probably four sheets to the wind.

[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:23.380]
Anyway, it's 146 at W-I-D.

[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:25.700]
But anyway, it's 150 at W-I-O-D.

[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:27.840]
And moving right along,

[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.880]
what were we just talking about there during the break?

[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:31.760]
Just before we came back,

[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:34.940]
I had something devastating that I wanted to say.

[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:36.720]
Okay, I must have been really important.

[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:38.120]
Now we got a pay phone here.

[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:40.720]
Some really big information on big-breasted Oriental women.

[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:41.800]
Hey, how's it going?

[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:42.360]
Okay.

[02:13:42.860 --> 02:13:43.800]
Listen, I want one more person.

[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:45.020]
Are you been doing some research?

[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:46.980]
I know I'm sorry about that, but

[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:49.960]
the host is over there in Denny's, man.

[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.740]
Biggest brush you can imagine.

[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:52.600]
And she's from China.

[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:53.400]
I mean, thirdly.

[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:53.800]
Really?

[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:54.860]
Yeah, for real, man.

[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:58.280]
But anyway, it's the first time call it long time listener.

[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:01.920]
Yeah, in fact, I was in at the same Denny's a few weeks ago,

[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:03.100]
and even have a little thing in the menu,

[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:05.080]
which is under the chicken items.

[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:06.680]
It says the biggest breast in town.

[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:07.480]
Oh, no doubt.

[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:08.200]
Yeah.

[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:09.800]
Okay, we're going to check it out.

[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:11.160]
All right, so how's it going, guy?

[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:11.880]
Fantastic.

[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:14.120]
We're having a wonderful day, and the best part of it is,

[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:14.920]
it's almost over.

[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:15.780]
No doubt, man.

[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:16.740]
Okay, you have to go.

[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:17.860]
I like you guys, man.

[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.060]
I don't care if the Glen, you know,

[02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:21.380]
Cackles or whatever you do, man.

[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:22.540]
Because you guys make a good team.

[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:23.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:24.220]
You can't break a good word, brother.

[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:25.020]
Okay, bye.

[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:25.640]

[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:25.900]

[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.040]
151 at WIOMD.

[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:29.500]
We just had a report on a Chinese,

[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:31.140]
was she a waitress, did he say?

[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:32.100]
Yeah, Denny's.

[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:33.300]
As Denny's in Halendale,

[02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:34.980]
has got enormous breasts.

[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:36.800]
According to this young man,

[02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:39.260]
who's been doing some very, very heavy research.

[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.460]
So to speak, ponderous.

[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:42.680]
Pangeless ponderous research.

[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:43.900]
Who is that lady that was out there?

[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.220]
Because I can't see she is more,

[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.080]
she is more see from the.

[02:14:47.140 --> 02:14:48.960]
Oh, yes, she's a nice lady.

[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:50.360]
All kinds of stuff is breaking.

[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:51.980]
Hell is breaking loose on this story.

[02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:52.340]
Really?

[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:54.720]
Now, you were, it was on the today's show this morning,

[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:55.280]
nationwide.

[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:56.460]
No, I was not aware of that.

[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:57.160]
So there it is.

[02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:59.660]
I mean, we're getting more and more of the USA today.

[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:01.240]
The poetry, yes, I saw that.

[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:02.040]
I saw that.

[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:04.540]
Today's show did a long, long story on that.

[02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:06.980]
So even at the risk of calling people, you know,

[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:09.020]
stereotyping and calling people old farts,

[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:11.520]
I would say that this is definitely an old farts story.

[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:14.100]
It's, you know, the epitome of everything that's wrong

[02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:17.300]
in this community is that we have too many people of that mindset

[02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:19.780]
who want to be miserable and hostile and nasty.

[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:21.300]
We have no heart, no compassion.

[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:24.660]
We just want to lock themselves away with people

[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:28.020]
of their own hateful mentality and shut the world out.

[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:30.780]
Well, it's an interesting, it's more subtle in that.

[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:32.480]
Because there are, you know, you keep talking about

[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:34.800]
Heather, the old fart mentality and then they're older people

[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:36.320]
who are nice decent.

[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:37.020]
And there are many of them.

[02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:39.800]
So real division at viewpoint and they have

[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:41.800]
fielded a slate of compassionate people

[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:44.440]
who run for the board and the selection that's in the next few weeks.

[02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:47.100]
And we're talking to all the folks at the viewpoint tonight

[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:49.860]
that some really nice and compassionate people out there

[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:53.100]
and with any kind of luck, we're hoping to get the new slate voted in.

[02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:56.320]
And I think it's just a handful of stubborn old

[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:59.120]
fart that are, you know, that are on the board now.

[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.420]
The man said this morning on the today's show,

[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:04.060]
he said they're not asking them to change any rules.

[02:16:04.060 --> 02:16:04.460]
That's right.

[02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:06.840]
He says all they want is to let her stay there

[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:08.140]
until they sell the condos.

[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:08.580]
That's correct.

[02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:10.980]
And also there is a thing in the bylaws that says that

[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:14.200]
the board of directors without threatening the adult status

[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:18.120]
of the community can vote in a hardship case to let one child in

[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:21.520]
without endangering the adult status of the community,

[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.160]
which is what we're trying to do, you know.

[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.500]
So it'll be interesting to see what I'm going to do.

[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:26.560]
Mm-hmm.

[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:29.260]
All they're asking for is just a little understanding compassion.

[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:30.420]
And that's what you're worth.

[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:33.320]
There's a whole group of people over there who just can't find it.

[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:34.400]
That's exactly right.

[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:36.660]
That's what the role says in the anthem of course the law.

[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:38.180]
And once we make the first exception,

[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.920]
we'll have a whole bunch of noisy little kids.

[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:42.620]
Oh yeah, they talk to these neighbors and say,

[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:45.160]
it's not our problem just because they have kids.

[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:46.820]
I want, you know, we don't care.

[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:47.600]
Can you believe it?

[02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:49.040]
Oh, but there are a lot of very,

[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.760]
listen, I've heard from more and more

[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:52.000]
the people that live out of the viewpoint

[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:52.920]
that are real nice people.

[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:54.000]
And I think we're going to hopefully,

[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.120]
we've got to hope they're in a majority.

[02:16:55.340 --> 02:16:55.660]
That's all.

[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:57.360]
We're going to go out tonight and try to talk to them

[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.060]
and talk to each other.

[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:00.580]
Okay, that's coming up, too.

[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:02.340]
Jamie will be here in Jill and Lynn.

[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:03.500]
And Marcy is here.

[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:07.460]
Unfortunately, the other side has declined to appear.

[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:08.040]
Am I correct?

[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:10.620]
Oh yeah, they won't come on the show.

[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:11.680]
They won't talk to you.

[02:17:12.060 --> 02:17:12.620]
Sharon on the phone.

[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:14.840]
All the Aussies just in hiding.

[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:16.280]
It was fascinating though,

[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.240]
then the day that you were given the number out

[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:19.380]
and then we gave it out the next day

[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:22.560]
that they were using, that same old ploy about.

[02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:24.320]
Well, our lawyer is going to be calling you

[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:26.860]
and stop these people from calling here and so on and so forth.

[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:29.040]
You know, people have a right of free speech within reason.

[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:31.260]
As long as it's not harassment.

[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:33.080]
Exactly. I'm hoping this thing will...

[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:35.500]
I don't usually get involved to this degree in these cases

[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:36.860]
because usually it's a no-one situation.

[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:38.220]
But I have real hope on this case

[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:39.600]
that something can be done.

[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:40.160]
Excellent.

[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:42.800]
Okay, that's coming up, too, on a Steve Kinchel.

[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:43.520]
Let's go to Hollywood.

[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:43.900]
Hello.

[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:44.960]
Hello, Neil.

[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:45.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:47.500]
I've been studying this question

[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:48.900]
of the people that have a radio

[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:50.500]
that only has one station on it.

[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:51.700]
Yeah, the Frozen Dial Syndrome.

[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:53.580]
Yeah, but actually it's true that...

[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:55.500]
If I Frank Sinatra is coming out in a movie

[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:57.020]
with Henry Fonda, pretty soon,

[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:58.220]
it's a sequel to the China Syndrome.

[02:17:58.220 --> 02:17:59.440]
It's called The Frozen Dial Syndrome.

[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:00.780]
Don't want to let me know.

[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:01.940]
Which is going to be brainwashed

[02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:03.100]
in the listening of WOLD.

[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:05.720]
It's kind of like a spin-off on the Manchurian candidate.

[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:06.880]
It's tying all those in together.

[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:08.500]
Well, talk about nostalgia.

[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:10.940]
But during the 30s,

[02:18:10.980 --> 02:18:13.460]
the Nazis issued a radio to the people in Germany

[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:15.180]
with only had one station.

[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:15.540]
Yeah.

[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.620]
And my guess is that those radios

[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:20.500]
have picked up at a fire sale around here

[02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:21.760]
and being sold to the old people.

[02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:22.780]
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:24.240]
And if Ernie finds out about it,

[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:25.600]
I wouldn't really be ticked. I'll tell you.

[02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:27.120]
Well, you guys, we'll do an exposure.

[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:29.480]
I'll let you know if I find any of those radios.

[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.440]
And you're doing great commercials.

[02:18:31.700 --> 02:18:32.320]
One other thing.

[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:36.400]
You do commercials for char-hut and for neuter systems.

[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:37.140]
That is correct.

[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:38.620]
Well, not at the same time.

[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:40.540]
Well, yeah, that's what I had in mind.

[02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:43.660]
Because I can hardly get into the char-hut at Hollywood now.

[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:45.060]
It's so crowded with your listeners.

[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:47.100]
And I see a lot of stylish women

[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:48.500]
there carrying the neuter systems,

[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:49.160]
they're pro-shores.

[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:50.520]
Does that tell you something?

[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:51.880]
Great. Well, see, if you lose enough,

[02:18:51.980 --> 02:18:52.960]
you can afford to go over there

[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:54.460]
and cheat a little bit every now and then.

[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:56.220]
Well, yeah, I'm going to have to get the neuter systems

[02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:57.880]
before I try to get in that door again.

[02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:58.320]
Okay.

[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:00.360]
That's what Fat Riches is doing.

[02:19:00.460 --> 02:19:01.860]
If he tried to get into the door at Hollywood

[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:02.720]
and couldn't do it,

[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:03.880]
there was nobody in the store either.

[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:05.720]
But that's another story.

[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:07.140]
Now, Linda, is Linda here in the building?

[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:08.600]
I haven't seen her yet.

[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:09.420]
Splendon the phone?

[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:11.900]
Okay, let's go to Miami.

[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:12.280]
Hello.

[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:12.940]
Hello.

[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:13.360]
Yeah.

[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:15.500]
Yeah, I've never been to the ice cream store.

[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:18.020]
I do hang out at the baseball card shop at Homestown though.

[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.920]
Great. Well, Steve will be down to seeing it.

[02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:23.080]
I have time for an Ernie story.

[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:24.260]
Sure, anything you like.

[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:25.520]
As long as you don't bash him too hard.

[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:26.180]
No, no, no.

[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:27.620]
I will make an exception in his case.

[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.580]
A week ago, Ernie started the show right after the cop killing

[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:36.020]
and spent the first hour just pouring his heart out,

[02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:37.440]
pouring his heart out on the subject,

[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:40.720]
just gun control and this and that,

[02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:41.320]
this and that.

[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:44.160]
And the first color he took was a little low lady.

[02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:46.260]
And she said, hello, Ernie.

[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:49.340]
Did you ever solve the toilet paper?

[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:52.420]
Yeah, we've been writing no question about it.

[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:55.120]
Ernie was speechless for the first time in his life.

[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:57.920]
Well, see, that's called from the school of wishful thinking.

[02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.460]
A lot of those old parts would like to need the toilet paper.

[02:20:00.580 --> 02:20:01.820]
Most of them have no use for it,

[02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:05.040]
because they haven't had a good BM in months, you know, in years.

[02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:07.280]
Some of them, but they can always hope.

[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:08.400]
Well, it happens, everybody.

[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:09.560]
Where there's life, there's hope.

[02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:10.400]
Well, good luck.

[02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:11.420]
Backward shouldn't happen.

[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:12.120]
Thanks a lot.

[02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:14.120]
Yeah, that's Ernie's motto as a matter of fact,

[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:15.180]
where there's life, there's hope.

[02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.060]
And to believe me, if you listen to me show long enough,

[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:18.120]
you'll find a little bit of each.

[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:19.580]
North Miami Beach, hello.

[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.320]
Yeah, Neil, you made the hell of the hell.

[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:25.880]
Well, judges, page 5A, Neil Rogers was pulling down top rated talk show.

[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:26.640]
Yeah.

[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:27.800]
My Karen Conway.

[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:28.420]
Terrific.

[02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:30.320]
Well, it's interesting, because Karen never spoke to me,

[02:20:30.420 --> 02:20:32.040]
but from what I understand, there are things in there

[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:33.280]
which we can't discuss on the air.

[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:35.460]
But it's always good to have it in a hell of a nail digest,

[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:36.860]
because that's one of my favorite papers.

[02:20:37.140 --> 02:20:37.820]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:38.800]
So you can see it.

[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:40.880]
They used to send it to me every week at the,

[02:20:41.340 --> 02:20:43.300]
or just another one of those things that clung up the mailbox.

[02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:45.520]
Thank God, they haven't discovered we're here yet,

[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:47.340]
or else they don't have the postage.
