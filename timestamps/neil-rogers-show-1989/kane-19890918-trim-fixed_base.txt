[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]
And a very good afternoon to you ladies and gentlemen. It is six minutes after two o'clock

[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.400]
On a day that will live in infamy

[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.640]
Monday, September 18

[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.300]
1989, I am Steve Cain. We have an incredible debate of the giant scheduled for you today

[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.560]
seated to my left inappropriately to my left the good right-revenue Virgin Jason Paulus and

[00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.830]
Presently in the men's room on his way up here as we speak

[00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.710]
Uncle Neil Rogers are gonna cross swords and Jason I was gonna give you a big speech today about not getting involved in

[00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.330]
Theology and stuff like that but Uncle Neil was an ex- I don't know if you know this but in the days when he used to do a meaningful talk show

[00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.530]
He is an expert in theology and will debate you point to point if you want to get off on that that would be fine on

[00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.810]
Everdick I personally would rather you know here you just both get involved in personal attack and leave the Bible out of it

[00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.370]
But Uncle Neil will be here momentarily. We want to thank the Miami dolphins and congratulate the Miami dolphins on a superb effort

[00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.310]
on Sunday and

[00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.770]
The really good news is we had a hundred bucks on the dolphins

[00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.850]
Because you know when they're playing a team that is totally decimated by injuries and they get six points or six and a half points

[00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.650]
What can you say?

[00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.590]
But it turned out very well as a sterling effort and who knows you know

[00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.670]
We don't want to get overly optimistic here, but we could be looking if we get lucky at a 500 season. I

[00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.050]
Supposed that's possible. I think that's the bed I had with Joseph Yankee last year. I bet I'm I bet that he bet they would finish over

[00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.410]
500 and I bet they would finish under 500. We'd bet a dinner at Burton Jackson

[00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.150]
Mm-hmm

[00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.890]
And when he chose lost out of the goodness of my heart I let him off the hook for it

[00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.790]
But well as possible I could win half of their games this year

[00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.710]
That's why you're a football fan certainly certainly and I'm not a pre-vent defense fan red blooded American wholesome

[00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.950]
That's true sport right the pre-vent defense has prevented the dolphins from winning for many years

[00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.350]
Mm-hmm, and a three-man line is prevented them from winning for many years

[00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.990]
So that is an expert on football here on the right little too macho for me that football

[00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.490]
Well anyway gentlemen, I guess suppose you're wondering why I've asked you here today. Is there any reason why I have such a short cord?

[00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.850]
No, you want you need a longer cord? No, it's alright. Oh you can just hold it near hand

[00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.010]
I can hold it in my hand so to say I don't like you Jason excited would you like to be on his left rather than his right?

[00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.550]
Whichever you prefer Jason I I came on you ever noticed that he looks a little like Jim Baker

[00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.590]
He's much taller than Jim Baker. No, sir. I'm not I'm not making that up basically looks a little like Jim Baker

[00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.290]
I could there's a certain resemblance for Jimmy's he's chasing better looking than Jim

[00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.310]
Don't you I'm not touching that line

[00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.610]
But I don't want to get him nervous. Can you turn this overhead on so I can hear it?

[00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.950]
Can't you hear the over?

[00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.130]
You're gonna run it on that's good. Okay. There you go

[00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.010]
Anyway, Jason. I you know uncle Neil has

[00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.130]
offered volunteer to be here today

[00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.910]
He is coming out of retirement in essence to do this because he doesn't do issues shows anymore

[00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.550]
But he was so outraged at some of the ridiculous and I mean in your last show I must admit

[00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.950]
So last show we did together you had did you even I got discussed oh you were taking a position and your position is on his side

[00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.170]
You know I am going to let me

[00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.430]
You know he doesn't have to take any position. Okay. I can handle

[00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.950]
I've done many shows like this in the past trust me

[00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.870]
He's just trying to set this up in a way to make it out of them now. Let me answer your question

[00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.530]
I'm let me explain my role here. Sure. All right. I am gonna

[00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.770]
You know you're gonna have more than your hands for with Uncle Neil

[00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.290]
And I'm gonna sort of sit back here and be a traffic cop and just kind of keep things orderly and keep you know

[00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.530]
People from killing each other, but basically I am going to attempt

[00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.930]
To sort of stay neutral in this thing you know sometimes you know we the best laid plans of my son man

[00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.290]
You know, but I don't really plan on on taking what is gonna be a massacre as uncle Neil wipes the floor with you and making it a

[00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.090]
An unfair massacre. I know that you're hope. Yes, of course you do have the Lord on your side, right? Yeah

[00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.830]
And I'm glad for that. Yeah, and it's also got the good book here

[00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.170]
Would you think that would more than compensate for even if uncle Neil and I decided to team up

[00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.810]
Wouldn't you say that the Lord and you would make a stronger combination? You guys are well known talk show hosts

[00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.530]
But the Lord is well known in the city and I

[00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.170]
The other hand I do not think that defensive homosexuality is going to

[00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.910]
Sit well with you wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's interesting defense seat you're way off to begin with no not at all

[00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.450]
I'm not going to defend homosexuality because I don't have to defend myself to you are anybody else are you a homosexual?

[00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.190]
Oh, here is this like the inquisition remember Turkey motto was another one of these good Christians who in the name of Christianity

[00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.410]
Did the same thing that Reverend Paul's

[00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.470]
You remember Joe McCoy like in the 50s

[00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.890]
Same thing that Turkey modded make everybody an offer that they can't refuse which is a good way to

[00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.970]
Spread his religion another would either accept it or we're gonna chop off your head

[00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.570]
It was a simple enough question. Are you a homosexual? No?

[00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.610]
Well, everybody knows that the answer is yes. How about you?

[00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.850]
I don't know how about you. How about you? What are you?

[00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.410]
I don't know well

[00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.270]
It's interesting if you don't listen to my show the outcome is I was driving home listening to your last appearance on Steve

[00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:22.990]
Show as you started your usual returus attack on homosexuality that you brought up my name if you don't listen to my show

[00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.690]
Then you know very little about me. I would assume I have heard how do you know that I'm a practicing homosexual?

[00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.930]
How do you know what I'm doing? Are you a practicing? I'm asking you don't answer

[00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.950]
Don't you're not Jewish so you can't ask answer a question with another question anybody can use that device

[00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.250]
I know but I asked you a reasonable question if we're gonna have any kind of a dialogue you Steve would call it here today

[00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.330]
I'll have a give and take now I asked you you ask me a question. Are you a homosexual?

[00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.510]
I answered yes. I have no problem with that and I asked you if you don't listen to my show as you claim

[00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.890]
Then how come for example one day as I was walking out of here

[00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.850]
You said something about you need to find the Lord or some of that usual porn again crap that people like yourself like to a spew

[00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.430]
I'm sorry. I don't understand the philosophy of live and let live

[00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.410]
I don't care as long as you don't harm anybody Reverend. I don't give a good damn what you do

[00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.610]
See and you should adopt the same philosophy

[00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.570]
No, I don't know I supposed to trying to save me because I don't want you to save me

[00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.090]
I want you to stop persecuting people. That's what you're doing and for you to come on

[00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.890]
Are you ready?

[00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.150]
You'll practice for you to come on his program and give a big song and a dance about other

[00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.270]
35-year-old virgin to be giving a song and a dance about other people's sex life would be like Dr.

[00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.370]
Mangle are coming on here giving a lecture on medical malpractice

[00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.890]
I don't let him get a word in here now go ahead Jason

[00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.110]
That was a very opening salvo. I must say but his analogy is clearly faulty

[00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.710]
You don't have to be involved in in bank robbing to know that bank robbing is wrong homosexuality is wrong

[00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.210]
I ask you if you're a practicing homosexual first of all because are you make a

[00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.570]
Because you make a statement

[00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.130]
I'm not going to sit here like we're in court on a witness thing

[00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.250]
What are you in my private life is none of your goddamn business?

[00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.030]
Okay, can you edit that out?

[00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.030]
No, we're not going to edit it out. It's not how I'm saying again. It's none of your goddamn business

[00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.330]
Well apparently even a liberal Supreme Court disagrees with you because they say that just because it occurs in the privacy of your own home

[00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.090]
Doesn't mean that it's not immoral or illegal really that it is really and you know that in the elite

[00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.950]
You know that if this in this state that a husband and wife have sex in other than the missionary position

[00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.610]
That's also illegal now would you like to go around peeping in people's bedroom windows?

[00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.350]
I would find out who's breaking the law

[00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.610]
I would disagree with the law

[00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.610]
The court says that's the law no, I disagree with your interpretation

[00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.630]
You can't ask you all you want

[00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.310]
You even know you even know what law that is you know the number of the law

[00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:45.390]
Oh, here we go. Do I know the number of the law really know I don't you're gonna tell you about the number of the Florida

[00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.070]
Sodomy Statute is what is it 800.0

[00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:55.390]
Boy, we got him even here. I haven't read you know something you said you don't have to do something to be an expert on it

[00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.150]
I'm gonna tell you the same thing. I don't have to know the number of the law. Are you a practicing?

[00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.770]
What the law is are you a practicing home?

[00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.630]
I asked you a question. Is this gonna be four hours of that? Is that what you're gonna do?

[00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.890]
If I might jump in here, I'd like to know the other question

[00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:15.110]
Excuse me every once in a while you're gonna have a chance to get a good one fruit to me if you're not willing to admit it

[00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.250]
I I'm wondering why I think some of your audience would like to know

[00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.970]
First of all I have admitted

[00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:25.610]
You know first of all let me ask let me ask you this question how many out of the closet homosexuals? Do you know in the media?

[00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.550]
How many can you name? I don't go around making that

[00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.370]
No, I'm asking can you answer me any question?

[00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.370]
We're not that's a silly question how many out of the closet people do you know in the media?

[00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.470]
I'd like you to name one besides me. I don't know many people in the media

[00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.370]
No, no, I'm not talking about

[00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:47.430]
How many people do you know who are out of the closet other than you telling you as he knows?

[00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:53.990]
But now that isn't enough that isn't enough for you now you want me to come on the year and tell people who I have sex with

[00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.910]
Where I do it when I do it etc

[00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:01.090]
That's not your business. That's not at all what I ask what I did ask is are you a practicing homosexual and it's taking

[00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.130]
Ten minutes and you still not answered the question. We're gonna take a break

[00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.170]
We're gonna take a break. I'm glad to answer the question

[00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.690]
I'm not gonna sit here and listen to the reverence in position for four hours this afternoon

[00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.430]
For example question if you want to be issues that's why we want to do that

[00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.130]
You want to deal with your hatred and your tolerance that's fine your practices are an issue

[00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:24.190]
When we really when we get back home reverend when we get back Uncle Neil says he will answer the question

[00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:29.970]
Then we will try to move on into more fertile ground with the good reverend right reverend with the

[00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.030]
Equalist you're listening to the Steve K show on 610 W I O D

[00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.870]
We are back on news talk radio 610 W I O D

[00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.750]
I just want to briefly announce as I will throughout the show. We have very exciting promotion arranged at playoffs

[00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.750]
We have acquired by hook and crook

[00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:51.610]
1968 Nolan Ryan rookie car in close to mint condition perfect coin is perfect centering this card goes

[00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:57.770]
There's highest $700 and we are going to be having a drawing for it at playoffs on October 2nd

[00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.690]
That's two Mondays from tonight and the only times you can

[00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:07.210]
Enter the contest or the drawing no purchase necessary you got to come to Monday night football either tonight

[00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.250]
Next Monday night or the night of the drawing which will be October 2nd

[00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.290]
So anybody who is a baseball card fan you're shot at a almost perfect

[00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.530]
Nolan Ryan rookie value close to $700

[00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.090]
So we're very excited about that anyway, you were gonna answer that just let's put him out of his misery Neil

[00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:31.210]
You know if your answer is yes, yeah, this is like doing stand major sure you keep turning that monitor down the overhead

[00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.830]
What about six and a half?

[00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.550]
Great wonderful. Yeah, the answer is yes does that make it?

[00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.510]
How are we?

[00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:44.470]
Half okay, let me know since I've answered no, we don't need to response answer the question. Do you masturbate?

[00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.670]
River? I

[00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:51.470]
Don't like the question. I've answered it for Steve K and the answer is negative. It's I don't think that's no good question

[00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.490]
I never have you do you have nocturnally missions?

[00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.670]
You know, I think you're way out of bounds

[00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:03.970]
Practicing homosexual and I'm asking you certainly a human being of your age of 35 years old cannot exist

[00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:10.470]
I think without a doubt no, I'm not out about biologically you cannot exist without having some kind of sexual release

[00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.290]
No, no, I assure you that's not true. Oh, it's not true. You can well, that's a biological miracle in other words

[00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.830]
You have semen inside of your body from what 30 years ago?

[00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.910]
Not 30 years ago maybe 25 years ago. I

[00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.350]
Is that what you're telling me your way out of bounds? No, I'm not your way out of

[00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.150]
No, I'm not because you're telling you on

[00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.750]
It's a fairy tale. I haven't gone over the audience at all

[00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.770]
I am asking you a question right online with the question you asked me at all

[00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:40.590]
I have a personal question about my sex life. I answered you honestly. I said I'm a practicing homosexual

[00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.790]
Although practice doesn't make perfect necessarily by the way

[00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.370]
But and you refused to answer these questions have I won?

[00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.770]
Here we go. Have you been your wife?

[00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:50.790]
Have you ever done this?

[00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.430]
Etc. What is the purpose of your quit? Let me jump in it. What is the purpose of that question now that that you've gotten the answer

[00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.950]
The only practices what what was the purpose the purpose of it is to

[00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.270]
Establish whether he's gonna be objective about homosexuality or yeah

[00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:08.110]
Does he have other in other words? I have to be noot or like you to be objective about sex

[00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.910]
You think that you're objective those who are involved with your brainwashing that you've obviously been subjected to

[00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.310]
Those who are involved in any kind of wrong doing that that would suggest are the words

[00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:21.150]
You're coming on the ear and telling that people ought to be executed because they were born a particular way

[00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.690]
Is that what is that what you think objectivity is would you like me to answer? Sure

[00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.750]
Okay, there's a reason that people that are involved in wrong doing aren't on juries and that is because

[00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:34.290]
They have been involved in it and they're the least likely ones to be objective about it

[00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:39.810]
You sir are not objective about homosexuality because you're involved in those who are not involved in it

[00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.190]
Well, how about me? How about me, Jason? I'm not involved in it or my objective

[00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.490]
Maybe I can help you out here as a neutral party. Okay. Would you have any questions you want to ask me?

[00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:54.330]
Well, if you put yourself in in the foray have you ever been involved in homosexual activity?

[00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.890]
Oh, yeah, he already is

[00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:02.470]
So that would be like saying that people are black can't be objective about civil rights because they're involved in the precepts

[00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.150]
Not at all. The analogy is no good

[00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.210]
You mean it's no good? There's no people who are involved. No, no, there's no sin and being there's no fine

[00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.550]
There's no wrong doing involved in being black but there is almost sexuality

[00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.030]
You have any idea

[00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:21.170]
Statistically speaking from survey after survey you just starting with a Kinsey report and working working ourselves forward

[00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:26.430]
What percentage of the male population has had a homosexual relationship at some time another and that one?

[00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.250]
Do you have any idea what the percentage is?

[00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.530]
Well the percentage is that we've seen recently say that although homosexuality has has grown

[00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.270]
But because of the restraints. I mean I answer on my no you're not you're not

[00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.610]
Let me stop you because you're not

[00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.470]
Because you're not

[00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.470]
That wasn't your answer. You're answering it question. I didn't ask I didn't ask

[00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:51.450]
What percentage of the population is homosexual although from what we are able again able to ask to take statistically that

[00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.430]
It goes at around 10% no, it's not no excuse me. I'm not gonna

[00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.450]
I'm not gonna debate statistics with you. Well, that wasn't a question. I asked you that Jason

[00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:07.190]
That wasn't the question. I asked you the question. I asked you is what percentage of the male

[00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.790]
population has had a homosexual experience at some time in their life? That's a different question

[00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.470]
So you are asking for a statistic then so you do want to get into this?

[00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.770]
Well, I know what the statistic I'm just curious. What you do?

[00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.410]
I would presume the ones I've seen are on homosexuality

[00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.830]
Do you assume that every body that every and other words you're not gonna answer that question?

[00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.910]
No, really what do you think is way what are you saying is he doesn't have the answer but which is okay?

[00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:36.650]
I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no, he's not trying to say he doesn't have the answer

[00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:44.490]
The fact that he doesn't want to admit that the overwhelming majority of American males have had a homosexual experience during the course of their

[00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:49.450]
Adelaide. I didn't say that they're homosexual. No, no, no, no. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

[00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.870]
Yes, Jason, but it's a matter of your respect and it will stay. In fact, Jason, if you want to if you want to I can put it

[00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.230]
We're not gonna go to the phones until for another hour and a half

[00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.890]
But if you want to I can put out a little call to anybody who's a therapist in our community to call and I can

[00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:08.130]
Get you 20 calls one right after the other that'll tell you that the overwhelming the over here fact it says high minus

[00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.730]
90% it's no we're close to

[00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.830]
I want to ask you one question now this is Tito

[00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.890]
You say you haven't had the answer to the question. He then tells you

[00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.550]
You've made up the test here. How do you know that the homosexual population is somewhere around four percent?

[00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.690]
It's not near

[00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.450]
I could find me a servant

[00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:28.770]
Josh

[00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:31.870]
I'm asking a question

[00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.250]
I don't know how we're gonna have a show it'll be good

[00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.650]
You don't allow me to respond

[00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.010]
asking you one thing or you're asking you one thing about people who have had an

[00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.030]
homosexual experience that doesn't make them homosexual

[00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:51.130]
Let me let me handle this in my own inimitable way. Are you saying that every male listening to this show now?

[00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.350]
Who at some time or another in the course of their life has had a homosexual experience as a homosexual?

[00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.610]
Is that what you're telling them out there? No, that is not

[00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.270]
Well then why do you keep quoting me figures about homosexuals when I talk about

[00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.450]
Males who've had homosexual experience at some time in their life? Why you got in the way you try to confuse the two?

[00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.710]
I don't confuse you. Are you confused? No, not at all and I'm trying to straighten you out what I said

[00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:15.270]
I ask you the question because this if you have had a homosexual experience you're far less likely

[00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:20.770]
To be objective about it. You don't as a matter of fact. You don't condemn homosexuality do you stay now?

[00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:21.530]
I don't know

[00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.150]
Let me just a moment. I've already done four hours here today

[00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.990]
I offered to do this show

[00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.650]
Steve took me up on a offer he had nidkko you you agreed to come in here and

[00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:39.130]
Have this discussion now if I'm gonna have to meet some other criteria in order to

[00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.290]
Debate with you or discuss this with you then there's no point in my being here. What did I stay here for?

[00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.770]
What is the criteria that you're saying that I'm not objective?

[00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.510]
Okay, I think that you're not objective

[00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.150]
But you're a

[00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:57.630]
Not involved in the wrong doing you're not involved in wrong doing so in other words when you come on his show and you advocate genocide

[00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.570]
That's not wrong doing that's love and that's the kind of Christian brotherhood that you're preaching no

[00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.210]
This has nothing to do with a genocide. Oh, it has nothing to do with genocide

[00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.030]
Saying that anyone who commits a homosexual actor an adulterer that they ought to be executed

[00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.890]
We ought to make the laws like they do in Iran

[00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.930]
And off with their head and off with their hand

[00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.890]
And we ought to do the barbaric kind of crap that you think is justice well since you open the floodgates

[00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.210]
Let me go ahead and respond to that and I think you owe me that I think you owe me a chance to give an explanation

[00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:27.390]
I believe I do believe in biblical law and I believe if we and establish the moral law of the Old Testament

[00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:32.690]
This land now let me finish of the old testament let me finish this land would be safe

[00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:38.390]
There would be no very very little if any rape no murder people would be safe to walk the streets

[00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:43.390]
Yeah, what was the law on the old land for disobedient children? What does it prescribe in the Old Testament?

[00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.190]
Well, I'm not sure you quite understand what the law was

[00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.450]
Oh, what it is doesn't say we should stone them to them

[00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:54.370]
If you understand what a disobedient child is it has nothing to do with a little child who will not eat his pee

[00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:59.690]
How do you know that there are people that are so how do you know that well for one before I read the same Bible that you have because both

[00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.370]
His parents would agree that the person is in courage

[00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:07.510]
You're going on and there are people today in our jails today that if we let them out we'll commit

[00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.390]
Shade crime let me pick up society would actually get her off without them zip it for a second

[00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.070]
Let me just I want to pick up on a point and I'll Jason if you allow me to answer no

[00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.750]
I'm going to allow if you're going to allow me to run the show all right

[00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.030]
Which is very difficult because everybody has very strong opinions here

[00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.910]
He don't want to pick up I want to pick up on this point that Neil brought up here like a clone

[00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:32.610]
So let's say we take a child you say the Bible does not the best you can do the Bible

[00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:37.110]
Tell you you look like Jim Baker you have that same little smile while you're talking on a one hand about

[00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.370]
Executing people on the other hand you have that cute little smile

[00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.750]
The Bible you're a dangerous person you have been severely brainwashed and you're a dangerous

[00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:50.930]
Devious intolerant person it's shameful can I pursue the one that's pointing all a finger in your sinful in your homosexual

[00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:57.430]
And you're in a dollar and the meantime you're sitting there with a glib smile on your face telling us that we got to execute everybody who doesn't agree with your

[00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.030]
I got kids more than including our kids who act out you say the Bible

[00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:06.610]
The Bible does not suggest you say killing our kids for not eating their peas

[00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:13.730]
So are you saying that if I have a child if I have a child that just deals a car if I have a child that is a drug out of whatever it is

[00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:17.010]
It's okay to execute him is that what you're telling the parents out there?

[00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.950]
No, what the hell does the Bible say what's the quote you're in a chapter in verse?

[00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:26.050]
I can tell you what what is it you got the Bible turn to the chapter in verse and read it is for disobedient child

[00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.950]
Even its parents its mother and his father read the quote

[00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.250]
You give me chapter in verse. I don't have the

[00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.750]
child

[00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.510]
By the way because I've read it and I've done this show a million times on a year

[00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.650]
It doesn't say in cordial but it doesn't say it's a median child

[00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:46.130]
So that they'll surely be put to death so that the mother and the father and any child that's both the mother and the father think that the

[00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.050]
Society would be better off without it

[00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.250]
And also the elders of the old man wants vigilante just to this

[00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.350]
And that's what we know

[00:19:54.350 --> 00:20:00.910]
No, I'm not going to let you go in there. I'm going to pick up on something you said and ask you a question about it

[00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:06.310]
Let me explain it. What you just said is that any mother or father who decides that their kid is

[00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.470]
Incorrigible has the right to put that kid to death

[00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.690]
Is did you not just say that I haven't finished

[00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.810]
Better you allow me finish but the old testament is saying is there are some

[00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.250]
People that are so incorrigible children

[00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:27.590]
Well, this is obviously children doesn't but it's it's offspring. It says children doesn't it's offspring

[00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.770]
You can be a child but it's not talking about it's clearly not talking about a child who won't use a piece in carrots

[00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.630]
It's clearly talking about one that the society would better off without

[00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:41.830]
If I decide to decide this society would better off without that their kid they should as the Bible suggests put the kids at death

[00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:48.430]
We're going to take a break reduce update. We'll be back. Let's make the Steve Key show on 610 W I OZ

[00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.570]
You have one whole show host

[00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:55.850]
You can't fight me come on here and debate this man or yes, but we have to get some water here

[00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.510]
We have to get water that's fine, but when I will respond to him

[00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.690]
I'd like to have the opportunity. I'm not here advocating anything except tolerance

[00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:09.770]
You're here advocating hatred and intolerance. That's what you're advocating. That's wrong. You're wrong genocide

[00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.050]
You have nothing to do with hate. I don't want to believe what's in that silly book more power to you

[00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:19.190]
You tell me no, this is right. This is the answer like all intolerant born again Christians Reverend

[00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.930]
You're the same as all of them. It's like you're cut out of some kind of a cookie cutter

[00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:29.950]
The answer and don't ask me any questions and don't make a complicate and you'll use every method possible under the sun to quote from there

[00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:37.570]
To justify your puke persecution not love not understanding not brotherly love and the compassion and these kinds of values

[00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.410]
But everything is the book says that we should persecute this one

[00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:46.450]
And this is a sin and isn't it interesting how the born against in these last few years as they always have to find some convenience

[00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:52.150]
scapegoat first it was the women and then it was the blacks and we have all these justification for slavery and that same book

[00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.610]
You're sitting there and now it's the homosexuals. This is in this is the new thing. Well, thank you

[00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.530]
Well, thank you to homo

[00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.450]
Let him get a good. Yeah, let him get a word you said about you know 10 different things

[00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.050]
It was the Christians who helped get rid of slavery if you know anything at all about. Oh, yeah

[00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.270]
No, it was a Abraham he'll be quiet for a minute

[00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.070]
I think you can learn some things with Abraham. I'm gonna learn a lot from you. He re Abraham. Oh, yeah

[00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:14.270]
Was it Abraham Lincoln's religious conviction that gave the emancipation proclamation?

[00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.090]
It was if you study history at all you know, you really study

[00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:21.470]
He made a deal with that Abraham Lincoln made it in the many more tolerance for blacks than most of his brethren

[00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:27.310]
Okay, so don't beat me that about Abraham. It was Abraham Lincoln's religious conviction that that helped the rid of slavery

[00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.510]
And if you look at the overall picture and in the British Empire

[00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.230]
Of course you forget about all that happening. I don't suppose you forget about all that happened

[00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.790]
Are you afraid to listen for a while? No, but I

[00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.430]
Are you afraid if you want to make a free of? I'm debating here. I'll be glad to leave the rule

[00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:45.490]
Okay, look I'm not interested in your words. I know you're not but I guess about 10 minutes of you

[00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.690]
So I'm gonna go ahead and go

[00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.230]
All right, wait a minute. Let me ask you quite. I want to throw out a new thing here

[00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.650]
I would like you to repeat for Neil and to kind of just about give you a chance to talk about it

[00:22:54.650 --> 00:23:02.950]
Why can't I want to excuse me? I will permit you to go on at length to explain why you believe homosexual should not be allowed to teach in our school

[00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:08.190]
Oh, no, let's get into that later. Do you see the movie Mississippi burning? I know I rarely see it

[00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.410]
Well, you might learn you might learn something Reverend paranoia if you'd go out and watch something other than

[00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.650]
That's silly book. That's good if the best you can do a main calling here

[00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.950]
Nothing going to finish the thought you know you're the best of slavery and that was a true story

[00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.970]
You know who got rid of slavery?

[00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:28.910]
No, who would you find their hatred of blacks? It was a man's anxiety black subservient with those good old Christian rednecks in Mississippi

[00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:34.110]
Okay, who used to go out and burn their crosses on the front lawns of black people's houses who got rid of

[00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.770]
Slavery in the British Empire. It was a man. Do you know?

[00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.870]
The fact is name was James will before you don't know

[00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.350]
Do you want to give us this?

[00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.650]
You want to give us the

[00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.930]
View of world history revered at the fact that slavery

[00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:53.990]
You don't know by the Bible for hundreds and hundreds of years including over 400 years

[00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.810]
You don't want to know from that you don't want to know that you don't even know why slavery was gotten rid of

[00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.850]
Do I have no idea? I don't know anything. I don't know anything. I'm just a dummy

[00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:08.450]
Well, I'm a parent for averted homosexuals that needs to be exterminated like today now

[00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.650]
I don't believe you would really exterminate Neil. Would you really? Sure he would

[00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:15.290]
Would you tell me? Yes, this is not genocide. Give me a yes

[00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.670]
I just thought all court of heaven perinoia

[00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:24.590]
Personally, I like you think the law that did that society would better off when we executed Neil is it's give me a yes or a no

[00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.130]
And I can give me a straight answer in that I

[00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.390]
Would not make it retroactive. I think the law should be on

[00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.150]
I'm not going to another word different today on tomorrow

[00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.090]
So starting tomorrow of Neil starts to sleep with women. You'll let him live

[00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.210]
Is that what you say if the law were enforced today and he is so

[00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.610]
Beligerent and so

[00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:48.210]
Adiment in his homosexuality he will be a legitimate and adamant are you beligerent and adamant?

[00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.930]
You are a unicism or whatever it is in your being a unic. Are you a beligerent in that in other words

[00:24:52.930 --> 00:25:00.210]
You say that you've chosen to be a celibate. Are you beligerent in it? I believe that's the moral and the correct way

[00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.790]
I believe you believe that I believe I believe

[00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.970]
I want to ask you a question and I believe you are

[00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:11.830]
Is this a pluralistic country in other words if you want me you can do anything in moral if you want see you always ask you don't answer the question

[00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.750]
I answer the answer is a real question

[00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.710]
I answered it quite well as a matter of fact you didn't answer it quite well

[00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.950]
I ask you don't have the right you don't have the right

[00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:23.810]
This is a pluralistic society but what does that mean it was a pluralistic society during the days of George Washington?

[00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.290]
We weren't all Christians in that time, but we had plural laws is my fate George

[00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:32.010]
Why have you really a Christian per se wasn't I think that he or come to a pain? I believe George

[00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.070]
I have made a promise Jeffers. I have more quotes from George Washington. See the people that

[00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:41.890]
I found in this country were terrified of people like you and religious intolerance because most of them came here to escape this

[00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:47.450]
You do you are aware of that you know that much real history apparently you're under selective world of history that you live in

[00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.870]
Apparently you're unfamiliar with some of the history of this country. Oh absolutely

[00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.810]
I like I said I know nothing how many I'm in the end it sits here every day and well

[00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.570]
You know how many how many signers of the Constitution do we have and how many of those were present?

[00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:03.710]
You know I feel like I'm back in primary school. Well you are how many of them were Christian

[00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.270]
Well, what does that imply does that mean that this is a Christian nation? Well

[00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:12.170]
Never are you going to start that again? I believe a lot of our Jewish listeners are going to be very upset if you do that

[00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:17.330]
Well, there were many Jews at the time a lot of our atheists are going to be very upset and a lot of our agnostics and

[00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.750]
Animations and lots of others which are the majority of our audience when you put them all together

[00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:25.110]
How many of our founding fathers were Christians of the signers of the right of the Constitution?

[00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.850]
Well, it's all the things on the it's all the things on your definition

[00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.770]
You even know you claim that oh history. Do you even know how many there were how many signers of the Constitution is?

[00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.370]
Oh, geez here we go that you know your tactic

[00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.730]
What you remind me of you ought to be a real man. No, you know what you remind me of you are a broadcast man

[00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:43.010]
Because the little techniques that you play don't you think everybody in the audience sees through this stupid exercise

[00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.610]
We're not here today to try to see who the greatest pseudo intellectual reverend

[00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.750]
We're here because you have advocated genocide for homosexuals, adulterers

[00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.910]
And anybody else in the world who doesn't live up to your moral standard

[00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.110]
That's what we're here to do

[00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.710]
It's not a non-obey their pattern. Everybody what a genius you are. What a mindless douchebag I am

[00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.670]
That's not the purpose of our conversation. I assume by your silence then you don't know

[00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:08.450]
Oh, but this what's gonna go on here for four hours? Well, he assumes by my silence

[00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.910]
I don't know what you didn't you just call to all the founding fathers you basically you said that they were not Christian

[00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:19.570]
No, I didn't say that I said I need several specific founding fathers like Jefferson and pain and possibly Washington

[00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:24.030]
Who are there you know they were deers still can't know that that means they were Christians fun

[00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.990]
They weren't the it doesn't matter fact. Oh, and I've done some research on that apparently you talk to them

[00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:32.450]
Did you talk to Thomas? Well, are you gonna tell me that Thomas pain was a Christian?

[00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:36.530]
Thomas pain was not one of the founding fathers of this kind of excuse me

[00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.930]
Okay, I'm sure Washington clearly was and George Washington was clearly a Christian

[00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.270]
I can give you a quote after quote it was one of the epic

[00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:47.610]
Juanicators in the history of the world for heaven how about Thomas Jefferson not at all as a matter of fact not even not even

[00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.670]
Not even why do you think it every motel in America? It says George Washington slept here

[00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.830]
Well, that's very humorous, but it's not at all. Oh excuse me

[00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:58.230]
We made a little joke and a Reverend almost had a chuckle there for justice. I was very humorous

[00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.130]
Do you ever laugh Reverend? I mean, I don't have sex turn

[00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.650]
Do you have a sense of humor or are you just like Dr. Mangala?

[00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:11.430]
You'd like to conduct these these experiments in the laboratory and continue picking people to death because of the fact that they don't live up to your moral standard

[00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:16.830]
You Reverend and the Nazis are no different. You're absolutely no different only you do it under the cloak of religion

[00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.190]
That's the only difference

[00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.130]
And the Nazis on their on the SS belts by the way it said God is with us

[00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.690]
There is a lot that they profess to be Christians too don't so now you're didn't they profess to be Christians?

[00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.670]
Can you do nothing more? Can you answer a question? Can you know history?

[00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:35.730]
Well, didn't the Nazis profess that God was on their side to be not all as a matter of fact all they didn't

[00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.770]
According to the Christian, according to Albert Schweitzer or if you

[00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.990]
You mean Albert Einstein who was there he said the church was the only organization stood up against Hitler

[00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.790]
But let me answer it

[00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.630]
That's why they signed the Concordat in 1933 because they stood up against them

[00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:52.810]
And that's why Pope Pius pretending he didn't know what the hell was going on right because they stood up so strongly against Hitler

[00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:58.130]
You will live in the order twisted try to why he thought Albert Einstein was a great historian

[00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:02.730]
But he was a Jew who was there and he said the church was the only organization

[00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.170]
But if you do like to disagree with that

[00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.370]
We'll find out if he what he thought about what the Pius did

[00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:12.190]
How about Nemoler and all the rest this stood against against Hitler Hitler was not a great Christian

[00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.830]
And he was a

[00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:23.710]
He was a fair Christian. Oh, he was a bad guy. No, he was not a Christian. No, I will suffer eternity for that

[00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:29.550]
He claimed to be a not at all. How about Turkey modesty claim to be a Christian? Let me all you done so far

[00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.830]
I can't answer one question. I

[00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:37.330]
And here 43 minutes did Turkey modic claim to be a Christian? I've answered an awful lot of questions

[00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:40.790]
That's the only one I want another answer to did Turkey modic claim to be a Christian?

[00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.810]
All you've done so far in the morning call

[00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.170]
Because it's too embarrassing

[00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.350]
They've had all these predecessors historically who run around

[00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.210]
Crucifying people because they refuse to make you make them an offer they can't believe if you are the

[00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.990]
Prince again godfather if you're the

[00:29:54.930 --> 00:30:00.630]
Sexuality is nothing better. Godfather is nothing better than homosexuality. Yes. Yes. Exactly. You do

[00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:05.830]
As a man. You're a little embarrassed about it. I'm embarrassed about it. It took you about half hour to admit it

[00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:09.410]
I'm in the year 13 years ago. Oh, it took me a half hour to admit it

[00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.050]
Have you ever introduced someone into homosexuality? No

[00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.150]
What are you smiling? He looks just like you baker. No, it's disappointed

[00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:23.150]
I didn't have a lot of the yes on them. How many times do I have to answer the question? Well, I know I've never had ever had

[00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:27.910]
Let me ask you can I ask you a question? Did you have you ever introduced a lady to heterosexual?

[00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.750]
I'm not sure all the implications

[00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.310]
You're any question

[00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.130]
What what we don't bring about you don't understand the implications

[00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.330]
What's the answer? Let me repeat the question

[00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.850]
Well, have you ever

[00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:47.630]
Introduced a lady to heterosexuality? Are you are you saying are you asking sounds like a simple question? Let's let's let's let it go a little bit here

[00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:55.130]
What go ahead now you're gonna have to go ahead? I have two radio talks your host that are advocating homosexuality

[00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.290]
I have a whole show

[00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.850]
They're putting words in my mouth again. I'm advocating

[00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.770]
I'm waiting you're letting them up the floor. Neil I'm not advocating anything

[00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.510]
We are gonna take a break what I'm doing is fighting your sickness

[00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:13.190]
We are in tolerance. We are gonna take a break when we get back. See now. I must tell you one thing. See he did that to you

[00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.170]
But did he have you had no good? No, could you guys you off on the

[00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:20.770]
I'm gonna find the answer to what you're asking. Well, we are gonna take a

[00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.830]
I'll tell you what watch my lips. I'm gonna do it real slow when we get back

[00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:30.190]
I'm gonna give you the commercial to play to search back and do every see me thing you ever done in the history of your life

[00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.510]
To answer the question, all right? The question is you asked Neil and he ever introduced a lady with a homosexual

[00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.670]
He said no right out didn't think about it didn't qualify. I didn't want to know exactly what you just said no

[00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:41.130]
There's something before you take the break

[00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.670]
There's something that just hit me like a lightning bolt okay

[00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:48.950]
Earlier in the Saur as the Reverend was probing desperately for all of these sexual sins that I've committed

[00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:53.170]
And I asked him does he masturbate and he said no and I asked him does he have nocturnal emissions?

[00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:58.490]
And he said no if this is true that means he has never even experienced the orgasm

[00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:02.030]
So again like I said in the beginning of the show him giving a lecture on

[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:02.640]
Your way

[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:09.380]
Mangle a giving election on medical malpractice you lost and even know what it is you lost

[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.220]
We have to break here. I'm gonna repeat the question when we get back

[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:21.280]
You're gonna tell us if you have ever in the course of your 38 years. I want you to explain it in an organ

[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.640]
What do you want to explain introducing somebody to heterosexuality?

[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.820]
You know I teach heterosexuality is true, but I think don't know have you ever?

[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.740]
You know you know what it is. Have you ever introduced by your out?

[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.380]
Who do I have to be to know right from wrong?

[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.760]
You know the case or the case is wrong.

[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.560]
A back year okay?

[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.500]
It's a down year right.

[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.100]
Ooh, come back here okay.

[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.700]
I'm listening.

[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:49.020]
I am asking you the question in the sense so this will help you to understand in the same sense that you

[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:54.360]
asked near the question hold on to your answer and whatever it was like bringing an Arab bond to give recipes for

[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:59.060]
Halivan until we get back you're listening to the Steve K show on 610 W I O D

[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:05.660]
Hi, we are back. We are on new stock radius 610 W I O D. I just want to remind you a whole you've had some time to think about it

[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:12.200]
I asked you if you have ever had an occasion to introduce a young lady to heterosexuality in the same sense that you asked Uncle Neil

[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.560]
If he had introduced anyone to homosexuality answer that is what as you explain the answer is no no so you've never

[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.980]
never petted never

[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:27.120]
touched a girl's breath nothing here I mean will we I want to know for dealing with a real candidate for

[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.300]
Sango already told us he's never had an orgasm so he does never experience but I do

[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:37.820]
I do object to this and again if you had any if I have answered that question before you have to be an expert just a doctor

[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.920]
and you have finally has to have why is it okay for you?

[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.220]
Why is it okay for you to ask him about your sexuality question?

[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.380]
Oh but but when you're asking the same question I'm so good I don't get into the graphic details of his personality

[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.420]
about graphic detail you certainly are I think that's not about it's not about.

[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.360]
It's not about asking if you've ever had an orgasm that is we're not describing it we're just asking a question

[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.220]
I think that's out of bounds I think it's clearly out of it.

[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.560]
Well in other words like like most born against you set the ground rules in other words we're playing with the

[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.980]
three striped for balls and you just make it up as you go along strike one you're out this guy makes it up as he goes along

[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.160]
in the interest you know if you will get any medical doctor on the phone he will tell you what is physically,

[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:20.140]
biologically impossible for a year what 35 years old for any male to live to the age of 35 without having an

[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.720]
orgasm either voluntarily or involuntary it is true it is impossible this is true.

[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.880]
Jay don't let you are in fact maybe the second coming I think that you're way out of bounds.

[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.240]
No because I'm questioning your veracity here I don't believe it I don't believe what you're telling

[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.240]
what he's saying in a nice way is that you're lying I'm I'm questioning your civility I think this is

[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.740]
way out of bounds. Oh in other words when you come on and begin the program by by asking me in a very

[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.580]
militant hostile way are you going to be practicing homosexual as if somehow that's a good

[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.500]
deming admission it took you about half hour to admit it because I wasn't going to play your game

[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.860]
right. I don't know I'm not going to sit here and allow you to do a verbal

[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:58.720]
inclusion every every virtually every religion in the world condemns homosexuality there's a reason

[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.780]
there's a really why they're in the news to you but I'm reading just in Europe this summer and you

[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.880]
know something also I listened to the show you had with Steve it's amazing how much BS you

[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.740]
spew out when you're unchallenged and you talked about all these varieties it's universal in about

[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.760]
how homosexuality is condemned I hate to break the news to you there's no law against homosexuality

[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.360]
in most of the your Western European countries it doesn't exist as a matter of fact I'll go ahead

[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.800]
and matter of fact Denmark is just recently legalized homosexual marriages uh you talk about

[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.960]
societies and their views of individuals so how much sexuality is not condemned anywhere in

[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.660]
the Netherlands in any of the Scandinavian countries in Denmark in fact in most of the most most

[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.640]
of the world let me let me go ahead and admitted that on our show he had sure countries in this world he

[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.060]
had to go into the third world I see there's a limit here but all they accept homosexuality no no no there's

[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.900]
simply mature you know how many countries are aren't like because they don't condemn other people

[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.040]
simply because they're racked not you know how many of the factories are the one the the Iranians

[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.840]
again like you did last time you know how many you know how many countries are in the world and how

[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.940]
many have here we go again with okay well let me go ahead let me go ahead and tell you yeah because

[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.680]
there are a hundred about a hundred and seventy countries in the world and approximately twelve and

[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:18.220]
we heard the list of them last time haven't only in the last few years really having some degrees

[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:23.620]
let me ask you no way no way no way how many years did we have civil rights let me go ahead this has

[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:28.100]
not been a year's if women it has a lot to do with the fact that you're a boy it's finally no

[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:33.520]
no no only but surely changing so there's prejudices that religion is like you continue to try to

[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.900]
promulgate almost like you're waiting and wearing a way almost actually what you're what you're

[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:43.140]
going to give in the right to the right to be ready not what you're women minority right to vote

[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:48.480]
almost sexuality clearly can you hear what you're women given a right to vote it is clearly what you're

[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.380]
all blacks given a right to vote it is not what year was brought to the board of a minority it is not

[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:59.280]
a legitimate minority you can sit there and you can say it from now until six and it's still

[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.360]
won't be a reason for you to be homosexuality to blacks and to women I haven't

[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.680]
appointed it to any certainly have with the kind of certainly have that you let your kind of

[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:13.640]
law begins try to promulgate that logic that won't hold water anywhere well we're talking about civil

[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.600]
rights you know what civil rights are I certainly I know what civil rights are that's basically

[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.720]
the no that common denominator and there's a first of all you're a minority and I get into a

[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.380]
discussion of what you just said almost sexuality is not a legitimate art first of all let me

[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.380]
tell you why tell me what the point of court is that about it with black tell me what the

[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.140]
Supreme Court said about it you want you want to listen to what I'm telling you do you want me to

[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:39.200]
tell you what you want to answer a question you want me to tell you what you want to hear all right

[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.440]
we have got a break one hour down three to go don't go away folks it's just warming up you're

[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:48.400]
listening to the Steve Cain show with the good right Reverend Virgin Jason Polis and Uncle Neo

[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:54.480]
Rogers right here on six ten that's what you do as a homosexual back with you on news talk

[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.200]
radio six ten W.I. Do you going to get that information that we requested over here in the

[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.120]
thing would be better you know why that is because it's my show and I introduce people the way I

[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:09.220]
want to that okay I was making the point that in the in the history of the world the homosexuality

[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:13.780]
has been outlawed in virtually every civilization yeah like you're a role-menghering in a question

[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:18.540]
about even right now I'll do the history of the world even in the last 15 years we have mentioned

[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.320]
there are a few countries in Europe that have now made it legal that that represents about 8% of the

[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.780]
of the civil world how much I'm what about the civil about eight eight percent

[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:33.540]
that we're not going to beat that in our country got a 171 but the 171 that you're talking about

[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.700]
of in the darkest continent of African picnies and headhunters but cry that loud along with the

[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:43.340]
Iranians if that's the best you can do you're in real trouble you're and you have 12 out of 171

[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:47.960]
you're sitting everyone else are civilized and and even then of these countries is just in

[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.640]
within the last 15 years and tell me has has morality and improved over the last 15 years or

[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.740]
basically has morality decreased and gone down over the last 15 years it's no quistness to have

[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:05.180]
measure that well you have all sort of thing is drugs rape incest yeah no quality no question since

[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:09.920]
there's been a more enlightened attitude about homosexuality the drug problem is directly tied

[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.020]
into that and the murder problem is tied into that and prostitution is tied into that and white

[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.840]
feeding is tied into that anything that's evil I see here we go I would like to hear Jay

[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.340]
from that can't wait wait a minute here we go that how are they laid earlier this you think

[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:29.760]
it's a co-incident a moral moral or Roberts and the jury fall wells and I'm getting I'm getting

[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.580]
I'm getting a little tired of being compared to people that I have no desire to be compared to

[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.820]
the statement and then maybe you'll understand what I'm getting and I'm not comparing I'm not

[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:44.400]
comparing you to them I'm comparing your rhetoric to theirs and it's isn't it interesting that

[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:51.100]
this agenda of the far right born against all it just by accident all mirrors itself all of these

[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.640]
people constantly pointing to the homosexuals and this is the reason we have all of these problems

[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.660]
in our country today it's called looking for a scapegoat it's the same thing the Nazis did in the

[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:06.240]
30s and 40s and you're doing the same thing you're doing more name just like the Reagan mentality

[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.220]
and playing calling is the best you can do you have well I'm starting to void our history

[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.360]
fan I'm citing this I am but it is true you might add to your list of countries who condemn

[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.140]
homosexual you might add Nazi Germany because they definitely did is that not correct is that

[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:25.280]
homosexuals in the gypsy where the first ones to go be or is that not a de facto Christians they

[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.680]
were the first ones to go to it is that not in fact a belief system you share with Adolf Hitler

[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.020]
and and you put your shoes on the way same way Hitler did what what does that have to do with how do

[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.180]
you know how Hitler put his shoes on were you there do you understand the point no I don't because

[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.760]
I think that maybe you put your shoe your boots on the same way that he did I would like to get

[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.840]
back to something that you so let's get in a little content here because I think you have some

[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.780]
interesting ideas and I like to have you develop them how do you I think Neil brought up an excellent

[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:53.620]
point how do you tie the drug dealing in the murder in the rape in the mayhem and all this kind of

[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:59.160]
stuff what has an increase in homosexuality assuming there is one which I don't but for the sake

[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.440]
of argument we'll concede that how does homosexuality cause all of these other ills that you see

[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.320]
it's a sign well I do believe there's a causal relationship but I also believe there's part of

[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:13.780]
the sentence what the causal relationship is more importantly it's a simple that more importantly

[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.060]
you say you see a causal relationship I would like you to tell me what the causal relationship

[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:23.720]
the idea as we've seen the moral slide it is no accident that homosexuality has become more

[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:30.760]
militant as as basically what does that mean what the hell did you just said we've seen homosexuality

[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.540]
grow basically as we have a fascinating and we've listened to him and we've listened to him and now we

[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:41.000]
think late 40's early 50's Kinsey said that 6% of the adult male population was homosexual

[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.920]
masters and Johnson said that it was between 6 and 10% you quoted studies earlier recent studies

[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.680]
that say it's only 4% so where's this epidemic of homosexuality drinking according to the

[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:55.960]
devastating where is it well you can see statistics now you don't like statistics but you can

[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.640]
see them in statistics well they're your statistics it's dropped evidently to 4% so how is it growing

[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:07.300]
well I think that it that it will grow as a matter of fact I will now it's profit pullers not

[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.280]
Reverend Paul as we have the profit pullers who's predicting do me a bloom in fact we're on the

[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.720]
road of Armageddon and midway down the road will be a big increase you know I want to go back to

[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:26.420]
something you said before but there we go for no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I like

[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.620]
attack that because I assure you that almost sexuality is not the same no nobody is born we have

[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:37.180]
seen we have seen they're all recruited by Neil Rogers we have seen societies we have seen even

[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:42.500]
even in California and over in San Francisco when they passed gay rights legislation

[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.420]
AIDS became a problem. It is not an accident. It is not an accident.

[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.720]
AIDS became a problem when they passed homosexual legislation.

[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.000]
What did that legislation have to do with homosexual activity?

[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.540]
What did that legislation say about homosexual activity?

[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.980]
As we loosen the restraints on homosexual activity, it got worse.

[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.500]
No, that legislation had nothing to do with homosexual activity.

[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.980]
Oh, it was an accident.

[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.500]
You want an answer? You just want to rant and rant.

[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.080]
I'm not ranting and raving.

[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.940]
It's like you're raving it to you.

[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.960]
It's a re-election against homosexuals in housing and employment.

[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.660]
It had nothing to do with legislation dealing with homosexual activity.

[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.160]
And you know that.

[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:21.980]
You know that.

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.100]
You know that.

[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:27.300]
The 70-eight Vanaryl disease has gone up about 24-hundred percent.

[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.300]
And that afforded homosexuals.

[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.520]
That's only homosexuals.

[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.800]
Among homosexuals.

[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:35.740]
Among Vanaryl disease have gone up 24-hundred percent.

[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.800]
And that's only an event.

[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.060]
Of course, it's only an event.

[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:38.840]
Your argument.

[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:39.160]

[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.840]
The period of time that AIDS came into our society.

[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.000]
Your argument is that it's just coincidental.

[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.020]
No, that is very weak argument.

[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.620]
No, you're saying.

[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.820]
I'm saying there's a definite tie.

[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.500]
And I think most thinking people will, uh, touch you and tell.

[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:51.480]
Well, Daniel, give it some thought.

[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.760]
I mean what he's saying makes a lot of sense.

[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.480]
In other words, they pass the gay rights ordinance in San Francisco.

[00:43:55.540 --> 00:44:00.100]
And a homosexual or the epidemic of AIDS swept the entire country in the world

[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.580]
because of the legislation in San Francisco.

[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.160]
And that makes no one known.

[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:03.840]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.500]
That makes a lot of sense.

[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.780]
No, I did not apply that again.

[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.320]
That's not the point I made.

[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.240]
Don't give you a...

[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:07.440]
When you take...

[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.860]
When you prefer a fairer way, you're with the fact.

[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.880]
When you take away moral restraints.

[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.480]
There were no moral restraints taken away.

[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.540]
All it did was stop people like you from discriminating against people

[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.980]
because of their sexual orientation.

[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:17.580]
It's homosexual.

[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.960]
It's homosexuality legal in San Francisco.

[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:19.480]

[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.100]
It's homosexuality legal in San Francisco.

[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.760]
Homosexuality is not illegal anywhere in the United States.

[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:24.560]
That is wrong.

[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.580]
No, it is not wrong.

[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.020]
That is wrong.

[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.980]
Homosexual acts are prescribed by many of the states.

[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.880]
But being a homosexual is not illegal in the United States.

[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.480]
We're talking about homosexual acts because it's a homosexual act.

[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.940]
It's a homosexual act that causes venerality.

[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.120]
And by the way, and by the way, the very acts that you are referring to

[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.980]
that are illegal in various states are heterosexual acts as well as homosexual acts.

[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:44.840]
You are aware of that.

[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.240]
Are you not?

[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:51.840]
I think most laws, most states do not have laws that would prohibit the kind of activity that you're talking about.

[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.580]
Of course, like in Georgia, the man where the man went to the U.S. for 19 months

[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.260]
because he had oral sex with his wife.

[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.040]
Most states don't have laws like that, right?

[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.340]
You know they do.

[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.400]
About half the state.

[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:01.940]
The autonomy law.

[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.560]
The autonomy has got nothing to do necessarily with homosexual.

[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.060]
Of course.

[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.120]
It's got to do with sex acts outside the missionary position.

[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:08.860]
Heterosexual.

[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.260]
You understand that?

[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.400]
I understand that.

[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:12.820]
That's exactly what it is.

[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.420]
That's exactly what it is.

[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.840]
The etymology of the word, sodomy than you do.

[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:22.420]
For a man who's never had a sexual experience in his life again, your expertise to me is astonishing.

[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.660]
It's amazing.

[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:30.040]
Like I said, it would be like a Saudi Arabian coming on the year here and giving us a lecture on kosher, a delicatessen food.

[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.360]
It's just incredible.

[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.280]
I just can't believe what expertise you've got.

[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.980]
You don't have any idea what you're talking about.

[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.020]
Who do I have to know to be to know right from wrong, the O'rodgers?

[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.040]
Who do I have to be to know right from wrong?

[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.940]
Who do you have to be to know right from wrong?

[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.060]
Who do you have to be to know right from wrong?

[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.180]
It dictates right from wrong.

[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.180]
You know most most people.

[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.700]
It doesn't say in your book, Love, Dineber is the itself.

[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.960]
It doesn't also say judge, not less DB judge.

[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:57.000]
You're sitting here and judging everybody who doesn't look at the world through the same warped classes as you do.

[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.600]
Virtually every religion in the world will condemn homosexuality, both the old and the new castor.

[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.180]
We did not, we did not back when that came to go religion again.

[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.960]
Oh, you're against every religion in the world.

[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.080]
Can you name one religion in the world that says it's okay?

[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:10.760]
Wait a minute.

[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:11.360]
Wait a minute.

[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.760]
Let us say, judge, because it's time to take a break it up the host.

[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:15.720]
Is that all right?

[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.400]
Is that all right?

[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.380]
You're taking a shot.

[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.140]
You see that clock?

[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.360]
See what that says?

[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.540]
What time's it saying that clock?

[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.200]
Go ahead.

[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.220]
You see what time it says?

[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:23.740]
Three, fifteen.

[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.100]
That's break time.

[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.940]
It was okay with you, Pastor Paul.

[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.160]
I wish that you were neutral.

[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.800]
Well, was that mean we don't take commercial facts to make you neutral any again?

[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:32.940]

[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.000]
It's getting the operation already.

[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:34.980]
It doesn't cost a lot.

[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.760]
I'll even chip in.

[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.620]
We will be right back.

[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:39.840]
You're listening with the Steve Cain show on 610 W I O D.

[00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.340]
10 W I O D.

[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.200]
I think we have sort of set the premise for the show now.

[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.540]
We can take a couple of calls.

[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.400]
Oh my God.

[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.040]
See if we can, oh, there's that word again.

[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.880]
See if we can find some, you could, you notice the way when you use the word God that Jason kind of tightens and pushes you.

[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.360]
I don't like the Lord's name, he's clearly using it.

[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.860]
He doesn't even believe in God and yet he uses his name in a vein.

[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:01.300]
Why don't you name it?

[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.280]
No, I'm not using his name in a vein.

[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.500]
I'm speaking the way I speak.

[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:04.500]
Okay, and it's America.

[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.180]
And I don't care whether you like it or Senator, ain't no way like it.

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:07.920]
That's the way I speak.

[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.760]
It's a figure of a, okay.

[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.260]
But are you clearly using Lord's name?

[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.640]
This isn't a dictatorship.

[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.820]
And it's also not a theocracy.

[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.160]
Okay, we don't have a Pope.

[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.820]
We don't have a religious head of state.

[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.380]
And as a result, if you want to believe all these fairy tales, and I shouldn't say fairy tales,

[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:21.980]
you're clearly not fairy tales.

[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.520]
You are, believe these bovamaisis.

[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.680]
That's up to you.

[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:25.880]
You're powered to you.

[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.380]
I don't happen to share your superstition, okay?

[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.740]
That's my right.

[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.800]
Do I have to believe that?

[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.940]
Do I have to believe that?

[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:34.860]
You don't believe it.

[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.880]
No, no, do I have to believe it?

[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.900]
In this country, you're free not to believe it.

[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:39.500]
Okay, thank you.

[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.240]
But let me go ahead.

[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.220]
You say that with a, with a kind of a tinge of regret.

[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.720]
Well, of course he does, if he can.

[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.280]
No, I'd have to believe it.

[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.120]
Christianity or religion cannot be forced.

[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.640]
But you like to give it a shot.

[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.780]
But what bothered me, you said it bothered me?

[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.720]
It clearly does bother me.

[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.160]
When I hear people using the Lord's name and they know I don't want to force anyone to be religious.

[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.060]
But I do think society has an obligation to help people to be moral.

[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.460]
You have no, to not help them to make you have, you have no constitutional rights to be moral.

[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.520]
You know the way to make an offer that you can't refuse.

[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.340]
I'm not immoral.

[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.020]
I'm not guaranteed.

[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.620]
I'm a hell of a lot more moral than you are, because I don't run around preaching persecution and hatred like you do.

[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.600]
And I've seen you guys come and go a dozen here and a dozen there.

[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.700]
And I'll always say like you all the time.

[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.480]
You're saying kind of intolerance and the same.

[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:25.300]
Oh, I know all us terrible faggots who are out there destroying the world and bringing society to us.

[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.700]
Is that basically why you don't want to see gay as teaching in school?

[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.620]
Because you're afraid they'll destroy our young people.

[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.240]
I think they're a terrible role model.

[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.700]
I think the country should do everything that I never had one teacher get up in my classroom.

[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.500]
Will you allow me sexual practices?

[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.220]
Will you allow me to finish?

[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.440]
Did you go to public school?

[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.060]
I think it is.

[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:43.940]
He won't, he won't tell us.

[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.540]
I think it is a wrong practice.

[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.560]
I think the state ought to do nothing to promote that sort of thing.

[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.760]
I think it ought to be illegal.

[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:50.600]
I think it ought to be illegal.

[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.160]
What ought to be illegal?

[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.360]
I think homosexual activity ought to be illegal.

[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:53.960]
How about teachers?

[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.120]
You want to have a witch hunt to find out who the homosexuals are?

[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.480]
It's not a matter of having a woman.

[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:04.060]
You realize that if they took all the homosexual teachers out of the classroom that most public schools would close tomorrow, you do understand that.

[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:04.620]
Oh, I see.

[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.080]
So you're saying that the most having teachers?

[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:07.800]
I did, I did.

[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.060]
Again, putting words in my mouth.

[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:09.700]
They have to close.

[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.580]
They would allow you to use that school to have the show.

[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.900]
That's a sad thing.

[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:14.500]
Oh yeah.

[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:14.820]
Why?

[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.040]
Well, I think he's overestimated their ability.

[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.860]
I'd like you to find one student in the listening audience.

[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.020]
Kids are all out of school now.

[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:30.420]
I'd like you to find one student who's had a teacher get up in a classroom and tell a class either of their heterosexual or homosexual or any kind of sexual activity.

[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.760]
I never had that experience.

[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:38.880]
I don't know of anybody who I ever went to school with or any of my acquaintances who ever had a teacher get up in school and even discuss such a thing.

[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.840]
So when you talk about promoting a lifestyle.

[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:46.460]
Society and government and an obligation to discourage immoral activity.

[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.660]
Did you in the course of going to school?

[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:48.700]
Not a response to what I had.

[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.480]
In the course of going to school.

[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.960]
Excuse me.

[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.000]
Excuse me.

[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.640]
In the course of going to school.

[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:54.700]
In the course of going to school.

[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.080]
I just did.

[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.840]
In the course of going to school.

[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.660]
Did you ever have a teacher get up in classroom and tell you who they were sleeping with and why and stuff like that?

[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:03.580]
Of course not.

[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:10.260]
Okay. Then why would you assume that if a teacher is up in front of a classroom whether they're sleeping with a man or a woman that a student would even be aware of that?

[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.240]
Well, I think it's a bad example.

[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:11.680]
I had to.

[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.680]
I was at a bad example.

[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:13.460]
How is it an example?

[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.460]
You don't know it.

[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.220]
Because you know, you ask two different questions.

[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:24.420]
I know that some of my teachers as I was growing up were probably homosexual.

[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.400]
No, no, wait.

[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.620]
More probably.

[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.700]
How did you know that?

[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.680]
Well, they had very effeminate characteristics.

[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.920]
Oh my gosh.

[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.140]
And it's not something you go up and ask.

[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:33.880]
Oh gosh.

[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:41.280]
You were operating under the stereotype that you can always tell somebody who is gay from that gay by whether what their physical characteristics are.

[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.420]
No, I cannot believe you.

[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:47.080]
You know, I have homosexual friends who could pick you up with one hand like truck drivers.

[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.800]
Well, maybe a little piece of minstrel against the wall.

[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.340]
They may be true, but it would be a homosexual.

[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:51.720]

[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:52.800]
More ordered.

[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:53.160]
Huh?

[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:53.940]
That may be true.

[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.740]
So maybe someone I'm talking about being a more stereotyped dog.

[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.260]
I'm talking about the kind of thing that's asking that.

[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.280]
You see the interesting question.

[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.620]
The truth of the matter is most homosexuals aren't like that.

[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.260]
Most homosexuals are effeminate.

[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.620]
How do you know that?

[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.280]
Oh, brother.

[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.320]
How the hell do you make a stable of that?

[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.440]
Well, that's the best one of all.

[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.240]
But I want to hear how we reach that conclusion.

[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.780]
I think most people would agree with that.

[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.300]
Most homosexuals.

[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.580]
That's how you rethink your own claim that most people would agree with that.

[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.700]
I get a chance to debate homosexuals all the time.

[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.100]
Yeah, and of course people like Steve bring on every swishy queen that they can find.

[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.500]
And that's exactly what you love.

[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.280]
I could bring on 100 homosexuals.

[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.620]
It would be a hell of a lot more masculine than you could ever hope to be.

[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:31.700]
Football players, baseball players, basketball players, bodybuilders.

[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.180]
And that still would make it right, wouldn't it?

[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.320]
Well, that's not what we see how you keep changing the subject.

[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.180]
Well, that is what you're talking about.

[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.920]
That is what you're talking about.

[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.860]
You see what you just did is you exposed your whole sham.

[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:41.620]
No, not at all.

[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.300]
The stereotype that you want to promote.

[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.280]
The swishy, they're all effeminate, they're all dangerous, they're all promiscuous.

[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:47.620]
No, no, no.

[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:48.300]
They're all doing this.

[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.920]
If you are a despicable, you're terrible.

[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.560]
You are despicable.

[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.940]
I was answering his question.

[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.760]
If I'd ever had a homosexuality.

[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.320]
I said that I'm not going to let you know.

[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.020]
Stop, everybody.

[00:51:59.260 --> 00:51:59.840]
Everybody, those sexes.

[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.660]
Those are effeminate.

[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.300]
That's what you said.

[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.320]
Mr. Rogers, stop for a minute.

[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:08.760]
What I am curious about is how since Jason had all of these probably homosexuality.

[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:14.720]
How the hell did you ever grow up straight, Jason, with all that evil we can't say that he is.

[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.260]
Well, we can't say that he is because he's a unit basically.

[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.420]
He's like non-sexual.

[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:18.840]
How did you know, not at all?

[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.700]
You're asexual, you said you never had a sexual experience.

[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.400]
That's what you're getting among the hook here.

[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:29.000]
I want to know how you ended up straight with all of these maleficent influences around you in this classroom and your youth.

[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.560]
Well, I think it is, you know, again, it's the position that I take.

[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.420]
I think it's the correct position.

[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.320]
It's the right attitude.

[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.880]
But how did you overcome all of these evil influences that you thought in your mind with there?

[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:40.980]
I guess I can thank my parents.

[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.460]
Did you ever stop to think that maybe you were projecting all of these homosexual impulses onto these teachers?

[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.700]
I had good parents who told me that homosexuality was wrong.

[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.040]
They told me that lying was wrong.

[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.360]
They told me that stealing was wrong.

[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.340]
Well, if they told you lying was wrong so far today, then you've broken that one.

[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.880]
What I'm interested in is your stereotype because I think you'd be, you know me, I wouldn't kid you about this.

[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:05.700]
The fact is, the fact is a lot of people, because you're a regular, you know, when I say a character on the show, a lot of people know about you.

[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.040]
I get questions about you all the time.

[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:15.780]
People have said to me in listening to his voice, I don't know whether they're influenced by, you know, your sexual activity or lack thereof,

[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:23.560]
but they say they have this underlying feeling in listening to your vocal characteristics and some of the women who work in the station who have asked me about you,

[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:29.620]
they get a sense that your characteristics are gay and I keep having a lot of that.

[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.060]
Well, I tell them that.

[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:31.960]
We can only vote for them.

[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:32.820]
I tell them that.

[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.780]
I stand up to you, but the point that I'm trying to make to you is people get the impression from looking at you that you have gay characters.

[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.420]
Not at all.

[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:39.960]
And I've never been like that.

[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.020]
Don't tell me not at all.

[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.600]
I'm telling you what people are telling me.

[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:43.800]
I mean, I know you're not.

[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.240]
That's not at all true.

[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:50.720]
But I think you are the perfect example of how somebody can have slightly effeminate characteristics and not be gay.

[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.620]
I do not think I have a feminine characteristics and I resent that.

[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:55.400]
Why would you want that?

[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.720]
Well, we certainly know that there are no gay priests or ministers.

[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:58.320]
We know that.

[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.840]
Well, that really has not certainly not the priesthood.

[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:05.320]
Is there any, is there some kind of a scandal there that we might need to talk about during this show?

[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.660]
You can talk about it.

[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.420]
Because those people call themselves Christian.

[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:09.800]
I'd be delighted to talk about it.

[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:15.140]
I know two priests in South Florida who are gay, who have abused children, who have interfered in people's relations.

[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.640]
And I find that you know, you bet it is.

[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:20.220]
And I think that they ought to be defraught and I think they ought to be in jail.

[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.200]
And this kind of thing goes on all the time within the so-called ministry doesn't matter.

[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:31.500]
We want to talk about Jim Baker or about any blacker or any of these other porn or chaos and adulterers and whatever they are.

[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:31.860]
Excuse me.

[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.000]
We can talk about biblical law.

[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.180]
We can talk about natural law.

[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.400]
We can talk about the laws of the land.

[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.760]
I've already told you that we live in a country of laws.

[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.940]
The biblical laws are not the laws of the land.

[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.620]
Well that's why I'm willing to talk about the other laws.

[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.800]
That's why sodomy is illegal in this state.

[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.960]
That's why I want to tell you.

[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.900]
You realize what percentage of your audience broke the law last night?

[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.760]
Married people in their bedrooms broke the floor to law?

[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.280]
You're looking at one of them.

[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:55.040]
I don't think you will find them.

[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.900]
Call the sodomy police immediately.

[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.860]
Sodomy generally refers to homosexuality.

[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:01.980]
Wrong.

[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:02.520]

[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.560]
Absolutely wrong.

[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.700]
No, it is.

[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.380]
No, look at it.

[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:07.880]
No, no, no.

[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.000]
He's going to keep repeating it like he has a lot of other things.

[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:10.180]
No, no, no.

[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:10.900]
You don't confuse him.

[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:12.400]
You have a dictionary in the building?

[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:13.840]
Neil, you haven't even looked up the law.

[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.260]
The law.

[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.280]
I've read the law.

[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:17.360]

[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.680]
We've had, don't you think I did this kind of a show for 15 years, Reverend?

[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:21.260]
I will.

[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.960]
Before I decided it was hopeless and that's certainly not what you were feeling like.

[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.400]
It certainly doesn't sound like it, but did you have made a good character?

[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.760]
No, because I don't have a fact.

[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.860]
If I don't have the number of the stands, my mind is the best that I ever know what it says.

[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:31.940]
The best that I ever know what it says.

[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.080]
Calling which means that you have no argument at all.

[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:34.320]
Right.

[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.020]
Go ahead, try to defend morally homosexuality.

[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.460]
Try to defend your position.

[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:39.560]
Defend it morally.

[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:45.040]
First of all, let me say this, if two adults are engaged in consenting behavior that gives pleasure to me.

[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.240]
You wanted me to do something and now you're interrupting me.

[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.080]
Do you want to let me finish the sentence or not, my Reverend Paranoia?

[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.080]
Yes, you let me answer you.

[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:52.840]
Yes, go ahead.

[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:59.600]
As I say, when two adults are engaged in consenting activity that gives pleasure to each other without doing any kind of harm,

[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.000]
how in the world do we have to justify that?

[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.780]
I don't have to justify that to you.

[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:09.000]
In fact, if you and your other people of your ilk would mind your own business, there wouldn't be any...

[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.660]
That's correct.

[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.540]
All right, we have to go ahead and be very calm.

[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.780]
We have 30 seconds.

[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.820]
Let Jason...

[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.000]
Keeping Jason's.

[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.240]
The Supreme Court has already said the Constitution doesn't confer a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in homosexual activity.

[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.860]
And the fact that homosexuals conduct occurs in the privacy of a home does not affect the result.

[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:30.200]
Is that the same Supreme Court that says it's okay to have abortions?

[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:32.080]
You don't quote them on that, though, do you?

[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.800]
Well, I think they're one of the reasons I think they're wrong.

[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.080]
So what the hell are you quoting them as a source?

[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.460]
You don't even believe what they're saying?

[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.400]
Because they can't even...

[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.220]
No, no, no.

[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.340]
They can't even have an act or an act of the Supreme Court disagrees with both of you.

[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.620]
All right, we are going to take a short break for this whole thing.

[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.600]
And, do you think we will be back?

[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.160]
You're listening?

[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:48.180]
We are back with you, Hon.

[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.040]
News talk, Radio 610WIOG.

[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:51.960]
Let's take a look.

[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.280]
I just discovered something by the way.

[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.140]
He tells me for the last 50, it's 13, by the way.

[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:00.580]
13 years since I came out of the closet that I've been arguing for homosexuality.

[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:01.940]
I didn't know that that's what I was doing.

[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.220]
Well, you certainly are.

[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.920]
As I said at the beginning of the show, I don't need your acceptance.

[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:08.220]
I don't want your acceptance.

[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.520]
I don't give a damn about your opinion quite frankly,

[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.640]
because you're a very disturbed individual.

[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:13.900]
I feel sorry for you.

[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:18.380]
But as far as, you know, that line about promoting homosexuality clearly...

[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:19.060]
Well, you clearly are.

[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.540]
No, I'm not promoting any of that.

[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.060]
And it's clear.

[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.480]
I'm trying to promote you to do that.

[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.600]
I'm trying to promote tolerance, not homosexuality.

[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:26.400]
You sound like our friend Jack in the Gables.

[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.120]
You sound...

[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.660]
You don't think you've had a conversation with him before the show, do you?

[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:32.920]
I really need to direct your polling camp vote for everybody else.

[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:37.040]
I really need to get in here to explore something in your mind here.

[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:40.020]
Are you suggesting that Niels promoting homosexuality

[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.880]
from the point of view that he is, since he is admitted he's homosexual,

[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.480]
that he then becomes a role model?

[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:46.980]
He's more than being a role model,

[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.680]
but I think it's an immoral position.

[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.480]
I mean, he's just saying who he is.

[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:53.280]
Are you saying that that in the end of it so?

[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:54.580]
I want to explore this with you.

[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.020]
When he said it's all right to be homosexual,

[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.180]
he says that there's nothing wrong with being homosexuality.

[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.440]
Now, here's my question.

[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.700]
Niels Rodgers gets on the air.

[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.680]
He says it's all right to be homosexual.

[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:07.000]
I get on the air and I say it's all right to be a homosexual,

[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.400]
a homosexual, whatever you want.

[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:12.680]
Are you suggesting that because Niels and I say that it's okay

[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.360]
for somebody who wants to be homosexual,

[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.800]
to be a homosexual, that you would start having sex with men?

[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.620]
I'd clearly know I wouldn't lie.

[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:21.800]
But I think that you could...

[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.920]
You could have let me tell you one thing.

[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.840]
There's a whole thing you can't make chopped liver

[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.020]
or chicken liver out of chicken.

[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:29.320]
What were you worried?

[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.000]
Can I put it in?

[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:30.160]
Drop it.

[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:30.980]
Chicken drop.

[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.720]
How do you try to say that no one has ever influenced

[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.440]
into homosexuality?

[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.200]
You are what you are.

[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.040]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.360]
To go back to something, can I just...

[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:38.640]
That's exactly what I'm saying.

[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.940]
But I give you a little education.

[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.540]
To go back to something Steve asked you the first hour

[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.840]
when he was talking about statistics.

[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.820]
Because someone may have a homosexual act,

[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.200]
because they're confused or because they're going through

[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:49.680]
adolescence.

[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.780]
Or because they're experimenting.

[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.680]
That doesn't make them homosexual.

[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.060]
You are what you are.

[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:57.240]
And when you pick up a magazine, when you're 12 or 11 years old,

[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.000]
and a picture of a centerfold in playboy arouses a young man,

[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.080]
that probably means he's heterosexual.

[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.140]
And if it doesn't, then a picture of a young...

[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:10.480]
Whatever he might be with almost no clothes on arouses the same young man,

[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.680]
then he's probably a homosexual.

[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.440]
Nobody wakes up one morning and says,

[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:16.360]
Hey, I decided I'm going to be homosexual.

[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.060]
Or I decided I'm going to be heterosexual.

[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.280]
In an genetic...

[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:20.760]
More and more.

[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.320]
Well, let me go ahead.

[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.960]
Whatever you have in it.

[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.520]
Whatever Jason, you can bring in environmental factors

[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.060]
if you want to.

[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:30.660]
Whatever, it's not a choice.

[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:32.080]
It is not a choice.

[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.460]
Nobody gets up any more.

[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.420]
No more than you could go to bed with another man.

[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:35.880]
No one...

[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.500]
You're no different than anyone else in the world.

[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.360]
He can never...

[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:38.700]
He can never want to.

[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.960]
He can never accept that.

[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.300]
Because once the thing has started admitting to that,

[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.100]
then their whole argument is gone.

[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.300]
Because they're trying to suggest that they're conscious.

[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.480]
This is a conscious immoral choice.

[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.840]
That would be like saying that somebody consciously wakes up

[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.020]
in the morning and decides they're...

[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.220]
If you have a show, you have to let me answer some questions.

[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:56.860]
They're going to decide and decide who you like on the air.

[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:57.940]
They're going to be black.

[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:58.820]
No, I can't...

[00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:59.660]
I can't just decision.

[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.960]
I can't let them...

[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.320]
Go ahead.

[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:01.800]
I can't.

[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.300]
I came on to debate two of the largest talk show hosts

[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.920]
that are advocating this position.

[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:06.800]
I think it's clearly wrong.

[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.020]
I think the majority of the people,

[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.060]
even in this community, think that it's wrong.

[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.000]
Where are you in those cases?

[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.920]
About 80% of the people think that homosexuality is wrong.

[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.340]
For them.

[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.260]
No, the question was, is homosexuality right or wrong?

[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.000]
That's what Governor Martin thought about abortion.

[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:24.940]
Who actually went out and took a survey?

[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:28.080]
They found out even a big fact that you're the best argument

[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.280]
is to call me a bigot.

[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.520]
I'm telling you, I'm not calling you a bigot.

[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.180]
You are a bigot.

[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.040]
No, I'm not a bigot.

[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:33.520]
You are a bigot.

[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.800]
No, certainly not.

[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.020]
You're just another eight-off Hitler.

[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:36.260]
No, no, no.

[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.160]
I'm not going to retract that.

[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.020]
That's what you are.

[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.860]
If you didn't have the kind of laws in this country to restrict people like you,

[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.320]
you'd be out there stoking the ovens right now.

[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.160]
And don't tell us otherwise because you would.

[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.260]
The best you can do...

[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.420]
Is tell the truth.

[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.500]
And I apologize to me in calling.

[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.820]
It's the calling.

[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.920]
If that's the best of your argument.

[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.300]
If you've ever had an orgasm, have you ever had an orgasm?

[01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:58.400]
Have you ever had an orgasm?

[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.540]
I resent your question.

[01:00:59.600 --> 01:00:59.900]
Why?

[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.920]
It's been from the whole thing.

[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.320]
You're sitting here making all kinds of moral judgments about sexual activity.

[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.120]
Not only homosexual, but heterosexual as well.

[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:08.860]
Why would you have a reservation?

[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.040]
You won't ask your question.

[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.100]
Why would you have a reservation?

[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:11.520]
You are.

[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.440]
You are answering that question.

[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:13.940]
You're talking about sex.

[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.380]
Like all these born against you.

[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.340]
You're talking about sex.

[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.320]
Why are you getting deal with it?

[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:22.660]
Is it that the answer to the question would make you look bad in your mind?

[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.120]
Is it why can't you answer a question?

[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.820]
It seems like it's an innocuous question.

[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.340]
Very simple.

[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:26.860]
Yes or no?

[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:28.680]
I think I've answered it before you many times.

[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.160]
Yes or no?

[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:30.760]
Yes or no?

[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:31.860]
Have you ever had an orgasm?

[01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.740]
You're out of bounds.

[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:33.760]
Oh, I'm out of bounds.

[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:34.640]
You're lost.

[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.680]
You're the basketball referee.

[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.980]
You're right about it.

[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.940]
You're way out of bounds.

[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.880]
And I don't expect you to ask that question of anybody who comes up on this show.

[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.080]
You're lost it.

[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:43.480]
Why not?

[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.440]
I have really lost it.

[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:44.820]
Why not?

[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:45.680]
You're way out of bounds.

[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.640]
I'm out of bounds.

[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.260]
I really think you're sitting there and you're telling everybody in the audience that I'm immoral.

[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:50.720]
Why?

[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.600]
And that's all these other millions of people are immoral.

[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.920]
And if I ask you a very simple biological question, I'm out of bounds.

[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:00.160]
I believe both the Bible, both the Old and the New Testions, but there are other religions in the world.

[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:03.220]
And all those religions, almost all the religions in the world are in them.

[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.440]
I can damn home with that.

[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.160]
Yeah, I can damn a lot of other things in the whole of the world.

[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.340]
I can damn each other as well.

[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.020]
Don't take that.

[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.880]
Why do even countries that don't believe in Christianity who don't even believe in it?

[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.760]
Well, I hate to break the news.

[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.720]
All European countries that I mentioned to you before, the predominance.

[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:18.640]
Wait a minute.

[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.420]
Wait a minute.

[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.100]
The dominant, the dominant religion.

[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.500]
There are all the countries that I mentioned to you before is Christianity.

[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.040]
And you have a post-Christian.

[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.200]
I'll get out of here in Christianity.

[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:36.400]
The fact is that the fact is that the direct is post-Christian Italy is pro-Christian.

[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.140]
How many of them go to church?

[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.820]
Do you know what their church attendance is?

[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.760]
Is somewhere around 4%.

[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.180]
Oh, that's about the same level as homosexuals in this country.

[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:45.940]
Yeah, I wonder if it's all homosexuals.

[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.060]
I don't like that they're like, let's go to that.

[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.120]
Let's go to Pompano.

[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.200]
We're going to take our first call.

[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.200]
Pompano, you're on to here.

[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:51.980]
Hello.

[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:52.880]

[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.720]
Don't get upset.

[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:58.740]
Neo-Rodges is on to upsteed pains ratings which are poor.

[01:02:59.320 --> 01:02:59.900]
Thank you.

[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:00.740]
That's it.

[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.280]
This is the best we can do for a hate call.

[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:04.600]
Pretty sad.

[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.660]
Isn't there anybody else here?

[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.700]
Here's some of the degrees we're chasing.

[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.240]
Hang on.

[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.120]
There's nobody.

[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.380]
I'm just trying to find one caller to agree with Jason.

[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.220]
They may not agree as to the extent of how long it is.

[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:18.880]
I don't think anybody can come out there that want to execute homosexuals or a adult.

[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.760]
We're not talking about the right mind.

[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.540]
We're not talking about the extent of the punishment but I think most people agree.

[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.700]
You did the last time we were here.

[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.680]
We're talking about the embarrassing that they're in tummy.

[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.700]
I should be executed.

[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.480]
Is homosexuality right or wrong?

[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:29.860]
The majority.

[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.800]
No, we're not here to ask if it's right or wrong.

[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.820]
We're here to respond to the correct thing we agreed on the year last time.

[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.820]
We agree that the majority of people would agree that homosexuality is wrong.

[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:38.580]
Absolutely.

[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:39.760]
No question.

[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:39.920]
No question.

[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:40.840]
Thank you.

[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.900]
The only thing that the majority of people would agree on abortion is a woman's choice.

[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.180]
Come on.

[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.320]
Now they've taken all these polls.

[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.540]
76% in Florida.

[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.580]
I don't believe in it.

[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.940]
I don't believe in a poll because you don't believe in a poll.

[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:57.460]
You are.

[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.500]
Every time we have an election, they just don't lose.

[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.760]
Tell them who won the last election.

[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.980]
We had three people who were four abortion.

[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.900]
Three people who were against it.

[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.680]
Who won that election?

[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.920]
Which election you're talking about?

[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.740]
The last one we had.

[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:11.140]
The presidential election.

[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.700]
No, the local election right here.

[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.660]
We had three people who had been there.

[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.020]
Oh, I see.

[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.700]
And the fact that all the Cubans came out and voted for really on a roster has nothing to do with it.

[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.660]
Tell me who the government is.

[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.240]
Tell me who the government of the state is.

[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:20.420]
Yeah.

[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.120]
And you know something?

[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.620]
You know something you're a governor.

[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.400]
The governor is telling who the country is.

[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:24.700]
And tell me who the president is.

[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.160]
And tell me who the president is.

[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.800]
Tell me who the president is.

[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:27.860]
Oh, geez.

[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:28.400]
Here we go.

[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.100]
Now the politics start coming in.

[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:31.180]
I'll roll.

[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:31.720]
I'll roll.

[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.160]
We have finally.

[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.280]
Jason.

[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:34.860]
Jason.

[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.780]
We wouldn't take long before the right wing Republican.

[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:39.740]
We have finally.

[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:40.420]
We have finally.

[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.420]
You are.

[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.260]
We don't happen to be Republican.

[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:42.360]
What?

[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.900]
We have to be Republican.

[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.660]
What is it an issue?

[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.580]
You happen to be Republican.

[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:46.380]
Are you?

[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:46.660]
Are you?

[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.760]
Are you a Republican?

[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:48.820]
Sure.

[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.600]
Oh, what an accident.

[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.860]
Another Republican's war.

[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.200]
I'm not ashamed of it.

[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.460]
What a mystery.

[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.860]
We have found we have been raised.

[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:56.980]
Jason, shush.

[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.140]
Why do you do that to me and not to hand?

[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.720]
You've clearly gone way out of bounds.

[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.440]
You've taken a position and it's clear from this.

[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.840]
I agree with Neil.

[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:06.440]
Of course.

[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:07.740]
So what?

[01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:08.840]
Am I supposed to agree with you?

[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.860]
Am I supposed to take out my brain just to be neutral here?

[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.400]
Not at all.

[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.780]
I finally found a caller who agrees with you.

[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:14.900]
Good.

[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:15.740]
We're in the fire monitor.

[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:16.680]
Here we are.

[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.000]
I'm glad to put my IQ again.

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:18.420]

[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:18.940]
Miami.

[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:19.800]
You're on the air.

[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:20.040]
Hello.

[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.860]
Let's see if this one can do better in the West.

[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:22.880]
When are you there in Miami?

[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:23.600]
How can it be?

[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:24.120]
Yeah.

[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.020]
Okay.

[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.400]
First of all, Steve, you haven't had a chance to say much today.

[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.880]
But the one thing you managed to say,

[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.220]
if Jason could have heard it and let him hear it,

[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.720]
is the biggest problem with Christianity

[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.700]
is that they got so many different branches and offshoots

[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.200]
of it fighting against each other.

[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.200]
They're not going to accomplish what God wants them to accomplish.

[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.980]
And he is a perfect living example of that.

[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.300]
I thought you were supposed to be in Jason's side.

[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.320]
I do agree with you.

[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:49.580]
I agree with you.

[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:51.460]
I'll get to the part where you agree.

[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.160]
Because he needs health badly here.

[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.920]
I'm not preventing any other denomination or religion

[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.040]
from doing whatever they want to do.

[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:59.560]
I'm clearly not talking about Christian Jason.

[01:05:59.840 --> 01:05:59.940]
Sure.

[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.640]
Let me direct myself towards Mr. Rogers.

[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.480]
Neil, let me promise this by saying,

[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.960]
I promise this by saying, I listen to your show.

[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.520]
I think you're a very funny man.

[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.940]
And I love your show.

[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:16.920]
However, however, the point that Jason is trying to make

[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.280]
when he talks to you about homosexuality

[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.700]
and when he talks to you about the wrong things

[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.080]
that mankind is perpetuated throughout history.

[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.440]
Like the Spanish Inquisition.

[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.440]
All kinds of things.

[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.260]
And the crusades.

[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.900]
You know, religion is not something of God.

[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.180]
Oh, no way, but why are you smiling and laughing when I said that?

[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:35.120]
Were those good things?

[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.880]
Neil, religion is not something of God.

[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.500]
God has no place for religion.

[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:40.540]
I did not try to defend those things.

[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.880]
But you said it's just an instinct that you have to go back 800 years.

[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:44.960]
Is it for a little bit?

[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.740]
Let's move it up a little bit.

[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.160]
Let's move it back up to the Salem witch trial.

[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.440]
Why was it okay for the...

[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:50.560]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.300]
Don't get off.

[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.400]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:51.700]
Don't get off.

[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.860]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.440]
Don't get off.

[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.640]
That's a real intention.

[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.040]
Go ahead, sir.

[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.280]
Make no sense.

[01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.000]
You're sure as correct?

[01:06:59.360 --> 01:06:59.520]
Yes.

[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:00.700]
Do you believe in God?

[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.100]
No.

[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.180]
You don't believe in God.

[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.740]
I believe in ethical Judaism, sir.

[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.720]
It's got nothing to do with God.

[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:05.420]
Okay.

[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.920]
Can I prove to you that God exists without...

[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.180]
No, without...

[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.180]
I'm not going to hint it about you.

[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.420]
Sir, can I tell you how many of these shows I've done with people like you

[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.740]
and many others try to...

[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.360]
Look, you believe what you want to believe.

[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.380]
Sir, can I finish a sentence?

[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:19.500]
He's a car.

[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:20.160]
He's a guest.

[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.640]
But I listen to him.

[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.020]
I want to respond to him.

[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:23.680]
You cut him off.

[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.460]
Let me explain something.

[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.240]
I'm cutting him off.

[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.440]
I'm not even going to give you a thought.

[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.020]
You're not cutting him off.

[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:27.600]
Let me explain.

[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.480]
Listen to some academic argument that proves these...

[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.820]
Sir, I believe in the Parliament.

[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.820]
I believe what you want to believe.

[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.080]
I want to explain one thing.

[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:35.820]
And I will.

[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.400]
Real quick.

[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:36.660]

[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:43.260]
A bargain question tries to convert other people to believing in Christ for the reason that that

[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.800]
is his purpose in Christ.

[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.260]
Whether they want to or not.

[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.760]
No, not whether they want to or not.

[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.160]
Sure.

[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.060]
Now, you're absolutely wrong.

[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:57.100]
The people that perpetuate this who are trying to impose their beliefs on people who don't want to believe them

[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.680]
are the ones who are causing all the problems in Christianity.

[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.060]
You mean like Jason?

[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.000]

[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.620]
Do you think, like, the moral law of God?

[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.760]
Do you think that's just for Christians?

[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.220]
Do you think no only Christians should not lie to you?

[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.220]
Or do you think that's for everybody?

[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.880]
I hung up on him because we have reached a break point.

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:13.740]
So we'll be back.

[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.400]
You're listening to this.

[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:17.580]
Carly, we are back on News Talk Radio 610WID.

[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.500]
Let us go to Miramar.

[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.220]
You're on the air.

[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:21.460]
Hello.

[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:22.700]
Hello, Mr. Kane.

[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.140]
Yes.

[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.040]
How are you listening?

[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.400]
I'm listening to the show for a few minutes and it just seems to me like the other guy, not the reverent, but the other guy.

[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.440]
He's kind of losing it a little bit, you know?

[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:33.440]
Yeah, the other guy.

[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.140]
I don't know what the other guy's name is.

[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:35.880]
The homosexual.

[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.600]
The homosexual, right, right?

[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.100]
The fag.

[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.380]
No, I'm not going to call him a fag right now.

[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.140]
The homosexual.

[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:41.560]
Yeah.

[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.360]
He just kind of...

[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.360]
You called yourself a homosexual, so I think you should own up to it.

[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.580]
I should own up to it?

[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:47.840]
Sure.

[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.880]
I've owned up to it publicly for 13 years.

[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:52.100]
How long have you owned up to the fact that you're a unit, River?

[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.160]
I never claim to be anything other than what I am.

[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.300]
I hope to be married one day.

[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.620]
Why don't you hope to be married?

[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.220]
Well, you're not going to do it at the right year going.

[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.520]
You're off to a very slow start.

[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:03.840]
I appreciate it.

[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.080]
Yes.

[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.720]
I mean, could I ask you...

[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.940]
You can ask me anything, sir.

[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.820]
I can ask you...

[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:08.640]
I want to ask you a question.

[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.320]
But is it...

[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.180]
I've heard so many times.

[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.140]
I'm not a homosexual or anything, you know?

[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:13.940]
But...

[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.660]
I believe you.

[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.460]
You sound like one, sir.

[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.180]
I believe you.

[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.540]
Does everyone have a swishy voice, sir?

[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.280]
Okay.

[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.960]
You sound a little fruity to me, pal.

[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:20.840]
Really, okay.

[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.460]
Well, that's okay.

[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:27.740]
It seems to me, or I've heard many times that a lot of the homosexuals are people that were...

[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:31.860]
at one time or another as little kids abused or mispeeded or something like that.

[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:32.820]
No, not true, sir.

[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:33.520]
Where did you hear that?

[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:34.140]
Who told you that?

[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.940]
Well, I mean, it's just something that you hear.

[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.080]
It's like people that end up being jailed as a young kid.

[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.280]
If you get to mispeed, it comes out of jail.

[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:41.800]
Sorry.

[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:42.700]
No.

[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:43.700]
Okay.

[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.240]
Well, that...

[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.780]
Well, I have to disabuse yourself of that notion, if I can say it.

[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.300]
So to speak.

[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.140]
Now, how old are you?

[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:49.980]
How old are you, sir?

[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:50.680]
I'm 26.

[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.180]
You ever had a homosexual experience?

[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.480]
I had never in my life.

[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:53.840]
No.

[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:54.360]
No.

[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.380]
Never thought about it?

[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.020]
Never.

[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:56.480]
Well, good.

[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.700]
The reverend loves you very much.

[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.260]
Well, nice talking to you guys.

[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.040]
Okay.

[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:02.240]
Thank you for the call.

[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:02.940]
I think I was happy.

[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.340]
It was happily departed.

[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.420]
Well, he's starting to think.

[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.500]
No, I think most people will agree.

[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.360]
I agree with you, guys.

[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.560]
He didn't say that.

[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.540]
He didn't say anything of the sort.

[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.880]
He just said he never had an experience.

[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.280]
He said he never had an experience.

[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:13.280]

[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:13.960]
I could do it.

[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.180]
I could.

[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:14.760]
I could.

[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:14.980]
I could.

[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.660]
I could at least have had some sexual experience.

[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.880]
I could tell the youths.

[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.940]
I could fill these phones for two hours with heterosexual males for two hours.

[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.420]
It would tell you that at one time in the life they had homosexual experience.

[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.660]
And most of them would still say homosexuality is wrong.

[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:27.920]
How do you know?

[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.300]
I think you can try to do whatever you want.

[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.440]
Maybe most of them don't care.

[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.200]
Maybe most of them are...

[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.920]
I think what you would find is 90% of them will tell you that whatever consenting is all

[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.940]
wants to do is okay.

[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:38.420]
Well, that's really...

[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.260]
Do you want to do a survey?

[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.140]
You really want to?

[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.100]
Clearly, because you have consenting adults doesn't make it either moral or legal.

[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.600]
They're talking about what the majority of people would say.

[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:52.220]
I am telling you, we could do a two-hour lightning round here with people calling in.

[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:56.080]
And you would find 90% of the people here would say that whatever consenting adults

[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.040]
want to do in the privacy of their home is their own business.

[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:02.820]
And I will tell you, assuredly, that just because they're consenting adults makes no difference.

[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.780]
That's your opinion.

[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.420]
No, not at all.

[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.820]
Just look at the opinion of the public.

[01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:06.720]
Don't you understand me?

[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.100]
Tell me his mind.

[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:07.720]
He's the deal.

[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.120]
I can blow away your argument right now.

[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.720]
Mr. Rogers, is suicide wrong?

[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.720]
What the hell is that going to go?

[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.440]
It only does that.

[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.620]
Another word that doesn't do harm to somebody.

[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:18.840]
Right?

[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.760]
We're talking about acts that don't do harm.

[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.120]
Okay, very weak.

[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.280]
You can do a lot better than that.

[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.460]
No, it doesn't do harm.

[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.000]
Okay.

[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.020]
It still does harm to the individual.

[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:31.180]
We're talking about consenting acts that don't do harm.

[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320]
And you know that.

[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.660]
So don't bring in some ridiculous thoughts about that.

[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.900]
The point I'm a scientist at you, you can do whatever it is that.

[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.400]
The suicide is wrong.

[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:39.960]
The suicide is wrong.

[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.980]
You can do better than that.

[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.360]
The suicide is wrong and homosexuality is wrong.

[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:43.860]
Right.

[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.760]
And so it's where moral don't do.

[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:46.900]
Moral don't do.

[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:47.120]
Moral don't do.

[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:47.380]
What's the reason?

[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.580]
Why is that?

[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:48.740]
Why is that?

[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:49.380]
What's the reason?

[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:49.680]
What's the reason?

[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.180]
What's the reason?

[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:50.400]
What's the reason?

[01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.800]
Why do you keep interrupting me?

[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.120]
Miami, you're on the air.

[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:56.400]
Hello.

[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.120]
Hi.

[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.260]
Hi, how are you doing?

[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.040]
I'm doing good.

[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.060]
Listen, my name is Terry.

[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.680]
I live in Hong Kong for the city.

[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.600]
But I'm from New York.

[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.340]
I talked to you guys earlier this morning.

[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.300]
I began with who died and left Jason Boss.

[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.460]
I'm not boss, but you were, you know, I'm clearly agreeing with you.

[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:11.960]
It's just the right hand.

[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.580]
No, no.

[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.900]
My grandmother is a Christian from A to Z.

[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:16.660]
I'm not saying I'm perfect.

[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.100]
I believe in God in my own way.

[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.600]
The one thing she's taught me that I've handed down to my children and my grandchildren.

[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.360]
And that is, you can hate the person for what they've done, but you cannot hate the person for who they are.

[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:28.720]
Well, I would...

[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.220]
You're condemning these people.

[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.340]
You don't learn nothing.

[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.700]
I'm condemning homosexuality.

[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.100]
I'm not here to condemn homosexuality.

[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.340]
I'm not here to condemn homosexuality.

[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.400]
I'm not here to condemn him.

[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.020]
I'm here to condemn homosexuality.

[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:42.920]
Oh, it says, same line.

[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:43.560]
And homosexuality.

[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:45.940]
And we love the sinner, but we hate the sinner.

[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.880]
Tell me what is what is what?

[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.360]
We love the sinner, but we hate the sinner.

[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:51.980]
Do you think God is in favor of homosexuality or is he against him?

[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.400]
Has anybody...

[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.120]
Has he spoken against homosexuality?

[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.500]
I have never heard anybody talk down homosexuality before they're dead.

[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.660]
Have you read what the Bible says?

[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.500]
He's a loving, tolerant person.

[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.660]
He's either the old or the new testament.

[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:07.460]
Have you read what's his name?

[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.620]
Not just the Christian, but a loving, tolerant person.

[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.920]
The major religion of the world.

[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.360]
Even if it's not acceptable.

[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:14.200]
He's a human being.

[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.300]
He is an obsessed, the Old Testament.

[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.840]
Christianity accepts the Old Testament.

[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:17.580]
Listen.

[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.580]
When you ask you, do you know any homosexuality?

[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:21.380]
What did you tell him?

[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:22.880]
Do I know homosexuality?

[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.580]
Do you know anybody?

[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.220]
Yes.

[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.680]
And you can't condemn them to him?

[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:30.080]
I condemn homosexual activity, certainly, and God...

[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:30.840]
Because God does.

[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.980]
I don't think it can be you.

[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.860]
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.160]
I don't think it can be you.

[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.380]
No, certainly not.

[01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:37.180]
All right then.

[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.820]
Because they don't bring it to me doesn't mean that it's all right.

[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:40.440]
That does not...

[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.580]
I can't excuse that activity.

[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.500]
I haven't had many prostitutes come up to me either, but her activity is still wrong.

[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.920]
If she's a prostitute, and I'm still going to speak against it.

[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.940]
Because they don't affect me doesn't mean that it's all right.

[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.840]
What do you think God meant when he condemned homosexuality in the Old Testament or the New Testament?

[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.100]
Which does condemn homosexuality?

[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:00.880]
That is wrong.

[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.560]
So, yes, it is wrong.

[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.160]
Exactly. So that's why I'm here to try to help people realize that it's wrong.

[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.820]
When you're raising your kid on a moral quest...

[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.840]
You're trying to help a moral quest.

[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.700]
Isn't that what you said?

[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.240]
On a moral quest.

[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.420]
Why do you...

[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:14.520]
Why do you not want to tell us what you said the last time you were here?

[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.360]
I'm not executing homosexuals in adultery.

[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.800]
I'm not backing down from the biblical position.

[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.920]
Okay. So in other words, again, he wants to emphasize that he thinks that...

[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:26.360]
Homosexuals and adulterers and fornicators should all be executed.

[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:27.240]
Along with...

[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.600]
We can handle all this obedience.

[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.380]
And also disobedient children who are in court here.

[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.300]
If you're going to make fun of the position, at least let me explain it to you.

[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.420]
No, I'm just quoting it.

[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.360]
I didn't say I'm making fun.

[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.040]
I'm quoting him.

[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.480]
People don't understand where Heinrich Wallace is coming from.

[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.620]
It's an ideal, but it's also a requirement of God.

[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.680]
God commanded it.

[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.920]
And also, if we had that in force, we would have a safe land, a land with not nearly the violent...

[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:49.340]
You know what this is?

[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.240]
I'm here already.

[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.300]
Have you ever heard the excuse somebody...

[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.280]
Somebody does something evil.

[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.620]
They say the devil made me do it.

[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:55.900]
You heard that a million times.

[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.020]
Same thing in reverse.

[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:58.260]
God told me to do it.

[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.240]
That's why I'm going to execute your bad person.

[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:00.840]
Well, is God wrong?

[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:01.700]
Yeah.

[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:02.460]
You're full of him.

[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:03.060]
That's the rule.

[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.860]
In other words, if you're...

[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.340]
You're a person.

[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.520]
Even though who are reasonable...

[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:07.760]
God.

[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.500]
Even those who are reasonable to leave him.

[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.940]
God cannot say that it's only God who can make the judgment.

[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:15.100]
And if there's a judgment going to be made, it'll be at the appropriate time,

[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.920]
not by Reverend Paranoid Pollis.

[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.180]
The New Testament did nothing to overturn the moral law of God.

[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:20.720]
That's the...

[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.560]
Where parents set, they decide their kids...

[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.840]
They're not going to help society.

[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:24.380]
They're not going to help society.

[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:24.980]
They're going to stop their kids.

[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.420]
They're going to stop their kids.

[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.220]
They're going to stop their kids.

[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.540]
Do you find the chapter in verse one?

[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.820]
Did you give me the Bible back, please?

[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:29.880]
I'll trust me.

[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.660]
I'll find it for you.

[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:31.960]
Okay, you're having a great deal of difficulty.

[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.680]
I'll find it.

[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:32.980]
All right.

[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.020]
We are...

[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.460]
We are going to...

[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:35.740]
You know what?

[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.200]
You don't mind him going to your Bible, yeah?

[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.180]
Did the lady have any other questions?

[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:39.700]
No.

[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:40.820]
She was going to hung up.

[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.740]
Because we are going to...

[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.000]
We are going to take...

[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.700]
You were having enough trouble with the moral law of God.

[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:46.860]
The moral law of God has not been overturned.

[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:46.980]
All right.

[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:47.440]
We are going to...

[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.240]
I'm so glad to hear that.

[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.020]
We are going to take a break.

[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.260]
We've reached a halfway point.

[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.120]
God bless us all.

[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:51.900]
God...

[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.080]
What does a tiny Tim say that?

[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.480]
Yes, God bless us that we want.

[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680]
We are going to know about him, don't we?

[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.800]
We are going to break for the...

[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.560]
They always said that.

[01:15:57.940 --> 01:15:58.000]
That's him.

[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:58.960]
I was never quite sure.

[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.540]
That's a say, if you guys...

[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.080]
We were...

[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:01.780]
Tiny Tim.

[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.320]
Don't you know Tiny Tim, not from a Christmas Carol.

[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.820]
Tiny Tim with a banjo.

[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:06.120]
Right.

[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.860]
Don't you have a sense of humor, Reverend?

[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:08.880]
Come on.

[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.140]
We are going to be back.

[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:10.700]
You're listening to the...

[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.660]
Wait, not a little while.

[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.380]
I didn't stand W-I-O-D.

[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.140]
He'll be going through the Bible here, trying to find that...

[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:16.240]
Good.

[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:19.440]
Parents killing their kids, according to Old Testament law.

[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.140]
And he has agreed to totally stay out of this next segment because there's something that...

[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:25.980]
Has come up that disturbs me deeply.

[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.440]
And I need to explore it with you.

[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.540]
And I want to remind you going in...

[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.580]
Not that I have to remind you you're born again Christian.

[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.460]
You're obligated to tell the truth, right?

[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.740]
Everyone ought to tell the truth.

[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:36.960]
I agree with that.

[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:37.400]
I agree with that.

[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.420]
I think you ought to start.

[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:39.720]
I agree with that.

[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.200]
No, no, no.

[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:41.600]
No, no, no.

[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.140]
No, no, no.

[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.720]
But that's a good example of moral law.

[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.100]
Everyone ought to obey moral law.

[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.120]

[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.640]
Now, let me ask you a question.

[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:56.960]
We received a call from a young lady who was sort of telling Nick an interesting story that I need to check out with you.

[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.420]
Do you know a lady named Cher?

[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.380]
Yes, I do.

[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.500]
Tell me about her.

[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.720]
I debated against...

[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.720]
With her at another news...

[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.240]
Park Radio.

[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.020]
JNO, right?

[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.420]
WJNO, that's correct.

[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:11.600]
She is a topless dancer.

[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:12.720]
Is that correct?

[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:13.840]
No, that's not correct.

[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.640]
She was with some of the topless dancers that I debated against.

[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:19.140]
She doesn't work at Moories?

[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.220]
I think she's Dan's bar there.

[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.600]
Did you ever...

[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:28.180]
You met Cher on the leaf owl show on JNO, correct?

[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.980]
Yeah, but this is getting into...

[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:30.720]
No, no.

[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:35.280]
You have never done anything that you're ashamed of that you wouldn't talk about, have you?

[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.840]
No, but again, I don't...

[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:37.080]
Oh, great.

[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:37.820]
That's fine.

[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.600]
Well, it's just...

[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.420]
You know, find out.

[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:40.920]
You know.

[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:46.780]
Did you ever call or have contact with Cher after the program when you met her?

[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.940]
Yes, I have contact with her.

[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.640]
Okay, you want to tell me about it?

[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:53.660]
Well, you know, I haven't seen her since then.

[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:55.540]
We talked for a while after the radio show.

[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.820]
You never stopped by Moories?

[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.140]
No, no, I haven't.

[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.660]
So in other words, if she said that you'd never saw her after the day of the show...

[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:03.120]
If she...

[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.000]
In other words, if she said you don't think so...

[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]
No, I haven't seen her since the day of the show.

[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.060]
I have talked to her.

[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.180]
You call her?

[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:09.480]
Yeah.

[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:10.980]
Yeah, I did.

[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.260]
But there's nothing wrong with that.

[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:14.700]
Well, I don't think...

[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:19.360]
I think it's the healthiest thing I've heard out of you in the time I've known you.

[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.320]
I'm not criticizing you.

[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:21.120]
I think it's fabulous.

[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.160]
I just...

[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:22.760]
What is your...

[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.280]
I mean, if you don't mind me sharing, what is your interest in this lady who works at a top-less board?

[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.460]
We talked for a while after the show and I have talked to other people.

[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.100]
I've talked to people that have been on your show.

[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.280]
You know, it's...

[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.740]
We continue to disagree.

[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:37.780]
What's your second question?

[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.340]
I assume Mr. Rogers doesn't want to continue.

[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.100]
If she...

[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:46.500]
In other words, in her conversation with Nick, if she said that you would stop by to see her at her place of work, she would be lying?

[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:49.380]
Yeah, I think...

[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.960]
I think she would tell you that I have not stopped by there to see her.

[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.620]
Well, that wasn't what I asked you.

[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:54.580]
I have not...

[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.180]
I've called...

[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.540]
You know, I've not stopped by there.

[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:57.340]
You just called her at home?

[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.220]
No, I called the place that she works at.

[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.260]
Ah, okay.

[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:02.840]
You talked to her.

[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.280]
Okay, and is this...

[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.480]
Is your interest in her to kind of save her from this life of...

[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.120]
So, from what I understand she's a very well-endowed lady, too?

[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:11.660]
Is that correct?

[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.720]
Am I not supposed to speak to her?

[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.220]
No, I...

[01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:16.620]
Jason, I think this is terrific.

[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.060]
I'm here to help you encourage you along these lines.

[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:19.540]
I'm not...

[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:21.840]
It sounds like the kind of thing that I would have done before I was married.

[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.260]
And I think it's...

[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:28.340]
I want to know if maybe being on the Steve Cain show, I can take some credit for opening up...

[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:28.360]
Why?

[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.420]
You up in this way?

[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.300]
Well, I haven't gone out with girl before, that's what you're...

[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:36.840]
Well, but I mean, it's just one kind of interesting that you would call her at a topless bar having met her.

[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:37.820]
I mean, I didn't know...

[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:38.880]
And what I...

[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:47.500]
My concern was whether you were trying to save her soul or whether you were trying to act in a normal way and, you know, maybe, you know, get involved in something physical.

[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:48.780]
No, thank you for your concern.

[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:49.640]
I appreciate that.

[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:50.320]
Can you...

[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.960]
Can you...

[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.420]
Answer my question?

[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:58.700]
I mean, is your interest in saving her soul or procuring her other parts?

[01:19:58.820 --> 01:19:59.380]
No, wait a minute.

[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.280]
What do you mean by...

[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.400]
I'm asking you a straight question.

[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.120]
If I were to ask her out, I see nothing wrong with that.

[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.300]
I think it's fabulous.

[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.520]
I think it's fabulous.

[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.480]
And if we were to continue our discussion, there'd be nothing wrong with that.

[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.040]
I think that's fabulous, too.

[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.440]
Is this the first time?

[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:12.500]

[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.480]
I don't think it's fabulous.

[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.480]
I would warn her ahead of time that she's in for a lot of reasons.

[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.280]
I don't feel like that.

[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.040]
I thought I'd agree.

[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.140]
Don't feel like that.

[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:23.620]
Is this the first time you've ever dated anybody from the topless entertainment industry?

[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.020]
Well, I mean, I visualize you as basically you're going out with Bornegan Christian.

[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.880]
You're a big part of your pattern?

[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.120]
I don't think that I've dated her.

[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.060]
Again, I've not seen her since that time.

[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.260]
You've never asked her out.

[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.840]
You never asked her to get together.

[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.480]
She may be giving us a wrong story.

[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.260]
I called her up to get together and she was busy then.

[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.260]
She asked me to call back of Ivan Busy since then.

[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.340]
We've not gotten together.

[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.000]
That's...

[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.660]
But your interest in saving her soul?

[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:51.540]
I was interested in talking to her after the show.

[01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.780]
But I'm interested in talking to many people after many of the shows that I do.

[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.760]
I think it is wonderful.

[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.080]
Well, I'm really interested in her too.

[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.560]
I'm sure that's why you brought it up.

[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.280]
I would encourage you.

[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.300]
And there's nothing wrong with it.

[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.180]
I think it's quite to the contrary.

[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:03.020]
I think it's a wonderful thing.

[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.940]
And I like the direction I surprised at it.

[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:05.760]
I'm surprised at it.

[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.120]
Well, I was surprised when I heard it.

[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:11.300]
But I would like to encourage you to continue to try to reach this way.

[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:11.980]
I'm going to say it again.

[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.380]
It's biologically impossible for a 35-year-old man.

[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.440]
Not to have had any kind of sexual experience.

[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.120]
It's biologically impossible.

[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.220]
I haven't found that one past but here's another classic.

[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.260]
This is so typical of God's where he kind of misses the target.

[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:29.120]
Well, you're hardly afraid.

[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.480]
It says, David said to Nathan,

[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.820]
I've sinned against the Lord and Nathan said to David,

[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.680]
the Lord also has taken away your sin.

[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:35.640]
You shall not die.

[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:40.500]
However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme,

[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.260]
the child also that is born to you shall surely die.

[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.400]
So again, this is the sins of one generation falling upon the next.

[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:47.500]
And it goes on here.

[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.340]
Nathan, on the seventh day of the child died.

[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.520]
Does that sound fair to you, Chris?

[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.580]
That's just what God does and loving God.

[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.360]
In other words, if you're out of your mind.

[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.080]
Or a great grandfather did something sinful act.

[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.600]
Therefore, you should die on the seventh day after your born.

[01:21:58.700 --> 01:21:59.320]
That's justice.

[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:00.060]
Is it?

[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.980]
That's the same kind of sickness.

[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.060]
Well, I don't know what to hear him account for.

[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:05.600]
What do you think is all true?

[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:06.400]
It's all true here.

[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:07.500]
Does that sound fair?

[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:10.700]
If I admit it, it's the Neanderthal people who wrote this crap

[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.120]
and you know it as well as I do.

[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.800]
Does it deny that vehemently?

[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.520]
What does it sound like justice to you?

[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:19.040]
If I committed a sin that my child died after seven days,

[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.480]
does that sound like just to be fun to death?

[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.960]
God has the right and he takes you.

[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.900]
If you want to call it blame, God is a big enough God.

[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:26.740]
It's a big enough God that can blame you.

[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.140]
Does it sound like justice to you?

[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:28.980]
It's an adieu.

[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.080]
Does it sound like justice to you?

[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.520]
Why is it your angry because you're beginning to see a picture

[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.640]
of the holiness of God?

[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.040]
The holiness and the justice.

[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.360]
Absolutely, just.

[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.100]
That's right.

[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.700]
If somebody else commits a crime, let's kill you.

[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.180]
In other words, if we can't get, wouldn't that be great?

[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.700]
That would be a tremendous way to increase the statistics

[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.020]
with the law enforcement agencies.

[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:49.540]
You know, they'd be a lot more effective.

[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:54.080]
If they can't catch the real criminal, let's fry somebody else just to make everybody happy.

[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:54.360]

[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.100]
From their parents.

[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:55.380]
From their parents.

[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:55.640]
From their parents.

[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.120]
From their parents.

[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:56.260]
From their parents.

[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:56.840]
From their parents.

[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:56.840]

[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:56.840]

[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:56.920]
From their parents.

[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:57.880]
From their parents.

[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:58.200]
From their parents.

[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:58.920]
From their parents.

[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:00.560]
From their parents.

[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.920]
From their parents.

[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:10.680]
From their parents.

[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:37.160]
It's not there 댓randog we have to say anything?

[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:37.280]
Sentoms are allowed for lectures, maybe for a ladiesaramczyn одним desolit patents.

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.280]

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.280]

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.280]

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.280]

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.280]

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:37.280]

[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:40.660]
Would you agree that you attend the commencement?

[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:40.660]

[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:43.540]
Jason I mean this is so too hot take it off

[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:50.300]
We can't say penis on here. See he is hyperventilating now. No, I know that one Jason. You're getting upset. No, I'm not upset

[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:56.620]
I don't what is calls for a physical exam and you have been I'm not able to work believe me but I think it calls for an exam

[01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:02.020]
I don't think it's you know he could be on her all the do you realize what a hit he could be he could be on her all though

[01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:04.900]
I don't penis got him hysterical penis how about nose

[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:13.260]
Some you see your problem is like all a born again Christians anything that has to do with sex you become absolutely hyperventilating

[01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:18.360]
You get it. I thought you started quoting the scripturing you start the condemning how many times about quarter the scripture today?

[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:23.380]
Oh many no not many times but I will tell you the Bible does say homosexuality is wrong and we

[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:23.980]
We've heard that

[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:27.800]
The majority of people believe and it also said that whether you're

[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.660]
Your son or not

[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.060]
The world agree

[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.120]
I want to tell you something I want to tell you something I'm gonna do something

[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.520]
Is this juvenile or what mr. Homosexual?

[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:44.980]
Did you call me?

[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.600]
Because of my meat because that all I am continue because every time he is the every time he goes to the martryu

[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.100]
I'm homosexual and your paranoid

[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:58.720]
It's not true and I'm not paranoid but anyway the bottom line is that I encourage people to read these fairy tales

[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:03.040]
You know why because if they will really sit down and get that book out and read it

[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.260]
They'll realize that all right

[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:08.320]
People who wrote it why they wrote it in a real

[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.020]
Rejected article

[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:10.400]
Harkey

[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.480]
It's filled with a lot of things. There's no question but when we get back I would like you to find what you said you can

[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.260]
I want you to find that passage where it talks about all the people that God wants to stone and do away with them

[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:26.140]
You know the adulterism he can't find it. He'll find you can find it

[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:29.700]
I mean I found that one I can find about the part about homosexual rather rather

[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:34.880]
Ravada I want the part about it. I want the part about it. I can only find the part about homosexuals pronto man

[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.200]
That's like right in his finger. That's part of that. That's what he wanted. All right. We are gonna take a short break

[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.780]
Let's check in with oh, excuse us

[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:48.260]
We are back. I see you got a 16 WYOD. Did you get these new prices from Toyota?

[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.040]
Hollywood

[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:55.740]
This has been an eye-opening. I want to get back. I want to ask him a question. Well, I'll ask the question

[01:25:55.740 --> 01:26:00.300]
But I think that during the break we can we finally got a tremendous concession from Reverend my poor

[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.420]
Making progress. No, I think we will maybe you started out with visions

[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:08.240]
He's got visions of sharing his mind or whatever that young lady that voluptuous young lady is and

[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.160]
He said we were talking so I said in the Bible somewhere

[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.140]
It says that it's also a sin to spill the seed which means master babe and he said well

[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:23.880]
He said I don't believe in capital punishment for master babe. I think I think that was such a concession on his part

[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:29.460]
That I love you any audience may may have a free mind. You may rest easy tonight. Okay. No

[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:33.800]
I thought that your implication was that they were in the same category and clearly

[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:40.940]
The Bible I just said it's a sin. I believe that it is I'd like to ask you a question

[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:45.680]
No, but doesn't it say in a screen? Why is it that it's so difficult for you? It's just a book Jason

[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.860]
Let me help you just that it's a sin. It's a sin. That would you want me to say okay?

[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.060]
Well, it doesn't it say that in the Bible?

[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:55.640]
Still in your seat is a sin not specifically no. Oh sure does. Oh come on

[01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:01.140]
No, you have one who was condemned who was punished for it

[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:04.580]
What there was but there were they were mitigating circumstances in that particular instance

[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:10.120]
But I'd like to ask you a question and he was so would you would you agree that my position is

[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.140]
Consistent with what the old testament. I know you don't agree with it

[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:18.100]
But you would you agree that it's consistent with what the old testament teaches? Yeah as well as no

[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:22.900]
No, it doesn't say anything about executing homosexuals or adulterers in the old testament

[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:27.800]
I mean it's got all it's got a lot of hate and a lot of oh are we gonna have to go through all this scripture again?

[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:30.100]
It doesn't it doesn't go in I thought it does

[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.440]
I thought it does

[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:38.560]
In parts of it it does but the part of the Bible he's talking about it doesn't I mean the part that we're trying to find which for some bizarre reason

[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.440]
He can't find about stoning to that the children and all the other litany of

[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:47.660]
Rook has punished the short and three lines going ahead and read it there if there's a man who lies with the male

[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:51.820]
As those who lie with the woman both of them have committed a detestable act they shall surely be put to death

[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:53.800]
That doesn't Leviticus chapter 20

[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.380]
I'd also talk about someone who lies with the animal of it. Let me have the Bible back. There you go

[01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:58.860]
He finally

[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.400]
I'm begging you but will you say now he knows I'm gonna I'll read that I'll read it okay

[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.720]
I have no problem with that you admit that you were wrong about what the Bible teaches no well I'm part of it

[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.900]
Yes, okay, I have forgotten about that great love

[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:21.680]
For one have no problem in saying that you are equally as absurd in your belief system is the Old Testament is and killing children killing

[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.040]
It's a real testament is not absurd. I give you credit for consistency

[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:30.360]
You know, I think most people even if they don't go as far as we evangelicals go will say that the the old testament is

[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.360]
At least basically accurate is clearly not written like a fairy tale is is filled with historical

[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.720]
I love where I love in the mind where they talk about blood offerings and all of that so that's terrific

[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.240]
And of course that's so contemporary. It's terrific. What do you think of the Santa Ria?

[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.780]
I'm talking about you believe in blood offerings. No, certainly not

[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:52.480]
Well, it's in the Old Testament. Oh my god. I believe in the moral law of God that is that is for all time

[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:54.280]
What about what it says in the Old Testament?

[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.760]
You were you telling me that you can system with the Old Testament? You must believe in blood offering

[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.820]
I don't want to read the segment on blood off. Oh, it's quite long

[01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:03.800]
I believe let's get a little what Jason's into here. Go ahead

[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.720]
Says what is left of it Aaron and his sons already? This is that's talking about

[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.460]
Handful of fine flower, but we get on here to the

[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:16.620]
Now this is the law of the guilt offering it is most holy in the place where they slay the burnt offering

[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:20.180]
They are to slay the guilt offering and he shall sprinkle its blood around on the order

[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:27.080]
Is it that on you wait a minute then he shall offer from it all its fat the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails

[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:32.780]
Oh, that's that's the two kidneys with a fat that is on them which is on the loins and the lobe on the liver

[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:37.620]
He shall remove with the kidneys and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the autores and offering by

[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:41.980]
Fire to the Lord who is a guilt offering every male among the priest may eat of it

[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.100]
It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy. You do that Jason. No, no

[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:49.180]
Says right here. You said that the Old Testament is

[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:52.900]
Now those the moral law the Old Testament is valid. There's a clearly

[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.660]
Selective piety

[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:02.360]
You can ask the questions the moral are the things that are always going to be so things like lines teal and cheating murder rape and almost like

[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:06.560]
homosexuality. Oh, yeah, let's buy the way in that trolling for boys on the year

[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.360]
I think this guy's been hanging out with jackfruit by I really do

[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:15.520]
By the way in that in the Bible if you want to continue the sacrificial system you have to do it at the temple

[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.580]
And there is no temple anymore. So even if I were to want to I couldn't oh I have to go to temple

[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:23.320]
But there's no temple of Israel like there was back then. Oh, there's a temple of

[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:28.740]
Right up in the street and there he said and did they do any sacrificing there? No, because it's pretty there

[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:34.580]
It's smart enough to understand that a lot of this is symbolic gobbledygook can seem to the minds of protein deficient

[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.720]
No, bad swandering the desert superstitions

[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.580]
The primitive and pericel more and bound to the whole world educated

[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:43.860]
No voting from this to justify their hatred. That's all it is

[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.800]
quoting from this to justify the

[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.040]
I totally are secured. I truly hope that you turn away from your

[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:54.080]
Your all I know and I hope that someday you're enlightened enough to at least I don't think you're much

[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:59.800]
But at least at least be somewhat you're enlightened so that you can get a tolerant tell just a little bit of tolerance

[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.980]
How about that of the hate that you know about all the other nations in the world and the world together?

[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.940]
They all hate homosexuals. They all hate homosexuals. They all hate homosexuals. They all hate homosexuals.

[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:09.240]
All the nations in the world. We have many

[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.160]
I'm only about

[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.540]
Well, I'm only about 12 out of 17

[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:15.360]
To be circumscenters. They have a lot of going on getting

[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:18.720]
All right, okay, well, we're we got a break for a news update

[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.820]
What I want to know is but really because I'm still hung up on that share thing

[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:26.720]
Did you when you call share at her place of work this topless bar for a date?

[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:31.020]
Did you have in mind knowing her in the biblical sense? No, certainly not

[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.540]
You didn't have biblical

[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:37.260]
I want you to know listen you gotta let me read this okay. This is about lepers go ahead

[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:43.220]
Then the priest shall look at him and if the swelling of the infection is reddish white on his bald head or on his bald forehead

[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:48.060]
Well, I hope the birds not listening like like the appearance of leprosy and the skin of the body

[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:54.940]
He is a lepros man. He is unclean the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean is infection is on his head

[01:31:54.940 --> 01:32:00.880]
As for the leper who has the infection his clothes shall be torn and the hair of his head shall be uncovered

[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:03.400]
And he shall cover his mustache and cry

[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:09.080]
unclean unclean that sounds pretty good. Well, it was a contagious disease and very contagious

[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.360]
And they were trying to isolate and they did that effectively

[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:17.080]
And he shall cover his mustache well, that's one that's one of the reasons the Israelites didn't suffer some of the other diseases

[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.680]
That some of those other centuries. I'll cover your mustache is according all right

[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.320]
Well, I wish everybody this week would get out these bibles and read if they if they haven't had a few good laughs recently

[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.040]
They'll be on the floor

[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.520]
There when we get back on the floor there is no book in a history of the world like the Bible thank goodness when we get saved

[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:41.420]
Maybe mind we get back when we get back we will get a little duteronomy 21 18 check that out duteronomy 21 18 you're listening to the Steve Caincho 610

[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:45.780]
W I O D all right, we are back on news talk radio 610 W I O D

[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:52.460]
We're going to write a great wrong which has been done over the last couple years on the Steve Caincho

[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:55.120]
Where I don't permit the quoting of the Bible

[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:59.620]
I think we've done a tremendous disservice to the good book and what we're going to do for the next hour if you have

[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:06.480]
Any suggestions for Nick. He's going to keep a line open and date and and browered about some of these horrendous Bible verses

[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:12.440]
Like duteronomy 21 18 which we're about to go into that you would like to have past your polls count for

[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.880]
What we're going to do for the rest of the show is we're going to do a little Bible reading on the show

[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.000]
We're going to get into the real nitty-grinayodian favor reading the good book

[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.400]
I'm sure I wish you'd pay more than two thousand to listen. All right

[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:29.740]
Do you know why you want to trouble finding this because in my Bible it's got twice as many pages because one pages in English the other pages in Hebrew

[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.180]
So I'm looking like way in the back here and it's not it's in duteronomy

[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:41.140]
So we thank whoever called and this is duteronomy chapter 21 verse 18 if any man has a stubborn and rebellious son

[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:47.760]
Who will not obey his father or his mother and when they chastise him he will not even listen to them

[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.380]
This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey us

[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.420]
He is a glutton and a drunkard

[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.420]
Then all of the men of his city shall stone him to death

[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:07.040]
So you shall remove the evil from your midst and all his real share shall hear of it in fear

[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:12.360]
And if a man is committed to sin worthy of death and he has put to death and you hang him on a tree

[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.000]
His corpse shall not hang all night on the tree

[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.860]
But you shall surely bury him on the same day for he who is hanged is the cursed of God

[01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:27.660]
So that you do not defile your land which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance and then it's time's reasonable now listen to this

[01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:29.160]
I don't listen to this

[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.680]
Listen now here's some that I had never even seen before her although would go nuts

[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:39.000]
That after oh wait a minute now you've got to hear this chapter 22 verse 5

[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.360]
I had trouble taking a woman shall not wear man's clothing

[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:49.460]
Nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God

[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.800]
Well, just what it what let deal with them separately

[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.240]
We'll let the first one about killing the kids. I have big sense. Sounds like good parenting. Well clearly

[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.180]
It's not again. It's not a little kid who won't eat his vegetables

[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:05.260]
It's clearly something far far more serious and I believe they're people today that are you got to hear our keep goes

[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:06.660]
That gets drunk oh no

[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:12.500]
Right to the snow this is if there is a girl who will encourage you to a man

[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:18.740]
I don't think another man finds a city lies with her then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city

[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.560]
And you shall stone them today. I mean do

[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:26.780]
Just before you go on I will but don't want to me chapter 21 and 22

[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:32.340]
21 and 22 are the best I mean this is a classic example a real good

[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:36.440]
sampling of the kind of hate and the kind of nation

[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:40.560]
Well, we're just not stoning everybody of that. I mean if you look at

[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:44.760]
The crossides don't them today. It's in his head. He believes in this. He's his believes. Yeah

[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:47.160]
He says he's going to be talented. How do you feel about this?

[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.020]
Stoning if you're married if you're engaged to grow as a version of guy goes to bed with the taking both out

[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:56.480]
The stonem to death in front of the city you believe that right? I do believe in the moral law of God

[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.760]
Yes, right? The answer to the question. Well, I am answering the question

[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:07.360]
I think if we had this this is not only God's ideal of God requirement if we had this people wouldn't engage in in the activity that we've described here today

[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.380]
You have you have a land that would be safe

[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:14.000]
You think we should have you'd have a lot of you have a land that would be safe people would be totally safe

[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.520]
You wouldn't have you know a hundred rapes right? So let's you would walk everybody in and repress them so much that they don't do right

[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.300]
I know that you want the right to be immoral, but there's no such rights

[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:27.840]
It's just like having capital punishment from murder is now we see this normal murder, right?

[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:30.180]
I when you've got rid of capital punishment

[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:32.640]
You know what happened when we did for 10 years capital punishment

[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:38.660]
But now we have it back. Thank God. Hey, but now there's no more murder right the murder rate doubled when we took it away for 10 years

[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:42.080]
And just all this time the murder rate double went to the way for 10 you are

[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.500]
Now what it says now that we have you are for stoning

[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:51.040]
Now that we have it back that the murder rate is going down. I don't think that's a question

[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:56.840]
I don't know if you think our capital punishment the way we administer our punishment is too lenient

[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:00.700]
Okay, let's get chapter 23 now this again. These are so good

[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:05.920]
Because this is a loving God and even if by accident you should have some kind of deformity or some kind

[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.820]
He's also adjusted. Oh no question

[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:13.260]
No one who is emasculated or has his male organ cut off shall enter the assembly of the Lord

[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.480]
No, no one

[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.980]
I hear again. This is something no one has any can do all these things are things that people have no control over

[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:24.420]
No one of illegitimate birth shall enter the assembly of the Lord. Okay, so again

[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.360]
You could be an illegitimate child have no control over that you should never let go

[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.420]
I don't want to let go on the time. I want to wait. Listen to this

[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:34.100]
You want to know but yeah, but let me finish the quote to you

[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.880]
Let me finish believe me. No biblical expert. Oh, I know

[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.220]
He's reading the chapter

[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:41.400]
I'm as a single correct person. No one has no biblical

[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.840]
intellectual entity assembly of the Lord. I know and you're no jack Kennedy

[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:49.340]
None of his descendants even to the 10th generation shall enter the assembly of the Lord

[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:51.940]
So for 10 generations we're going to punish those people

[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:54.420]
Who are descendants of someone who was born

[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:56.600]
I don't know. He was your likes to come

[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.220]
Yeah, certainly would he's not talking about punishing them

[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:03.380]
What he is talking about is requirements to enter the temple or the priesthood

[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:06.960]
And you know, you know why that is because the priest had to be without blinish

[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.960]
Which again is what the behavior of another lamb had to be without blinish and Jesus wasn't so

[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:19.360]
But so what you're saying is Jason that if four generations ago your great great grandfather had had a child at a

[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:25.000]
Weblock and that you were caught up in that ancestry that you wouldn't be allowed to preach today. No, no, no, that's where oh yes

[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.180]
Yes, that is what it said

[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:28.680]
I found one one

[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.560]
Laws for is like a

[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:35.540]
Characombs entering into the priesthood. I got one here that so far you haven't gotten any

[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:39.860]
I got one here as well. You haven't gotten anything. I've gotten plenty. Okay, but not lately believe me

[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:42.440]
You're no biblical expert. Oh, I know and you're no genius

[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:48.180]
Number 10. I'm not sure that you know that if there I don't have any evidence here for almost three hours

[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:53.040]
If there is among you any man who is unclean because of a nocturnal emission

[01:38:53.620 --> 01:38:57.160]
Then he must go outside the camp. He may not re-enter the camp

[01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.180]
That's correct

[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:03.260]
Well, then why did God create that how is that possible? I mean, that's a volunteer volunteer

[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:07.180]
It's an involuntary thing. You're the one that's saying is you know normal and good

[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.560]
I didn't make any judgment. I just said it happens. It's a biological

[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:15.180]
It's it's involuntary. I didn't say anything about normal good battery and different

[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.940]
I'm not passing judgment like you are

[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:23.820]
But how then why did God create the possibility for that to happen? You're sleeping all of a sudden this horrible terrible thing happens

[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.680]
And you're a sitter involuntarily what what God is saying is there

[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:32.540]
Requiring when you come before you're too much, but there are certain requirements when you come before him

[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.600]
And he has the right to make those rules, right?

[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.760]
Uh, you know a woman who doesn't answer my question again

[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:40.920]
Well, I say I want to say if I have to go you allow me time today

[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:44.560]
You didn't ask where you allow me I could retire. Well you allow me. I'm

[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.040]
You're not answering the question you all you don't let up is let it let's get them to go please go ahead

[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:55.180]
It talks about being ceremonial clean and unclean doesn't have much to do with the actual sin when a woman has her period

[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:57.500]
That is also called ceremonially unclean

[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:03.080]
That's not saying that it's wrong is you're saying that's a fact and God is saying that there's a thing wrong with it

[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:09.920]
No, not at all God in this in this instance is talking about being ceremonial is unclean

[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:16.460]
Good and desirable in the eyes of God you're the expert has the right to determine you know the people that come before his

[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:21.880]
Is God is unclean in the context that is using the Bible considered to be good or bad

[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.400]
I you know you're in that particular point

[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:29.740]
You know God is saying if you're going to come before the temple you have to have

[01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:34.300]
Fulfilled the requirements. He's not saying so there's something wrong with you if you're unclean

[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.320]
He's saying that he won't be lost

[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.000]
And you couldn't if you were blind you couldn't come before Lord

[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:39.320]
He's not

[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:42.040]
You couldn't you couldn't be

[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:47.280]
That's a loving God. That's not why you can't become a priest if you're blind

[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:50.900]
That's not the point his point was he was foreshadowing as a matter of fact

[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:55.160]
Why couldn't a lamb a lamb had to be without spot without blinish? Why is that?

[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:59.320]
Because the Messiah was that way. Jason this is a bunch of

[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:05.700]
Iberish not at all gobbledy cook not at all conceived in the minds is meddling mario hair would put it of protein

[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.220]
No, Matt's

[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:15.860]
To loosen it tell it why why they have you know about a thousand prophecies in the Old Testament about 900 have come home already now

[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:20.600]
We're here with that again. I'd be glad to do a show a whole show about how many prophecies have come true

[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.500]
There's no book like the Bible the correct doesn't do it

[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.640]
You know how many books do you know that can prophesy something before hand

[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:33.500]
If prophecies are broad and generic and general enough you can

[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:38.880]
Not 100% look at it is equal to the way of the way of what about the middle of the heart?

[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:45.500]
The entire it's specific it's specifically says a whole city will be not all destroyed but tossed into the sea now

[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:50.040]
Exant of the great did just that oh another homosexual. Oh my god

[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.160]
Wow, did you better watch yourself? Well another homosexual?

[01:41:55.060 --> 01:42:01.500]
Did you look at all those what you refute what I just said the prophecy? Can you refute what I just said another

[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:08.360]
homosexual? Why are you putting Alexander the great? How come if it was prophesized it would take a homosexual to carry this prophecy out?

[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:10.980]
God can you as many oh yeah, he works in mysterious

[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:16.420]
You think a hole on that one baby. Oh, just that again. We're gonna take you to be talking about the angel

[01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:18.100]
short great for

[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:22.780]
Joe Brennan with Metro traffic brought you by Bell South ability cellular network

On this talk radio six 10 W I O D 11 wine fine momentary to hand or later

[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.820]
All right, don't forget to be coming up October 14th and 15th. I just mentioned that oh I turned away from this

[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:42.500]

[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:46.780]
The decimates true. Yeah, oh absolutely no mistake about William Ramsey

[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.820]
You say it's true. I have to I don't have to do any more investigation if you say it's all that

[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:55.600]
They are theologist have looked up by the cities. No car you can deny that but he can no question about it

[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.840]
You're heard of an oscar as the put his head in the sand. Yeah, yeah

[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.320]
Highly motivated not to believe that by there's no there's no

[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:05.260]
You're a guy with Reverend paranoia

[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:09.800]
Because he's made up to mind he's got all back and forth if you'd like to argue I have to do that for three hours

[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.020]
I have no good all because you've got all I haven't heard

[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:16.340]
I haven't heard of argue on this third of what you are I had a hate monitor that you are no

[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:20.140]
I have no hate for even I do the kind of eight-offular mentality that you're trying to warn me

[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:21.700]
Oh, that's good. No, it's not in

[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:28.120]
It's true. It's absolutely true. I have no homosexual no question about it absolutely and I have no problem with that

[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.940]
I'm just like Hitler and Dr. Mangle you are

[01:43:30.940 --> 01:43:33.380]
No, I'm not

[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:37.660]
No, I'm not I'm the best looking you for the kind of a hate that you preach has nothing

[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:39.660]
Just like all of these born again cultists

[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:41.780]
You know there are a lot of great things to this

[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:47.860]
You're going to go into this you're what are you equating homosexuals with rapists?

[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:51.140]
I think the Bible certainly equates them certainly. Yeah, I think they're both

[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:55.180]
They're not so they have in common the Bible equates them. You know they're clearly

[01:43:55.180 --> 01:44:01.340]
What is the relationship forgetting about the Bible and just switching if you can with an ab switching the common sets for the moment

[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:08.600]
Well, the Bible is what does rape have to do with a homosexual act between two consenting as oh both are immoral

[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:12.720]
Yeah, both are wrong everything in God's opinion everything is immoral

[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:18.100]
Is this not consistent both of you all the air have admitted this very good my position very consistent without the Bible teaches

[01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:25.560]
We're trying to figure out how the Bible feels about you calling share at a topless bar and lusting in your heart only only I would say there are many

[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.640]
That many can't say anything without him. He's too

[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:31.360]
Now what he just did look what he just I didn't

[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:34.880]
He responded to that I didn't hear it. He accused me of lusting after somebody

[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:41.440]
You want to tell me you had no luck now mad you're a Christian. Yeah, you sat there looking at her with her humongous

[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:43.660]
Mamedia you're telling me there was no lusting

[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:47.880]
I that was not I want the truth. I think you're an attractive girl

[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.460]
It's as well as an attractive man. There's not a lot of what made her attractive

[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:54.620]
A good figure but doesn't that make her sexually attractive? Is that a fancy?

[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.060]
You said no of course not but why can't you talk about it?

[01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:00.600]
But I think so what hey I'm not a time what's going on?

[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:04.220]
So physically and psychologically I'm talking about it. I want to really I want to tell you

[01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:07.740]
You're going to tell me there was not I want to tell you you're not going to help you

[01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:10.280]
Tell me you keep telling me you keep telling me what's in your mind

[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.700]
I'm asking you to get out of your mind and into your heart the bottle of drugs that I'm lusting in your heart are you telling me?

[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:17.160]
Carter had of course he was in that

[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:18.120]
As you look

[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.280]
Yeah, that's all I have to do. There was not the slightest bit

[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:24.120]
Not the slightest bit of lust as you gazed at her breast

[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:27.660]
I stopped myself from not if I got what he's facing her

[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.300]
Now he turned to the wall

[01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:32.880]
Well, I want you know your friend we foul had I said up so he was

[01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:35.840]
He was looking at her and I was not that's the way he was

[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.980]
But that's why he was called her back after what she'd get a good look from the crowd

[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:42.120]
All certainly not well, I want to go out with her was there any

[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.500]
Was there a hard one that don't Christians have

[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.360]
Structural dealing to her each other

[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.620]
There's a different my good girl like I said there are real living

[01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:53.320]
There's a great thing for it. This is when there's a real paranoia here

[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:56.960]
But they're actually between saying girls attractive and they're not any wrong with that right

[01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.360]
Sexual attractive and going beyond that and sexually attractive

[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:06.200]
Let me ask you a question. Are there men who are attractive to physically attractive? I'm talking sexually

[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:11.040]
Was it really attractive? Sure they're handsome men. Okay boy that was quite an accomplishment

[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:15.640]
But that doesn't know I'm not I'm not see I'm not doing to you what you try to do to me

[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:18.080]
I'm not condemning you I'm not trying to sneak something in there

[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.460]
So at least we find have risen to a level where we find that elite and they're not there

[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:25.500]
I agree that both the Bible now forget about that Bible

[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:30.300]
I still have a majority of people we have two minutes here before we go off the air

[01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:34.960]
Majority of people if we had an election today and in Mississippi the majority of people would take away

[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:36.780]
Civil rights and the right to vote for Black

[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:46.560]
The majority espouses a particular view that automatically makes him all excuse me because I've just exposed that nonsense

[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.700]
You thought he was just

[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.960]
I just did I just did I want to get back we have now 90 seconds

[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:58.520]
I still have not heard you say as a Christian telling the total truth there is not one little

[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:03.900]
Itty bitty lust in your heart feelings of lust when you call share her place of

[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:10.840]
How can their law never experience you're letting him of the hook here was there anything in your heart as you look deeper your soul

[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:11.580]
What did you say?

[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:19.440]
No lusts that I tried to stop that yes, I you know he tried to stop us and everything is natural feelings

[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:24.640]
So what you're saying is you tried because he's a real one really I'm trying to be attractive and not lust after her

[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:29.620]
Well you tried not so you're saying you tried not to but there's lust there you're getting there's lust

[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:30.960]
No, it's not no

[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:39.420]
There could be that could be love it might be that could be that's it is and we are civilized people and we're able to control

[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:45.980]
So your way of your way of controlling your feelings of lust is to call around the phone and try to get a date with her right?

[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.180]
Is that your way? No, why did you call her and put yourself in that position to take it?

[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:54.360]
So what you're saying is I'm allowed to date non attractive girls

[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.980]
No, I'm saying that when you realize this potential for lust with this

[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:05.900]
Bucks him bar made or topless dancer that Jesus would Jesus would tell you to keep yourself out of temptation

[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:08.480]
And not to call her this denim and equity which he works

[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:12.420]
So I'm not I'm not allowed to talk to anyone who hasn't tried to say that

[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.100]
I'm saying what Jesus would try you

[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:17.080]
Jesus would tell you not to put yourself in temptation

[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.540]
What wouldn't he?

[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.360]
I'm not a perplexed

[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:23.240]
Do you think that if we could get him to pray it could help Paul kill Wistonight?

[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:25.180]
I don't know

[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:25.920]
I don't think so

[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:27.520]
Let's check in with your little

[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:30.660]
Facebook traffic brought you by bell south mobility back

[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:35.380]
Mercifully for our what will be our final hour ten people in his congregation

[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.740]
He said I'll be very said like 10 to 25

[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.960]
Well, we have what kind of a congregate in a house. I see so

[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:48.980]
So because my first is a minister like I'm a brainster look at the look but look with the Lord Jesus did with just well

[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.260]
But correct because my church

[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:52.940]
You look at the cups. It done with just nine

[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:57.020]
You're saying that I'm wrong because my church is firing both of you can members

[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:00.020]
But oh no wait, let me say just chase

[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:03.940]
I don't think there's anything wrong with you only having ten members of your church

[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:10.180]
But I think it should be an indication to you that you're not in the mainstream of American thinking wow

[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:12.920]
I was hoping religious point. Well, I was saying

[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:16.100]
I can't remember American banking would think that almost sexuality is wrong

[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.360]
They wouldn't go as far as the Bible

[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.680]
We've already been over eight million times

[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:22.560]
But they know why I think he had everybody who doesn't agree with that

[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:26.380]
With the majority of them wouldn't want to go as far as the Bible goes or as far as you would go

[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:29.820]
I think you've already admitted and they don't want to stole their disobedient children to death

[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:33.520]
Okay, but not sick like the Neanderthals or rotate those old New Testament or like

[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:37.640]
People want to take care of you. Not only just a little bit wrong, but it's very very very wrong

[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.720]
I'm gonna write that right now

[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:44.360]
But what Jason

[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.580]
The man has been here. He's been annihilated and wiped out

[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.440]
And lost the after trying to get him to give you a chance. They were thank you. Okay. Go ahead

[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.960]
I'll go of the of the hundreds of the world there about 170

[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:08.260]
We're beating the same tired garbage a million times. Yeah, you're like an automaton

[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:17.240]
Lines as he does parishioners. I haven't even finished it. Go ahead only about 12 countries of the world

[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:17.760]
I've heard this

[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:18.460]
10,000

[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.540]
I've finished it but you over the last

[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:29.600]
That's about seven percent of the world's population and that's and that is only in last few years and that is the civilized those that the civilized

[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.720]
I think so in other words in the world

[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.120]
Roman and Greek civilization what are you talking about Alexander the great who is doing God's bidding earlier?

[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:40.880]
So only the Romans and Greeks was that within the last few years because I was just in Rome this summer

[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:43.900]
It seemed to me like all those old buildings are from thousands of years ago

[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:47.840]
Well in Rome almost sexuality was a capital offense if you're really

[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:49.560]
Yeah, how about in Greece

[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:54.980]
In Greece of course Greece fell that is quickly. Yeah, they're like well

[01:50:54.980 --> 01:51:00.680]
If you read some their writings what they consider they considered women inferior and therefore they considered the high

[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:05.480]
You know some of the some writers who had homosexual tendencies said well, this is the high one

[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:09.120]
No, not some writers. That was a part of Greek culture. Don't feed me that you know

[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:13.160]
It's amazing how he rewrite history right here on the radio. Oh, you make it up as he goes

[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.800]
Say everyone in Greek culture back then was a homosexual

[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:16.860]
I can say that

[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:20.160]
I'm in practice homosexuality

[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.440]
Older men and younger boys was considered the highest

[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:26.340]
Oh, don't say younger boy Jack is gonna go crazy

[01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:28.980]
He's gonna be right that

[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.140]
Greece and only you

[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.620]
Jack and only long ago it far away and only if you have those homosexuals and again

[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:43.820]
They're justifications like Alexander the great that they believe that man was a period of women the Bible teaches that men women are equal

[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:45.740]
Now oh

[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:52.780]
Boy the five or four hours on that one which is why we have all the female priests in the cabinet right?

[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.380]
That's why women can vote until 1920 in this in this advanced country

[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:04.100]
Oh of course, oh just as there were strange and

[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:10.100]
Between being barefoot pregnant in the kitchen being of all the history of the world out in the new room here

[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.020]
First and all the history of the world

[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:15.660]
What percentage would you say that is made homosexuality?

[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:20.240]
Legal I haven't got any idea. I have no I'm not gonna take a guess. I haven't got any

[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:28.220]
I'm the host of stopping this line equating right now. I must have gotten no no no no no

[01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:37.600]
Is the question four hours every time you manage to get the floor or you can do is come back to the same old land

[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:38.680]
Margana did everybody else

[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:48.720]
In the building here W.I.D. You put them in a cage again. Okay, I don't want to go to the cage

[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:50.400]
The people

[01:52:52.440 --> 01:53:01.820]
I'm a racist disgusting society black

[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:02.680]
Who are

[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:08.780]
I'm not racist at all

[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:17.660]
What they quote from the Bible is justify their slavery why they burn their crosses on the front lawns

[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:20.180]
All those

[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:25.580]
You do Reverend that are for a cramp like you are lost if you've not now

[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:36.120]
I'm doing I'm making them up. We've never had slavery and we've never had cross-forties and we don't have the plan and we don't have

[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:40.900]
The ways of white-breaking mountains and black people those things that it hundreds of years ago you're humorous but inaccurate

[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.220]
We only have 45

[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:54.200]
I would like to try to help you guys again the majority people don't think homosexuality

[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:01.380]
You're helpful. Here's me. I know how you're gonna have on our hotline. Yes, share. Oh

[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.000]
Would you be interested to talk to you? No, we don't have share on

[01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:09.220]

Okay, we have somebody on the hotline that's gonna give us some information. Are you there? Yes, hi. How you doing?

[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:20.220]
Real good. Who's this? I'm Brady. I was at WTA. I know. Hey Brady. How are you doing?

[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:25.080]
Real good. What's happening? How much? Tell me what's going on. What's the story with Jason and Cher?

[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:29.840]
Well, it was sitting about six inches away from each other

[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.140]
You

[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:32.760]
Six inches

[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:38.460]
They were trying to print in there. There were five of us in there right and it was interesting

[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:45.280]
Did you get the feeling that Jason had any kind of attraction and the way he behaved towards Cher? Oh, he was

[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:46.160]
He was

[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:56.340]
Wrong with that. No, Brady. Which one were you were you at the microphone? I was sitting next to them as they refer to where the mother superior

[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:58.480]
Mother superior

[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:03.780]
What does that mean? What you was the owner of war. Oh, I see I see are well

[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.920]
I'd story want to find out what's going on here. Is there any hope for this this couple? I mean

[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:15.420]
Get the feeling here. You see what just happened with the lights in there like

[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:24.780]
The lights just flickered here the Lord is having a nervous breakdown. This man has lost in his heart

[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:31.440]
Come on Brady. We want the story tell us. Well, I did speak briefly with Cher this afternoon. Okay, and she said yeah

[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.420]
She does verify that they do speak they do speak sounds like more than once

[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:39.620]
Well, I guess they have spoken on the phone a few times

[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.380]
There's no there's nothing wrong with that

[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.640]
I'm gonna tell you exactly what's wrong here Jason that you lied

[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:57.340]
Holy yeah, you said I called her once and she would go out and I never spoke to her after that all right you lied

[01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:59.960]
I don't like our flickering

[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:04.280]
I called the Lord and I said his

[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:10.000]
The Reverend parent later I was busy and I ever got together and you've never ever seen talk again and

[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.180]
Phone in just how many times if you spoke

[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:18.600]
Oh, I don't know come on. Let me hear about these families

[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:21.920]
Reverend come on let's stop that you can be honest you have lost

[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:35.020]
What they're doing here. There's nothing wrong with me calling her. I called her she said she was bidding

[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.080]
Did you remember

[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:42.900]
Well

[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:55.300]
No, no, it's two or three now is something wrong for is there something wrong with me calling now, but I want to know what your intentions

[01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:01.560]
And I'm sure she would like you know there's do it be nothing immoral or anything like that done

[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:06.420]
It's I didn't ask you what would be done. I asked you what your intentions my intentions are honorable

[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.600]
Don't you guys know what that means?

[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:14.900]
Is this go back to what we're talking about during the break where you were kind of measuring her as a preacher's wife

[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:16.480]
What kind of creature why should they

[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:20.960]
Did you not say that you're you're you're out of mouth. I think it would be hard for a

[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:23.540]
A person with her background

[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:25.960]
But stranger things have happened

[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:35.740]
Well, she may she may be and I don't know her nearly as well as you know

[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.900]
She may be you can be well you keep calling this girl for a date and you it's only maybe the shoes of one person

[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:42.200]
Why don't know her very well?

[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:47.140]
You seem hung up for a lack of try you seem hung up on this for some reason

[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:52.600]
Yeah, if I've never gone out with anybody before well, but we're dealing by the way to share dance

[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:57.640]
No, she's not a dancer. She was she just a bar made or whatever

[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:06.120]
Yeah, she's the she's the name bartender and day manager. I see I see is she having any interest in Jason? Just to cure us

[01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:08.720]
That I don't really know

[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:14.460]
She doesn't talk a lot about it. I just mentioned to her today with my day off that he was on the radio

[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:19.080]
That she might want to talk to him. I would love to have her fall in here to find out

[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.480]
You know what's what the real story is because you know

[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:27.300]
It's not every day that you get a appreciate your born again mid-habor to get minister who's you know trying to date a

[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:33.040]
Top bar keeper, you know, I think I think it has real potential. You think she could straighten about as well

[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:35.240]
We're really asking I think so to speak

[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:40.240]
You know, I think you know that your version

[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:41.560]
I

[01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.420]
Believe it was mentioned yes

[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:46.440]
I see great

[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:49.320]
Well, that is probably a turn up for I would guess

[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:50.200]
You think

[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:53.240]
Maybe we'd like to speculate for us

[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.260]
Well, I could be if you'd be a pretty woman really I guess absolutely in fact

[01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:03.180]
Maybe you wouldn't and share it together might you know explore this with with Jason of course

[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:08.500]
You know, I can't because I'm there. Oh, yeah, hey, I miss out on best things

[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:12.960]
But I'm sure there's no shortage of ladies who would be willing to volunteer to round that you know to make it rude

[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:15.620]
I'm sure there would be a lot of women in the world and have to go volunteer

[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.900]
Thank you. I appreciate your call

[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:23.040]
All right, so far anyway you if you talk to her we really want to get a whole of

[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:27.740]
Share you know to get her on the air here to find out the how many times that we've really had conversations

[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:30.460]
It started like why I think I think

[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:34.960]
Well, what different does it make it's you know, there's nothing wrong with it. I think it's terrific

[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:40.280]
I think it shows there's hope these resting in your heart and all that like normal moral. No

[01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:46.380]
There's something wrong with life. I wouldn't go that far. No, he wouldn't go that far. All right. Well, it's short of it

[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:48.460]
Brady, I thank you very much for calling it

[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:50.880]
I got the record straight he was trying to sell us this idea

[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.560]
He just called her once and now it turns out there's been a call so many calls he doesn't around. Yes

[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:02.040]
Brady nice talking. Thank you. You're our best everybody at Maurice and tell the girls to watch out for Jason. All right, I will

Now let's check in with

[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:13.780]
We're back on news talk radio six and WI out of the US. We now have it gone through this credible period of harassing and haranging and arguing with Jason

[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:19.500]

More times than you can remember. No, no

[02:00:29.620 --> 02:00:34.600]
It's being done a show. I think it's three times. She asked me to call back. We talked to your phone

[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:41.040]
And that's you know vertically now. This is a shit. We have to drive and talk out of people after I've done sure

[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.240]
Because there's that you drive

[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:45.820]
But I think we're totally interested in this one. There are people tuning in and out all the time

[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:50.040]
A lot of people don't know what we're talking about. We have on the show the good right reverend Jason Polus

[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.100]
We have uncle Neil Rogers on and we found out that when

[02:00:54.920 --> 02:01:01.000]
Jason did a show in Palm Beach. You were talking about almost like when you did a show in Palm Beach that there was a very

[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:07.140]
voluptuous young lady who worked at Moorys, which is a topless bar who Jason has been having continual contact with over the phone

[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:14.840]
Her name is Cher. She works at Moorys, which is a topless bar. This is the lady that Jason has been calling and we have her on our hotline. Are you there?

[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:17.100]
Cher how are you doing?

[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:19.880]
You're up working there at Moorys today?

[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:22.280]
How's business you had Moorys now?

[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:24.520]
You've got a lot of people up there

[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:28.520]
Got a lot of topless bodies swaying in the breeze up there

[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:30.840]
You can't hear me

We have Jason Polus here reverend Jason the man has been calling you continually on the phone

[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:39.340]

You're sure? Why does he keep calling you?

[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:45.560]
Why does he keep calling you?

[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:49.060]
Do we have a bad connection if you want us to call you back?

[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:54.280]
We're going to have to call her back. This must be an act of gun. You know

[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.300]
Hello you there

[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.320]
Can you hear me now? We have Jason here in studio. He wants to go out with you

[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:06.560]
They're busy harassing me here and

Would you like to go out with Jason? He needs help. They're having great fun with Jason needs help. Can you help him?

[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:21.660]
You don't know who Jason is Jason Polus

[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:25.160]
How many times has Jason called you on the phone?

[02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:27.520]
You see they're harassing me here

[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:30.480]
They're harassing me here at this

[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.720]
They certainly are. Is there anything wrong with me calling you?

[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:41.080]

What is the big deal that they're making that you call?

[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:06.240]
They act as if we have done something wrong. They act as if we have done something wrong.

[02:03:06.700 --> 02:03:10.600]
You're talking about my kind of business. You're talking about my kind of business.

[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:18.920]
No, I'm not. They call me. Certainly not. He was just talking about how he keeps calling you on the phone. He wants to go out with you.

[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:22.640]
No, you guys are out of bounds. Way out of bounds again.

[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:27.160]
I feel like I'm in a sucker. I'm sorry. I did not want them to call you.

[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:33.500]
They seem to have some kind of problem with it. They seem to think

[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:39.760]
What was that?

[02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:47.680]
I don't know Jason. Who did you tell? He talked to somebody at WJ. As a matter of fact, it's been on radio a couple of times.

[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:52.280]
I've even heard it in Fort Lauderdale in Palm Beach and I don't know how they knew.

[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:55.000]
You didn't tell anybody? No, I didn't. How would they know if you didn't tell anybody?

[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.840]
I don't know. I was wondering myself. Did you tell anybody?

[02:03:59.740 --> 02:04:05.400]
I was here when he called. Everybody was here.

[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:10.780]
I see. Well, somehow worried has gotten out of it. This romance I think is fine. I think you worry about it.

[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.720]
This is absolutely right. What is the big deal?

[02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:19.640]
Well, he's a minister who doesn't approve of the kind of establishment you're working in.

[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:20.580]
That's true.

[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:22.480]
I know. That's the big deal.

[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:27.280]
Well, and the fact that he's lusting in his heart to be your volatuous body.

[02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:29.980]
That's all you know. You're out of bounds. You're way out of bounds.

[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:32.120]
Out of bounds again. Well, why are you calling it?

[02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:36.500]
Why are you calling it? Again, you're trying to get into my personal life.

[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:40.700]
What's this now? Just tell me. Just say, you know, that you're none of your business.

[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:43.120]
Just say there's no truth to the room where we're just good friends.

[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:46.820]
Well, I haven't seen her since the radio show.

[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.020]
But not for lack of trying.

[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:51.220]
Correct? Well, she's been busy and lately I've been busy.

[02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:55.120]
That's the way it is. You're going to keep calling it?

[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.920]
You know, why don't you butt out?

[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.180]
There's none of your business.

[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:01.960]
I think we touched a wrong move on this one.

[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:02.240]
There's none of your business.

[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:07.780]
Jason, this is mad when a holy my life is one of your business.

[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:11.620]
When a holy man of God trained your fingers and had his hands on the air

[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:16.120]
and professors did not have any human inclination towards sex and lust.

[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.620]
You know, calls a volatuous and sexy and lovely lady.

[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:20.780]
So it works it more easy?

[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:24.080]
No, I'm always supposed to be non-attractive, girl.

[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:25.240]
That's basically what you're saying.

[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:26.480]
That's brilliant.

[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:27.860]
We just want that in real life.

[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:28.760]
We just want you to be honest.

[02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:31.080]
We want you to admit that you're lusting after this lady.

[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:34.140]
I'm not lust after...

[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:34.500]
Anybody?

[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.580]
Well, you know, I don't believe in lust, so I don't.

[02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:42.400]
I'm very attractive women, but I try not to lust for it.

[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.820]
What is it particularly about fear that you like?

[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:48.440]
Yes?

[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:51.620]
I've never seen anyone who's lust for work.

[02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:54.620]
Well, you very rarely give me a chance to say anything.

[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:55.360]
Come on, go ahead.

[02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:57.560]
Now, what is it you like about her?

[02:05:57.620 --> 02:05:58.880]
Why do you keep calling it that way?

[02:05:59.000 --> 02:05:59.120]
Sure.

[02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:05.080]
What do you think about this harassment that they're perpetrating here?

[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.340]
Jason had a...

[02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:08.980]
Jason, you think...

[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:09.740]
Don't say they.

[02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:11.200]
I don't have anything to do with it.

[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.260]
I said to you, you know what I'm saying?

[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:13.060]
I want this to be said.

[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:16.780]
Jason, would you describe the expression on Jason's face as like the little boy

[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:18.380]
who got his hand caught at the cookie drum?

[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.240]
That Jim Baylor look is coming back.

[02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:21.840]
Come on, I've not done anything wrong.

[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.540]
I didn't say it, I said no.

[02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:25.040]
Look, he asked me to describe the look.

[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.440]
You have that Jim Baylor look.

[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:27.920]
I've never been trying to imply that I was not.

[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:28.700]
No, I'm not.

[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:29.580]
Not at all.

[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:30.740]
Wait, what's about fear?

[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:32.660]
We're just implying that you'd like to.

[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:34.000]
No, not at all.

[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:38.200]
I think that those things are starting to surge in his mind now.

[02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:38.960]
I really do like it.

[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:41.040]
Chad, let me tell you something.

[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:42.900]
I'm sure you're very lovely, lady.

[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:45.600]
I never got a chance to see you, but from all reports,

[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:47.080]
hello, you there.

[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:47.500]
Yes.

[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:49.760]
From all reports, you're very lovely, lady.

[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:51.280]
And I wish you luck with Jason.

[02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:53.020]
You'll need it.

[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:54.000]
All right.

[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:56.800]
You think you're going to be able to help him a little?

[02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:57.880]
Can't we?

[02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.640]
You think you'll be able to help him a little?

[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:00.300]
How come what?

[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:01.180]
You'll help him.

[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:02.940]
I'm sorry if they call.

[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:05.300]
I don't know how they got your numbers, but I see.

[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.660]
I don't know either if they're going to find it or miss his car.

[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.600]
I don't know how they got my number.

[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.440]
Wow, real?

[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:09.880]
I'm sorry.

[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.280]
No idea how we did this.

[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.660]
But anyway, Sher, we appreciate you sharing

[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:15.440]
your relationship with Jason with us.

[02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:15.740]
All right?

[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:16.440]
OK.

[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:17.460]
All right, thanks for calling.

[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:18.240]
That was it.

[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:19.020]
I got to tell you.

[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:20.520]
Did you enjoy that?

[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:21.840]
I really know that.

[02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:24.440]
You know Mori Pupik is going to be in on this story pretty soon.

[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:25.160]
This is incredible.

[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:26.680]
I really want to talk to you about it.

[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:28.380]
We have a major news story here.

[02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:29.520]
We're going to break for news updates.

[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:31.520]
Speaking of news, you're listening to the Steve K.

[02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:33.440]
show on 610 W.I.

[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:37.620]
Putting yourself in jeopardy by pursuing this relationship.

[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:40.960]
If you want to hang on to this idea of putting yourself

[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.180]
in jeopardy by pursuing any relationship.

[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:45.900]
Because when you say that you don't want, no, wait a minute.

[02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:50.280]
When you how can you have a relationship if lust is evil and sinful?

[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.960]
How can you have a relationship that ever of any kind that ever

[02:07:53.960 --> 02:07:57.660]
develops into something if you don't lust for someone in a physical

[02:07:57.660 --> 02:07:58.040]
fence?

[02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:59.080]
How is that possible?

[02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:01.400]
Well, because you can have physical attraction for somebody without

[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:02.300]
lusting after that.

[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:03.160]
Well, what does lust mean?

[02:08:03.720 --> 02:08:06.720]
Well, I think lust is clearly going beyond just physical attraction.

[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:10.880]
It's festering the thought in beyond what is it's a sexual desire.

[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:12.580]
You know, is that bad?

[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:13.140]
Is that evil?

[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.980]
If you don't act it out until you're wedding night.

[02:08:14.980 --> 02:08:15.780]
Why is that evil?

[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:18.640]
Well, because, for one, because Christ had to see you.

[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.560]
Well, but let's, let's, let's, you know, Christ out of it.

[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:22.680]
For the moment, he came back to, get back to share.

[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:24.060]
And I want to know if you've ever had this feeling.

[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:24.560]
So it's, sir.

[02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:25.800]
Tell me you have it.

[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:30.400]
Tell me with a, if you never developed a sexual desire for somebody

[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.220]
even on your wedding night, why would you have sex with them if you

[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:34.180]
didn't have a sexual desire?

[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:37.520]
If you're physically attracted to someone, you will notice how

[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:39.960]
it's known instead of so.

[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:43.660]
Notice how he ignored my question about whether he had a lot of

[02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:44.060]
sexual desire.

[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:44.940]
He interrupts the loudness.

[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:45.700]
All right, now he's interrupting.

[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:47.260]
So I haven't answered his question.

[02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:47.600]
No, no, no.

[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:49.880]
I think let's get, why don't you want to talk about the lusty

[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:50.260]
atmosphere?

[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:52.280]
You don't have to lust for a woman.

[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:54.020]
Why don't you want to answer my question?

[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:55.840]
Many people have not lusted for people.

[02:08:56.060 --> 02:08:58.300]
In other words, if you had sex with your wife, it would only be

[02:08:58.300 --> 02:08:59.380]
kind of like an obligatory.

[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:00.560]
No, not at all.

[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:02.000]
Why don't you want to answer my question?

[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:03.760]
I said, God made sex and he made it very good.

[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:05.480]
Can we assume from the fact that you're out of love?

[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:06.120]
How would you know?

[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:07.120]
How do you know?

[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:08.280]
He made it very good.

[02:09:08.460 --> 02:09:09.420]
You're really, you're really God.

[02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:10.140]
He made it so good.

[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.980]
You're really letting him get off the hook, here.

[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:15.820]
He's letting him go back to court with you, the rest of the

[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:16.180]
outspoken.

[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:17.680]
He had to deal with his lust for sure.

[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:20.580]
Because God made the rules and he said it's good within the

[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:21.360]
right context.

[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:22.980]
So why don't you want to answer my question?

[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:23.840]
How did I do that?

[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:24.540]
Do you lust?

[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:25.440]
No, I don't.

[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:26.140]
You never had.

[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.580]
No, I never had a lustful thought.

[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:30.080]
I never thought of what you would look like with no clothes.

[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:30.560]
Tell me the truth.

[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.260]
No, I do not think like that.

[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:35.720]
But she is an attractive woman.

[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:36.920]
With what?

[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:37.800]
With large cheeks?

[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:40.540]
She has a good figure, but that's not there's nothing more

[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.020]
about having a good figure, is it?

[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:45.480]
But you don't think you're putting yourself in jeopardy by pursuing

[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:46.140]
this situation?

[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.800]
Well, maybe I won't pursue it.

[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.160]
Maybe I'll make you a second thought.

[02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:52.200]
I think you're doing this, sir.

[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.040]
I think you're shaming him out of this.

[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:58.300]
You know, I think you're only holding this to be his only hope.

[02:09:58.460 --> 02:09:58.780]
Thank you.

[02:09:58.800 --> 02:09:59.540]
Appreciate your concern.

[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:00.540]
No, no, I'm serious.

[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:02.100]
This could be like the chance of a lifetime.

[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:04.600]
And he's interfering on the year here with this.

[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:07.780]
And I think the best thing that could happen is that he's

[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:09.200]
going to be a woman for the right reverend paranoia.

[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:10.340]
Would be to get laid on this.

[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:11.320]
There you go.

[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:12.960]
No, seriously, to get married.

[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:14.760]
I have a wonderful wedding night in this.

[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:17.340]
No, I don't want to hear about what you think for me,

[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:20.200]
because I already know that I'm going to fry an oil or something.

[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:21.420]
You're going to jog in the van.

[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:22.020]
You're going to pull the wood.

[02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:23.020]
Why don't you come to my church?

[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:23.760]
I don't hate homophobicism.

[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.320]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:26.720]
I only got life for that people.

[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:27.860]
And they're probably all ugly.

[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.280]
I hope that there's a little joke.

[02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:31.800]
I hope you put some outbought.

[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:32.300]
I'm Christian.

[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:33.120]
I don't hate homophobicism.

[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:34.620]
I don't want to become a Christian.

[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:35.700]
You don't hate to be deaf.

[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:37.280]
I don't hate homophobicism.

[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:37.620]
I don't hate homophobicism.

[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:39.220]
I don't hate homophobicism.

[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:40.460]
You believe in capital city.

[02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:43.000]
In other words, he doesn't hate you, but he wants to.

[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:44.080]
And I couldn't even take off.

[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:45.460]
You're a chipper if I became Christian.

[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:47.460]
You wasn't executed with love.

[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:48.180]
You're right.

[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:49.000]
That makes sense.

[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:50.200]
You haven't asked about love.

[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:51.860]
If you have any expression killing with kindness,

[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:53.700]
that's how he's born again, killing with God.

[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:56.520]
God is the God of love, but he loved so much.

[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:57.920]
And you're with me.

[02:10:58.600 --> 02:10:59.880]
Look at us cross-eyed man.

[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:00.980]
Love off with the head.

[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:02.800]
Love's baking those eighth babies, right?

[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:03.080]

[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:05.940]
You're beginning to get some of the picture of the hornet.

[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:07.840]
God is a whole new God.

[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:08.840]
No question about it.

[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:09.520]
That's what I'm talking about.

[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:10.680]
That's what I'm talking about.

[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:10.720]

[02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:12.100]
He's ratchell wax hot.

[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:14.740]
He's up there with whips and chains and off with your head.

[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:15.440]
There's no, no.

[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:16.800]
A long, long, long, long.

[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:20.320]
I wonder what you will say at the pearly gate.

[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:21.040]
What will you say?

[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:22.960]
Oh, I'll say, oh God, this is good.

[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:24.760]
Just like you'll say on your wedding night.

[02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:25.920]
Oh God, that's good.

[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:27.320]
Let me ask you another question.

[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.660]
Would you like to be a fly on the wall on your wedding night?

[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:30.160]
Wow.

[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:33.040]
You're talking about, you remember the seat?

[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:34.620]
I don't have that invite either of you guys.

[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:38.320]
I think you wrote where the rockets are going off and ready.

[02:11:38.540 --> 02:11:39.660]
I remember the whole brother.

[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:42.500]
Talk about, we may have like Mount Vesuvius all over again.

[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:44.600]
I might be like an interruption in the Europe.

[02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:46.520]
You know, the question I haven't had answered yet.

[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:47.840]
Why is it that even...

[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.600]
Why are you still hung up with us?

[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:53.200]
Why are you so many of you born against...

[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:56.800]
Did somebody teach you was unpleen or was filthy or your body is dirty?

[02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.100]
Why do we need it?

[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:00.640]
In all honesty, I believe it's not a bad looking guy.

[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:02.720]
Not my type, but he's not a bad looking guy.

[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:03.220]
Why?

[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.100]
He's a normal looking a lot.

[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:05.380]

[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.720]
But a normal looking 35-year-old guy.

[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:08.660]
I resent that.

[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:10.380]
No, Sam, I'm just joking with you.

[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:10.520]

[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.780]
But you're a normal looking guy.

[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:13.680]
Why is it you feel like sexist ones?

[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:14.080]
Clean.

[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:15.700]
Why are you so uptight about it?

[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:17.600]
That's the one thing about the born against, man.

[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:19.060]
This is what they have to do.

[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:21.620]
They have to indoctrinate your body is filthy and this is dirty.

[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:23.280]
That's not all what I said.

[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:25.760]
This is the product of years of brainwashing.

[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:28.080]
God does have the right.

[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:29.160]
I feel I'm already poor.

[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:30.320]
You're a human being.

[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:34.060]
Why is it that most countries of the world down the road?

[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.160]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:37.680]
Come on, you're like a stuck man.

[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:38.620]
We don't want you guys.

[02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:39.120]
We can't see you guys.

[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:39.640]
We can't see you guys.

[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.300]
We have a call on a date.

[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:42.560]
We have a call.

[02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:43.680]
We have a call.

[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:44.980]
We have a call about...

[02:12:44.980 --> 02:12:45.240]
Cheers.

[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:46.260]
Hold on one second.

[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:47.020]
Let's go to Hollywood.

[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:47.780]
You're on the air.

[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:48.520]
Hi, Steve.

[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:49.480]
Hi, how are you?

[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:49.960]
Good.

[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:55.620]
When I was talking to Nick, I told him originally that I disagreed with the raven.

[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:59.240]
But there's something that he said that I agreed with about this call with fear.

[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.640]
When he was talking to her, when you were talking to her, the raven was getting very upset with you

[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.680]
and told me to brought out his personal business.

[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:06.940]
Right.

[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:11.120]
And I'm sure that made him very upset when you brought it into his personal life.

[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:12.280]
Like he's doing the mind.

[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:12.820]
Exactly.

[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:16.780]
Because when he's touching his personal life, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:20.280]
Yeah, but he says that that's more role in what everybody else is doing is immoral.

[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:21.580]
So you got an answer for everything.

[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:25.260]
I think homosexuality is wrong.

[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:26.740]
I don't care what you think.

[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:28.280]
I'm not going to do it in here every morning.

[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:29.820]
Excuse me.

[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:33.520]
Both my guests, if you would do it quite, I want to talk to this caller for a minute.

[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:36.880]
Now, man, I want to just come and know what you just said.

[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:40.140]
Here is a man, Jason Hollers, who has been on my show.

[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:41.400]
I don't know how many times.

[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:45.960]
Preaching the gospel, preaching God, preaching virginity, preaching purity, preaching all the stuff.

[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:51.720]
And the lower the hole, I discovered that when he's on a show in the JNNO, I'm in West Palm Beach,

[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:59.640]
with a voluptuous bar made, which works in a topless place, that he's been calling around the phone right and left trying to get dates with him.

[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:03.600]
You don't find something the tiniest, weeniest bit hypocritical about that.

[02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:04.680]
I do.

[02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:05.720]
I have a problem with that.

[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:07.360]
So that's why I've got it up there.

[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:09.040]
Do you think there's anything wrong with it?

[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:09.720]
The point is...

[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:11.360]
Do you think there's anything wrong with it?

[02:14:11.380 --> 02:14:13.200]
Well, I think there's anything wrong with what?

[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:15.400]
With the fact that you are wanting to date this thing?

[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:16.500]
I think there's something wrong with it.

[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:17.260]
I think there's something wrong with it.

[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:21.140]
I think there's something wrong with getting in there, condemning sexuality, condemning this and condemning that.

[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:25.920]
And then running around and calling somebody that you've met with large presumed on a radio show.

[02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:27.600]
You're out of line.

[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:28.020]
Yes.

[02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:29.620]
You're out of bounds again.

[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:31.100]
I think you...

[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:37.980]
The reason is that the Reverend gets very uncomfortable and angry when other people are on his personal life.

[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:39.740]
With idle blame and I would too.

[02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:44.620]
But yet, he has no qualms about getting involved in other people's personal lives and making done use.

[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:45.720]
Well, okay.

[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:50.140]
When you're a teacher in your child, you teach him not to lie or steal.

[02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:53.920]
So why the hell did you tell me only qualmer once would you call a point on that?

[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:54.860]
I didn't tell you that.

[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:56.040]
I told you that.

[02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:57.100]
I told you that you called it.

[02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:57.740]
You delivered it.

[02:14:57.800 --> 02:14:58.560]
I told you that you called it.

[02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:58.620]
I told you that you delivered it.

[02:14:58.620 --> 02:14:58.900]
Come on.

[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.560]
I asked you this one way.

[02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:03.240]
So I just called it once and then we took it together and that was it.

[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:05.440]
And then you called it five, six times.

[02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:06.760]
How many times has it been?

[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:08.240]
You multiplied it.

[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.900]
You told me you couldn't even remember having it seven or eight times.

[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:10.900]

[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:13.920]
You guys are out of bounds.

[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:15.320]
You're trying to fabricate things.

[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:15.640]
Oh.

[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:16.760]
And the fabrication.

[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:18.300]
You called it out of me a fabrication.

[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:22.520]
You're spreading it right and you just call this lady once and you've been spattering the life out of me.

[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:23.740]
I told you that I've not seen her since then.

[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:24.640]
I haven't.

[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:28.620]
And there's a bunch of been trying having you over and over and over again.

[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:32.280]
The fact that you won't give it to your final lust doesn't mean that you haven't been trying.

[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:33.700]
You're way off, man.

[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:34.640]
Out of bounds.

[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:35.580]
We're way off, ladies.

[02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:36.880]
We are going to take a short break.

[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:37.600]
A break.

[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:39.120]
Well, Jason takes a free kick.

[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:40.300]
You're listening to the key thing.

[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:42.560]
Show on 6th St. W. I.O.J.

[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:43.640]
Now it's twice the cup.

[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:48.360]
I think I think why are you pacing the floor, Jason?

[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:48.800]
Relax.

[02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:49.540]

[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:50.660]
Well, he is up here.

[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:53.820]
He had a major score on the on the break right there.

[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:54.180]
Very good.

[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:57.540]
Well, no, no.

[02:15:57.540 --> 02:15:59.360]
No, I don't know her.

[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:01.020]
I didn't get involved with any of that.

[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:02.940]
That part of the part is we're trying to prove.

[02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:03.460]
We're not.

[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.180]
That's her.

[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.420]
She's had the good thing to say.

[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:05.980]
Yeah.

[02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:07.640]
This is by your persistent core.

[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:11.140]
Let me just tell everybody about what we're going to come here.

[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:11.920]
A credible sale.

[02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:13.300]
It's a Toyota of Hollywood.

[02:16:13.460 --> 02:16:15.100]
Do you realize that?

[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:19.340]
I think we should add sincerity to your hard-root.

[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:19.480]

[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:19.740]
You do.

[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:23.660]
Is it I bring this down to you because in the past you've been so nice to him.

[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:25.920]
You know, you may be, I can maybe do what I am.

[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:27.420]
You know, I don't think so.

[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:32.220]
I've been talking for four hours basically about the whole set of you hours.

[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:32.820]
Yeah, who is this?

[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:34.000]
That's all you ever talked about.

[02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:35.700]
If you don't want to talk about your own dirty laundry.

[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:36.820]
That's what I'm saying.

[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:37.440]
That's what I'm saying.

[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:37.980]
That's what I said.

[02:16:38.100 --> 02:16:39.240]
Not because you don't want it to be.

[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:40.340]
I talk about just about it.

[02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:42.440]
I know that you guys are right before.

[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:44.260]
We have to talk about less patient.

[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:47.060]
Let me just talk about you and my best friend Toyota Hollywood.

[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:50.120]
The last ten minutes exploring your relationship with share.

[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.980]
Toyota, now I think, and I always say, you know Jason, I've always taken a position on the show that I try to help you.

[02:16:56.180 --> 02:16:56.740]
And I'm your friend.

[02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:58.360]
I don't need to get angry with me for this.

[02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.060]
I think that you really owe share.

[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:01.760]
I have to call him.

[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:02.120]
I have to call him.

[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:02.340]
That's all right.

[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:04.720]
Yeah, they're going to excuse the next phone call.

[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:05.800]
Here we go.

[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:06.500]
Call her tonight.

[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:09.960]
No, I think it's I think I think you know, I was wrong.

[02:17:09.960 --> 02:17:13.460]
You did do a favor because here's a perfect excuse for the next phone call.

[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:16.800]
And I think you should say share.

[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.100]
I must apologize for what happened today.

[02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:21.280]
I am sorry that I have lusted it in my heart.

[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.900]
I do have these high biblical ideals.

[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:26.560]
But every now and then, you know, I am human.

[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:29.540]
And I get caught up in this lustful thing and you're just so beautiful.

[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:31.200]
You're beauty and your charm and your music.

[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.520]
And you think you're making me overwhelmed me.

[02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.120]
You're making all that up to you.

[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:38.760]
I don't think that that's a proper suggestion.

[02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:38.760]

[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:41.440]
I don't think it's right either for me or for her.

[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.660]
Can I take it out of that?

[02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:43.360]
Can I take it out of that?

[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:44.120]
Let me have a drink.

[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:45.280]
You should take my advice.

[02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:47.120]
I used to be pretty good at this with my dad.

[02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:48.740]
I'm very good.

[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:51.300]
So give her a call and see what you have.

[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:52.480]
But I'd report back to you.

[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:53.620]
And you don't have to judge.

[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:54.760]
I'm sure that you would like that.

[02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:57.260]
I do have a question for you.

[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:00.580]
I assume that I hate homosexual because I believe that homosexuality is wrong.

[02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:02.140]
And because you want to ask if you there.

[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:04.620]
Does Mother Teresa and the Pope also have...

[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:05.740]
Oh, now here we go with the Pope.

[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:07.820]
You know, I got news for you.

[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:10.920]
I could get you to attack the Catholic Church and the Pope before.

[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.460]
I was looking at another show and you know it as well as I do.

[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:15.700]
You don't have any use for the Catholic Church.

[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:17.580]
So don't start calling the Pope now.

[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:18.480]
Okay, for simple questions.

[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:19.820]
And if you want to talk about the Catholic Church.

[02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:23.840]
It's a simple, so many gatekeepers in this rule that you'll start doing it.

[02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:26.020]
If it's simple, forget about your share for five minutes.

[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:29.380]
And you can not see that you can hate the sin.

[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:32.100]
Oh, that's the biggest cop out of it.

[02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:33.800]
So that's an idiot brought in.

[02:18:33.860 --> 02:18:35.260]
You saw what happened with her.

[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:38.780]
How she repented for all the evil and all the hate that she spewed on everybody.

[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:41.420]
And she said she's sorry that she did it in the first place.

[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:45.100]
It was wrong and it was disgusting and embarrassing and humiliating and degrading.

[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:46.880]
I thought there was shame.

[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:48.240]
I thought there were four hours.

[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:49.140]
You ought to be ashamed.

[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:50.760]
And the baby is spewing this kind of hate.

[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.280]
You ought to be spending more of your health.

[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:53.640]
Healthy young guy like me.

[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:54.980]
You don't have any church to be with you.

[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:55.740]
You have nothing to do with it.

[02:18:56.300 --> 02:19:00.180]
You ought to get out there and go to a court chair and you know have a good time.

[02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:02.780]
And you're going to have to start living a real life.

[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:03.900]
There's nothing to do with it.

[02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:08.040]
I'm not the fan of anything.

[02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:09.500]
You're the one that keeps saying that.

[02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:11.080]
I don't have to defend anything.

[02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:12.660]
You're a proud of it.

[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:13.980]
I'm proud of what?

[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:15.000]
Being a homeless actor.

[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:18.740]
I'm proud of being a tolerant decent human being, which is more than I can say for you.

[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:24.060]
A 35-year-old virgin who's sitting here right in the face because he has exposed your lustful thinking.

[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.960]
And these then the next phone calls that you're making on the phone with.

[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:28.900]
You're making allegations that you have no right to make.

[02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:31.700]
I like I told you during the break.

[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:34.580]
I don't care what you do because I don't like you making a bunch of people.

[02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:35.580]
And you're sitting in judgements.

[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:36.440]
You're not in here.

[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:36.960]
This is you.

[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:38.120]
That's just as you know.

[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:39.100]
This is you.

[02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:40.040]
You don't quite about that.

[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:41.720]
What's your name with a beautiful body?

[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:42.440]
You're not.

[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:42.780]
You're not.

[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:43.640]
This is you a homeless sexual.

[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:44.060]
We're trying to get you in.

[02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:45.140]
Oh, you're a homeless sexual.

[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:46.320]
I'm not trying to get you in.

[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:47.180]
No, I'm not.

[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:47.560]
I'm not.

[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:47.840]
You're not.

[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:48.720]
You're not.

[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:48.800]

[02:19:48.920 --> 02:19:49.180]
You're not.

[02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:53.560]
That's the show.

[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:55.260]
Gentlemen, I got to say we're comfortable.

[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:56.240]
You like over here.

[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:56.900]
We comfortable.

[02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:57.540]
We comfortable.

[02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:00.000]
I want to say the same thing 600 times.

[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:05.700]
I want to thank Uncle Leo for taking the lead.

[02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:05.720]

[02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:06.420]
He went off.

[02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:08.000]
It was something else.

[02:20:08.140 --> 02:20:09.720]
And now maybe you'll understand and look at all.

[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:10.840]
There's a little more compassion to know.

[02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:11.100]
I know.

[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:14.320]
He's still a hateful person who needs more.

[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:15.300]
Why is he talking to my church?

[02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:16.040]
He's talking to my church.

[02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:16.380]
Oh, God.

[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:17.580]
He's talking to my church.

[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:19.260]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:20.020]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:20.160]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:20.160]

[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:20.720]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:22.200]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:26.940]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:27.980]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:28.780]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:29.160]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:29.540]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:30.680]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:31.640]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:34.320]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:34.880]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:35.360]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:36.160]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:36.660]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:37.900]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:37.900 --> 02:20:38.720]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:38.880]
I don't want to come to your church.

[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:38.880]

[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:38.880]

[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:38.880]

[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:38.880]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]

[02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:38.860]
