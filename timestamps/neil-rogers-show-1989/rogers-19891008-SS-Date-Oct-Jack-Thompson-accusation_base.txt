[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.260]
uh... if that isn't the most incredible story

[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.800]

[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.000]

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.240]
last night in a motel which was right across from the station okay

[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.380]
and i'm walking

[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.100]
it's like half a block you know just right across the street i'm walking from

[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.860]
the station to my motel

[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.320]
and there's a police car pulls up i told us to remain the time of course jackfruit

[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.560]
i thought oh boy what is this all about they said you know where you can find

[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.820]
the guy named neo rajas and i thought boy this is the end of my life as you know

[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.660]

we grew up here and we were really uh... bigoted racist kind of people and we

[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.680]
just uh...

[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.180]
we feel that you've opened our eyes to a lot of things that we never heard

[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.940]
before we've never been exposed to different kind of thinking we want to thank

[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.240]

what we must fear in our cell

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.120]

[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.260]
friend of mine the other day we were talking about your old juz and when we

[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.160]
first started listening

[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.780]
and he was told you about the time you were calling

[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.540]
