[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]
Neil Rogers, on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.320]
It might not be as bad as everyone says.

[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.140]
Hi, I'm Sue Nallison.

[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.260]
Notice you haven't seen me in movies for a long time.

[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.980]
That's because I always wet my pants.

[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.320]
Remember my love scene with Jimmy Stewart and that moddy strat and fixer?

[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.460]
I was so...

[00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.180]
Do you know Gene Kelly's famous dance and singing in the rain?

[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.440]
That wasn't rain? That was me.

[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.020]
But I'm back.

[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.040]
Thanks to deep-end adult diapers,

[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.980]
they're so absorbent it's like having two rolls of toilet paper in your back pocket.

[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.000]
Oh and each diaper has colorful pictures of the great stars of the forties.

[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.560]
Fred Astaire, Donald O'Connor, and there's me.

[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680]
Do Nallison, I still wet my pants.

[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.020]
But thanks to deep-end, I'm working again.

[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.640]
You're a bastard.

[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.620]
Okay, it's a 1006 at WIOD.

[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.640]
That is a little preview of the kind of day it's going to be.

[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.700]
It's going to be great.

[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.960]
Okay, because I'm not pulling any punches today.

[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.420]
You know, we had the holiday on Monday and I was sick as a dog.

[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.220]
And then yesterday we had the air was still out.

[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120]
And the audience was celebrating Monday all over again.

[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.720]
Oh yeah.

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.960]
And today I hear the rumor through the grapevine is all the big shots

[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.980]
in a building got their golfing shirts on today.

[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.820]
So you're going to be able to get that one.

[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.280]
They didn't have a long enough holiday weekend.

[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.760]
Okay.

[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.820]
I mean, let's face it, three and a half days just it doesn't do the job.

[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.880]
Now do you think if the AC was off in the bureaucrats part of the building

[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.200]
it would have been two days to get it fixed.

[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.520]
Do you really think?

[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.080]
Two minutes.

[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.540]
Two minutes.

[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.720]
Anyway, how about those cubs?

[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.240]
Boy, I can't, I don't think I'm going to make it to the All Star break.

[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.500]
I just don't think I mean, I win a three to two and I have to bring in Mitch Williams

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.400]
at the end of the game.

[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.580]
I can't take him, you know.

[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.320]
He always gets the job done or usually, but boy, he just makes it exciting.

[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.720]
Okay.

[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.660]
We got an old bag and then the meds.

[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.080]
How about you, med fans out there?

[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.020]
How they, it was close.

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.260]
There was only 10 to three.

[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.660]
They lost to the giants last night.

[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.280]
And then I made the mistake.

[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.940]
I was fishing.

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.060]
I couldn't sleep because well, you know, the pressure of the game you paced the floor.

[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.320]
And so I'm pacing the floor and I turned on the Canadian, in Montreal,

[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.340]
I can get what was the French telecast.

[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.380]
We didn't come in all that good on anic one on the Canadian satellite,

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.560]
which is a very weak satellite.

[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.740]
Comes in okay.

[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.620]
And I was watching it and I turned it on just in time.

[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.020]
And the Dodgers were ahead four to one on the night thinning in Montreal scored four runs.

[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.260]
That Dodger, bullpen, he couldn't get me out, okay.

[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.520]
And so I just didn't work out.

[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.900]
But anyway, it comes there two ahead, but I have a feeling they're three and a half ahead of the meds.

[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.860]
Now, wait a minute.

[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.340]
Let me get this clear.

[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.960]
Now you are up to all hours of the night watching a baseball game in France.

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.920]
And the cardinals lost two in French, yeah.

[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.140]
Now that ladies and gentlemen is a true definition of a sports nut.

[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.820]
In France.

[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.140]
Anyway, we're going to very important call.

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.480]

[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.840]
Got to how you passed it.

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.220]
Okay.

[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.460]
That's her, isn't it?

[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.800]
No.

[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.560]
No, that's how she's more like.

[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.800]
You're a best fit.

[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.680]
See, similar.

[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.280]
It didn't have the same flare.

[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.440]
What was all the feedback on that call?

[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.520]
Did you notice that all that?

[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.080]
Are we going to have one of those days again?

[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.520]
A Roblo spy report? Hello?

[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.020]
Neil.

[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.460]
Yeah.

[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.420]
How about the McBean on Negotiating now as we speak to get the video.

[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.760]
And they're going to go to some bar one of these days and show it.

[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.180]
Who cares?

[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.200]
I care.

[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.760]
I'm going to ask.

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.480]
I'm going to ask.

[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.440]
What do you call it?

[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.400]
You know, I'm recovering addict, sex addict.

[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.020]
A pervert, is that what you're trying to say?

[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.420]
You know what this is going to do to the 16 year old girl population here in Top Florida?

[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.780]
If they show that video.

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.840]
First of all, they've shown the video was on the Murray Puppet Show,

[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.580]
did on television.

[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.400]
But they're going to show it.

[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.180]
Steve is doing a whole show on it tomorrow.

[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.680]
They're going to show it in it entirely.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.200]
Entirely.

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.820]
It's entirely.

[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.680]
Let me please start with with your IQ and a bottle of Bud.

[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.720]
You ought to go all the way.

[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.700]
I can show it to you.

[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.720]
I can show it to you.

[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.500]
And it's entirely.

[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.540]
Anyway, I must confess, you know, I'm not usually swayed easily, especially by Steve,

[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.580]
because generally if he says, you know, especially like with his abortion thing,

[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.720]
which is so, I just, when he keeps talking about our freedom of choice,

[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.880]
and then he wants to take away women's freedom of choice over their own body,

[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.200]
I don't like that.

[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.740]
I really don't.

[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.000]
I think it's a cop out.

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.920]
You know, and he makes all these, well, he's decided that life begins at 40 or something.

[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.300]
But anyway, the thing with the Blockbuster video, I have really bad feelings about it.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.300]
Nobody has spoken to me.

[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.860]
Don't get the wrong impression, but it's just, I think I got sucked into something

[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.200]
that I don't want to be a part of, and I'm going to tell you why.

[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.120]
You know, he gave me this poor sob story about how well, you know,

[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.740]
they did it for religious reasons, and they're pontificating the public,

[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.660]
trying to pass their morality along to everybody else.

[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.720]
But then we had that call on the bat line from somebody who had spoken to a woman

[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.740]
at one of the Blockbuster locations down there, and she said that it was the company.

[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.560]
The company owned stores were the only ones that were doing that,

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.840]
and then the individually owned franchises were going to stock at some of them.

[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.940]
In other words, it was up to them.

[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.100]
So they weren't dictating to the other franchises, and the boycott,

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.680]
which is what effect this is, what people are tearing up their cards,

[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.980]
would have hurt everybody.

[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.020]
You know, if you tear up your Blockbuster card, it isn't just going to hurt, you know,

[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.180]
certain stores, it's going to, you're going to stop doing business with any of them.

[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.660]
Yeah, of course.

[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.480]
So it reminds me very much of the Exxon thing, which it seems to me that Steve,

[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.900]
just like I was, was knocking at all these idiotic tacos getting on her,

[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.300]
you know, sending a cut up your Exxon card, because all that did,

[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.380]
that didn't really hurt Exxon.

[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.860]
It's just like dropping a, you know, a tinkle in the ocean.

[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.220]
Yeah.

[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.660]
But that hurts the independent dealer, you know, the, yeah, the service station guy,

[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.740]
you know, when people stop buying their gas, it's not going to hurt the company that much.

[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.520]
You're not even going to notice it. It's a joke.

[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.540]
But it seems to me this is the same thing.

[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.360]
I don't, I don't think I want to be involved in it.

[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.180]
Okay. I really don't. I think it's a mistake.

[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.580]
Everybody loves to jump on the bandwagon on these things.

[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.140]
And I don't know, like not for me.

[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.440]
I don't know.

[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.020]
So if you cut up your card, you send it to me.

[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.100]
Don't do it anymore. Okay.

[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.300]
Because I'm going to, I don't know what I'm going to do with them.

[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.340]
Turn them over to the CIA or something.

[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.780]
But don't send me, if you want to send your cards and send them to Steve.

[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.420]
I'm just, Steve loves to do that.

[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.020]
He really does.

[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.080]
And what kind of cinched it for me today.

[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.120]
I looked at these schedule.

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.120]
And again, I'm not trying to interfere with anybody's show.

[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.500]
But I didn't I predict this?

[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.340]
Absolutely.

[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.360]
Remember when Roger gave me the thing out of the paper a few days ago that this douchebag got fired,

[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.360]
which is long overdue.

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.200]
He should never have been on a year in the first place because he's, he's so far transcend.

[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.160]
This guy is such an anti-Semite and such a, such a hate-monger that there are no words to describe it.

[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.280]
And he wouldn't deny that. He revels in it. Okay.

[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.800]
Fired conservative Cuban radio commentator Felipe Rovero talks about freedom of speech,

[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.100]
the Holocaust and much more on the cane show this afternoon.

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.920]
Didn't I predict that?

[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.680]
I just, I find that so reprehensible, I have no words to describe it.

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.520]
The Holocaust.

[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.900]
I mean, they finally got this guy off the air.

[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.660]
They finally got him, even they had enough sense to get him off the air.

[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.140]
And we're going to give him four hours of air time to spew his hate.

[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.820]
Oh, sure.

[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.720]
He's another one of these, you know, the Holocaust didn't happen.

[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.480]
Oh, no.

[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.120]
Or, you know, one of those, I mean, I don't want to put words in his mouth,

[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.000]
but he's just, just obsessed.

[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.120]
Well, you called it.

[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.680]
Yeah. And I predicted it. I knew the first chance they get him on.

[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.960]
They'd put him on the air and give him air time.

[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.300]
I just, I can't deal with it.

[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.120]
I just can't deal with it.

[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.460]
But anyway, I'm not having anything to do with the blockbuster thing.

[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.420]
And if everybody wants to have a good time with that,

[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.360]
I just, I just don't believe in punishing business people over a nitpick.

[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.400]
And that's basically what it is. Like I said,

[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.760]
there aren't 15 people in this entire audience of this radio station

[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.760]
who give a damn about last temptation to Christ.

[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.500]
I mean, I don't, so it was nominated for Academy Award.

[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.920]
So was Roger Rabbit, okay?

[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:30.880]
That's true.

[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.100]
I don't want to see either one of them.

[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.920]
To me, they both have the same social relevance,

[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.640]
okay, because they're both fairy tales.

[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.360]
All right.

[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.440]
And I just, I'm not going to, I don't like getting sucked into those things.

[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.600]
Well, we first came over here.

[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.760]
There was a thing going on with WOLD, remember?

[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.900]
And it was some thing of, oh, yeah, it was about Alice and Sandy.

[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.460]
We're getting their contracts. We knew.

[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:50.920]
And all of this.

[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.780]
And we got sucked into that whole thing.

[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.900]
And then it turned out not to be true.

[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.760]
Let him keep it on his show. How about things?

[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.180]
Exactly. I mean, we don't ask anybody to, you know,

[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.460]
come in and eat our food except the newsroom.

[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.800]
You know, we do our own lunch and they can eat their lunch.

[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.760]
Is that, is that a good parallel?

[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:07.600]
Yeah.

[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.820]
I like that.

[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.800]
By the way, after the break, I'm going to tell you the real story

[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.020]
about the lunch, why there's been a little nervousness in the newsroom.

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.260]
But after the break, anyway, I want to tell you,

[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.980]
last night, for example, I stayed up till the wee hours of the morning,

[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.080]
watching the Montreal Los Angeles game in French from Canadian satellite.

[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.960]
I saw the Dodger game or the Metz game.

[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.220]
What you, I guess, just about anybody, because it was on WOLR.

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.440]
But if it would have been on the sports channel, I would have seen that too.

[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.640]
Saw the Cubs win over Atlanta on WGN.

[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.100]
I didn't have to listen to the imitators in Atlanta.

[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.420]
And the bottom line is so many of the sporting events that you love.

[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.860]
You're going to get to see if you have your own.

[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.620]
My, because Dorothy made a comment to me last Friday that she was going to be on vacation this week.

[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.920]
And she said, I'm afraid the kids in the newsroom are going to be nuts.

[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.440]
Right, you mentioned that.

[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.760]
And I said, don't worry about it.

[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880]
They're, you know, just fine.

[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.920]
In fact, some of them are really fine.

[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.220]
But so there's a memo up there.

[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.760]
Part of a memo where she says she's going to be on vacation and so forth.

[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.800]
And what's going on, just all that says is, feel free to get food from Neil

[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.920]
but keep socializing to a minimum.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.360]
That's all.

[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.700]
Well, I don't like that.

[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.300]
I think there ought to be a lot of socializing, all depending on who we're talking about.

[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.980]
But of course, Ross is not your type.

[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.860]
Anyway, um, a lot of people talking about that by the way.

[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.820]
You're the talk of the town.

[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.300]
Right.

[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.720]
No, I'm not joking.

[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.820]
What are they talking about?

[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.100]
You are the talk of the town.

[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.860]
Oh, come on.

[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.280]
Even fat rich was like, oh, he was.

[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.000]
Yes, he was.

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.240]
I spoke to him last night.

[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.340]
He was apoplectic.

[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.540]
He was facing the floor.

[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.120]
I bet you even watched some of the meds game last night.

[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.500]
He must really be depressed by now.

[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.200]
He was hysterically said, well, what he said?

[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.000]
I thought there was a major announcement coming.

[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.940]
I did not come out.

[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.860]
Yeah, right.

[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.580]
So, uh, Ross, whether it isn't, how about Rob Lois?

[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.100]
See your time?

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.420]
No.

[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.580]
Oh, because you got a whole bunch of, well, he's got all this Rob Lo information here.

[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.740]
I thought we check it out first.

[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.820]
That has nothing to do with me.

[00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.480]
What?

[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.020]
What has to do with the movie again?

[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.400]
Let's see.

[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.740]
Yeah, I'm going to show on the show.

[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.580]
See, that's more like it.

[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.500]
The Rob Loat tape tomorrow.

[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.420]
That's more like a show.

[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.540]
This Felipe Rovero, we need him like hemorrhoids.

[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.640]
We need, and of course, I'm sure that within any day now, we'll be doing a show with the

[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.280]
Ellis Rubin and a guy from the Navy, you know?

[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.420]
Any day that's coming up on a cane.

[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.040]
Trust me.

[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.920]
You can bet your lungs on it, even more of a lock than Northern Wolf.

[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:22.880]
Wow.

[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.660]
All right. Now, what's the Rob Lo thing here?

[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:32.340]
Well, this is the new star, June 6th star, and it's got two pages of fascinating information about this tape.

[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:39.120]
The headline is the sex, the sex capades that Rob Lo filmed in Suite 28.

[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:39.900]
It's got 24.

[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.260]
Can I see the pictures?

[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.640]
Sure.

[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.760]
Because I'm one of those who can only look at pictures now.

[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:43.980]
I know.

[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.040]
I know.

[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:44.260]
I know.

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.480]
I know.

[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.020]
When I started doing this kind of a show, I'm reading this to you.

[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.000]
Low and Princess Stephanie were hot and heavy.

[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.680]
Oh, come on.

[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.400]
When you people stopped this already.

[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.660]
When you cut the crap, let me...

[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.760]
You think you're fooling somebody?

[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.940]
This is like Michael Jackson and what's your name?

[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.680]
You know, with a fat butt.

[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.420]
What's your name?

[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.180]
That.

[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.640]
Discuss this last week.

[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.140]
With the jeans.

[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.020]
Oh, Brooke.

[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.140]
Brooke Shields.

[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.080]
This is the same chaserite.

[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.060]
I guess it is.

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.960]
Get out of here.

[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.900]
Rob Lo has a roving eye for a pretty girl such as this beach beauty he met at the Cannes

[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.900]
Film Festival just days before the sex video scandal broke.

[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.120]
I see this is all part of it.

[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.220]
It's working brilliantly.

[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.740]
It's all part of a PR campaign to butcher up his image because a lot of people are concerned.

[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.280]
What is that?

[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.140]
It's in People Magazine.

[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.240]
What is their conclusion?

[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.960]
They say the verdict is still out probably.

[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:34.900]
Or Rogers got people.

[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.640]
See, he's everywhere.

[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.600]
He's getting all this publicity.

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.480]
And people actually think he's more butch than Marlon Brando now.

[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.600]
Yeah, bring that all.

[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.040]
Look at that.

[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.660]
Rogers got tons of stuff on it.

[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:45.780]
Good.

[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.620]
We can look at the pictures.

[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.720]
Go ahead, even though he's not your type.

[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.200]
Jeez.

[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.860]
Anyway, it's a very poor choice of words yesterday.

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.060]
You really, you really blew it, if I can say that.

[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.380]
A video romp in the buff gives heartbreaker Rob Lo.

[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.840]
A little too much southern exposure, it says.

[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.180]
Yes.

[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.800]
Oh, well, I wanted to read you this.

[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.520]
Well, we got a whole bunch of them.

[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.380]
They all thank you, Roger.

[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.480]
They all tie in together.

[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.120]
Oh, I know.

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.260]
Or do you want to have an exclusive?

[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.520]
They're like a well-apparice.

[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.560]
There's some things in here.

[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.220]
Are you trying to be the Loella Parsons of W-I-O-D?

[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.540]
Now, look at this.

[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.680]
Princess Stephanie.

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.820]
She's got an outfit here.

[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.760]
She looks like a guy.

[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.380]
I know.

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.260]
Did you see that?

[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.000]
No, he looks butcher that he does.

[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.960]
Other pictures over.

[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.900]
She's, yeah.

[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.880]
Looks the alley.

[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.580]
Fawn Hall.

[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.280]
Wow.

[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.500]
Belinda Carlyle.

[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.520]
China Phillips.

[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.520]
Now, look at, I want you to look at the shadow

[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.000]
with that picture over there over here.

[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:48.680]
Yeah.

[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.740]
Doesn't that look like ET?

[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:50.740]
It does.

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.960]
That doesn't look like a human.

[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.360]
I mean, they've shadowed it out a little bit, you know.

[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.360]
But it looks like ET.

[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.240]
That isn't human.

[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.900]
Maybe Rob is doing it with extra terrestrials.

[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.120]
Is that possible?

[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.340]
I think it's a lot more likely than this other story.

[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.780]
Oh, man, they are really living in a dream world.

[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.160]
This is accomplishing just a look at this.

[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.520]
He may face felony charges.

[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.040]
Rob could get 20 years.

[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.260]
And boy, I bet you they'd like him in prison a lot, you know.

[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.280]
He might be right at all.

[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:18.840]
I don't know.

[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.980]
See, I don't really care.

[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.120]
Do you care?

[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.580]
No.

[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.360]
I don't care.

[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.720]
Of course not.

[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.320]
Do you care?

[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.440]
No.

[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.380]
Oh, okay.

[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:26.720]
Hold on.

[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.640]
Now, you're not going away already.

[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:27.860]
No.

[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.280]
Okay.

[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.740]
Let's take this call from plantation because it's about blockbuster.

[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.040]
Hello.

[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.340]
And they hung up.

[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.340]
Well, they obviously cared a lot.

[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.300]
I was going to get them on first because I just saw it on the screen.

[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.560]
And they were going to talk about something that I mentioned here a moment ago.

[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.360]
But because we took at least two minutes about Rob Lowe,

[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.140]
it was just more than they could handle.

[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.440]
Is that I'm calling back?

[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:50.700]
No.

[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.060]
Well, screw them.

[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:52.400]
Okay.

[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.200]
Must've been one of those people who cut up their cards.

[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.080]
Save your cards.

[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:55.480]
Okay.

[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.520]
I don't want anything to do with it.

[00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.640]
I don't, you know, when you go on the air and you do something that can ruin somebody's business, you know.

[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.020]
Yeah.

[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.720]
Just nitpicking over one.

[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.280]
I, you know, I do agree with part of the principle.

[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.540]
And it's always the lunatic right that's, you know, dictating what we can see and what we can read.

[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.080]
And that the rest of the so-called mainstream sits back quietly.

[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.140]
But it's not like there's some big tymos over this, okay?

[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.240]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.120]
It's not like there are people scurrying at the door to see the last temptation of Christ,

[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.880]
which was not exactly what you call a blockbuster movie if I can say that.

[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.180]
Well, here's a mobile about it.

[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:28.400]
Hello.

[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.140]
Hi, Neil.

[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:29.600]

[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.980]
You know, the thing is, is that blockbuster video, like other disseminators of free information have responsibility

[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.820]
to the public to provide the information that's available.

[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.080]
And if they, if they give in to any sort of a special interest.

[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.520]
So you didn't listen to what I said.

[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.280]
They're allowing all their franchises to carry it or not carry it as a case of a family.

[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:49.540]
They're not allowing it.

[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.880]
They just, they have to allow them to do it because they're franchises.

[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.660]
These people own their own stores.

[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.140]
They can't stop them from carrying it.

[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.760]
Sir, you're out of your mind, okay?

[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.580]
Because any company can set their own rules.

[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.340]
It's like the fast food, the outfits.

[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.060]
There are plenty of independently owned ones, but they can't put different items on the menu or just do their own thing.

[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.400]
They're all governed by company guidelines.

[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.720]
So don't tell me a, you know, a song and a dance.

[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.340]
But a lot of, but they can't sell their own thing if they want to.

[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.940]
Just as long as it doesn't compete or directly in a fear with the menu that they make dials as.

[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.620]
They can't sell somebody else's hamburger.

[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.040]
There are another type of french fries.

[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.980]
But they can put other, you know, trinkets out there in order to...

[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.820]
No, they can't.

[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.360]
You're wrong. You're absolutely wrong.

[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.140]
All of that stuff comes direct from the company.

[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.880]
Okay, it's all made by the company.

[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.720]
Well, they, they can.

[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.260]
I'm depending on the franchise.

[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.080]
Well, so this is the world according to you making it up as you go along.

[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.380]
I guess, you know, I mean, what kind of a conversation can I have with a guy who just makes it up as he goes along?

[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.100]
I'm telling you, I guess they're going to start, they're going to start carrying a Wendy's at McDonald's now.

[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.080]
You know, I don't know, I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.820]
So if they're...

[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.160]
The bottom line is that it's not a major stimulus.

[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.600]
There are a lot of these independent stores that are going to carry it.

[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.140]
And if people start carrying, tearing up their blockbuster card,

[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.620]
it's going to hurt people at heart part of this thing that you are all upset about,

[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.780]
sir, and I don't want to talk to you.

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.320]
I mean, I'll talk to people who want to be reasonable about it.

[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.820]
All I'm not going to change my mind again.

[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.640]
Okay, it must have been a, it must have been the heat in here yesterday.

[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.520]
It caused me to keep it so easily.

[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:10.940]
Yeah.

[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.120]
It's a 24 past 10 at WID.

[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.280]
Let's talk about char-hut.

[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.280]
Now it's an excellent time because I just mentioned it all.

[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.020]
No, it is a perfect time.

[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.520]
Because at char-hut, they really do it their way in your own.

[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.880]
The night after the Roblo party, the two redheads came back into the club,

[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.140]
all bubbly and smiling, and very pleased with themselves.

[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.420]
One told me we went back up to Rob's room,

[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.000]
Rob set up his video camera, and he told us what he wanted us to do.

[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.740]
But Rob made a fatal mistake.

[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.680]
He allowed the two women to call a friend, the girl who turned up with a guy,

[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.720]
was a young teenager.

[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.900]
She turned up with a guy.

[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.740]
Doesn't that sound as you read more of this?

[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.260]
Doesn't it sound much more realistic?

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.560]
Just something here that's missing, okay?

[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.100]
Something that doesn't meet the I.M.

[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.880]
And a guy turned out to be a David Cassidy Jr.

[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.900]
Anyway, it's 1028 at WIOD.

[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.300]
We got a Cubs call.

[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.120]
We better get this out of the way so you don't get upset.

[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:05.440]
Hello.

[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.680]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:06.980]
Great.

[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.140]
I'm not really a Cubs fan, but I listen to every day,

[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.480]
so I kind of start to follow them a little bit more and more.

[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.100]
And I thought they were on, they've planned to praise me.

[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.480]
How about that Greg Maddox boy?

[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.920]
He didn't have his best stuff last night, but he pitched a great game.

[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.700]
He did, but the play I was amazed.

[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.580]
That was when Dunston was a second, and Maddox popped it up.

[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.300]
That's Dunston.

[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.880]
And Dunston ran all the way to third.

[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.980]
I was saying, I was...

[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.680]
Sean Dunston, on a sign over half, is checked at Dunz Zimmer.

[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.040]
Whenever they get paid every week or every month,

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.600]
they have to sign half it over to Zimmer, because Zimmer has given him more chance.

[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.380]
They got this kid, Domingo Ramo.

[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.900]
He's not a really kid who's played great.

[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.260]
Every chance he's gotten, he hits the ball, he's a good fielder,

[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.480]
and they keep insisting on Dunston, man.

[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.440]
This guy, he'll never hit over 200 again.

[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.460]
He'll never see 200.

[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.000]
And I don't think he's going to steal out of base, is he?

[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.420]
No, because he gets picked off or he gets...

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.800]
He's stretched the single into a double,

[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.420]
and everybody's all excited, and then on the very next guy's up,

[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.580]
Maddox pops out and he gets doubled off second base.

[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.400]
I never saw a second baseman pick off a runner who had a big deal.

[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.160]
Did you see the pitch he struck out on his last time at bat?

[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.440]
Even Harry was apoplectic.

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.080]
Harry was doing a tap dance in the booth.

[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.820]
He was hitting Steve on the head with a microphone.

[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.220]
All right, and that's right, because you were a good dodgy,

[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.820]
and I was watching a TBS.

[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.380]
Well, see, you don't have your satellite dish,

[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.240]
but so you got to settle for those fakers, okay?

[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.240]
The last pitch he struck out, that ball almost within his eyes.

[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:22.680]
And he's...

[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.080]
Oh, he's...

[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.820]
Don't knock Mitch Williams, sure.

[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.280]
Don't knock Mitch Williams.

[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.480]
He's taking 10 years off my life, but he gets a job done.

[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.080]
Let's not get too intensive here, because somebody's pounding already.

[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.200]
It's really...

[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.080]
Hostel, he's hysterical, okay?

[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.360]
Can we get away from sports talk for a few minutes?

[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:37.940]
No.

[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.940]
A couple minutes, I mean...

[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.220]
Well, Barablo is going to be on the team.

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.840]
I mean, if that's...

[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.460]
Oh, okay.

[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.540]
Well, there he goes again, sir.

[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.540]
He's really serally.

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.040]
Well, it comes, he got a lot of good-looking guys on the team.

[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.900]
They're just not his type.

[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.820]
Have a great day, Pat.

[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.220]
You did.

[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.560]
See, even Mark Grace?

[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.760]
I don't know who that is.

[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.400]
Well, see, it's a learning experience.

[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.720]
Oh.

[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.200]
You're broadening your horizon.

[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:02.860]
No, no.

[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.220]
It's 10-30 at WIOD.

[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.020]
Okay, now let's get back to the Roblo thing, because you obviously got some heavy-duty stuff over there.

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:10.840]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.360]
I'll give you just to make one for the...

[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.960]
In temperate remarks of this last caller.

[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:21.860]
Listen, if all you can do is call the show and say, hey, Neil, how about them cut?

[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.980]
Ami, please, not today.

[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.140]
Can we have one day off from there?

[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.320]
In other words, it would be better if they call it a glib.

[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.660]
How about Phoebe's boobs?

[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.480]
Are they bitten around?

[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:30.900]
No.

[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.300]
I mean, it's either a case.

[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.560]
In both cases, if that's all you can do, would you please get to the...

[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.120]
How about if Phoebe's played on the cup?

[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.280]
How about if she was the Batgirl?

[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.760]
So that's a serious question.

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.720]
If Phoebe's could get the job as Batgirl on the cup, would you take a little more interest?

[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.500]
I realize it's just...it's strictly hypothetical.

[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.980]
But again, we're talking about Roblo and women here, so you know it's a fantasy show.

[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:04.800]
Seriously, if Phoebe's was scantily clad as the Ball Girl, you know, teams have Ball Boys and Ball Girls.

[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.700]
The hurricanes have got Ball Girls.

[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.200]
They do.

[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:09.980]
They're out there in Omaha.

[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.820]
Believe it or not, I hope they got a lot of chaperones too.

[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.840]
Seriously, they got Ball Girls.

[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.620]
If she could be on the cups, would you take a little bit more interest?

[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.960]
If she was on anything.

[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.900]
Oh, okay.

[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.900]
So the answer is yes.

[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:22.960]
Well, there you go.

[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.360]
I'm going to call Jim Fry this afternoon, Alabama, Atlanta.

[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.280]
The General Manager.

[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:33.440]
And I'm going to tell him to sign up, Phoebe, here at the Ball Girl, we can have a whole new core of Cubs fans.

[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.140]
Yeah, well, you would.

[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.560]
Yeah, and she'd like hanging around with Mark Grace and Ryan Sandberg and Maddox and Balucky and Damon Berryhill and Hoi.

[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.600]
Gary Varsho.

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.300]
I'll talk about hype.

[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.540]
This almost made the fans fine.

[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.880]
Well, we got a lot of good-look guys on our team, okay?

[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.880]
And even now that he shaved that beard off, Mitch Williams looks almost human too, okay?

[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.840]
Now that he shaved that schmutz off.

[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.080]
So anyway, getting back to your...

[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.260]
Now, which magazine have you got?

[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:56.680]
Star.

[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.660]
You got the star.

[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.860]
Roger gave me...

[00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.920]
Is this the inquire?

[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.240]
Yeah, the inquire.

[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.440]

[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.180]
And the people.

[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.220]
Well, I would...

[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.660]
It's the one that's in People magazine, you know it's not gonna be true.

[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.180]
I would like to compare the stories, because the star gives the story of what happened also.

[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.860]
Now, this happened at the National...

[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.500]
The Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, okay?

[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.740]
Last summer.

[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:23.740]
The girl now 17 told her friend she met low late one night at the bar of the Trendy Rio Club.

[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.100]
A hot night spot frequented by politicians, lawyers and local people.

[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.900]
I just heard an analogy.

[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.240]
I'm Fabian by the way he was on hold.

[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:30.700]

[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.740]
She told her friend, I was pretty drunk by then.

[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.380]
His friend asked me, you know Rob Lowe the actor?

[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.540]
He liked you and he'd like you to join him.

[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.200]
How about it?

[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.920]
I had no objections.

[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.080]
And so I said, sure.

[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.540]
He led me back to the booth and introduced me to Rob.

[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:51.420]
He was charming, we had a lot more drinks and did ecstasy, a sex stimulant.

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.640]
We were all having a lot of fun, laughing, joking, getting high.

[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.200]
Finally, Rob asked me back to his hotel, must have been early in the morning by then.

[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.860]
I told him I was a lesbian and that my girlfriend was at the bar, could I bring her along?

[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.060]
Oh my God.

[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.840]
He told me to go and get her.

[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.660]
The owner of the club, Joanne Fernandez, says Lowe was in the club during the Democratic Convention

[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.160]
and one night he left with two women, I don't know who they were.

[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.760]
Lowe had been at the club on a previous occasion and I easily recognized him.

[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.020]
The friend claims that the girl said the party finally went back to the Hilton Hotel

[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:30.960]
where Lowe had booked Suite 2844, which cost $650 a night.

[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.660]
When we got to the suite, Rob showed us some videotape of himself making love

[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:39.440]
with lots of female Hollywood stars the girl later told her friend.

[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.480]
I can't remember who they were but their faces were familiar.

[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.540]
One woman I remember recognizing was Bridget Neelson.

[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.800]
Rob told us he had a whole library of videos of him and bed with famous women.

[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.580]
He certainly had quite a few in the suite.

[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.520]
After the video showing the two girls, but they all had their clothes on, all right?

[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.720]
After the video showing, comma, the two girls were encouraged to undress

[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.220]
and get into the king size bed together.

[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.900]
In the audio videotape made and later viewed by the Fulton County District Attorney

[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.280]
and all the major TV networks, the two women are seen making lesbian love.

[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.660]
Lowe is clearly seen naked and heard and seen at one time approaching the girls

[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.180]
and directing them and cheering out lesbian acts.

[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.060]
The camera was the type which took the video automatically.

[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.080]
There is no doubt it shows actor Rob Lowe's assistant attorney, Louis Slayton,

[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.560]
who refuses to identify the women in Bob because one was a juvenile at the time.

[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.620]
The girl told her friend the orgy lasted until they fell asleep,

[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.400]
but she and the other girl got up.

[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.080]
Lowe wasn't there.

[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.060]
The girl saw the tape which they knew had been taken the previous evening

[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.360]
and decided to take it with him.

[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.920]
The 16 year old girl then hid the tape in the bedroom of the home

[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.800]
which she shared with her divorce mother in Marietta, Georgia.

[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.280]
The girl's friends said the mother had been suspicious of her daughter's relationship

[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.620]
with other girls.

[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.180]
She searched the daughter's bedroom and found the videotape.

[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.560]
She was appalled when she saw its contacts.

[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.120]
The tape was shown to various people to see if she could take legal action

[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.220]
against Lowe.

[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.800]
It is believed that someone copied the tape.

[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.280]
Now at one point it was shown for a month at Stagnight's

[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.600]
at a very upper class country club near Atlanta.

[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.160]
The requirements is the video of Rob Lowe and the women

[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.880]
is a big hit around Atlanta.

[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.520]
It's at a police source.

[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.980]
Besides Rob's scandalous sexual life sports

[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.720]
that they've also showed him, listen to this,

[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.260]
walking around the room drinking beer and sharing a cigarette

[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.520]
with a woman in bed.

[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:00.660]
Wow.

[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.660]
That is shocking.

[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.400]
That is really heavy duty.

[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.600]
Well that's the story.

[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.760]
Oh man.

[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.200]
The inside story.

[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.740]
I don't think I'm ever going to be the same.

[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:16.220]
It's 1036 at WIOD and Steve is doing a whole show on it tomorrow.

[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:16.520]
Yeah.

[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.100]
Isn't that great?

[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.460]
Yeah.

[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.760]
And he's going to have the sister of ET in the studio.

[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.980]
Look at that picture.

[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.020]
That's got to be ET in that.

[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.960]
Not a human form.

[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:25.200]
No.

[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.180]
Not a human form.

[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:26.660]
It's true.

[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.240]
Anyway, I want to tell you about Nutri's system.

[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.580]
29, 21 before 11 at WIOD.

[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.420]
We have somebody dropped off in date and I hung up on it.

[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.260]
Fabian again.

[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.480]
Fabian, I don't want to talk to you.

[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.120]
Don't you understand?

[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.620]
You're a chronic pain in the ass.

[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.760]
We don't want to talk to you.

[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.920]
We've got heavy duty subjects here today that are far beyond your

[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.380]
capacity to discuss.

[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.240]
751 WIOD in date.

[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.940]
Steve is doing a whole show on Rob Lowe tomorrow.

[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.000]
So we don't want to steal his thunder.

[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.180]
This is kind of like a little preliminary buildup.

[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:52.860]
Is that what it is?

[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.480]
Do we show tomorrow?

[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.300]
He showed today we don't want to dignify with that.

[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.020]
Oh my God.

[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:56.820]
Discussion, okay.

[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.280]
Shocking.

[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.920]
It's beyond belief.

[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.180]
Anyway, so that covers the Rob Lowe thing pretty well.

[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.580]
I guess lunch today I think.

[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.740]
I hate, I don't like to be presumptuous.

[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.480]
Okay, because I know these people have got a life.

[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.940]
And they got a lot of work to do with all these different places.

[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.920]
But I'm in the mood for royal castle burgers today.

[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.520]
I know that Wayne Arnold was just here on Monday with his lovely wife

[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.460]
and they brought tons of food.

[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.860]
But I was sick as a dog and I didn't eat a bite.

[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.420]
Now you know I was sick if I didn't touch the dough.

[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.000]
Yeah, no.

[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.860]
Because boy, those are just...

[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.780]
If I got to have to say between the Italian sausage

[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.700]
and char hut, which is my favorite over there.

[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.620]
And the little cheeseburgers at royal castle that's a tie.

[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.220]
That's not a cop-up, but I just love them both.

[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.600]
Anyways, so that would be my choice.

[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.840]
If of course they could find it.

[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.120]
I mean, they're up there on 125th and northwest 7th.

[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.040]
That's not very far.

[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.240]
No, not too bad.

[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.480]
It's like 20 watts, 46 blocks.

[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:48.960]
Plus over the cut.

[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.420]
I mean, I don't want to make it sound like I'm pushy or anything like that

[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.120]
because they've been very, very nice to us.

[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:54.340]
Yeah.

[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.820]
But I'm Jones in for those little cheeseburgers.

[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.820]
And of course Todd's probably going to be in the newsroom today.

[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.100]
And you know him, that's about as much as he can deal with.

[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.340]
What, three Fabie and what? He's on again?

[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.240]
Don't you take no for an answer?

[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.340]
No.

[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.300]
Don't you understand we don't want to talk to you?

[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:10.680]
No.

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.780]
And don't take it personally.

[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.000]
We just, it's not your day.

[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.340]
But Amara's the first of a new month.

[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.660]
We let, on the first of each month, we let anybody call all the chronics.

[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.260]
Can't you wait till tomorrow?

[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.360]
Can't you control yourself?

[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.900]
No, I'm just too much of an idiot.

[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.020]
Can't you find something constructive to do?

[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.880]
Aren't you, don't you work?

[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:26.740]
I'm on work release.

[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.520]
You're what?

[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.260]
I work release.

[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.140]
Yeah, I believe that.

[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.760]
But I'm over here, right?

[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.760]
Maybe, maybe if you release it, you'll feel better.

[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.060]
Maybe the blood is rushing to your head or something.

[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.060]
Hey, Neil, I went over to the Pensacola for a moment.

[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.400]
In other words, you're just going to go right on the head.

[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.440]
You're not listening to me.

[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.860]
I'm trying to be reasonable with you.

[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.200]
I didn't hang up on you again yet.

[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.820]
Yeah, I know.

[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:46.200]
I know.

[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.540]
Fabian, what do you want?

[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.120]
Well, I just called to say hi.

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:49.580]
You know what I mean?

[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.440]
Well, how you doing?

[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.760]
Well, I'm over here hanging on.

[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.420]
Well, good.

[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:53.760]
See you.

[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.360]
All right.

[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.180]
Is that it?

[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:55.680]
No.

[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.480]
Well, what happened about going to Pensacola?

[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.360]
I was over there. I was trying to get an EM station.

[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.620]
There's nothing open there.

[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.840]
Well, Captain Dave used to be up in that area.

[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.840]
So I think that says it all, doesn't it?

[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.800]
I guess pretty much so.

[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.080]
Yeah.

[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.060]
Is that it?

[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.360]
Well, yeah.

[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.280]
Well, that's good. See, I let you get it out of your system.

[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.080]
You feel better now?

[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.040]
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Neil.

[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.300]
OK, put it away, Fabian.

[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:13.580]
Later.

[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.640]
See, incredible.

[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.760]
He is something, boy.

[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.480]
He just doesn't have to say that.

[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.520]
What's that on the bat line?

[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.920]
Is that for us or is that, I get nervous when I see that

[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.260]
family?

[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.000]
Oh, it's for you.

[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.760]
Oh, it's another one.

[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:23.840]
It's probably Rebecca Paul.

[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.060]
1042, W-I-O-D.

[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.620]
And if you want to call in and argue with me about the blockbuster thing,

[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.340]
you're going to waste your time.

[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.040]
I mean, go ahead if you want to, but that other guy just didn't want to listen to me.

[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.500]
I don't like hurting people who aren't responsible.

[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.120]
In other words, the basic premise I agree with,

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.020]
but there are a lot of the individual people who are not making that choice.

[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.540]
And they're going to get hurt too.

[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.780]
Believe me, OK?

[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.780]
Because the people that dummies out in the audience, they're not going to look at their cards.

[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.160]
Oh, well, I don't know if this store is a franchise owned or if it's independently owned.

[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:54.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:55.380]
Yeah.

[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.500]
They're not going to do that.

[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.120]
They're just going to like a bunch of little automaton's on there.

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.840]
They're going to, you know, cut up their cards and send them in because they think that they're really making some kind of a statement.

[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.140]
And I just, I don't like doing those things.

[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.880]
I mean, I've run plenty of campaigns in my time, but I would prefer to do it when there's really a need for it.

[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.780]
I don't see any desperate need to try to put these people out of business, you know.

[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:14.980]
Mm-hmm.

[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.820]
Oh, boy, does that look good?

[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.680]
Look at that.

[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.340]
Tex-Mex Meat Loaf.

[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.700]
It's a velvita recipe in this magazine and his paper on the left.

[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.160]
Doesn't that look good?

[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.800]
It's meatloaf with cheese.

[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.820]
Yeah, looks great.

[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.120]
Chives?

[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.040]
Oh, boy, does that look good, huh?

[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.780]
With onion and parsley?

[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.500]
Maybe my mother would make that next week.

[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.020]
She wouldn't make something like that because I mean, she makes everything great.

[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.980]
Don't get me wrong, but she just wouldn't do that.

[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:45.180]
Meatloaf with...

[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.640]
Galvita Mexican Process Cheese Spread melted on top of it.

[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.220]
Oh, boy, does that look good?

[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.120]
Now I'm really going nuts.

[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.400]
Doesn't that look good?

[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.540]
It does look good.

[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.300]
Looks damn good because it's getting close to lunchtime, too.

[00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.240]
It's already 1043.

[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.800]
Okay, let's, here's another.

[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.260]
I'm taking these out of order because I want to see if there's anybody who really is paying any attention

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.100]
in what we're talking about.

[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.440]
It's a Rob Low call on, too.

[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:07.720]
Hello.

[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.360]
Neil?

[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:08.800]
Yeah.

[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.920]
Long time listener, first time caller, how you doing?

[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:11.320]
Okay.

[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.940]
Yeah, I used to live in Atlanta.

[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.020]
And you know who Rob Low used to date?

[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.260]
At the time of the Democratic Convention up there?

[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.200]
Andrew McCarthy.

[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:19.700]
No.

[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.660]
Head Turner's daughter.

[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.300]
Wow.

[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.580]
Yeah, there was a lot of stuff going up there about that.

[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.860]
Boy, oh, boy.

[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.100]
Yeah.

[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:26.980]
How old is she?

[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.560]
About 10.

[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.980]
She's about 28.

[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.740]
Oh, 28.

[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.180]
Yeah.

[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.480]
That's a little old for Rob, isn't it?

[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.780]
Yeah, he was way out of his league.

[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:34.120]
Yeah.

[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:34.920]
Yeah.

[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.960]
Hey, the guy called yesterday about called her.

[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.960]
The fourth floor.

[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:39.580]
Mm-hmm.

[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.260]
Wait till you go up there and see that place.

[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.240]
I'm going this weekend.

[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.160]
It's incredible.

[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.420]
I mean, it looks like Caesar's Palace.

[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.000]
Really?

[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.360]
Yeah, you'll be amazed.

[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.080]
I'm going to go see Mickey and Martha and just have a wonderful time up there.

[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.340]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:51.760]
That's great.

[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.240]
Well, if I see up there, I'll stop you in the hell.

[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.880]
And if you're going to say hi to my friend Jimmy at the ice cream stand down there downstairs,

[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.000]
then he's a great guy.

[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.500]
Yeah, I know Jimmy.

[00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.760]
Jimmy's a terrific guy.

[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.080]
Yeah.

[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.580]
Well, I enjoy your show and you guys do a great job.

[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.160]
Thanks a lot.

[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.840]
Okay, take care.

[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.000]
Bye.

[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:04.540]
So he was dating.

[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.080]
He dates all these very important people.

[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:07.680]
Mm-hmm.

[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.260]
So to speak.

[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.400]
So maybe the bottom line is Rob is a lot butcher than we thought, right?

[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.340]
It's unlikely.

[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.360]
But he certainly haven't a tremendous effect.

[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.240]
You know, he's convincing people.

[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.360]
Now, you think he's going to jail?

[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.220]
No.

[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:18.780]
No.

[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:25.380]
I think we could take up an office pool on it and we wouldn't get anybody putting in money on the go to jail side.

[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:25.840]
Mm-hmm.

[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.260]
I just have my doubts.

[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.120]
Now, if it would have been like Joe Schmerrill, Joe Schmendrick in Atlanta,

[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.580]
who had sex with a minor, you know, and made video to everything, he'd be...

[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:41.080]
he'd have a battery of lawyers already and he'd be up against the wall and he'd probably go to jail for like 15 years, you know.

[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.120]
But I just have a feeling that Roblox, in fact, he'll probably go, what was the Roman Polanski?

[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.140]
That's the country.

[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:52.420]
He'll probably go back to France with Roman Polanski and the two of them will go out there looking for a 12-year-old or something.

[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.940]
Poets pathetic.

[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.740]
10.45 at WIOD, we have an opening in date and one in brown.

[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.460]
I guess we're getting a little bit too heavy duty for our very intellectual audience out there.

[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.880]
We've got a couple of open lines now.

[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.740]
Well, I guess we usually don't have topics on the show.

[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.560]
We usually try to avoid that very...

[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.240]
assiduously.

[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.420]
Not at all.

[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:10.940]
Don't let us tell you.

[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.260]
And if you don't understand that word, I'll be glad to spell it for you later and you could look it up in your little Don Web dictionary, okay?

[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.640]
Anyway, what a great day to be out on the water, huh?

[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.060]
Man, if I had...

[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.860]
I'm thinking about getting a boat from Boatsur Us when I was down there.

[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.320]
When we were down there that day, I took a look around at that boy.

[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.740]
I know like looking too hard because you know I have no sales resistance.

[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.940]
For me, we're a couple of boats.

[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.960]
Not the real big ones.

[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.880]
It's 10-11 at WIOD.

[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.400]
We've got this very important Roblo mobile call here.

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.580]
Hi, Neil.

[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.320]
Yes, I was a delegate to the Democratic Convention.

[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.780]
And the first weekend I stayed at the Holton.

[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.200]
And all the big shots were staying up on the 28th floor.

[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.340]
It was the security floor.

[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.080]
The lobby was full of young girls waiting to see these celebrities.

[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.160]
James Bond and Rick Helwell were there.

[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.800]
I haven't seen them, but I had to move up to Dunwoody for it.

[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.980]
That's where the Florida delegation was housed.

[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.800]
On Tuesdays, I unfortunately wasn't back when I had all the exciting events going on.

[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.360]
I have found you a wonderful house in the grove.

[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.120]
Yeah, good luck to you, sir.

[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:16.840]
There's that Campbell.

[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:17.540]
Yeah.

[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.620]
On the same street where our good friend Freddie lives.

[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.560]
You remember Freddie from the studio residence?

[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.280]
I sure do.

[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.360]
You could go over and ask instead of for a couple of figures,

[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.000]
you could get a couple of strutles or something like that.

[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.320]
Yeah, that's just what I need, Jack.

[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.360]
So I thought you liked to hear about that.

[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.580]
And down here in South State, or South Miami, campaigning.

[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.200]
And I thought I'd get in before all of the cooks start calling tomorrow.

[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.000]
Tomorrow?

[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.780]
Isn't that June 1st?

[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.220]
Yeah.

[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.540]
Well, we had you on the list.

[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.460]
I was an Asian provocateur the last night.

[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.400]
Yeah, something like that.

[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.020]
Well, just remember, Jack, what goes around?

[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.560]
See you later.

[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.560]
All right, thank you.

[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.360]
OK, 10.51 at WIOD.

[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.520]
And it says here she's a 16-year-old sophomore student

[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.840]
that lasted her high school.

[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.140]
Oh, my name forgot her.

[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.740]
She's gone to club Rio several times or so,

[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.020]
but she gets in easily because she looks much older than 16.

[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.460]
And you have to be 21 again in that club because they serve booze.

[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.760]
And she had a fake ID.

[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:16.700]
Yeah, he's a thing.

[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.680]
So I think that they're going to be some mitigating circumstances

[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.900]
because she passed herself off as being 21.

[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.480]
Yeah.

[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.280]
OK.

[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.480]
And she was there.

[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.120]
In other words, nobody dragged her in there.

[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.820]
She was there for her own volition, passing herself off as being older.

[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.620]
And I don't know what the law says.

[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.740]
Well, in the star article, it says that Rob regularly picks up girls

[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.580]
at Beverly Hills High School where he goes to Georgia.

[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.460]
Female students leave their phone numbers on the windshield of its 928S Porsche.

[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.320]
Seniors, of course.

[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.060]
Of course.

[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.160]
Anyway, it says here around 2 a.m.

[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.820]
Rob called the manager of the club and told him,

[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.900]
my friends and I are hungry, we need some food.

[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.740]
The manager told him the club doesn't serve food, but Rob shouted,

[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.760]
we want pizza.

[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.700]
Get us some damn pizza.

[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:04.480]
Yeah.

[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.260]
The manager gave in and later told me if it wasn't low,

[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.960]
I would have booted him out onto the street.

[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:15.500]
I was checking and begging for booze.

[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:16.480]
Huh?

[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.320]
What was that?

[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.340]
He was shaking for a bush.

[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.780]
Is the president on the suit?

[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.020]
We're back in Atlanta, according to Roger here.

[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.300]
The word is that the video is going for $500 to $1,000.

[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.120]
Yeah, that's been on the TV news.

[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.820]
Yeah, I saw that on the news.

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.640]
Now, do you think they're going to be carrying this at Blockbuster?

[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.480]
I want a great idea.

[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.220]
You think that would pacify Steve and Steve would call off his attack

[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.100]
if they carried this video at Blockbuster?

[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.560]
I think that might do it.

[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.840]
I thought about that.

[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.900]
Okay, well, that's what it takes.

[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.300]
1053 at WIOD, Miami.

[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:49.700]
Hello.

[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.240]
Yeah.

[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.960]
Yeah, about this Blockbuster video that Steve can is promoting.

[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:01.460]
I think my personal opinion is the only reason why he's doing this is because he has no material whatsoever.

[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.120]
And he has to stoop as low as possible.

[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.320]
Well, now let's not turn this into a personal attack, and Steve, even though that's probably true,

[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.860]
but let's not go overboard.

[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.380]
Yeah, I just, I don't like getting sucked into somebody else's.

[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.680]
That's a one thing about Steve that's still, we get along pretty well, but it still irritates me

[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:24.580]
as he loves being the Ojón provocateur who stirs the pot and in lights to drag everybody else to jump into the cauldron with him, you know.

[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.880]
Right, but the thing is, I mean, he probably doesn't even care about it, but he's acting like he does just a promoted show.

[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.580]
Well, it's a cost-celebrate.

[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.240]
I mean, you know, more than somebody did with a spray paint.

[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.820]
Somebody with a spray paint.

[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.920]
Steve can't probably go down to the Miami International Airport.

[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:38.400]
Spray paint, swat, because on a face.

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.320]
No, he's going to have to leap a Rivera, do that for the afternoon.

[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.220]
Okay, sir.

[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:43.740]
All right.

[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.200]
Thanks a lot.

[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.500]
Obviously a big Steve came face.

[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:45.820]
Yeah.

[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.700]
We have an open line in Dade, one in Brown and one in Bocca.

[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.060]
So the Rob Lowe hour here is really generated incredible excitement.

[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.440]
The fever pitch is just building out there, man.

[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:55.920]
They're bubbling.

[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:56.720]
They are?

[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.420]
Bubbling.

[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.060]
Are you sure?

[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.400]
Bocca 278 of a YOD.

[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.880]
Well, we don't want to talk too loud.

[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.900]
You know, we don't want to wake him up.

[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.140]
So what's the verdict on lunch?

[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.160]
You think we're getting any lunch?

[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.460]
No.

[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.360]
What does that mean?

[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:10.740]
No.

[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.260]
I mean, here's the guy sitting in there who's been fed more free food in the last seven

[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.420]
months than Carter's got pills.

[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.280]
And he has no confidence in us.

[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:17.620]
Okay.

[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.140]
Somebody will do something.

[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:25.100]
I mean, I don't want to press Mr. Arnold down there because he, there's such wonderful people

[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:32.320]
and they brought us enough of those castle burgers to choke the whole barn area at Calder.

[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.320]
I'm going to say to choke a horse, but a whole bunch of horse.

[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:34.660]
Wow.

[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.960]
But I just, I'm just in the mood for that today.

[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:38.380]
I don't know.

[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.020]
Oh, he's not in today?

[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.260]
Well, I guess so that's takes care of that.

[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.940]
I guess we're out to lunch on that.

[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.240]
So to speak is a little plan.

[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.800]
Words are, so I guess we're not getting fed today.

[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.360]
That's all right.

[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.180]
We'll survive.

[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:49.840]
That's right.

[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:51.540]
We will.

[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:51.940]
Yeah.

[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:52.920]
I will.

[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.780]
Well, see, I would have been all right, but then I saw the picture of the meatloaf.

[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.300]
Oh, man.

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.220]
Yeah, see, that's what.

[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.580]
No, I'm serious.

[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.340]
Because meatloaf is the kind of thing I like once in a while.

[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.860]
It's a real goyish kind of a thing, but I like it once in a great while.

[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.980]
If it's spicy and if it's got something neat on it, you know what I mean?

[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:11.840]
Like if it's not the best.

[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:12.440]
No, that's good to be.

[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.860]
And that had that Mexican cheese on it.

[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.240]
Oh, man, it looked good.

[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.420]
I'm trying to put the hell with this Rob Low crap, okay?

[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.520]
See, he's one of those people you really don't care.

[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.260]
I'm sure that there are a lot of people in the audience who care because they live these vicarious lives

[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.100]
and you're all excited about people that they're never going to meet and never going to see.

[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.220]
You, of course, on the other hand, having been a very, very famous.

[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.700]
Movie critic.

[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.940]
I used to rub elbows with all of these people.

[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.120]
Nothing else but elbows.

[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:42.600]
That's correct.

[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.920]
This is why, of course, he hasn't watched his elbows in many years.

[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.460]
He once rubbed elbows with AJ Dewey at the SNS cafeteria several times.

[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.560]
West Palm Beach, hello.

[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:51.900]
Hi, how are you doing?

[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:52.340]
Great.

[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.060]
I just figured out, I might as well tell you that I want to start by saying that I'm not really from West Palm Beach.

[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.600]
My girlfriend was up here, so I...

[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.940]
Okay, we won't blame it on you, pal.

[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.580]
Okay, thanks.

[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.160]
Just so I can be clear to this city.

[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:06.640]
You can have been hanging out here for the past couple of hours and it's really just a nightmare time.

[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.840]
Yeah, even just being there a couple of hours is enough to turn your life upside down.

[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:10.320]
You're not kidding.

[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:15.200]
That's why I'm going to end off the Rob Lowellr with a very special report for you.

[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.680]
How much did you say that the video was going for?

[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:17.880]
500 to a grand.

[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.140]
Okay, I have the video.

[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.160]
You do?

[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.360]
If anybody over there wants it.

[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.800]
I have the complete...

[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.340]
Well, actually, I've completed it by 20 minutes.

[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.180]
I got about 20 minutes of the video.

[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.200]
And let me tell you something.

[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:35.320]
If you take a look at this video, like anyone who sees it will have to be convinced that Rob Lowellr is going to get off because...

[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:35.760]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.260]
That's a play on the hard side thing.

[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.680]
I think that was the idea, wasn't it?

[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:46.620]
Basically, no, but you have to see it because there is no way that this 16-year-old girl was this nice and modest,

[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.000]
a little innocent girl who got to do this by Rob Lowellr.

[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.140]
Some of the things that she says to him in the video are well-shock-shocking.

[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:53.580]
Absolutely.

[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.080]
Well, how are we going to get this?

[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.560]
In other words, you're going to sell it to us?

[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.940]
No, I don't want it.

[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:58.860]
Do you really want the video?

[00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.420]
I'll bring it by.

[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.560]
Oh, my God.

[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.520]
That would be incredible.

[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.340]
I have no qualms.

[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.200]
I don't give it to Kane.

[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.600]
Okay, I want this because if Kane gets it, I'm going to be upset.

[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.480]
He's probably got his zone already, but I want it.

[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.600]
Okay, I want it.

[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.960]
Just, of course, for only four scholastic purposes, okay, just so we can study it for on a year to come.

[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:13.760]
You're in the office, yeah.

[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.360]
Absolutely.

[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:15.560]
I can't.

[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.680]
In fact, we can probably all get together in Disney's office and watch it on his VCR and you're on the TVN.

[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.400]
Just, you know, strictly journalistic.

[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.860]
Yeah, that's the reason why I got it.

[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.760]
My father's a journalist.

[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:25.200]
Yeah.

[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.220]
I sort of, I guess I wiped it with the good word.

[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:29.760]
Fabulous.

[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.100]
Well, I'm going to look forward to it.

[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:31.360]
Okay.

[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.300]
When are you going to bring it by?

[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.480]
Well, let's see.

[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.140]
Like I said, I'm in Palm Beach at Nightmare Town.

[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.080]
If I can get down there today, I will definitely drop it off today.

[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.020]
If not, I promise you you'll have a 14 does.

[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:42.680]
Great.

[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.340]
Thanks for million.

[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.120]
Okay, take it easy.

[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:44.380]
Bye.

[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.300]
I mean, it's not like we're in competition with Steve on it, but I just don't want anybody else in the building.

[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.540]
Get their grubby hands on it.

[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.380]
Now listen to this.

[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.880]
There's a word in here which is amazing.

[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:59.720]
It says, the inquirer has obtained a portion of the video which shows low performing shocking acts with a female.

[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.220]
A lot of other men looks on.

[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:01.940]
Really?

[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.200]
Now, I don't understand.

[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.460]
For a form of shocking acts with a female.

[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.900]
Interesting choice of words, isn't it?

[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:11.520]
What does that mean?

[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.500]
Yeah, I'm not exactly shocked.

[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.480]
Yeah, in other words, not just because the inquirer, it would take a lot of shock.

[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:25.680]
When you read about the eight-year-old boy that's had his second baby in the other page, you think it would take quite a bit to shock these people in the last panel.

[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:32.020]
But it says it shows low performing shocking acts with a female while another man looks on.

[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:32.920]
Huh.

[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.040]
Boy, it just sounds a little bit bizarre, don't I?

[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.980]
Well, you see, actually, what happened is the pressure of that Ducakis campaign.

[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:48.820]
When he was out there on that train with Michael Ducakis and waving and smiling and really believing that Santo was going to happen.

[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.120]
And then his bubble burst and he just never been the same.

[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:53.000]
He's going through Ducakis withdrawal.

[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:53.880]
I see.

[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.620]
Anyway, we have an open line in Brown and one in Palm Beach for the big 11 o'clock hour.

[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.040]
We're definitely not going to eat today.

[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.800]
So it turns into a real bummer again.

[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.700]
I thought it was going to be a great day.

[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.120]
I really just...

[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.360]
I never learned my lesson, do I?

[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.760]
Anyway, Henry Barrow's got the 11 o'clock WIOD news.

[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.480]
We're going to come back at 11 o'clock and Steve this afternoon.

[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.000]
Boy, do I have to promo this?

[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.420]
No.

[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.880]
Fire conservative Cuban radio commentator and famed anti-Semite.

[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.220]
Philippe Barrow will be on the cane show from 2 to 6 this afternoon.

[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.880]
New stock radio 610 WIOD presents Neal Rogers.

[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.880]
To get in touch and talk, call 751 WIOD in day.

[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.400]
524 WIOD in Brawler.

[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.180]
Or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach.

[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.820]
Other areas make all collect.

[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.900]
The opinions expressed by the host guests or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.880]
Now, here's Neal Rogers on New Stock Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.660]
This is very impressive.

[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.140]
It's a great deal.

[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.820]
It's not even quite cut.

[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.460]
It's 11 o'clock WIOD.

[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.400]
He went on his a lot of pressure building here today.

[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.220]
Yeah, there is.

[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.100]
A lot of pressure.

[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:16.740]
True.

[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.920]
Now this is incredible, Fulton County.

[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.380]
I'm so choked up about this.

[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.620]
Portland County District Attorney Lewis Slayton says that

[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.980]
Lo has been the focus of a criminal investigation for weeks.

[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.880]
Although the age of consent in Georgia is 14.

[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:30.680]
Wow.

[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.660]
He could face the prosecution under a law that prohibits the use of anyone

[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.300]
under 18 in a pornographic movie.

[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.120]
The age of consent in Atlanta.

[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.520]
Oh, Andy, a news on on conversion of the tape of channel seven.

[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:45.580]
Really?

[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.340]
And.

[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.260]
How is it?

[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.380]
And he doesn't have any comment?

[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.340]
Well, why doesn't Andy come in here in Philosin?

[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:54.740]
OK.

[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.180]
I didn't believe that.

[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.220]
From our news department.

[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.920]
Well, our news people are right on top of these.

[00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.380]
Obviously.

[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.760]
So to speak, I didn't get invited.

[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.180]
We got three open lines, by the way.

[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.620]
All of a sudden we were doing just great.

[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.400]
And then all of a sudden, I guess, too much of this,

[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.500]
it deals too much with the subject, doesn't it?

[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:08.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:09.580]
They're not used.

[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.620]
And we don't want to take this away.

[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.940]
Because Steve's doing a whole show on it tomorrow.

[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.640]
So don't get the idea that we're going to talk about Rob Lofor four hours.

[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.060]
Oh, he's busy and he'll be insuredly.

[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.300]
Well, excuse us.

[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.720]
OK, it's like lunchtime now.

[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.540]
You know, when the food gets here, we tell him you can come in now.

[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.080]
And then they come sheepishly and whatever they feel like it.

[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.380]
But I don't think they're going to have that problem today.

[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.740]
Because I think we're getting shine totally.

[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.100]
This could be the first day in weeks that we

[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.520]
don't have a particle of food coming, isn't it?

[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.620]
First day in a long time.

[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:36.980]
I think.

[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.060]
It could be wrong.

[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.100]
Since the day after my birthday party, we only

[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:41.780]
didn't eat today.

[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.760]
But there was a reason for that.

[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:43.940]
Yeah.

[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.080]
Palm Beach is open 655WIOD.

[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.300]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.320]
I know it's pretty ridiculous.

[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.340]
A bokeh call about blockbusters.

[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:51.700]
Hello.

[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.200]
Hi, Neil.

[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:52.640]
Yeah.

[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.960]
I agree that you don't want to hurt the franchisees.

[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.460]
But up here in Boca, there's three blockbuster videos

[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:58.680]
and they're all corporate stores.

[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.500]
So everybody up here can cut their card in half.

[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:02.800]
OK.

[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.020]
Taiwan missing the point.

[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:06.360]
Yeah.

[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.600]
Boy, so ridiculous, you know.

[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.780]
It's really good.

[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.900]
No, I really don't.

[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:14.980]
I don't like the whole idea.

[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.580]
It's just so arbitrary and just can do so much damage.

[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.480]
So if they, I'm not going to get into it.

[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.620]
Because if we do that, then I'm going to do a whole show on it.

[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.140]
And we don't do that kind of show anymore.

[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:26.500]
OK.

[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.140]
Thank God.

[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.640]
I just, you know, Steve wants to do that.

[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.400]
He's got his right.

[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.960]
Of course, more power to him.

[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:32.760]
Let him do his thing.

[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.500]
Let him run his own campaign.

[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.520]
I don't want to get sucked in on anybody else's campaigns

[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:37.920]
anymore.

[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.300]
OK.

[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:41.080]
I'm not doing campaigns unless it's something

[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.600]
that I really feel strongly about.

[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:43.020]

[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.700]
In fact, it seems to me that every time in all the years that I've

[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:47.740]
been in this market and Steve's been in it, every time that I've

[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.480]
done a campaign, whether it was Save Our South Florida or anything

[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.060]
that was accused by him and others of being a bigot.

[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.620]
And I was doing it for all these other sinister purposes, which I was

[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:56.900]
not.

[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.420]
And I think history bears me out very well to see the tracks that have

[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.120]
been left by the way the Murray all vote lift was handled, for

[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.160]
example, and a lot of other things that have gone on in this town.

[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.340]
But, but now all of a sudden, I'm over here.

[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.680]
You know, there's this attempt to just, it's like Norm Kent with

[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:14.540]
his rotisserie base.

[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.000]
Norm, you're a wonderful guy.

[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.220]
But if you want to continue behaving, you know, in your baseball

[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.660]
life, like a five year old child, that's fine.

[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.540]
I mean, that's great.

[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.180]
See, I just watched the games because I enjoy them, you know,

[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.120]
because I'm a Cub-Span.

[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.620]
I love the game and I just have a good time.

[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.260]
I don't have to have a bet on a game.

[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.820]
I don't have to have some financial interest.

[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.380]
I don't have to take, you know, die jail after the game.

[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.080]
Just a game.

[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.100]
That's why they call him that.

[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.040]
Isn't he sent me a letter?

[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.300]
Did I say this on there?

[00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.900]
Send me a letter a few days ago about how they inviting me.

[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:48.060]
They have a team open in a rotisserie league and it's only 130 bucks and

[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.820]
on and on and on.

[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.520]
It was shocking.

[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.500]
It was more shocking than Rob Lowe.

[00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:53.460]
Whoa.

[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:54.940]
Really?

[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:55.400]
Yeah.

[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.140]
Well, we have both the Palm Beach lines open.

[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.720]
This is getting me really peeled, you know?

[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.520]
We were, we were off to a pretty good start.

[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.840]
Seems like we got Monday out of the way yesterday.

[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.400]
And Palm Beach now is crapped out.

[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.860]
I guess this is as far as we can go on this show with the discussion

[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.040]
of any substance, okay?

[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.620]
Other than dying over here.

[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.300]
That's about what we can do.

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:14.520]
Okay.

[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.220]
Why don't we admit it?

[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:15.700]
All right.

[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.300]
Steve, you shouldn't feel bad because this audience can't deal with anything.

[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.400]
Even semi intellectual anyway.

[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.660]
All day dying over here.

[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.000]
That's the best they can do.

[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:24.300]
Okay.

[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.560]
That's all our callers could have speaking of dying over here.

[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.960]
What do you want Spencer?

[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.280]
It's Spencer.

[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:32.720]
Yeah.

[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.200]
I think girl pan take some more.

[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.220]
I got it like that.

[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:37.560]
We're good.

[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.880]
It's shiny glass out there.

[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.820]
Shining like glass.

[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.400]
Well, that's good.

[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.960]
It better be shining like glass.

[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.240]
Are you going to have a shining ass?

[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:44.980]
Okay Spencer?

[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.440]
Don't be my please.

[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.420]
Don't hit it.

[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.120]
My friend.

[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:49.480]
I love it.

[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.180]
Did a good job.

[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.700]
I'm you checked it out personally because I know it couldn't have been you

[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:54.740]
that did it two weeks ago.

[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.000]
I put my glasses off and look.

[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:57.000]
Oh, did you?

[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.860]
For the first time in years.

[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.160]
Spencer even sleeps with glasses on.

[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:03.420]
Okay.

[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:03.860]
Got to.

[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:04.420]
Yeah.

[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.300]
Let him know.

[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.020]
Yeah, Spencer's here today and it's his last.

[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.560]
That's the last day of a May last Wednesday of May and the last day of May.

[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.220]
And so the last day for that $30 special if you want if you're in the building

[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.460]
and you want your car washed and waxed if you want a good hose job from Spencer.

[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.220]
It's 30 bucks today.

[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:20.580]
Okay.

[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.020]
30 way to put it.

[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:22.180]
Yeah.

[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.660]
I think it was an accurate way to put it.

[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.700]
So the vet is looking really good.

[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:26.940]

[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.020]
No smear.

[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:28.740]
No smuts.

[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.280]
You sure now?

[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.640]
You checking out all those bugs are gone now?

[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:33.720]
Yeah.

[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.160]
Well, that was you let me down Spencer.

[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.300]
That's the first time ever.

[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.020]
Yeah, you're going to hold me up.

[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.200]
Yeah, I bet.

[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:43.020]
Okay, Spencer.

[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:43.760]
Thanks a lot.

[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.040]
Okay.

[00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:45.120]
We'll see you around the old barn.

[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.200]
Say goodbye to our friends at Zeta to next Monday.

[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:47.500]
Okay.

[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.880]
Because they're going to be leaving real soon.

[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.840]
It's 12 minutes after 11 at WIOD.

[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.260]
We have it opening in Boka at 2789463 278 WIOD.

[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.560]
These phones should be blazing.

[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.220]
They shouldn't they?

[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.160]
They should be blazing.

[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.840]
No, I said get out of here Spencer.

[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:02.720]
Get out.

[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.600]
Man, the man is all in here for his own show.

[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.740]
So he's almost as bad as the guy that called you and invited

[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.360]
himself on the show and I'm on vacation.

[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.620]
He's I'm serious.

[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.100]
He's right in the running there.

[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.220]
So anyway, in the last two days we've discovered some really

[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.460]
amazing things we found out that Ross is not the birds type and we found out

[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.500]
that Rob Lowe performed shocking acts.

[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.520]
Now you put those two things.

[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:24.700]
Are they really equal?

[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.160]
Well, I'm really equal, but they're just overpowering.

[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.920]
I'm more repupping may come to town.

[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.040]
He may just come to town to cover all of this.

[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.400]
Anyway, it's 11 12.

[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.880]
I think I said that at WIOD we'll be right back.

[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.960]
This is Steve Cain for the East Coast Fisheries restaurant and market more

[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.220]
than just a restaurant.

[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:46.280]
The East Coast Fisheries are commercial fishers.

[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.500]
They have a fleet of 38 boats that go out every night and come back.

[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.900]
We're getting all.

[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.680]
The good one word goes.

[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.560]
I think I'll speak just dark.

[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.800]
Did man be louder?

[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:22.360]
칠 dinner scene when talking about

[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.740]
the generation.

[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.340]
Ian or Christian.

[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.300]
Do you arrange on like a.

[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.020]
That's what the author is.

[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.800]
It just goes, huh, huh, forever.

[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.800]
How much will you offer for pain?

[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.220]
I need taking a presentation.

[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.200]
Wish we could hear what we all say.

[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.460]
I'm not here to be seen.

[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.040]
Wait, you're all for porn and cake.

[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.440]
Just wanting a maceration.

[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.000]
Talking about degeneration.

[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.500]
It's degeneration.

[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.480]
It's degeneration, baby.

[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:25.040]
It's degeneration, Baby

[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.360]
It's degeneration

[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.520]
Baby, mates, keep preaching.

[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.580]
Talking about my association.

[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.520]
I'll give you.

[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:42.400]
Talking about yay

[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.080]
What's every quarter in the sun, right?

[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.020]
Is it over?

[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.040]
It's finally over.

[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.740]
Love it's shocking.

[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:57.960]
Anyway, it's as low as first movie in two years, ironically called Bad Influenza,

[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.740]
getting pulled towards building this summer.

[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.900]
Oh boy, talk about a hype job, huh?

[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.460]
Well, anyway, I guess this puts to rest all those ugly rumors about Rob being not even

[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:08.380]
as butchers sell many.

[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.880]
I guess he turns out to be a real viral, all-American red-blooded guy.

[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:12.700]
A surprise.

[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:13.180]
Yeah.

[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.220]
So he's okay and everybody's booked now, huh?

[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:15.800]
Yeah.

[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.220]
Even though he's having sex with minors, he's okay.

[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.060]
Let's see, Royal Castle's later.

[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.660]
What does that mean?

[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.800]
What kind of a message is that?

[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.100]
Royal Castle with an L.

[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:29.860]
Soon.

[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.320]
Oh, they're coming with food?

[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.480]
Oh my God, how do you like that?

[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.100]
Really?

[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.040]
Isn't that incredible?

[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:35.840]
It is incredible.

[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:36.960]
Probably their day off.

[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.780]
They're open 365 days a year.

[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.120]
They work 24 hours a day.

[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:46.800]
They're even open on a holidays and the Arnold's have probably dragged themselves off the floor

[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:52.300]
because they work so hard to schlep over or send over a bunch of those great little Royal Castle books.

[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:52.980]
Incredible.

[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:53.560]
You're amazing.

[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.420]
Oh God.

[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.220]
Well, listen, you know, when you beg real hard, although it doesn't always work.

[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.180]
19 past 11, it depends on what you're begging for.

[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.040]
Yeah, it is.

[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.280]
Miami, hello.

[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.500]
Neil, how are you doing?

[00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:04.940]
Great.

[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.120]
I got a question then.

[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:11.580]
You are not in competition with Steve to see who can feel like the most blockbuster video card.

[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.100]
What?

[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.320]
Steve came with me yesterday.

[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.140]
You're in competition with him to collect video cards for blockbuster, right?

[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.480]
No, I've dropped out, sir.

[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.600]
I don't want anything to do with it.

[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.960]
So that means you don't want my blockbuster video card for Oklahoma City?

[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:25.360]

[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:25.540]
Keep it.

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.260]
No, send it to from Oklahoma City?

[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:27.640]
Right.

[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:29.980]
You don't want that, right?

[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:30.320]
No.

[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.720]
Okay, and I've been listening to Steve came the best of on Sundays.

[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.140]
Yeah.

[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.560]
And I'm wondering, is there any chance I'm working here standing boom boom on that?

[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:39.220]
Unlikely.

[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.080]
Unlikely?

[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:40.400]
Yeah.

[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:45.420]
And I have one more, I heard a rumor that someone found a video with Rob Lowe, River Phoenix,

[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.500]
and Marty, is that true?

[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.580]
I think that's more likely.

[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.240]
Okay.

[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.260]
Okay, good luck to you.

[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:49.900]
Yeah, the good one.

[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.660]
Okay, boy, that's glad that guy got out of Oklahoma City.

[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:58.820]
20 past 11 at WIOD, we have, that must be one of those heterophobics that Stan used to talk about.

[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.060]
Do you ever hear that line of his?

[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.160]
Oh, that's right.

[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.400]
And tropomics.

[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:02.920]
Yeah.

[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.640]
Anybody who didn't like Stan's show was a heterophobics.

[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.060]
Which I'm not sure I know what that is, but Stan, Stan's got a wild imagination.

[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.840]
In fact, we don't know who the other guy was who came in and watched all of this.

[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.640]
Okay, who observed?

[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:17.640]
That's right.

[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.440]
So just keep an open mind on that.

[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.740]
So anyway, the guy from, well, he's not from West Palm.

[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.380]
If I say that, it'll change his mind.

[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.180]
A guy who is like a captive up in West Palm with his girlfriend visiting.

[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.940]
Is bringing that tape 20 minutes of it.

[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.960]
I think that should be enough.

[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.220]
Shouldn't it?

[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.440]
Oh, I think about double shot.

[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:39.420]
See, I'm reading that and I know, I know they used that word just to titulate their readers.

[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:39.960]
Oh, okay.

[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.680]
It shows low performing shocking acts with a female while another man looks on.

[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.080]
I just don't understand that.

[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:47.680]
What does that mean?

[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:50.260]
Like, is he burning cigarette holes into her flesh?

[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.980]
I don't, maybe I'm just too jaded over the years.

[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.940]
I don't know what sex act could be shocking.

[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:56.300]
You?

[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.820]
I can't think of it.

[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.480]
No, but I'm sure if anybody could rob can.

[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:01.440]
Okay.

[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.380]
Maybe too many movies with Andrew McCarthy.

[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.280]
Is that possible?

[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.480]
That could do it to you.

[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:08.680]
It's 21 past 11 at WIOD.

[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:13.660]
But once we have the evidence, so in fact, what we could do, we could steal Disney's VCR.

[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.440]
We could bring it in here and hook it up to little TV.

[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:20.820]
And we could screen it on the air and watch it together.

[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:25.180]
And of course, we'd have to be very careful about what we did, you know, how we do a play by play.

[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.900]
Boy, Gary has one in his office too.

[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.180]
Oh, but boy, better yet.

[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:30.780]
We steal boy.

[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.640]
Wouldn't want to steal Disney's because he gets real uptight.

[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.340]
Like Gary has one.

[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.060]
He's still boy, Gary's because he's never here anyway.

[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.820]
Like one day when they're out playing golf like me.

[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:38.280]

[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.460]
Can you believe it?

[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.460]
These douchebags, they take off a three and a half day.

[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.260]
They all leave like midday on Friday, get out as early as they can.

[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.000]
They got three stinking solid days.

[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.200]
While we're sitting here sweating our brains out with no AC.

[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.860]
And then they come back for one day and out of the day, they got their golf clothes on.

[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:55.780]
Like they're going out to play golf all day, okay?

[00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.020]
Well, probably a real heavy lot of power meetings yesterday.

[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.400]
Power breakfast.

[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.260]
Oh, man, I'm telling you.

[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:03.980]
It's pathetic.

[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.120]
And to think that these people like control our destiny, they control our lives.

[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.980]
You know, I think boom boom is radio incarnate.

[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:12.300]
Don't you?

[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:15.700]
He's like the definitive radio beat up douchebag.

[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.200]
Don't knock boom boom, okay? He's okay.

[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.460]
He didn't always use to be that way.

[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:25.020]
It's 22 past 11 at WIOD Toyota of Hollywood.

[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:25.920]
We're going to be back there.

[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:29.140]
Steve and I, in fact, I'll tell you what, we're going to be there on the 24th of June.

[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.540]
That's this week's the third.

[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.780]
So it's like 310 73 weeks from Saturday, right?

[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:39.640]
On June 24th at Toyota of Hollywood, where we are every five, six, seven weeks we go back.

[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.740]
And you're going to be there too this time, whether they know it or not.

[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:42.680]
You're going to be a part of that.

[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:43.920]
Oh, oh, yes.

[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.700]
And anyway, they're going to have those great deals on the fact.

[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.240]
We got some surprises coming up, which we can't tell you about yet.

[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.480]
But we're going to have all kinds of great prizes to give away.

[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.840]
I mean, some really not, you know, we're not going to be selling Neil Rogers t-shirts anymore.

[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.500]
We're going to be giving some really good stuff away.

[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.700]
And hope to really get a big crowd out there.

[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:03.360]
And in addition, people can bring their cut-up cards to Steve.

[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.200]
And then they can come over to me and they can, I'll paste them together.

[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.500]
How is that sound?

[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:10.580]
Well, anyway, now is the time to buy.

[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.360]
I don't have to wait till the 24th because the dog days of summer are really here.

[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:17.240]
I mean, everybody's in the doldrums and people are just not buying cars.

[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:23.920]
And as a result, they are slashing humongous amounts off the prices on a great selection of beautiful 89 Toyota's

[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.080]
that you already know by now.

[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.920]
I hope that they've got waiting for you over there.

[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:33.480]
So if you've been shopping around or thinking about a camera for the family or a Toyota Supra or an MR2 for the little sports car,

[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:40.760]
whatever, whichever the Toyota you want to or a Toyota pickup truck, which is rated by the way number one in the country by Motor Trend Magazine, now is the time to buy.

[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.460]
Great factory rebates, tremendous deals.

[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.460]
And of course, the same nice knowledgeable salespeople that you always do business with at Toyota of Hollywood on 441

[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:50.960]

[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.600]

[00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:01.120]
I would never have asked because they were just here on Monday. I know it's not their fault that I was sick and I couldn't eat any of them

[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:33.920]
Now what do you think about that lie where it says he was performing shocking acts with the female?

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.140]
Do you understand that? Yeah, well, it's a shocking act I guess

[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:44.220]
Well, maybe maybe maybe the fact that it was him that was doing it they were shocked by okay, because a lot of us have had our doubts

[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:49.900]
Yeah, a lot of us have had serious doubts. Yeah, I guess so I got you bumper sticker yesterday from char hot

27 past 11 at W I O D an open line and brown where we want to just want to keep these lines smoking today

[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:39.680]
You know put on an act like you really care. We know you don't but just pretend all right like roblo

[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:44.840]
And don't forget Steve's doing a whole what does he calling it tomorrow? He reviews the roblo tape

[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.920]
So he must have it or else he's getting it from what I don't really care. I'm not in a contest

[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.100]
I just want to make sure that we have our own copy right okay

[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:57.500]
That we can kind of look at in slow-mo and freeze frame and just to make sure that you know things are what they claim they are

[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.360]
Yeah

[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:05.740]
Scientific sort of exactly strictly journalistic research. I want you to understand that because I have no interest in seeing roblo

[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:12.160]
Naked doing incredible in fact if you've seen any of his movies he already simulated that in every one of them already right

[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.140]
Now the one where he and Andrew McCarthy

[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.620]
Let's go to sunrise. Hello. Yeah, how you doing? Okay?

[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.300]
You're

[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.760]
Fascination it's great. I love it, but now it's June time for the June

[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:36.360]
No sir don't don't start them when you feel you this is a real that we've been doing all this without Dawson and

[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.660]
Sandberg missed a couple of games and they still one they got a real ball club

[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.540]
You know and even even the last two days when they've left all these runners on bay

[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.360]
They should have had six seven runs last night and they had a

[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.220]
Pormatics man had a pitches guts out and then sit in the dugout and watch Williams nearly give it away again

[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:54.320]
But when Dawson comes back it's gonna and and how about your own Walton?

[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.840]
He's also been out for about a month

[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.860]
He's coming back next week now the bad news is sir. Wait a minute

[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:05.700]
The bad news is that Mitch Webster's off the disabled list and he got in the game tonight to go and struck out

[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:10.780]
I want to really thank you for honoring my request that we have a day off from this

[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.980]
Thank you very much if we can give Mitch Webster to the best we don't want anything a return great

[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:21.860]
Just if the mess will take Mitch Webster that would mean a lot to me and now but after 20 years of rooting for me kind of get used to

[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.420]
This month of June, I understand

[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.100]
I don't watch that up for all the cause you might get from that fan

[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:32.140]
I let me tell you after watching the meds last night in their 10 to 3 loss to the Giants

[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:36.240]
I don't think they're gonna have any period of the season when they're gonna have it in a chance to call

[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.420]
You know, in other words the Cubs may not do it the team I'm worried about is Montreal now that they got Langston Montreal's tough

[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:46.900]
But to forget the meds the meds are in fact the only thing I care about is the Cubs finish your head of the meds

[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.600]
Okay, in other words if we finish fifth as long as the meds finish last I'll be happy

[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.920]
You know no matter what other thing miss it is Rob low tape only 20 minutes long

[01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.480]
Well how shocking can you get in 20 minutes fight if I only gave my wife 20 minutes

[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.900]
The only thing to get shocked would be me. Yeah. Well see that's about as much as Rob

[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:06.820]
You know, that's about all he had in him

[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.220]
And laughing my drip

[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.400]
One way to draw a lot of people to tell you on a place there. Yeah, I guess that tape tomorrow

[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.180]
Make a few thousand copies and about oh

[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.260]
Yeah, I'm sure that would go over real big. Okay

[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:23.260]
Listen, I'll see you in Wrigley Field sir. All right. Good luck to you. Yeah, that would go over real big

[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:28.040]
I just can't imagine who would be excited about that 11 30 at WIOD

[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.240]

[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.540]
oh i think

[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.740]
you already was a step ahead of them i think so too

[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:26.180]
you think we could consider her a uh...

[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.120]
a low-bound provocateur could be

[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.540]
can i say one thing about the game well if it's is

[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:31.700]
well i was good

[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.860]
yeah eleven thirty three at w i the same you was he was right on the edge there

[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:38.680]
with the other but then he just went nuts you know another big steve came

[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.040]
for him

[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.260]
but if we didn't ask him but a call in a rip steve today but about the blockbuster

[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.140]
thing if you have an opinion one way or the other that's fine you know

[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.800]
but i'm not gonna change my mind again i just don't agree because i think that

[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.760]
there's uh... you know it's a generalization you know blanket generalization

[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.940]
and there's some independent franchise people who are gonna get

[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.180]
hurt in the thing

[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.600]
and i just don't think it's that big of a similist i mean you know if there was

[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.240]
some real cost of like the farm store thing i agree with them wholeheartedly

[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.120]
you know that was a concerted effort by group of people to boycott them and

[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:08.460]
try to

[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.620]
force a whole bunch of material out of their stores because those people want

[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.660]
dictate public taste in public morality

[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.980]
the right wing lunatic fringe i totally agree on that and really pisses me off

[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:21.480]
yeah one point yesterday was speechless when i started thinking about this

[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:21.640]
thing

[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.240]
but now i realize i was getting

[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.540]
con that would do that the great con job that steve does so well he was

[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:30.340]
kind of me into this thing and i'd say it's not my deal you know

[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:34.480]
he knew i think to it he's a uh... major provocateur the master

[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.400]
i will have an open line in date at seven five one nine four six three seven five

[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.760]

don't be don't be some kind of a sicko fan some kind of a

[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.520]
underling who just every time somebody gets on the air and snaps their fingers you

[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.340]
know and you do some idiotic ridiculous thing that you know isn't right but you

[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:10.920]
do because somebody else said don't be a follower okay you morons

[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.280]
i we haven't gotten any mail yet because they're busy playing golf today but if i

[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.640]
get any of those cards in it i'm gonna be really pissed okay i really yeah

[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.140]
and i i confess i admit full fault full guilt i admit it i got i don't know i

[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.820]
when he sat down and tried to talk me out i thought to myself why is he wasting

[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:31.300]
his time it's never gonna happen and within forty five seconds he had me

[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:36.500]
changing my mind the heat wasn't that it i had toward the end of the show i was

[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.760]
almost about to pass yeah i think he took advantage of the fact that we've

[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.820]
been here two days in a row under tremendous heat i'd been sick of cell on

[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.080]
Monday and i had no sales resistance at all

[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:49.040]
yeah because they just know and i just don't agree okay i just do not agree

[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.960]
with them i think it's it's pathetic but be like my opening up the

[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:57.640]
the newspaper and reading just the most minimal thing that i didn't like about

[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.340]
something that some business did and then conducted now for example years ago

[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:05.480]
i cut up my bird i in car because they they donated fifty thousand dollars to

[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.020]
the anti casino gambling people really and the reason that all the department the

[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.700]
big department store chains were doing that is because they didn't want all those

[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.400]
people that work for peanuts in their department stores to be able to get much

[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.720]
in higher paying jobs and casinos really okay that was the only reason not

[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.820]
because they were so concerned about crying i had nothing to do with it they

[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.680]
just didn't want you know a whole new industry coming in here that would take

[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:30.080]
away their tremendous supply of cheap help or for like minimum wage or close to

[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.220]
it and they donated fifty grand to the anti casino well i i tore up my bird

[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.740]
i in car on the air i don't recall that i asked other people to do the same

[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:42.700]
or send their cards but i did it you would remember if you yeah no i don't

[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.060]
think i did i just did it personally because they pissed me off okay and i

[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:50.020]
have never gotten another one since yeah that's fine that's your

[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:54.920]
prerogative yeah i don't like that fine in fact all the anti casino i mean

[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.300]
they're entitled their opinion but the harm that they've done to this

[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.580]
community by their near near neanderthal stance is so embarrassing it's so

[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.980]
grotesque and out for example i was thinking to go

[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.080]
down to the Bahamas this weekend which i i don't like the Bahamas you already

[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.760]
know my feeding about the matter that murk Griffin has got a new place

[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.160]
and they've got their own uh airline and they got their own you don't have to go

[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.920]
through all that crap when you go to the Bahamas you got to go through such

[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.280]
grief at customs man it's enough to make you puke and and if you look at them

[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.180]
cross-eyed they get real hostile and sorry and uh okay you know they start

[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:29.260]
talking with a patoine they give you a real a real song at a day oh you bet they

[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.640]
really i don't like that you know and then and then they're going to take your

[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.700]
money and then fleece you for every dime you've got you know but the supposedly

[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.720]
murk Griffin new place but and then i was i was thinking of myself where i don't

[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.220]
you know it's like a few minutes away and there's like nowhere to get there

[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:46.100]
now and the only reason those and i know we have a lot of listeners over there

[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.520]
and you folks should be laughing every minute okay because you wouldn't have one

[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.200]
tourist on your stinkin islands over there if we had gambling here in his town

[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.240]
you wouldn't have even the dumbest of the dumb wouldn't come there okay

[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.200]
we got better beaches we got the same climate we do have air conditioning

[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:05.760]
uh when it works of course we do have air conditioning man when i walked into that hotel uh

[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.660]
that elevator i can never get over it man the shaggy dog carpet it was so wet you think that

[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:15.720]
somebody gave it a bath man it just smelled the mildew odor was so incredible

[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:21.000]
you almost passed out no air conditioning and i thought when i got into bed that first night i

[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.420]
thought isn't it nice they washed the sheets too bad they didn't dry on it they were so the

[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:32.440]
sheets were soaked oh my god how can i saw either either it's the humidity or rob lozban here one

[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:37.600]
of the other how can you sleep no air conditioning to sleep no oh air conditioning period

[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.760]
god didn't have a little fan nothing

[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.260]
haha

[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.940]
worse humidity than here it was incredible oh here's Henry Barrow ladies and gentlemen just got

[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:55.500]
an inspiration what is that generic oh great what did you find this oh the head he's got

[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:00.020]
things hidden he's got her in a whole show round today why are so many people listening to the

[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:05.580]
bill Mcwigs show one reason is guests like dr. Robert Ballard the man who led the expedition that

[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:11.020]
found the Titanic and often's owner Joe Robbie an Academy Award winning actress patty dude

[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:16.820]
another reason is so far we haven't told a single caller to get off the phone you

[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:22.520]
preton won't you tell a friend the bill Mcwigs show a great way to wind down from the morning rush

[01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:42.280]
you know for a nice Jewish kid I don't I don't think he was like that when he came here I think

[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.340]
it's Sharon it's influencing him period he's saying incredible things lately 10 minutes past noon

[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:52.320]
a W.I.O.D there's an open line in Broward and one in Boka I just mention that don't feel compelled I

[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.600]

[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:06.860]
Mitch brought us some coats so it really isn't ad here you know this is all a big hype job for Bill

[01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:13.220]
Wise with a picture and everything I mean Jay's come on spike this is pathetic you know what pathetic

[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:21.080]
isn't it just weird talk about contrives surprising but anyway if you're hungry right now I want you

[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:28.860]
to head over to char hut because do you hear that what Andy has been telling Sharon this is like

[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:33.020]
a soap opera here Andy has been saying the Sharon that we've been badmouthing her we haven't

[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:39.300]
said anything that wasn't true I mean when she said that Ross had lips like a duck-built plan

[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:43.880]
I put this disgusting thing like that she deserved to get ripped okay that was the cruelest thing

[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:48.740]
and if he said it it was true I mean that would be cruel but at least it would be true now but

[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:55.860]
Ross is like God okay even though he's not your type what must he think of me well I don't

[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:59.180]
really care what I mean he's a good guy he's got a good sense of humor does anybody know where he

[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:02.060]
goes to school does he go to you of him I don't know I hope he has a good sense of

[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:05.580]
he does have a good sense of humor he would have come in here and popped several people in the mouth

[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:12.580]
on including Sharon no she was hostile and vicious when she said it so she's got the no bones coming

[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:18.740]
well she's like that she rolls along sweet man great she has one of her screaming sessions would

[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.480]
Steve and she takes it out on everybody all day so Andy and he's a great guy we've been

[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:29.060]
trying to keep his job for him going to batting a whole campaign and we feed him of all the people

[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:32.720]
in the newsroom we always make sure Andy gets fed first because we know any meal could be his last

[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:41.580]
and he's bad mouthing us to Sharon how do you like that isn't that embarrassing so from now on

[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:48.140]
Ross comes in first then Jared then Todd then anybody else who's hanging out

[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:55.560]
because Andy's on a diet and we wouldn't want to interfere with we West Palm Beach hello

the unsuspecting you guys get Buffalo style chicken wings right the blue cheese is not for the celery

[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.160]
oh oh well they always say that's a big debate about whether the blue cheese is for the

[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.180]
celery or for the wings it's not it is it's for the wings well I've never I've never tried that

[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:23.820]

this controversial DS constantly like all the other talks of her yeah now I got sick of it a

[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:04.880]
long time ago and everybody else did too and there's some people who pretend they still care about

[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:10.120]
but they don't for example last night I was at my mother's for dinner and we were watching the news

[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:17.480]
and they had this uh was CNN was on and the the newscaster was interviewing some douchebag about

harming I love plantay you know you must love the police department too they're just fine officers they

[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:31.180]
take it to the man of and he is the first one for being guilty of an obscurity a loose and obscurity

[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:38.000]
excuse me tongue twister but no they he was doing a tongue twister yeah but the plant it's

[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.700]
robbed low the plantation police proud of their first obscurity conviction in the county the news spread

[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:51.020]
so quickly that this gentleman started getting phone calls from the television news stations etc good

[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:55.220]
it'll probably be on more republic pretty soon and make a million bucks well the young man just

[01:42:55.220 --> 01:43:00.460]
pulled up to a stoplight and they ticket him and the police uh he said to the officer he'll peel it

[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:05.940]
off but uh it costs him sixty five dollars and plantations finest are really proud of it well that's

[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:09.120]
great i'm glad i'm glad that you're doing something to protect all of us over there okay

[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.760]
hopefully that's your tip because they do have one of the uh they have more breaking and entering

[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:18.000]
in plantation than under the other uh the municipality so i was told i don't know anyway listen have a

[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.780]
great life okay see uh what was he talking about i didn't i didn't i'm stupid to start out he was saying

[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:26.840]
about isn't it great that we don't talk about all these seriously pressing things and then he was

[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.140]
talking about the plantation police i mean he was a good guy but i just it seems like there was a

[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:36.140]
little contradiction there wasn't there yeah because that was pretty depressing i lost it in fact

[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:41.200]
they may come and arrest him for a um and obscene phone call the one he just made here

[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:48.060]
hmm oh that was good i just found a little onion on the roblo's picture lucky well i guess none of us

[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:52.340]
are ever going to be able to look at roblo again straight in the face and um see i don't believe any

[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.980]
of it i still believe it's all a gigantic publicity stunt it's all but orchestrated it could be

[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:01.400]
i mean even he's not that stupid that he's going to do something like this by accident they're

[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:05.100]
going to be all as mag gigantic publicity you know get a big name lawyers will come in there

[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:09.580]
and then the girl will admit that she had a phony idea and that she wanted whatever was going on you

[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:13.740]
and that'll be it i see you know slap him on the wrist they'll make him do four hundred

[01:44:13.740 --> 01:44:17.860]
hours of community service uh over in Beverly Hills you know pay a fine

[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:22.660]
to have to stand on a corner there on um hollywood and vine and hand out street maps of the

[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:27.880]
celebrity houses for free i'd see your point yeah see what you're saying and it's working like charm

[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:32.740]
boy yeah that be the you know because his last movie was a bum we started this a while ago we got

[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:37.800]
sidetrack this is the heavy duty story and uh he's been like lagging you know he was in a

[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.860]
low there so now he needed to get back on a front page isn't this a way to do it boy did he's

[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:50.300]
oh sure he's everywhere credible he's like stink on um yeah mong and the media just eats this up

[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:59.520]
mm-hmm so to speak performing shocking acts with a female while another man looks on it is um

[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.780]
and i think again it's within the context of his image i think any act with a female for

[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:08.880]
to be shocking that that's i still believe that i he'd he'd have to do it in front of me i'd

[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:14.220]
have to be the man watching to believe it okay okay i just am not convinced all right in fact maybe

[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:22.000]
we could set that up twenty twenty three past noon at w one of these and amazing we're going to do

[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.160]
the melting pot next because i was just thinking of roblo at the pod having dessert with a white

[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:30.720]
chocolate with amaretto and when it came time for everybody to dip their banana in a white chocolate

[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:36.400]
i wonder just what roblo's excuse would be huh would he give us the same lame excuse that michael

[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:43.560]
j fox gave oh no i don't know only only a real experience i guess could prove it anyway if you

[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:47.720]
want a great dining experience tonight then the melting pot is the place for you it's rated three

[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:52.360]
and a half stars by the herald of all people and you know those fakers at the herald men they

[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:56.020]
are so stingy with their stars they hang on to them like it was life and death you think that

[01:45:56.020 --> 01:46:01.400]
dick capins very existence hinged on those stars that's how they squeeze them as tight as they can

[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:05.300]
but they hand it out three and a half to the melting pot that's about as close as perfect as you can

[01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:10.300]
get it's also rated as one of the top ten restaurants but i'm gonna give it a try i still got

[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:14.680]
these stupid headphones on i was gonna i was gonna let the audience in on what sandy requisition

[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.860]
yesterday that we were supposed to take home but i was a little bit short here

[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:44.520]
on four hello hello yes meal yeah i just wanted to clarify with the bird said just say when you

[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:50.860]
mentioned about russ what he thought about ross ross ross is his exact words were he's more your

[01:56:50.860 --> 01:57:01.500]
type than mine and then he said what does that mean is that really what i said yeah exactly well what

[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:06.340]
yeah you don't know in other words in other words it begs the question what does that mean right

[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:10.940]
and i don't think we've had an answer have we not yet we've had an answer but i don't think it's

[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:15.400]
the right answer yeah we've had an excuse we've had a cover up but i don't think it's right now

[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:19.700]
we need to bring more e-pupig down here to get the right answer i think you guys have to do what

[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:25.600]
we you taught me long time ago consider the source i think that's the key to this whole thing

[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:31.860]
consider the source exactly yeah it sounds like a screen to me yeah it sounds like a lot of

[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:38.700]
smoke now i have one prediction here yeah i predict by the end of the year the bird will be sports

[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:46.620]
intensive because little by little if you hear your recordings day after day yeah there's

[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:51.560]
no question more involved yeah he is you're right he's with the horse racing first he hated that

[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:56.700]
with a pan and now he's like he's obsessed now he even watches now he's not going to have that

[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:02.700]
as well oh the race is the replays on sunshine and i don't get that's how obsessed he is with horses now

[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:07.720]
often i do the end of the year now when is now when are you in rich and i going to go out to

sports program they worked all yeah they they invited him as a matter of they did they

[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:37.560]

[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:41.060]
i was gonna say he didn't want to show him up he didn't want to get in that view of what they're

[01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:45.100]

[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:50.080]
so close oh a talk up car maybe by far the most significant problem facing man today is the

[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.520]
production of food and fiber to meet the necessities of life even with the so-called food surpluses

[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.440]
that currently have plagued the United States and the western world if all the food in the world

[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:03.220]
were equally distributed among all the people in the world we would all be in a state of starvation

[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:10.060]
means somebody cheating somewhere i think we're the ones do let me just pass eleven years Bobby

[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:15.080]
Dare dream lover that's not a bad now we got to try that again it's a very classic program for the

yeah

[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:34.720]
gets me every time every time it is just as amazing as the first time i don't think shocking is

[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:40.540]
the thing not even close to describe that card you know what it is so embarrassing that it's just

[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:47.760]
humiliating and degrading and um mesmerizing even though i've played it a hundred times man every

[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:52.620]
time i still can't believe it every time i don't oh what an honor we get to call it day early from

[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:56.600]
mister a kvetsho over here what do you want i'll tell you what i'm going to do i'm going to cut up my

[02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:02.620]
underwear send them to steve k there you go i made the mistake all you ladies out there in the

[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:06.160]
audience cut up your panties and send them to steve okay i'm sure you'd enjoy it a lot more than

[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:11.860]
your blockbuster card he went on and on about this pumpkin head yeah and i went out and rented it

[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:17.840]
it had to be the worst rip off harm i never heard of it i never heard i mean i've heard of it but

[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.960]
i never heard anybody else talk about it sucked really it sucked that would be all the more reason

[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.980]
to cut up any card or any underwear but anyway let's deal with everybody picking on Glenn

[02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:34.920]
yeah and everybody's pan on glen didn't you hear that show yesterday no i missed you well if you

[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:40.320]
heard the show yes yes he's trying to slip out of this no i was talking about Ross our one of our

[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.800]
fine interns in the newsroom what happens to be at incredible wonderful guy a young

[02:02:45.340 --> 02:02:50.620]
college student he has a nice guy and he's great looking guy i mean just on a scale of 10 i give

[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:55.020]
about an 82 okay he's a terrific looking guy and of course Sharon made these terrible insults

[02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:59.660]
yet they said he had lips like a flat-billed douchebag platypus or something like and we got that

[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:03.700]
all squared away and then i made some comment yesterday about Ross when he'd come in here for lunch

[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:09.720]
and the bird said well he's more your time he's not my type and i said what does that mean

[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:16.120]
wow now since you are taking up the role here in defending him you want to explain that to me

[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:24.260]
well to me it sounds like he turned Sharon down to begin with oh don't you mean Ross oh yeah

[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:28.060]
i got news for you Sharon couldn't get near his puppet okay that's what that

[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:32.760]
because Sharon is obsessed with him she really is she's just obsessed with him i saw her crawling

[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.920]
on her hands and he's trying to get near him and he just like walks by in a lamp so that's why

[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.140]
she made those disgusting comment could see her philosophies if you can't get it

[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:43.740]
rip it yeah you know what i mean in other words pretend you don't want it

[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:49.700]
probably something Arlene would write yeah yeah but anyway i i can understand but we try to get

[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:55.800]
Arlene in the building but so all of it you horn wasn't big enough all of this Paul's i just

[02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:59.840]
didn't choose my words carefully enough which you have to do right what it was a slip of the

[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.300]
tongue was a Freudian slip and the whole audience is in an upper right there we're talking about

[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.220]
this at the water cooler all day as today flip at the tongue and when i got home i was getting phone

[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:12.540]
calls and fattening called breathlessly and everybody was just up in arms and i think there's more

[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:16.740]
than this than meets the father isn't i was just trying to say something else because that for

[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:21.400]
example if i if uh Phoebe Kates came walking in here god forbid because that would be the end of

[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.660]
the show but she came walking in i wouldn't say she's cute but she's not my type

[02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:30.060]
i would say she's cute well i'm kind of like today remember the script for the Phoebe Kates look

[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:34.860]
like came in there yeah how could we forget and everybody was agreeable yeah there were no cuts

[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:40.140]
that's right everything went smooth you're missing my point yeah okay well maybe she did too

[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:47.820]
but anyway have a nice day good night that cleared up nothing yeah well listen if i was in trouble if

[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:52.100]
i dug a hole for myself i can't think of anyone in the world i'd rather have come to my defense

[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:59.940]
from Paul Harvey Jr okay i think you got real problems now we have an open line in date 751946

pure toy that you know that's how quiet it is i mean this is ridiculous okay and they got some nerve

[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:20.920]
they probably were upset because i went home sick on monday that's it yeah they probably were

[02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:24.780]
piot about they probably had a couple of executive meetings well better not let them do that again

[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:31.820]

all over your radio dog come on down with it we're gonna get down tonight we're gonna

[02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:34.300]
get groovy it's not a taboo but what they held up on talking about

[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:51.460]
if you if you held a gun to my head if you offered 50 million dollars we couldn't do that again

[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:55.440]
in the history you people i hit it did you see what happened i hit it and then i screwed up and i

[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:59.600]
hit the wrong button yeah and then i hit it again to queue up the record i just started it

[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.100]
i would never heard this card before and he still can do it what is that the old one i never heard

[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:10.780]
this card he just brought this in here it just brought the card in here and he it was perfect i

[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:17.200]
mean it wasn't close really nailed it oh nailed it beauty i i don't think i can continue i'm

it where gets tossed around loosely with that yeah we're shocking okay roblo and a sex act

[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:41.500]
being close but this was shocking that was incredible i think the circle may make a comeback now

[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:48.120]
after that okay spike wise may start playing the circle after here and that was boy completed

[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:54.020]

and he's birthday we forgot and we forgot i never would have done that i just saved it for tomorrow

[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:41.480]
and his birthday cake is delicious so happy birthday and he and also Todd was there in the

[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:45.520]
newsroom with Jared and everybody else working away feverishly actually Todd wasn't doing a damn thing

[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:51.560]
it was it our time and he said what happened to you the other day i said i got sick

[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:58.060]
and he said oh i thought you got overheated and i said Todd would have had a been on today when

[02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:03.740]
Ross was here that i got overheated and i don't think you know was he okay though about time

[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:07.600]
i don't think he liked that i think there's some kind of competition going on in here you know

[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:11.940]
that good luck to him although Todd does look very good today which is why of course he didn't come

[02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:15.800]
in here because we don't have any more food by the time he came in the burgers were all gone so he

[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:21.300]
he like didn't come in to say hi did he no are you guys okay can i do anything and i get you

[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:27.280]
you know like anything i noticed that didn't come anywhere near no interest no food no interest now

[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.920]
i remember the one day remember Ross came in he had that paper what was the thing new times or

[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:37.220]
something that actually had to do with a show wasn't that incredibly no we had already had it still

[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:41.600]
yeah it had to do with anything like right over here and handed to me is it kind of like

[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:47.060]
well i didn't sit on my lap but close to it he got close to you close i saw i noticed not close

[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:51.940]
enough but close i watched so anyway Todd you're just now look at that sandy smiling and laughing

[02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:55.440]
and to go falling out there because she knows that she didn't do anything wrong yes it wasn't your

[02:15:55.440 --> 02:16:00.860]
fault it was that troublemaker sharing again or Laura one of those troublemakers we got so many

[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:07.300]
the best news of all oh guess who heard the rickie tiki talk yes theme season i ran it to

[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:11.360]
courses done all his great work he just i'll drill and you know the most incredible part

[02:16:12.020 --> 02:16:17.640]
there's more what there's more i don't believe with though well i've had i didn't even know that

[02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:23.040]
the great dogs on your great radio stages hey it's the rock and roll baby

[02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:34.420]
what a card now that's a card you can't miss card yeah just a matter where you started

[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:38.540]
because i thought it was over but i stopped it just to be sure before and there's more

[02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:44.900]
and he did it again he completed his thought as harry would say he did it again there may be more

[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:52.320]
on there could be more what goes on and on and on i ran into him downstairs he said he had heard

[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.700]
that he was just thrilled yeah i hope he heard that because that was probably did when we thought you

[02:16:56.700 --> 02:17:03.580]
could never do it again that rickie never sell him short okay we used to say that about tonne

[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:11.780]
denberg but no more okay we got an open line in bokeh two two two on a w i o d two seven eight nine

[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:35.340]
okay in fact ross is here tomorrow i wonder if ross would like to go to the track with us next

[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:45.980]
through the with that change your mind would you be intimidated if he said yes well i would assume

[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:51.700]
that he has other things like this cool or go to school he's not going to go but i just said it

[02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:56.740]
to see if i get a reaction to you just to make me crazy sure enough sure enough why would that make a

[02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:02.120]
difference to you why is everyone looking for trouble today you could kind of hang out with fat

[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:06.520]
rich and all hang out with ross that sounds like a great match up to me it'd be okay with me

[02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:12.200]
and you noticed Todd still didn't come in to say hi you're a far from you it's right everybody is

[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:16.280]
it lead maybe he doesn't mean it but he puts on the pre i think he does mean it puts on the pretense

[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:22.040]
of caring about this show and about us but Todd he makes it very clear that he don't have any idea

[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:26.660]
what's going on in here and couldn't care less and if we got some free child he's ready for it okay

[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:31.780]
if we beg hard enough he might come in here that's all right Todd we understand we don't take it

[02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:35.720]
personally okay because i know you got a lot of important things to do with jirat in the newsroom

[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:42.720]

[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:19.760]

[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:25.640]
uh tomorrow there's a horse in the seventh oh jeez what is it dikes image yeah i know that

[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:30.480]

[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:14.160]
own jingle first here's just something i was going back to the track maybe we could have

[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:21.400]
filled saltman inside a source man a couple of days ago apparently a horse lost a race and the

[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.620]
trainer was so upset with the horse that the trainer went up and punched his horse in the face

[02:23:26.860 --> 02:23:32.500]
trooper don't be like that that's pretty funny well yeah if you weren't if you were the horse

[02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:37.180]
you're gonna be like it's not funny it's pathetic exactly so that did happen maybe we can find

[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:41.740]
out from fill if he can find out if but any action was taken against the trainer or the horse

[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:46.660]
horse yeah horse was suspended for running too slow

[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:54.440]
the two the next two things here kind of like go hand in hand if i hate to admit this but that

[02:23:54.440 --> 02:24:00.380]
was a porn movie that i saw not too many weeks ago oh the one with rob low in it well no i hear

[02:24:00.380 --> 02:24:06.320]
they're selling in the blockbuster and i swear to you this is true there's a female porn

[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:14.980]
oh star that resemble a strong resemblance to our friend oh sandy i don't know you know maybe if

[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:20.480]
she's looking for other career moves here but trust me Steve can probably verify this story

[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:30.360]
yes Steve would know because he's seen every one of them exactly i've only seen two out of

[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:35.160]
when you get that rob low tape yeah and you review it for us yeah we're gonna have you

[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:31.000]

[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.840]
had no CD in the machine you took you know i had it in the inner but i punched it up to cut five i

[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:39.920]
started it and i hit the pause button the play button it went back to one there's always one

[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:44.500]
I had to punch up oh five again hit it on pause to get it cute up and then i started it just

[02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:50.180]
anywhere as we never heard this cart before okay and then through the miracle of that blue cap man

[02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:53.920]
the guy just comes through a lot i can't believe it boy that car is probably gonna get worn out

[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:58.780]
probably have to have several copies of that that that's a classic they'll be asking to borrow that

[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:04.420]
on stations all over this market you know the man himself might actually want to hear that you know

[02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:09.320]
