[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]
I'm a cup man. I know bud man. I trust you are too.

[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.940]
Hey, way back. Might be out of here.

[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.260]
Hey, hey, hey, hey. He's giving again.

[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.440]
Oh, my God. Look, David's eyes. Holy cow.

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.880]
Yeah, what is it? Is it on the tape? I like this. He saves time.

[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.320]
I never noticed that there's two things at once.

[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.960]
Well, it's not as good as that sports actuality that Joe played on the 10 of sports.

[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.640]
Sir. That was really good. I don't get hysterical, Joe. It's just a ball game.

[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.200]
Okay, 1006 at WIOD. It's a Thursday. And I'm curious is today like

[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.660]
um, payday for everybody. Boy, you're low down in your

[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.300]
chair. I told you that. I told you this chip is on the floor. God,

[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.320]
you're so low. Yeah. Well, I'm going to bring me back down to Earth.

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.380]
The numbers came out. We went up again a little bit. They just try to bring me back to Earth.

[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.580]
I don't know if you're going to get paid today. And I heard some rumblings about it over here.

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.120]
Because nobody's going to be here tomorrow. Are they?

[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.100]
Of course not. I'm not coming in if we have a whole bunch of people tomorrow.

[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.500]
Now today we got natural eats is bringing food and the course fat

[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.260]
riches here every Thursday. So just by coincidence, he happens to be here.

[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.120]
That's good. I'm curious what this is. Hi, ladies and gentlemen. I'm ready to broadcast.

[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.360]
I love myself.

[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.720]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.280]
It's the kernel.

[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.520]
Isn't it?

[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.780]
Ricky Tiki.

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.320]
Looking for a pillow.

[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.280]
I wonder he's related to the Boka puke at all.

[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840]
What happened to the thing we got yesterday that new card?

[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.080]
The thing. Boy, that better be in here. I'm going to be crazy.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.100]
Oh, you're trying to find something in here, man. Looking like looking for a haystack in a needle.

[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.540]
The one from Mitch? Yeah.

[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.180]
What's it called? It's called just exactly what it says.

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.760]
Now that card better be in here and it better be here quick.

[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.680]
Nice reading, by the way, from Mitch. The greatest.

[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.220]
You could tell there was a lot behind it. Oh, boy. Here we go.

[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.220]
Very sincere. Here we go. I haven't even started the show yet.

[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.960]
Oh, here it is. Thank God. Boy, my heart is just bitter-patter.

[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.180]
Is it real? It would.

[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.480]
Sales, people are rassholes.

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.920]
Okay, it's 10-8-11. What does it goes without saying?

[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.260]
Okay, now we've got a couple of things here. First of all, our horses are still running from yesterday.

[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.380]
Oh, God.

[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.380]
And you know, you can't win them all. We're going through a cold streak now.

[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.860]
Oh, kind of like the Yankees.

[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.720]
Cherokee Ninja in the first race today.

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.300]
In the first race. Not that it's...

[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.620]
In the first race. In Zalaz, it's 8-5 in the morning line.

[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.460]
Okay. Okay.

[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.260]
So I'm not taking any chances.

[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.600]
That's my pick. I gave you a chance at aristocratic cross today and you passed it up.

[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.060]
I don't want to go with the... You bypassed a lock.

[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.440]
Yeah, that's correct.

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.260]
And you pick touch and feet in the feature in the ninth race with Jose Rivera.

[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.480]
I like it.

[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.480]
Or is that Jungle Jim Rivera? It's one of the other.

[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.200]
A Jungle Jim.

[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.780]
Yeah, Jungle Jim.

[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.980]
Also, here's a little blurb from the paper, a scuffle with political prisoner.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.520]
Roberto Martin Perez has cost Spanish language radio commentator Felipe Rivera, his job.

[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.680]
What?

[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.560]
Another one of Steve's buddies.

[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.300]
Felipe?

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.700]
What do you want, sir?

[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.720]
Yeah.

[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.100]
I got a horse for you.

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.520]
Yeah.

[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.380]
Silky Roman in the fifth.

[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.020]
I love Silky Roman.

[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.140]
A horse is 12-1 in the morning line.

[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.000]
These tips, these hot tips.

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.340]
Okay.

[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.680]
Thank you. Good luck to you.

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.060]

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.900]
Good news, be yours.

[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.300]
Silky Roman with a Roberto Castillo.

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.000]
12-1. Is anybody pick it?

[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.680]
No.

[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.860]
How about that?

[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.300]
The fact that Balmer Vision is Steve is best bet of the day.

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.320]
We're not picking any more horses out of the sun, Central.

[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.840]
To let get somebody making the graded line, a little who's got some clue what's going on over there.

[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800]
That's why we get screwed half the time.

[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.440]
We pick out of the sun, Central.

[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.500]
They got horses like four to one and five to one.

[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.680]
And Phil looks in a program.

[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.220]
They're like 800 to one and a half.

[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.600]
That's true. It's true.

[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.440]
Anyway, Roberto, a commentator on radio suave, was fired after advertisers and listeners complained about his run-in with Martin Perez.

[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.680]
Yeah, he's a wonderful guy.

[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.060]
That Philippe Rivera, wasn't it?

[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.360]
It said he also had a talk show from five to seven PM called the firing a flagrant attack on freedom of speech.

[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.520]
Now, he's a great one to be talking about freedom of speech.

[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.940]
Okay.

[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.300]
One of the worst douchebags in the history of this town.

[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.600]
How he's ever been allowed to be on the air beats a hell out of me, but I'm sure Steve will have him on real soon.

[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.960]
Oh, you will.

[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.100]
Oh, guaranteed.

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.300]
Steve loves him.

[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.620]
Steve loves every douchebag that ever came down to Pike. He's obsessed with.

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.280]
Steve has open phones today, which is good because I mean, at least we get through one more day without a rabbi.

[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.780]
How is my or Kahanah yesterday?

[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.700]
I can't handle the rabbi.

[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.940]
Was he still hawking a trinic?

[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:05.600]
I didn't hear what.

[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.240]
I can't handle the rabbi.

[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.700]
Was he hawking a trinic about the Arabs and a Jews again?

[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.620]
I can't do it.

[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.360]
Because I get the feeling when I listen to him that like the Arabs and Jews don't like each other too well.

[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.140]
Don't you get that feeling?

[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.040]
Which is quite a revelation. That's something really brand new.

[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.980]
Anyway, it's 10 minutes past 10 at WIOD.

[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.860]
I mean, we may or may not be getting paid today.

[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.940]
I just mentioned that in passing because if I'm getting paid, then it's going to require at least three or four people to drag the check-ups to it.

[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.440]
But we'll see.

[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.760]
Because I just think tomorrow is going to be skeleton crew.

[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.260]
Yeah.

[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.240]
And then Monday, of course, nobody will be here.

[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.520]
But Mr. Arnold's coming by with those royal castle burgers on Monday.

[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.060]
Amazing.

[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.600]
And Todd will be here on Monday.

[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.220]
So I know you're happy about that.

[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.380]
Anyway, I don't know what your problem is.

[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.020]
Really, I think we need to examine this.

[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.000]
Look at that. Every line on the board is lit.

[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.440]
Problem about what?

[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.880]
Every line on the board is lit. What the hell did we do?

[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.340]
Is there something going on?

[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.600]
Man, the traffic this morning was brutal.

[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.440]
And you know what it was?

[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.960]
It was jammed up on 95.

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.620]
And then I get to like, Halondale Beach Boulevard.

[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.440]
It's somewhere around there.

[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.860]
And there were a couple of those.

[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.420]
What do they call those orange pickers?

[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.740]
Those big things where the guys are up in the sky and they're doing something with the lines.

[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.460]
And once you get by there, there was no traffic at all.

[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.900]
Now they weren't in the road.

[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.360]
They were like, I'm a side of the road.

[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.380]
But that had traffic.

[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.240]
Just looking, gawking at those idiots had traffic backed up about five miles.

[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.080]
You people out there who think you're a driver, man.

[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.200]
You couldn't drive your finger up your nostril.

[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.320]
Or wherever.

[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.320]
They have no clue how to drive in this town.

[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.940]
The slightest little distraction, man.

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.200]
And you got about a five mile traffic jam.

[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.020]
Apparently these people's lines are so empty.

[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.700]
They're so little going on in their lives that there's the least little thing happens on the road.

[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.360]
It's enough to make me a Jew.

[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.980]
My son.

[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.880]
Major in their life.

[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.820]
Anyway, 12 minutes.

[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.740]
You got to be kidding me.

[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.940]
Dwight Lauderdale.

[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.000]
Huh.

[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.360]
Okay, well, it's a good thing she didn't name a man Bishop.

[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.160]
Anyway, that's just a little thing in the herald.

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.620]
It's not worth repeating, but of course Sharon is scouring the papers trying to find something for Steve to talk.

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.980]
It's 10-15 at W.I.O.D.

[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.880]
Sonny is up in Gainesville, by the way.

[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.680]
So even though you're not going to hear the hurricane game, we'll be getting reports throughout the show.

[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.920]
The game starts 11-30.

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.460]
And we'll keep on the edge of our seats.

[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.500]
Oh, Rufus, what do you want, Rufus?

[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.440]
Hey, Rufus.

[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.720]
How are you doing, Neil?

[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.980]
No, this is Neil Rufus.

[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.700]
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to get a hold of you for three, four days.

[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.340]
What do you want?

[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.880]
Tell you the copies are doing great.

[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.900]
Yeah, I know that already.

[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.320]
I see all the games, Rufus.

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.820]
Everybody.

[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.600]
How about that Greg Maddick's Rufus?

[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.540]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.480]
He's okay in my book.

[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.420]
You like him.

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.480]
Yeah, a lot.

[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.100]
Okay.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.980]
You good picture, too.

[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.160]
Yeah.

[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.220]
Big weekend up here.

[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.020]
And one major problem.

[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.720]
Big weekend is we're going to have the Cherry Pine Cat Fish Festival Saturday.

[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:51.440]
Great.

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.100]
Okay.

[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.040]
Big problem.

[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.660]
You remember I told you, Colt Lisa V. Roy, took that girl out there, revealed to fish fishing?

[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.040]
Yeah.

[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.420]
Well, V. Roy won $1,000 on a scratch off ticket and an artery.

[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.460]
What was he scratching, Rufus?

[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.040]
I don't know, but he had a show bet.

[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.240]
Also, I'm Sonny Sallie.

[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.580]
A show bet, yeah, that's good.

[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.580]
He made somebody.

[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.220]
Yeah, sure.

[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:13.520]
Okay.

[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.840]
And on the other hand, he took the Isabelle.

[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.060]
That was that woman that came up to build the fish fishing and ran off water.

[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:20.900]
Yeah.

[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.180]
And now his wife just came home last night.

[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.320]
And we don't know her years, could you please tell him because he listens to you all the

[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.080]
time, tell V. Roy to come to hell, huh?

[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:29.960]
Yeah, okay.

[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:30.900]
Come on, Nia.

[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.860]
Whatever you say, Rufus.

[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.440]
Please, Nia.

[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.980]
Whatever you say.

[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.660]
Have a great life.

[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.500]
Okay.

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.160]
It's 1017 at WIOD.

[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.480]
Boy, I was feeling so good, too, right up until that moment.

[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.720]
Okay, we have an open line and date one in Palm Beach.

[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.680]
I haven't given the numbers out yet, so I don't know what I'm hucking open lines.

[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.780]
Now, what is this problem that you've got that any problem?

[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.920]
Are you sure that's the right one?

[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.520]
Well, I think it's definitely the right word.

[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.480]
It's this hysteria.

[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.160]
Histeria.

[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.580]
Got these news interns that come in here and they don't sit on my lap.

[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.500]
They don't even come over this half of the table.

[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.860]
They don't come on this side of the table.

[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.820]
And yet you have this hysteria, this obsession, this obsession, a hatred.

[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:06.800]
No.

[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.240]
I deny it.

[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.200]
I have, I don't paranoia.

[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.480]
No.

[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.380]
Insecurity.

[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.740]
Hostility.

[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.160]
I haven't said one word to them of any time.

[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.420]
I have no boys running around the newsroom interns.

[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.020]
I don't even notice.

[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.400]
Wait a minute.

[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.040]
Are they boys?

[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.000]
Kids.

[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.780]
Holiday kids.

[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.140]
She's not a boy.

[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.600]
I'm talking about male interns running around the newsroom.

[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.340]
How about the female interns?

[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.560]
I haven't seen any.

[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.300]
Well, there are two.

[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.280]
I haven't seen them.

[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.180]
I think the newsroom is terribly unbalanced because it's all-

[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.920]
I think you're unbalanced, okay?

[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.560]
About what?

[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.040]
About this subject.

[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.860]
Okay, here's, now he's ripping Dorothy because she has good taste, okay?

[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.360]
I didn't say anything about her.

[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.620]
Is an April and Gail enough for you to squeeze and fondle and molest?

[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.140]
And then Sharon, who comes in here and scratches your back and-

[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.820]
I don't talk about him endlessly.

[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.600]
Does anybody notice that?

[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.640]
What I want to say is-

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.140]
You know what?

[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.700]
I don't talk about him endlessly.

[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:07.480]
I'm not upset.

[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.100]
Endlessly?

[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.060]
What I want to say about the male?

[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:11.920]
What do you mean just now?

[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.600]
Boy, is he getting defensive or what?

[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.160]
Interns in this building.

[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.320]
And then I have no opinion one way or the other.

[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.160]
What does that mean?

[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:19.640]
You have nothing.

[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.380]
They have not struck me at all.

[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.900]
One way they haven't struck you.

[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.980]
Well, one of them is going to strike you when he comes in today.

[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.300]
Ross will probably beat you over the head if you don't stop.

[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:27.920]
Stop.

[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.000]
What?

[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.060]
They haven't struck you.

[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.380]
They're just-

[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.300]
I have no opinion.

[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.120]
Well, I do.

[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:31.820]
One way or the other.

[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.200]
Well, we're not talking about you.

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.640]
Are we?

[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.340]
Yes, we are.

[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:34.900]
We talk about you.

[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.820]
I thought you were asking me.

[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.400]
Not at all.

[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.100]
Good.

[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520]
Because I have no opinion.

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.820]
It's 1019 at WIOD and he has no opinion, folks.

[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.800]
Sports talk tonight.

[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.160]
Correct.

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.140]
Goldberg with Kenny No of Calder.

[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.300]
By the way, Calder opens on Monday.

[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.140]
Wonder what happened to my Calder passes?

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.380]
A 28th at opens.

[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.880]
That's right.

[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.160]
No.

[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.580]
In 29.

[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.220]
29th.

[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.040]
I don't want to nitpick.

[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.300]
But Sunday's the 28th is last day at Hylia.

[00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:58.520]
Okay.

[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.580]
With free admission at Hylia.

[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.180]
So all the-

[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.060]
We out there on Sunday.

[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.480]
And then Calder opens on Monday with a big memorial day card.

[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.160]
I would assume.

[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:09.680]
Right?

[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.380]
Great.

[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.000]
I like Calder.

[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.720]
I do.

[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.920]
I really like Calder.

[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.200]
I do.

[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.100]
I love going to Calder.

[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.700]
What's funny about that?

[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.240]
I don't know.

[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.420]
It's just the way you said it.

[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.220]
There was just something about it like-

[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.640]
I don't know.

[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.200]
I do.

[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.180]
I do remember that wonderful breakfast we had a Calder with Gary Lawrence.

[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.040]
That wasn't at Calder.

[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.660]
That was at the Holiday Inn Calder.

[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.760]
That wasn't the-

[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.980]
Well, overlooking the track.

[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.360]
But that wasn't being in the track.

[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:38.920]
Yeah.

[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.380]
That was our ratings breakfast.

[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:40.680]
Yeah.

[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.660]
Our power breakfast for the rating.

[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.580]
That's what it was.

[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.660]
And boy, that was quite a reward.

[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.740]
It's sitting there at 10 o'clock in the morning.

[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.840]
30 in the morning.

[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.500]
Watching the horses, the remaining horses work out.

[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.240]
And listening to Gary BS.

[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:54.780]
You know.

[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.720]
It was great.

[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.720]
Well, they're really getting theirs over there.

[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.420]
I'll tell you that.

[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.180]
In fact, there's a big article here.

[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.840]
A minority hiring gets scrutiny at 102 Florida radio stations.

[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.300]
Hmm.

[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.700]
And it says the FCC is investigating the hiring practices

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.380]
of 102 Florida radio stations as a result of allegations

[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.760]
by black civil rights groups of an adequate minority recruitment.

[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.960]
And it has a list of the South Florida stations

[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.160]
among the 52 in the state, which are in the-

[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.560]
in the list.

[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.660]
That's okay.

[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.780]
You can get choked up.

[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.040]
And among the list are W-I-N-Z-W-N-W-S-N-W-Z-T-A.

[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.760]
Wow.

[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.280]
Fast and interesting.

[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.500]
Gary Lawrence.

[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.320]
Yeah.

[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.580]
Hmm.

[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.100]
21 past 10 at W-I-O-D.

[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.440]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.860]
Also have a wonderful memo here from Bill Mullin.

[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.420]
And I want to thank him so much.

[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.700]
He signs it all the best.

[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:49.040]
And I couldn't come up with words to describe my feelings about that.

[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.200]
Sales people at rest.

[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.000]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.000]
21 after the hour,

[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.760]
a char-hut opens the doors in nine minutes.

[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.440]
And speaking of Bill Mullin, I want to-

[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.000]
I just want to get this straightened out.

[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.340]
And I was going to want any confusion.

[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.000]
The hotdog specials at the char-hut at the-

[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.740]
Now where is it?

[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.540]
County line.

[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:07.980]
Really?

[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.140]
County line store only.

[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.300]
Okay. Thank you so much.

[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.720]
Well, I'm confused because Mullin is-

[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.180]
Well, you have so many slips of paper.

[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.140]
I got two or three more in here.

[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.900]
After 4 p.m. on weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.540]
at the County line location only, hotdogs 50 cents till the end of the month.

[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.580]
You got another week to go in there and really pick out.

[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.180]

[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.500]
But again, after 4 p.m. weekdays,

[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.860]
all day on Saturday and Sunday.

[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.920]
And of course, at all seven South Florida char-hut locations,

[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.760]
you'll discover-

[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.640]
there's the only fast food place where they use Kaiser rolls with a poppy seeds.

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.840]
Or you can get the regular roll if you're some kind of a slumper.

[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.000]
And they grind that chuck fresh every day using only the very finest ground chuck.

[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.620]
They grind their pork butts every day.

[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.000]
You might say they work their butts off every day to bring you that great Italian sausage.

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.080]
And at 25 at WI would do we got a Mr. Food Spire Report.

[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:57.920]
Neil.

[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.120]
How you doing, buddy?

[00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.860]
Kay, pal?

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.040]
Listen, I heard you talking about Mr. Food,

[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.420]
so I figured I'd give you a little Spire Report on the guy.

[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.020]
I used to work at a certain country club in Boca.

[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.560]
The guy used to come in and play a little golf in the afternoon

[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.080]
and then the old mob to bar for the freer deres in the afternoon.

[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.780]
I used to watch this guy, you know, he'd come in maybe two or three times a month.

[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.200]
And I figured, you know, Mr. Food, Mr. Connoisseur,

[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.560]
you know, cook this, cook that.

[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.960]
He would never break down and spend a buck in water, something off the mat.

[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.720]
He always had to be there for the freer deres.

[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.180]
And as soon as they were gone, he was gone too.

[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:31.920]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.620]
Oh, okay.

[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.740]
Well, I thought maybe there was more, but that's a good start.

[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.400]
When he looks like Mr. Schmutz, I think, should be his new name.

[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.580]
That's what he looks like, man.

[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.060]
That was a real idiot.

[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.920]
He's got hair growing off the outside of his nostrils, that guy.

[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.820]
That's how bad he looks.

[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.380]
Seriously.

[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.680]
Mr. Apapitya.

[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:52.680]
How you doing over there, Bird?

[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.520]
Okay.

[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.720]
All right, man.

[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.720]
See ya.

[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.300]
That's about it.

[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:56.680]
Okay.

[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.980]
Thank you.

[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.100]
Quite a spy report.

[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.280]
Yeah, 1026 at WID.

[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.380]
Well, there was no roofage from wherever that was.

[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:04.800]
Boy.

[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.640]
I guess Atlanta.

[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:07.740]
No.

[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.600]
No, he's not a saintly.

[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:10.180]

[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.700]
Behoek.

[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.520]
Or somewhere up there.

[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.680]
Open line is in Boca, 278 WID.

[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.980]
And of course, Palm Beach, we're saving for the people out of town.

[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:21.100]
If you're listening like in San Francisco or in Phoenix or in Albuquerque,

[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.880]
line 8 is open and available right now or into Bahamas.

[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.840]
Everybody keeps telling me that everywhere they go into Bahamas,

[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.660]
they've got us on, like in the stories on a radio.

[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.300]
So we want to wish you a real happy ripoff day to all our friends in Bahamas, okay?

[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.680]
Because we know they love ripping off American dollars.

[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.160]
And good luck to you, okay?

[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.820]
As long as they're too stupid in this state to have gambling,

[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.660]
you folks are going to continue doing very well.

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.000]
Sure.

[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.540]
And we don't hold it against you.

[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.320]
If we were in your shoes, we'd rip off the dumb Americans too, okay?

[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.920]
Hot 105.

[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.740]
This is from the dining and entertainer.

[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.520]
Oh, this is the Thursday paper.

[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.500]
Oh.

[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.620]
This is the Thursday paper.

[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.980]
Oh, don't you remember we got the one last week?

[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:58.540]
Yeah.

[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.420]
This is the book.

[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.700]
We just got a new trend, but this is the book.

[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.840]
Palm Beach.

[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.080]
Wow.

[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.400]
Dining and entertainment.

[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.280]
The Thursday...

[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.360]
What is the Thursday paper?

[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.140]
What does that mean?

[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.040]
What...

[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.380]
Don't you find that a strange name for a paper?

[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:12.860]
Yeah.

[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.400]
The Thursday paper, although it does come out on Thursday, so I guess it's okay.

[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:17.580]
Wow.

[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.860]
The top 40, this is Robin Plitt again.

[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:20.460]
Again.

[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.760]
Not Robin Platt, the jockey, but Robin Plitt.

[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.340]
The top 40 radio format proved to be a hot commodity in South Florida.

[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.040]
WHQT proved to be the hot property.

[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.580]
The Miami Bay Station, which bills itself as Hot 105,

[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.040]
received a lion's share of listeners.

[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.020]
Look at this.

[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.240]
They've even got a whole list of all the stations here from the book,

[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.520]
which is only a month old.

[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.620]
That's pretty came out today, May 25th.

[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.140]
So they're right on top of things, okay?

[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.480]
Then it has a paragraph where it says,

[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.860]
Power of Speech.

[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.580]
WIOD continues to improve its audience share after requiring controversial tacos

[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.180]
near Rogers last fall.

[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.640]
Rogers, Micronirion, Steve Kane, form a popular lineup that blended

[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.000]
with the station's evening sports programming to generate a 5-1 share.

[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.680]
WSNews placed more than a full point behind with a 3-2 share,

[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.560]
while all news WIOD was a close third with a 3-1, close to what?

[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.960]
Close to WOLD, not close to what?

[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.640]
WJNO, well, they're a 9-minute segment of CBS Radio's The World Tonight.

[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:29.340]
At 6 p.m., program director John Focano said the move was an experiment that has run its course.

[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.400]
And if you mention any other station in this article, I'm going to retract my hand.

[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.100]
Well, he is such a fishback.

[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.400]
Okay, such a paranoid doucheback.

[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.600]
I will only show up if no other station's invited.

[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.140]
Yeah, right?

[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:42.500]
Wow.

[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.600]
The big JNO, okay.

[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.600]
Here's a multiple collar on four. Hello.

[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.960]
Hi, how you doing?

[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.440]
Okay.

[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.080]
We're sitting here listening to your show, enjoying it as we always do.

[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.560]
We all love it.

[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.560]
We work for a government agency,

[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.040]
so you're the only sanity that we have during the day.

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.180]
Government agency, boy, we're being monitored by the government ladies and gentlemen look out.

[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.720]
But, uh, no, you know, we enjoy listening to your show.

[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.700]
Well, that's great.

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.600]
And, uh, we haven't heard to talk about the video we were treated to the other day,

[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.260]
with Rob Lowe, that we all got to enjoy during our dinner time.

[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.100]
I didn't see it.

[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.100]
You haven't heard us talk about the Rob Lowe thing?

[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:26.720]
Yeah.

[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.980]
We've talked about it till we were blue in the face.

[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.960]
I mean, too much.

[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.200]
Didn't have, okay.

[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.540]
Okay, we must have been working during that time.

[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.540]
Devonette, well, that's good.

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.920]
It's glad to know that on government money, you're taking a little bit of the time to do some work.

[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.940]
But, uh, no, we, uh, we enjoy your show.

[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.460]
And, uh, we got a couple of other people here that want to talk to you.

[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.000]
Okay, well, that's great.

[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:50.860]
Okay, hold on.

[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:51.360]
You bet.

[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:51.980]
Great.

[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.380]
Wow.

[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.780]
I think there'll be a surprise.

[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.640]
I hope not.

[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:56.860]
I hope it.

[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:57.600]
Hello.

[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.240]
Hello.

[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:58.740]
Yeah.

[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.720]
Yeah, we just wanted to say that we think the bird is an excellent addition to your show.

[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.400]
Great.

[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.700]
And we think he does a fantastic job along with you.

[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.560]
And if it wasn't for your show, we'd all be going nuts by this Friday and the day.

[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.180]
Right.

[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:13.180]
Hmm.

[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:14.640]
Okay.

[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.380]
All right.

[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.420]
Have a great life, pal.

[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.080]
Hey, you, too.

[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.500]
Okay.

[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:17.760]
Bye.

[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.220]
Oh, man, that's the government for you right there, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.960]
What a call.

[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:22.800]
Summed up.

[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.120]
What a call.

[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.220]
Well, that's your crowd.

[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.080]
That's your fan club right there.

[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.320]
I get the chance of that.

[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.560]
I'll give you a big compliment there.

[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.880]
Oh, now we got veggie on the vocal line.

[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.920]
Don't you understand we don't want to talk to you anymore?

[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.320]
Wait, I don't understand.

[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:36.940]
Oh, no.

[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.820]
1031 at WIOD.

[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.360]
We have an open line in Broward at 524-9463.

[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.720]
You should have let him finish that one word.

[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:47.780]
What was it?

[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:48.880]
I don't understand.

[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.660]
Yeah, understand.

[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:50.980]
524-9463.

[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.480]
We're going to be here at WIOD in Broward in Palm Beach.

[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.460]
Forget it.

[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.100]
Forget it.

[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.880]
I thought we were really going to be smoking today in Palm Beach because we started out and

[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.700]
every line was lit.

[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.900]
We didn't even give the numbers out.

[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.000]
And I thought they had something to say.

[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.200]
And if you noticed, I'm wrong.

[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.020]
Nothing.

[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.920]
And they have nothing to say.

[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.160]
In fact, these are some of the most terminal people.

[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.540]
It almost makes you want to punch up Boko again.

[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.060]
Hello.

[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:11.420]
Neil.

[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.120]
1031.

[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.040]
I don't give up, bitch.

[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.960]
Welcome back to you every now and then.

[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.240]
Well, he usually does hang up.

[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.780]
That's one of the reasons he pisses me off.

[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.680]
Something fears is we try to get him on in spite of his chronicness.

[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.400]
And he just hangs up.

[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.780]
If you don't get to him right away, it goes off in salt and drops the phone on the floor

[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.700]
or some stupid thing like that, right?

[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:32.180]

[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.120]
OK.

[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.940]
At least he's starting to get honest.

[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.780]
OK, I like that.

[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.860]
That's a good, fresh approach.

[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.300]
Honesty may save you.

[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.300]
I wouldn't count on it, but it might save you.

[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.920]
It's 1032 at WIOD.

[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.600]
And by the way, Fernando, I'm sure, is driving up right now with a food from Natural

[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.880]
Leads, which is just tremendous.

[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.080]
And it's not that we don't like you, Fernando, but just drop it under the door.

[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.880]
You're a wonderful guy, but don't, please.

[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.520]
Don't come in here for another four hours, smoothing around and just being...

[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.900]
Well, he's got work to do.

[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.500]
He can't stay there.

[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:02.860]
Exactly.

[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.920]
He's got a lot of stuff to do.

[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.280]
So we understand if you can only leave it at the front desk.

[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.640]
And we remember what you look like, which is one of the reasons we don't want you in here.

[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.660]
1032 at WIOD.

[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.440]
Well, he can't all look like Ross and Todd, in spite of the fact that you hate them.

[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.160]
Don't say that.

[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.760]
And Jared, what do women really want to admit?

[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.720]
You know that Maya Kahana kidnapped Jared yesterday and took him to Israel?

[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.200]
Not.

[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.160]
He saw him wearing that high around his neck.

[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.120]
What do women really want in men?

[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.720]
Not the sensitive carrying Alan Alda types that were invoked in a year back.

[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.960]
And I said, Maya, we got enough goyem here already.

[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.520]
You can't take the Jews out of the building.

[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.920]
Nowadays, gals are looking for handsome, rich guys in the mold of Donald Trump, according

[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.140]
to the latest pull by Man Watcher.

[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.940]
More than one went off at 40 to one at Hylia.

[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.940]
So Steve's listeners was, as usual, were full of it.

[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.180]
So he had to give Hank another 20.

[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.480]
Good.

[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.720]
So it's 120 that he peed away.

[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.900]
You might as well have burned it.

[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.380]
I'm sorry, go ahead.

[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.140]
Today's ambitious women want the superficial things.

[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.040]
Good looks and this success quota, according to Man Watcher's name.

[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.820]
They must have interviewed Laura for this, okay?

[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.340]
Because she's given up all that other stuff.

[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.900]
Now here are their faggers.

[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.120]
That's what it is.

[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.020]
It looks he don't have.

[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:23.360]
Right.

[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.100]
Exactly.

[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.840]
Here are the top vote getters.

[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.100]
Mel Gibson.

[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:30.920]
For what?

[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.640]
Man Watcher's Inc.

[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.760]
Oh, come on.

[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.760]
Now will you stop it?

[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.060]
Are we going to go through the same old list again of all these schmutzzy guys?

[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.620]
The probably Patrick Swazies on Epic Swazies on Epic Swazies.

[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:41.960]
No, no.

[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.780]
Swazies didn't make it.

[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.260]
How about John Cameron Swazies?

[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:44.460]
No.

[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.980]
John F. Kennedy Jr.

[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.140]
Man.

[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.380]
Lou Gossett Jr.

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.240]
You know if he wasn't John F. Kennedy Jr. that wasn't his name.

[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.000]
Nobody would pay any attention to him, okay?

[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.400]
Lou Gossett Jr.

[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:55.780]
Yeah.

[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.340]
Why is that?

[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.980]
Because he was in that movie with Jason Getrich.

[00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:58.740]
Obviously.

[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.220]
And Donald Trump.

[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.140]
Oh, give me a break.

[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:02.500]
Will you?

[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.320]
Looks money power.

[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:04.980]
They say.

[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.660]
And Paul Newman.

[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.840]
Also making the list.

[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.380]
A most watched man.

[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.400]
Oh, put on your seatbelt.

[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.740]
Alan Thick.

[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.740]
Oh, God.

[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.280]
Get serious.

[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:22.800]
Brett Pack actor Andrew McCarthy, who I hung out with in Atlanta years ago.

[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.640]
Yeah, you hung out with him and Rob Lowe.

[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.860]
Tony Danza.

[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:26.900]
Yeah, it was.

[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:27.060]
Yeah, it was.

[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:27.760]
I thought it was.

[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.360]
Tony Curtis.

[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:30.660]
Yeah.

[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.280]
And Kenny Rogers.

[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.420]
I wasn't at Jamie Lee Curtis's.

[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.480]
Yeah.

[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:35.900]
Yeah.

[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:36.680]
Yeah.

[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.140]
Oh, now I'm beginning to put all of that together about her problems, okay?

[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.120]
The fact that you had a paste those on.

[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.320]
And that she seems so butch all the time.

[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.700]
Tony Curtis is her father.

[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.800]
What do you think about that, Veg?

[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:51.820]
A wonderful.

[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.000]
1035 at WIOD.

[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.940]
And I want to mention, of course, that a lot of evidence.

[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.840]
You know one of the great Italian restaurants anywhere in the world.

[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.140]
It's not just South Florida's finest Italian restaurant.

[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:02.680]
It's so good.

[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.020]
I don't think you can beat it anywhere.

[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.420]
And they bake everything fresh on the premises.

[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.080]
All their great pastas are all homemade.

[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.240]
That angel hair pasta with whatever you like on it.

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.360]
You can get it with baby cow or with seafood or with just about anything.

[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.200]
Or you can just get it like with sauce, you know?

[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.100]
And all kinds of great wheel dishes and poultry.

[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.720]
The very finest Italian cuisine.

[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.920]
I do want to mention at La Teverena, it will be closed this Saturday and Sunday

[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.620]
because Chef Romano and his lovely wife Carol will be attending the graduation of their daughter from college.

[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:32.520]
Well, congratulations.

[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.340]
Of course.

[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.120]
And of course, they're normally closed Mondays and Tuesdays anyway.

[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.020]
So they're going to take like a little busman's holiday for this and it's well deserved.

[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.540]
They'll reopen on Wednesday to serve you with La Teverena.

[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.860]
As a matter of fact, I'm just thinking about it and I think next week, one night,

[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.200]
I'm going to La Teverena for dinner.

[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.900]
I just, yeah, it's been a long time.

[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.680]
That's it has.

[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.520]
And now that I'm just kind of floating and my weight is just hovering about the same.

[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.040]
So for the very finest Italian cuisine, you head for La Teverena.

[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.200]
To be sure make reservations, 722-1831, you'll find them on McNabb Road,

[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.120]
just east of Pine Island, just north of commercial, 8455 West McNabb and Tamarack.

[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.020]
Like La Tavranetta.

[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.860]
Well, like I said, no, I don't think he's a Paheza Puts.

[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.940]
Because I, you know, I said something to him about this the other day again and they won't play it on GTR.

[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.320]
Okay.

[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:24.800]
Now, they wouldn't play the Roy Orbison record, which was number one AOR, not just number one like Billboard,

[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.920]
but number one AOR, an album rock in the country.

[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.840]
They wouldn't play it on GTR.

[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.820]
They won't play the Dion, which even YNF in Tampa is playing.

[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:38.260]
See, that's the problem with this market. There is no real AOR station.

[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:44.020]
What you've got are stations, you've got three stations pertaining to BOR that don't want to be.

[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.300]
In other words, they want to be safe.

[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.120]
All right, Miami Stable.

[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.800]
I say it at which plays all the same six groups that Rose Folger likes over and over and over again,

[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.280]
the stones and the Beatles, you know.

[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.200]
And for example, like Billy Joel, I hate Billy Joel.

[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.960]
I know I've told a story before, but I said to Rose when we were over there,

[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.840]
I said, how can you be an AOR station and not play Billy Joel?

[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.860]
He doesn't like him.

[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.600]
He doesn't like him.

[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.620]
Okay, so he's not going to play Billy Joel.

[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.540]
He evidently doesn't like Dion, and of course it's she.

[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.940]
God don't know what they're playing.

[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.580]
And here's GTR over here next door, and they don't have any balls over there.

[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.400]
Okay, they play the same safe stuff, you know, the same groups over and over again,

[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.920]
including groups that I like, but I don't want to hear four in their all day, okay?

[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:24.840]
Right?

[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.320]
Do you?

[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.820]
No, it's the tested safe.

[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.140]
Yeah, tried and true safe.

[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.520]
So there's no station in this market where you'll really get a chance.

[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.560]
It's really some commentary that this, which is a hot album already, by the way,

[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.420]
and getting a lot of play on AOR stations, the only place you'll hear it in this market

[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.320]
is on this show on an AM station.

[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.560]
I wasn't at, and this isn't even a music show.

[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.680]
What do you think of that?

[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.200]
Unbelievable.

[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:51.980]
Thank you.

[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.260]
Shocking.

[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.200]
So just for the record, spike wise, you're a putz, and when you keep looking at those trends,

[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.040]
you keep seeing that little yo-yo up and down and down and then up a little bit.

[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.540]
See, they get a fluke once every three or four months, and then they go up and they get all excited.

[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.460]
Then they come back to where they really belong.

[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.220]
They should be dominating, because they just like, you know, five minutes away

[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.020]
at any given moment from being off the air.

[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.540]
Okay.

[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.080]
She is like, they made a little bit of a comeback here.

[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.040]
Somebody gave him some oxygen, I think, by default.

[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:18.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.620]
But the guy only knows what the hell they're doing.

[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.320]
So they ought to be running away with it. They ought to dominate.

[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.160]
Okay?

[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960]
And they don't.

[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.440]
Because their music sucks.

[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.540]
Focus groups.

[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.320]
Incredible.

[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.520]
Unbelievable.

[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.240]
I wish I had in the bank.

[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.220]
Yeah.

[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.600]
The money, the stations like these, these two here in this building, waste.

[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.040]
Ah, on focus groups and all these other phony baloney studies.

[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.240]
You can't program music on focus groups, okay?

[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.360]
And over at Zeta, did you notice they used to do that all the time?

[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.100]
All stations.

[00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.480]
Yeah, down here.

[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.200]
Same thing.

[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.520]
And you keep, it doesn't work.

[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.160]
I mean, if it works, how can you be doing a one share

[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.440]
and you keep doing the same thing month after month with focus groups?

[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.240]
Oh yeah, they react real positive.

[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.740]
It's like, you know, in commercials, they react.

[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.640]
They get these people in a room and they hook them up to like,

[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.640]
they're like light detectors.

[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.220]
They detect all their emotions.

[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.600]
And what they sweat or puke or anything even close to that.

[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.900]
And then they get the reaction of it because they're spending a lot of money to make those commercials

[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.680]
and they want to know how the public is going to react.

[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:27.960]

[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.400]
Well, it's the same thing with the focus groups on this music, you know.

[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.820]
And they get like 14 drunks that they got down it.

[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.280]
You told them somewhere and they bring them in a room and they sit them down.

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.160]
And they put the music on and half of them are stoned out of their mind.

[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.700]
They can't understand what the music is anyway.

[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.640]
Oh yeah, man, that's real great.

[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.280]
Okay, give it like five stars on a sheet.

[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.520]
And that's how they determine what music they're going to play.

[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.160]
There are a bunch of jackasses, okay?

[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400]
There are a bunch of idiots.

[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.980]
The first thing is what kind of a person would participate.

[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.520]
You know, it's obviously the kind of person that does nothing else to do.

[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.180]
Wait a minute, I gotta find a one part.

[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.100]
Okay, here it comes. You ready?

[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:15.560]
Yeah.

[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.080]
Yeah, me too.

[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.100]
1046 at WIOD, pardon us for getting hysterical and excited, but it's so damn frustrating.

[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.800]
You try to talk sense to people in this business in this market.

[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.200]
And they don't have any sense. They won't listen to you. They know it all, okay?

[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.840]
If they know so much, how come they're rating suck?

[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.360]
You want to answer that question for me?

[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:41.900]
No.

[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.120]
Like Rose Folger, who wouldn't know a hit record if it bit him on the lip?

[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.900]
What he knows about music, you can put in this can over here of Diet Cherry 7 up

[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.600]
and have room for the entire Chinese army leftover in drag.

[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.060]
Okay?

[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.980]
It's 1047 at WIOD, the music of your life.

[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.760]
Research is ruining this country. I've said this before.

[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.600]
Exactly. I've said this for years.

[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.660]
Whatever happened to gut instinct.

[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.200]
Yeah.

[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.800]
When Gary Lawrence, I don't want to pick on him because he, you know, he was okay to me.

[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.660]
Although he was a cheap bastard, but he was a pretty good guy.

[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:24.100]
But I'd go into an argue with him and the bottom line was he couldn't, in fact,

[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.380]
nobody that was ever in that chair in that building or in this, in this building,

[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.180]
now I'm got any idea.

[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:34.520]
But can't you turn on the radio and listen to something with your own ear and decide if it sounds good?

[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.400]
Not, not if you're in programming or if you're one of the executives.

[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.820]
They got to bring in all these experts and they got to conduct studies and they got to have maggots studies

[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.480]
and pay $40,000 and he comes out with a big black book and he says,

[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.680]
the audience wants to hear the weather, the news, and the traffic.

[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.360]
They got to spend $40,000 to find out that the audience wants to hear the news,

[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.760]
weather, and traffic in the morning.

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.940]
Okay? That's the kind of morons we have programming these radio stations, folks,

[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.780]
which is why you have so much boring crap on your radio.

[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.200]
It's enough to make me sick.

[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.300]
Would you agree?

[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.700]
Their jackass is an idiot.

[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.840]
Exactly. He is redeeming himself with it.

[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.840]
Very important what? Very important you deliver it tonight.

[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.760]
That's great.

[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.120]
When you just relax Fernando, he's so hyper.

[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:31.380]
Food from natural eats just arrived, ladies and gentlemen, and of course fat rich is digging into the bag with his very hands like an animal.

[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.240]
I've never seen anything sort of disgusting in my life.

[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.700]
So you're delivering at night now from natural eats from what?

[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.240]
What time? Five to nine?

[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.340]
Look at that. Or five to eight?

[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.460]
Depending on whether Fernando's got something else going on.

[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.720]
We'll see how it goes. Well, isn't that interesting?

[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.860]
Okay, let's just get the food open and cut the crap.

[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.960]
10.51 at WIOD. I'm sorry you couldn't be here, Vetch,

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.180]
didn't share our lunch with us.

[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.620]
I would love to be there.

[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.320]
Hold on one second.

[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.900]
Listen, we got to collect call from Jupiter.

[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.120]
Now you'll hold for that, won't you?

[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:06.560]
I'll hold.

[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.140]
I'll tell you one thing, boy, he really must be desperate because ordinarily he would hung up a half hour ago.

[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:12.760]

[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.300]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.420]
Hi, this is Doc from Jupiter.

[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.520]
Long time, Mr. Frickle.

[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.760]
Who is it? Doc from Jupiter.

[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.720]
Doc? Doc, the OC.

[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.460]
Doc? Yeah.

[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.360]
Doc? We got any napkins in here, by the way.

[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.000]
Don't mind us, Doc. We're eating.

[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.420]
Bad radio, Neil. I know.

[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.580]
I was flipping through the channels last night on the TV

[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.460]
and I caught Morton Downey's act last night.

[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.200]
He said in all time, low.

[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.160]
He's desperate.

[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.080]
They had...

[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.080]
I heard that he's doing a video with Rob Low.

[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.900]
He had on dwarf tossing.

[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.700]
dwarf tossing? Yeah, dwarf tossing.

[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.960]
Were they tossing him on the show?

[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.240]
No, no, no, they had a big mat.

[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.340]
A big mat? A big mat?

[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.180]
You know, like wrestling mat?

[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.320]
Oh, I see, yeah.

[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.700]
And did they toss work?

[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.020]
Because I would have paid to see that.

[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.300]
No, dwarf, majors.

[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.500]
It's a new thing going on around in the country.

[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.200]
I guess it bars.

[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.680]
And so they had...

[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.780]
Was Bob Mayor on the show?

[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.680]
Oh, no, no.

[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.420]
They had a bunch of dwarfs there that were against it

[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.660]
because it was breaking bones and things like that.

[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.800]
And then he had these big, you know, like football players throwing them for distance.

[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.460]
And I just thought you'd like to hear about that

[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.640]
since you bring up Morton Downey once in a while.

[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:40.740]
Yeah, he's really...

[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.320]
He needs a publicity, believe me, boy. He's on his last legs.

[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.080]
Have it down, Lee.

[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.360]
I told you, he had...

[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.860]
Didn't I say when we first came over here in another six months or so?

[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.100]
Yeah, I remember that because I started listening to you when he came to IOD.

[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.700]
And since we came over here, he's been moved from a primetime at night

[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.980]
into the one o'clock in the afternoon on 39 here.

[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.060]
Plus, he's been dropped out of several stations.

[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.060]
Yeah, I watch him on...

[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.160]
or what channel is it?

[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.340]
WLR, like midnight.

[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:06.700]
Mm-hmm.

[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.740]
And, yeah, I just thought he'd be interested in that to work with him.

[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.700]
Well, I don't want you to feel too bad because Morton made 40 million last year.

[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.260]
Okay, so he probably won't miss any meals.

[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.680]
He even made enough to get the warts removed.

[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.580]
Yeah, that's a few bucks more than I made.

[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:18.940]
Yeah.

[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.300]
All right, and the arm out of...

[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:22.620]
Material.

[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.320]
Okay, well, it was a great call, sir.

[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.760]
I'd let anybody tell you otherwise.

[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.540]
Okay, he's almost as good as Steve's picking the freakness.

[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:29.620]
See your bird.

[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.080]
Okay.

[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:30.960]
All right.

[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.620]
Now, see, that was worth waiting for, wasn't it?

[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:33.460]
Oh, yeah, right.

[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:34.620]
Now, what do you want?

[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.240]
All right, listen.

[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.200]
Why do you've been shining me?

[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.240]
What the hell does that mean?

[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.140]
Every time a Roger puts you on hold, you hang up if we don't put you on in 30 seconds.

[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.120]
So, no, no, really.

[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.400]
And tie up our very valuable vocal line.

[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.500]
What is that?

[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.120]
Soup?

[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.320]
Well, you guys went crazy with it.

[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:51.880]
This is good.

[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:52.720]
Hey, Glen.

[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:53.340]
Yeah?

[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:53.840]
Thanks, Jeannie.

[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.060]
Listen, I wanted to wish you happy, belated birthday.

[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:56.920]
Thanks, Feds.

[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.420]
I hope everything was great for you.

[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.000]
I heard that day.

[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:06.260]
I heard the radio, whether it came in speaking, I heard, you know, how you guys had a good

[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.360]
time on the station there.

[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.320]
Yeah, it does sound like we had a good time.

[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.160]
Good time on what?

[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.580]
Here on the station.

[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:11.860]
When?

[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.900]
With the stripper, though.

[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.460]
Last Thursday.

[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.000]
Well, last Thursday, yeah, that was quite a show last Thursday.

[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.480]
That was amazing.

[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.320]
That was because Hank was here.

[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:18.680]
Eating.

[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.460]
Saying nothing, just eating.

[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.960]
Well, he's had a few little vicious comments.

[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.840]
Yeah, he had a few shots.

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.860]
Wow, look at that.

[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.240]
Hey, listen, can I give you an update?

[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.100]
Mm-hmm.

[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.520]
Okay, you remember how I'm famous for the strikers, right?

[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:32.760]
Whatever you say.

[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.220]
Did you hear about the Fourth Law Deal strikers had the suck this year?

[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:36.560]
No.

[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.400]
We don't care.

[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.320]
Don't go on your stamp.

[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.220]
Seeing how you're regretting again.

[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.420]
And they're regretting, okay, I won't talk about that.

[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.260]
Nobody cares about soccer here, okay?

[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.680]
Well, Glen does.

[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.540]
No, he doesn't.

[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.160]
He doesn't know a soccer ball from a ping pong ball.

[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.440]
Soccer.

[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.040]
Yeah.

[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.940]
What do you like soccer, though, you like soccer?

[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.800]
Yeah, it's almost as big down here as hockey.

[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.340]
I put them right beside each other down in Florida.

[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.200]
By the way, game six in the NHL finals tonight on the sports channel Florida.

[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.920]
I'm nuts about that.

[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.240]
Well, listen, it's been real exciting.

[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.360]
Yeah, no.

[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.880]
Listen, I like that new song that you played.

[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.740]
I gotta get to you.

[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.480]
That's a really good song.

[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:15.720]
See ya.

[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.180]
It's great.

[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.020]
Okay, see ya.

[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.440]
Yeah, bye.

[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.140]
Well, listen, we got rid of him, boy.

[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.600]
Open line in Broward 524WYOD.

[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.180]
Bokered 278-9463 in Palm Beach.

[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.260]
No, no hope.

[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.360]
What are you doing now?

[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.760]
You're getting a little carried away.

[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:30.900]
What is that?

[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:31.780]
What do you mean from me?

[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.600]
Man's a maniac.

[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.040]
No, don't give that to me.

[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.360]
I can't have a sandwich in baked zedian soup.

[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.880]
And the man's nuts.

[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.500]
I don't underestimate myself.

[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.220]
You're crazy.

[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.660]
Let some of the news people eat some of this stuff, okay?

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.660]
Like that big salad.

[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:54.920]
Soup.

[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.080]
What kind of soup we got today?

[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.140]
Ooh, I love mushroom barley.

[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.440]
That's my favorite soup.

[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.320]
How did you know that?

[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.360]
Just because we took shots at Fernando last week,

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.220]
he brought some good stuff.

[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.640]
Now, isn't that baked zedian grade?

[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:07.160]
Great.

[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.940]
And he was smart enough to bring two of them.

[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:09.360]
Yeah.

[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.820]
Here's a mobile on the vocal line.

[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.260]
But this is a great call.

[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.580]
It's going to be a terrific call.

[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:13.940]
Yeah.

[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.380]
You've been number intense for the last couple of days.

[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.680]
I've been hitting a little bits and pieces here.

[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:19.920]
What are Todd's numbers?

[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:21.620]
Who?

[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.240]
Todd.

[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:23.440]
Todd.

[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.860]
Yeah, your new little...

[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.120]
Oh, you mean Todd in the newsroom?

[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.560]
Yeah.

[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.920]
I'd say about a 13 and a half on a scale of six.

[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:29.480]
Oh!

[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.400]
Is that any move to my car?

[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.180]
Okay.

[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:32.960]
Thank you.

[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.020]
Is that desperate, sir?

[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:35.420]
Well, not actually.

[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560]
Well, Ross will be in today.

[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.260]
Ross is about an 18 and two thirds.

[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.940]
I'd have to, I'd have to think about that.

[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.800]
As a matter of fact, Laura is hanging out in the newsroom today.

[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.640]
Nobody has seen Laura except for a couple of seconds.

[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.060]
She's waiting for Ross to come in.

[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.060]
Yeah, but is she smiling?

[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.660]
From ear to ear.

[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.380]
There you go.

[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.140]
That tells it all.

[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:49.580]
Okay.

[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.380]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.780]
1057 at W.I.D.

[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.020]
Now, what were you saying about the zedian?

[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.960]
I was saying I like about it.

[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.580]
It's got zucchini like...

[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.460]
Yeah, it's so great.

[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.860]
I didn't get any of this last time.

[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.900]
Boy did I miss that.

[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.200]
Yeah.

[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.780]
I think we may wind up eating all the food.

[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.360]
And of course, Richie is on a little quiet way over there.

[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.360]
Yeah, Richie is here.

[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:10.420]
So...

[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.320]
Oh, he's going nuts.

[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.760]
He's going to be mellow today here.

[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.460]
I have a feeling.

[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.600]
Yeah, and I like last week was kind of frantic.

[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.580]
Oh, God.

[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:19.580]
Wow.

[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.100]
Uh-oh.

[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.360]
What do you want, Henry?

[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.160]
Henry never reads.

[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.200]
Henry's, um, unless it's liquid Henry would talk to.

[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:25.240]

[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:27.460]
Hmm.

[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.240]
Hmm.

[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.340]
Do you sell wine?

[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.280]
Oh, he'll be down to see you for an under.

[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.380]
Oh, my God.

[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.080]
Look at the size of the mushrooms in this mushroom barley soup.

[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.380]
Makes me feel inadequate somehow.

[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:42.320]

[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:43.820]
1058.

[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.880]
And WIOD, the bulk and poverty lines are both dead.

[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.060]
We don't really care though, do we?

[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.060]
As a dornig.

[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:49.580]
Damn right.

[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:50.940]
Miami, hello.

[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:51.760]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:52.940]
Yeah, good morning.

[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.420]
How you doing, bud?

[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.060]
Great.

[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.260]
All right, listen, I got a WZTA Spirey Fort.

[00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:57.980]
Mm-hmm.

[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:58.560]
Yeah.

[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.180]
How about those numbers, huh?

[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.520]
Yeah, how about that one five in the morning?

[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.180]
Is my favorite.

[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.900]
Listen, I was traveling down the county line road going south.

[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.000]
And what did I see up on the road?

[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.540]
Thanks for, Andy.

[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.480]
What's that?

[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.060]
Sure, some sodas would be great.

[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:13.900]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.040]
And what did I happen to see up on those highway billboards, fine?

[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.080]
It said 94.9.

[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.520]
Thanks for, Andy.

[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.320]
Watch this space.

[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.500]
Watch, yeah.

[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:25.180]
Yeah.

[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.280]
You know what that means, don't you?

[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.560]
It means there's some kind of a change coming.

[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.740]
It means I 95.

[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:31.700]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.400]
Great, huh?

[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.740]
Could be.

[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:35.240]
All right.

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.100]
Or could be W-O-F-F.

[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.400]
No, I doubt it.

[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.180]
I doubt it.

[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.960]
It'll be good to get on any five back, though, I'm sorry.

[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:42.620]
Yeah, sure would.

[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.120]
We get to roll the squirrel back over there.

[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.620]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:47.960]
Hi, 95.

[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.840]
Maybe we'd have to give Johnny Dolan up, too.

[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.880]
We'd have to make kind of a trade.

[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:51.760]
Oh, no.

[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.420]
Okay, thanks for the report, pal.

[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:53.980]
All right, bud.

[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:54.840]
You're a great American.

[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.860]
It's 10.59.

[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:56.700]
You know what that means.

[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.680]
That means Henry is slinking into the newsroom as we speak.

[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.560]
And look at that.

[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.480]
Rich is just having a 7,000 calorie salad over there.

[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.800]
Just kind of minding his own business.

[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.820]
And then we'll come back after Henry with the 11 o'clock news.

[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.820]
At 11.05, Steve's got open phones today.

[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.700]
Well, you got the sun he's going to be calling in with reports

[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.580]
on a hurricane's game.

[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.040]
All kinds of stuff here today.

[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.460]
And even Yankee baseball at 7.30 tonight.

[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.780]
Okay, I got one other question.

[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.120]
Yeah.

[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.780]
Is Robin the Doric lady?

[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:29.620]
Yes.

[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.460]
Oh, okay.

[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.840]
That's why we don't hear from her anymore.

[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.340]
Okay.

[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.860]
In fact, we had a fake Robin on yesterday.

[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.340]
Yeah.

[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.120]
I'm kind of red.

[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:37.680]
Yeah.

[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:38.620]
Oh, okay.

[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.340]
Okay, sir.

[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.420]
Well, I'm glad we were able to answer all the pressing problems

[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:41.760]
here.

[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.620]
Are you going to be all right now?

[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.100]
Are you sure?

[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.040]
See ya.

[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.540]
Don't encourage him.

[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.260]
We'll let him go.

[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.900]
Open line in Brown with 524WI.

[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.280]
And of course, the Palm Beach line is sitting there waiting for another call from Tel Aviv

[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.000]
or somewhere far away from here.

[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:57.360]
Okay.

[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.860]
So, let's go to the next one.

[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:06.900]
Okay.

[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:06.940]
Okay.

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:06.960]

[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.360]
Okay.

[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:08.360]

[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:08.360]

[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:08.360]

[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:08.820]
Okay.

[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:08.820]

[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.220]
Okay.

[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.100]
Okay.

[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.200]
Okay.

[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:11.700]
Okay.

[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.060]

[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:12.060]
