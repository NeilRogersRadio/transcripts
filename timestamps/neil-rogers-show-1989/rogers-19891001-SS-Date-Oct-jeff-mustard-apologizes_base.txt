[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980]
No way to argue the situation of the point further and I was asked to leave.

[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.680]
I guess the most disappointing thing of all of this is how the whole situation was handled after my departure from the studio.

[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.720]
And then again the following week I was called to the station in the same capacity as a local expert on a particular subject.

[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.040]
I wonder what the subject was. I guess we can't say it on the air.

[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.220]
Mr. Betta wanted to talk about comedy and Sharon called me. Apparently Mr. Hill had a major problem with this.

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.640]
Wait a minute.

[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.020]
Yeah, they're going here.

[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.760]
I'm not on a retainer with no of my pay by any radio station. I'm just a young hard-working comedian looking to establish myself.

[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.280]
Johnny Dye!

[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.520]
I believe I've accurately described what replaced that day. If you feel there's a problem with what I did, then certainly you are entitled to feel that way.

[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.980]
I did not intend on hurting or offending anyone.

[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.840]
Maybe as a young, perspiring, aspiring comic, I wasn't sensitive enough to the politics of the situation.

[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.060]
However, once again, I feel I did not do anything that would be considered inappropriate.

[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.480]
I would even very much like to maintain open dialogue with you. I've even enclosed some of my recent jokes.

[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.260]
I hope you like them.

[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.120]
Sincerely, Jeff Mustard.

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.660]
And we probably ought to, and here's a picture too. It is just, oh wait a minute. Hold on to it now. It's trying to...

[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.760]
Here's a comedy sampler platter from Jeff Mustard. Are you ready?

[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.800]
I don't know.

[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.260]
The chief surgeon said they removed old blood from the brain of the 78-year-old ex-president.

[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.820]
No kidding. What are they going to find? Young blood?

[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.980]
Okay, let's try another one.

[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.100]
The operation was performed at the world famous Mayo Clinic.

[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.860]
Doctors were concerned about Reagan's age and other complications which might develop.

[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.200]
So during the procedure, they used Miracle with.

[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.080]
Okay, one more now. They got to get better.

[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.360]
Former President Reagan underwent successful brain surgery.

[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.160]
Doctors who amazed they found they removed the same exact things when they performed his colon operation.

[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.760]
That's a joke.

[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.880]
Well, one more.

[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.660]
Congressman Barney Frank, the acknowledged homosexual legislator,

[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.360]
is being investigated for hiring male prostitutes, Steve Goldie,

[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.700]
who allegedly used the Congressman's house for prostitution.

[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.040]
So what? Nobody's bothering Barney Frank about the house he uses on Capitol Hill to screw people.

[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.600]
One more? I guess not.

[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.880]
Well, Jeff, let me just say this.

[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.360]
We certainly want to thank you for your fine letter.

[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.340]
And don't call us.

[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.040]
We'll call you.

[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.960]
Yeah, that was good.

[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.180]
One now you see.

[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.080]
One 17 at WID.

[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.980]
We better do a little break after that Marvin.

[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.760]
Very heavy duke.
