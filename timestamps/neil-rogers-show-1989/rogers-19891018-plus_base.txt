[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]
And now get ready, hell and hell!

[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.580]
Cause live wealth is gonna make your class to be bad.

[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.360]
This Sunday, one afternoon only,

[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.020]
A lasting blue air over the rear door.

[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.380]
Live wealth.

[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.580]
Live wealth.

[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.060]
This is why it really takes us.

[00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.000]
I ever fall in love, I keep...

[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.300]
All day afternoon in a basement work room on the facilities,

[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.760]
Meet a consummate even hell and hell.

[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.800]
Live wealth.

[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.860]
What special guest, let's make a long kiss.

[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.820]
Wake you up!

[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.640]
On the popular press,

[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.720]
Fit black magic.

[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.060]
You're too much.

[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.400]
For a place people in world.

[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.840]
Are you clearly clueless?

[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160]
No, the whole night true.

[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.780]
I bet you think it's unfair now,

[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.200]
We're all calling for a win and dying cup of your real estate.

[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.820]
I don't use it to remember what you probably want.

[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.900]
We're so honest, we're basically close to normal.

[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.640]
A common door comes to push the patient.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.320]
A common door comes to presentation.

[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.320]
It's 11.47.

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.400]
Now that's kinda...

[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.840]
If you missed the Neil Rogers show,

[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.340]
You know that Neil was sick,

[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.780]
But the bird took his place.

[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.360]
Oh, now come on, guys.

[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.760]
The bird had a lot of incident to talk about.

[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.580]
I had a friend of mine years ago,

[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.720]
Jerry Clifton, whose famous in radio,

[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.200]
had a house in Port Lauderdale.

[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.840]
I won't play the golf game.

[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.200]
I'll play you on Neil.

[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.780]
Yeah, we have a great meet-up.

[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.520]
Boy, you know, I can't.

[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.920]
I don't have a promo sheet.

[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.780]
I'm have to look around.

[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.680]
I have a promo sheet.

[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.720]
Should they be paid?

[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.500]
Repatriate.

[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.280]
I have to tell her that word.

[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.380]
Repatriations.

[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.080]
I'll say the same thing that Neil says to me.

[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.160]
I just answer the phone.

[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.920]
All right.

[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.220]
That's it.

[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.220]
We're done with this hour.

[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.920]
Okay, I'm using this to be okay.

[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.300]
All right.

[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.420]
Myer in the newsroom, Chuck.

[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.660]
We're gonna do the news.

[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.760]
All right.

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.620]
And then we're gonna have lunch.

[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.640]
And I will play you on Neil for you.

[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.300]
Okay, Chuck?

[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.320]
Yeah, there he is.

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.600]
I'll play you on Neil for you.

[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.280]
We'll see you then.

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.100]
Don't miss a minute.

[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.780]
The Neil Rogers show.

[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.600]
I'm going to attend a new talk radio 610 WIOD.

[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.100]
That's unbelievable.

[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.300]
I didn't think you could fill this segment like you did.

[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.620]
You still got a little.

[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.520]
Oh, but we could make a lot of noise turn the rack.

[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.660]
It's not squeaking.

[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.980]
Now that we need it, there it goes.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.800]
Scared the crap out of me when I saw that.

[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.260]
Now, Roger told me.

[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.060]
I can't find a cart, my friend.

[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.880]
I don't know what happens.

[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.280]
It's in here somewhere, but we'll continue searching.

[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.620]
You see that?

[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.120]
Why?

[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.420]
He said he is so proud of that guy.

[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.020]
It's six seconds away at the duck.

[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.560]
He said if you need a duck.

[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.120]
Now we've already used the duck.

[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.400]
Oh, screw the duck.

[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280]
He's real proud of that, Kurt.

[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.060]
I can't find it now.

[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.360]
There's wiggle wobble.

[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.940]
Yeah, wiggle wobble is in there.

[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.880]
Yeah, everything else.

[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.620]
And then of course there's.

[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.820]
Or that.

[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.740]
I don't like that.

[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.400]
It is a standing.

[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.760]
Well, we could play a few seconds of beyond.

[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.420]
Get some of those people unupset.

[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.960]
The ones that are all upset about the Donny Osman.

[00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.980]
What?

[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.340]
You want to be on the air?

[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.720]
What do you want?

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.400]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.580]
I didn't want to be on the air now.

[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.180]
Yes, you want to be on the air right now.

[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.720]
Well, I just want to tell you that I would call you back right after this first race only because I didn't get a chance to tell you.

[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.920]
I thought you this morning because we went to the funeral as you know.

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.280]
So they'll there.

[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.580]
And I guess I'll talk to you after the race because they're nearing the gate.

[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.720]
Okay, okay.

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.140]
Bye.

[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.520]

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.820]
Well listen.

[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.080]
What was he talking about?

[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.840]
This is unbelievable segment, this past segment.

[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.080]
He went to the funeral.

[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.100]
I don't know.

[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.500]
Okay, we got Chuck Meyer standing by.

[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.620]
It seems like holding moments ago we were talking with Chuck.

[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.200]
He's got the one o'clock news now.

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.980]
And then we'll come back at 105 with the big one to two hour and find out what the hell fill is talking about.

[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.600]
New shock radio 610 WIO D presents Neil Rogers.

[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:10.900]
To get in touch and talk call 751 WIO D and then 524 WIO D and Broward or 655 and 278 WIO D in the fall beaches.

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.540]
Other areas make all collapse.

[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.540]
The opinions expressed by the host guests or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.560]
Now here's Neil Rogers on new shock radio 610 WIO D.

[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.260]
106 is WIO D. It's the big.

[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.520]
It's the line to two hour.

[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.840]
I almost forgot about that.

[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.240]
Couple of lines in Broward now.

[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.740]
And this is the part of the show where we can't talk because we've had too many of the Italian Isis.

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.760]
Now it's still going to call back now or we're going to have to mess up the whole thing here.

[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.300]
We want him to call in now because Marvin is queuing up that Donny Osman phone call.

[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.200]
Don't refer to it as an interview because it wasn't an interview.

[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.380]
We just a phone call.

[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.620]
Yeah.

[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.580]
Right.

[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.000]
Exactly.

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.160]
You're just my buddy calling on a phone.

[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.240]
Your buddy?

[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.980]
My pal.

[00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.380]
Yeah.

[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.720]
You're good friends.

[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.100]
That's for you.

[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.280]
That's my only comment for you.

[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.620]
I'm sorry it couldn't have been what's your name.

[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.520]
Debbie Phoenix, whatever her name is.

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.760]
What?

[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.560]
Debbie Phoenix, whatever the how her name is.

[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.640]
She's a free no no no.

[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.620]
What's your name?

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.340]
Phoebe.

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.980]
Phoebe Kate.

[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.460]
What do you get to remember her name?

[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.480]
Debbie Phoenix.

[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.220]
Debbie Phoenix.

[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.060]
That's a buzzer.

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.480]
She looks like River Phoenix.

[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.740]
In drag.

[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.140]
Anyway it's 107.

[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.600]
We'll take a call and the guy from Vegas is probably still on there.

[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.460]
I'm still here.

[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.440]
Why isn't it exciting kind of like a link with your past?

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.500]
Ooh yeah.

[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.320]
Without having to set foot down here.

[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.260]
I mean it's like I got a story for you.

[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.100]
You know that's always good.

[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.980]
It's always happened.

[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.180]
We put some phone on hold or spending our money and then we go back just to say

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.360]
I and he started how can I try and I got a couple stories.

[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.880]
You know how they have a lot of conventions here in Vegas.

[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.520]
There was a convention of radio program directors Neil.

[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.240]
I went there and I checked it out and they were all wearing suspenders.

[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.440]
That's the end of the writing.

[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.560]
Just before they get canned.

[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.260]
One of the things here that the producers of the Lawrence Wilkeshire

[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.260]
that used to produce it are suing Michael Jackson for trademark infringement.

[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.040]
You know how like before on the beginning of the Lawrence Wilkeshire they were always

[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.440]
blowing bubbles with that machine.

[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.020]
Yeah.

[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.920]
We'll turn down Michael Jackson to the blowing bubbles before his show too.

[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.000]
Hey hold on.

[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:31.780]
It's on the TV.

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.160]
Sonia and Bert sitting in the tree.

[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.440]
KISS, that's on the NG.

[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.000]
Okay that's I think we're three.

[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.420]
Today on the two of Hill six long.

[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.580]
Oh okay.

[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.200]
I didn't even have to tune in.

[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.380]
I heard you had to show yesterday.

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.620]
Same old douching and the same old talking.

[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.680]
Come on give us a break.

[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.200]
1253 is WI would be.

[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.620]
It's the world of the two hours.

[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.220]
Did you know that Johnny Carson is cab Halloween baby to take flim?

[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.380]
Where did you find that?

[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.360]
I was in the toilet.

[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.640]
Sure is people want to know.

[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.400]
Did you know there's a place just six feet under the earth where you go when you die?

[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.460]
Where's your pig model?

[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.180]
I picked it up in the toilet.

[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.500]
Here's what you'll find in the toilet.

[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.860]
This is where you come from.
