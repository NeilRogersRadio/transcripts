[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]
Well, there's off again. He'll probably be back at WS News.

[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.780]
Right, Robert?

[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.340]
Right.

[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.040]
So what's going on? You have a good new year?

[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.900]
Yeah.

[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.360]
You going to the track tomorrow?

[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.080]
No, I think I get to... I want to...

[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.020]
Well, I bet you they're racing today.

[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.020]
Let me see the sports section. I bet you because it's a holiday. I bet you they're racing today at Colter.

[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.660]
Well, I can't really go. I think my grandpa is a lot really good. So I usually go with him.

[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.160]
Yeah.

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.760]
And what happened?

[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.760]
Um...

[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.540]
I still lost everything I'll do I have.

[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.880]
You lost it all, huh?

[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.220]
Yeah.

[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.360]
Well, that should teach you a good lesson, Robert. I noticed that there were five winners in the lottery that Rebecca Paul, boys.

[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.960]
She's got a great sense of humor, doesn't she?

[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.180]
You notice those numbers she came up with?

[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.640]
20, 30, 40, and if there would have been a 50, she would have used that, but they came up with 49 because that's the last number there, right?

[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.900]
Who the hell are they kidding?

[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.900]
I notice it's about 15, that...

[00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.180]
Yeah.

[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.960]
Yeah. I'm going to bet 50 and 60 next week.

[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.380]
Okay, Robert, well, I wish you good luck, okay?

[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.500]
Right.

[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.060]
Bye.

[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.260]
Now, I don't think they are running today. Although Pompa Dopark is offering free grandstand admission to children 17 and under, beginning with tonight's program.

[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.580]
They're also doing something else tonight.

[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.300]
Um...

[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.100]
And I don't know, I can't remember what it is.

[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.420]
In December, Pompa Dopark announced a senior citizen policy that provides grandstand admission and reserve seat for 75 cents for patrons 55 plus.

[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.100]
Wow.

[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.680]
I'm not saying a word about that.

[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.700]
I've been shocked, but no, there haven't something special I think tonight at Pompa Dopark, and we should have some information here because they're starting on a show very, very soon.

[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.480]
But, uh, it's free.

[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.340]
I shouldn't say it should, unless I'm sure. I think it's free admission for everybody to all levels of the track tonight.

[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.000]
That sounds right.

[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.760]
But they're starting on a regular basis free grandstand admission to children 17 and under, every night starting tonight.

[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.840]
Which is about time that the pyramuchal started really getting into this family bill, right, getting some younger blood out there at the track.

[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.360]
1032 at WIOD, now what were you saying about upstate New York?

[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.300]
I'm, um, now I'm talking about like July or August.

[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.140]
It's when I'm talking.

[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.920]
Definitely the time to go up. Preferably in August.

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:25.400]
That's when I'm talking about like August. I'm going to go up there, and I'm going to go to all these places that I have heard endlessly, you know, said over and over and over.

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.580]
And you know what I'm going to do?

[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.640]
I'm going to have my picture taken in front of these places.

[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.940]
Great.

[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.440]
Why you're up there, by the way, why not go over to Niagara Falls? It's right nearby, right by Buffalo.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.440]
Uh-huh.

[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.960]
And they can cross over. Be sure and take your order.

[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.580]

[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.280]
You go over to Niagara Falls on Tariots.

[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.340]
I'll rip it off.

[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.180]
Get ripped off.

[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.780]
Real bad. You can go to the wax museum and you can go at all those tourist traps over there and get ripped off.

[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.360]
The worst in the history of mankind.

[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.240]
I think I have plenty to do, you know, with Don and Bob's and everything.

[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.380]
Yeah. You're right.

[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.880]
You know, and you want to get a sub, but what's that place in Buffalo where they got the subs?

[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.180]
You'll figure all this out and write it down for me.

[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.120]
And so I have a list when I go up there.

[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.620]
The main street, there's that great place where they have those subs.

[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.380]
You remember.

[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.220]
In fact, uh, Nemo's, remember Nemo's roast cheese?

[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.220]
Sure. And I think it is.

[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.480]
I think it is.

[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.020]
I think it is somehow related to this someplace, and I can't think of the name. Somebody you'll call in.

[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.180]
See, you've probably inspired a lot of upstate New York calls already.

[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.240]
No, that's not the purpose.

[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.760]
Which is exactly what we want of my comments.

[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.340]
1034 at WIOD.

[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.580]
The Palm Beach Line is available.

[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.040]
We just mentioned that in passing,

[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.600]
655-9463-655-WIOD.

[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.360]
And when we come back after a gale,

[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.300]
oh, gale is here answering the musical question in the newsroom is gale bright.

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.360]
And after we do the headlines in his little break,

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.180]
I think we ought to do some carpenters, don't you?

[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.340]
We'll play that one that we got cute up.

[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.300]
I brought in not one, but two albums.

[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.260]
Because I was positive that everybody would have seen that movie last night.

[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.160]
This happens to me all the time.

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.840]
I will watch something on Network TV, which is a rarity for me other than sports.

[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.000]
And come in and talk about it and get all enthused,

[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.840]
and nobody will have seen it.

[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.560]
I don't know why they do this to you.

[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.580]
Yeah, they do this to you all the time.

[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.540]
They're pretty ponderous, you know?

[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.900]
Anyway, I'm sure gale probably saw it has a couple of comments to make during the news.

[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.040]
It's 1034 at WIOD.

[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.800]
Oh, 1038 at WIOD.

[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.720]
Are we going to play that record?

[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.620]
Are you going to talk it up?

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.200]
No.

[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.620]
Oh.

[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.640]
Well.

[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.320]
Back to the Neil Rogers program on 1240 WGVA.

[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.240]
Here again, America's youngest dog, chill host, six-year-old Neil Rogers.

[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.920]
Okay, I guess we're done with Neil.

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.360]
And there's four minutes left in the hour.

[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.080]
Who wants to take some calls?

[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560]
Only. Hello.

[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.380]
There's Neil. How's it going?

[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.620]
Great.

[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.180]
That's good.

[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.220]
Well, so I can't film my subscription to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.540]
Of the Google's DNC.

[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.260]
What an abortion that people are.

[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.560]
Then I asked how many other people did lifeline,

[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.680]
and they said, no, my business.

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.640]
Yeah, well, they're real nice over there.

[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.040]
Okay, well, I just thought I'd let you know.

[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.620]
You're a fine American.

[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.000]
Have a nice life.

[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.320]
Well, hello.

[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.040]
I want to speak to Neil.

[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.660]
You got him.

[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.900]
Am I on?

[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.040]
Yes.

[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.480]
Neil.

[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.840]
You know.

[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.920]
Neil, you're a stinky pink-alglucinif and bedwaters at a pansy.

[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.560]
By call.

[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.360]
This is day so far.

[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.160]
Did he say pansy?

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520]
I don't think he'd get off.

[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.440]
What a mung-brain.

[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.660]
I run my bike 30 miles every Saturday to the list show.

[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.820]
And this guy calls me names.

[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.380]
She's my newtor.

[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.980]
She's on you.

[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.720]
By the way, have you seen some of those bad boys at the new AMP?

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.420]
No one are you cacking about A.

[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.080]
This is my car.

[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.360]
A million producers in the world.

[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.240]
And they fix me in here with some A.

[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.400]
Shit is my car.

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.000]
It's in the castle.

[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.580]
Hello.

[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.600]
How many?

[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.320]
You're supposed to be such a nice boy.

[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.940]
How many of your father?

[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.840]
Yeah, but you can't share it up.

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.600]
You can't share it up.

[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.700]
I wouldn't leave this.

[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.240]
It offers from everstations.

[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.620]
Cotavia, Almira, Fredonia.

[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:55.600]
But instead I stay here and entertain you, protest, subsequent due to bad.

[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.820]
Unbelievable.

[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.140]
To me, but how?

[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.340]
How was this Neil Rogers?

[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.760]
What kind of phone are you on, sir?

[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.260]
How's that again?

[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.120]
Do you have a dial phone or what?

[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.920]
No, I had to put it to the other foreigner.

[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.960]
Let's...

[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.120]
Let's knock him to that.

[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.760]
Hey, I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night.

[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.060]
Somebody asked you.

[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.600]
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?

[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.380]
No, I wasn't anymore.

[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.600]
He's a daughtery old man.

[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.900]
He claims he's only 40.

[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.960]
Yeah, right.

[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.400]
And do we be true in truth?

[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.020]
Oh, shut up.

[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.160]
A girl's a fella.

[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.960]
And if you think he's bad now, what will he have to do?

[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.700]
Oh, oh.

[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.900]
Okay, let me come back.

[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.080]
Maybe the egg will come out of his shell.

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.040]
But I hope not.

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.480]
That is in the movie.

[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.080]
And I just had this feeling that with Phoebe Cage anywhere on the screen.

[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.920]
That's right.

[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.640]
You would not be watching a great movie like the Carpenters movie.

[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:15.380]
They must have taken a long time to film that because there was obviously all lip syncing during the movie.

[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.080]
Because they used all the real records.

[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:17.320]

[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.920]
And she did a great job.

[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.860]
What's the name of that actress?

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.160]
Cindy Gim.

[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.040]
She's very good.

[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.180]

[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:30.080]
And it is a very sad, very traumatic and depressing, and the parents were just...

[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:31.840]
Unconsciously.

[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.100]
And the mother was feeding Richard Kuelood's and the got him hooked on drugs.

[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.480]
And, oh, just beyond belief.

[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.360]
But it ended.

[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.240]
You just wanted to spit out lunch breakfast and dinner and never read again.

[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:42.620]
Correct.

[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.220]
So all of those disgusting jokes about the Carent Carpenter diet that we've done on this show over the last several years.

[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.420]
We won't do those again till tomorrow.

[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:50.840]
Okay.

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.120]
1043 at WIOD.

[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.620]
You know, we do have somebody on the Palm Beach line who saw it, right?

[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.240]
Hi, the L.I.

[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:56.700]
Saw the movie.

[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.280]
And?

[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.020]
It was very depressing.

[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.320]
Yeah, but it was well done.

[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.460]
Yeah, it was very well done.

[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.360]
The music was beautiful.

[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.620]
Kind of like Carent's lunch breakfast and dinner.

[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.200]
Well done.

[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.500]
Very, no very little.

[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.000]
Yeah.

[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.900]
I'll tell you, if she would look like me, she would have killed herself.

[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.140]
What do you mean?

[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.280]
If she would look like me, she would have killed herself 10 years sooner.

[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.080]
No, she did kill herself, but just... she did it slowly.

[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.740]
Yeah, it was really sad.

[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:19.220]
Yeah.

[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.060]
But she was very maladjusted.

[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.220]
You think it was just a parent?

[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.320]
Just a mother?

[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.860]
Well, that's what the story says.

[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.220]
She had no social life.

[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:26.640]
No.

[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.660]
Neither one of them.

[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:28.620]
And...

[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.880]
She was 24 years old and she was living with a brother, which my mother didn't want.

[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.300]
Yeah, there was something a little bit bizarre about that too, you notice?

[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.060]
And then when she got married, which a marriage... is I recall, I think the marriage lasted only a few months.

[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.500]
Yeah, I didn't even know she was married.

[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.760]
Yeah, very, very briefly.

[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.500]
But, you notice the brother was very jealous.

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.920]
There was something going on that didn't come out in the story, you know what I'm saying?

[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.480]
It almost seemed like there was something between them, but they didn't say anything about that.

[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.500]
And then the family was just a little bit too close in some ways.

[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.580]
You know, there was something there that didn't meet the eye.

[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.040]
They had that one scene where she came home and her husband was there with groceries and she was surprised.

[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:04.760]
Yeah.

[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.800]
I didn't understand that.

[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.340]
I figured where else would he be?

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.480]
And she was singing in the background, Masquerade.

[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:10.640]
Yeah.

[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.740]
It was the song they played when the husband was in...

[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.620]
And I'm curious as to what that was supposed to be telling us, you know?

[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.600]
Yeah, I don't know.

[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.400]
Would you remember years ago, there used to be jokes that she was dating Barry Manel?

[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.100]
Well, that would have been pretty humorous.

[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.020]
I could have understand Richard dating Barry Manel.

[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.900]
Me too.

[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.180]
You know, they used to be something that would pop into the paper, but I don't know.

[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.980]
I guess that people around knew that she had all these problems, but if somebody who listened to our records, we didn't have it.

[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.140]
Well, I'll tell you one thing, boy, she had the best voice of any female vocalist that I can think of.

[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.460]
I mean, just an incredible voice was like a musical instrument, just tremendous.

[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.580]
You think stories like her is long on TV?

[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.360]
You think it's really interesting?

[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.340]
Oh, sure.

[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.560]
That she was so messed up.

[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.900]
That's what people are into now, don't you understand?

[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:55.720]
Yeah, no, but that's...

[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.460]
The more messed up you are, like the Liberace story and the...

[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.880]
Yeah, like being a voileo, though.

[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.860]
Well, hey, that's what America's into.

[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.940]
I suppose why I watch it, too, so I guess I'm a voileo, yeah?

[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:05.720]
Me too.

[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.500]
Well, I enjoyed it, but it's kind of a rough thing to have enjoyed.

[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.000]
Yeah, I still want to risk lightly at the end of the movie, but the right wrist, you know?

[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.240]
Yeah, so you don't get channel 12 very clearly?

[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.840]
No, it's clear, but it's not...

[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.120]
When 10 and 12 were both ABC, for example, I would always watch 10

[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.380]
because it was a little sharper.

[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:26.060]
Right.

[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.760]
And the color is a little bit better than 12 on my cable.

[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.340]
Now, that may not be true for everybody in Broward, but where I am on that God-for-Second Continental cable,

[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.660]
12 is a little washy.

[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.140]
It just doesn't have that real sharp crisp like a local station, and it's not.

[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.440]
It's coming from Palm Beach with about 50 miles away.

[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.260]
And they're not going to give you channel 6, are they?

[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.720]
Well, we got channel 6, but the quality on my cable is so bad.

[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.600]
I'm not joking. Yesterday there were times when it was just like snow.

[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.500]
It looked like the Bears Eagles game.

[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.040]
Wow. Well, I worked at channel 12, so I'm glad to have you as a viewer.

[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.300]
Okay, you've got us.

[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:56.720]
Okay.

[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.320]
Okay, bye.

[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:57.840]
Bye, bye.

[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.200]
Thank you.

[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:58.520]
Bye, bye.

[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.440]
10.45 at W-I-O-D, and let's go to beautiful coconut grove. Hello.

[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.260]
How you doing?

[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.800]
Great.

[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:10.860]
Not so that will be last night and also, the only thing I was struck with is that Karen,

[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.020]
well, actually, I don't know one of those kids who haven't had the N-A-D-O of their own.

[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:14.400]
Yeah.

[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.200]
You think with all the money that they made?

[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.160]
Well, they were, the parents just coddled them to the point of being obnoxious.

[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.700]
And then when they came and they bought them that beautiful house and they brought home that plummet fury for dad and all of that,

[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.100]
and the parents were just crushed because they weren't going to move into the house.

[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.980]
They had those big rooms all set up for them.

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.320]
They were 24 years old and they wanted them to live in the house, you know?

[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:44.380]
Unfortunately, I think the situation like that is happens too often when you see kids in the house.

[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.020]
They're involved in show business and then they have these driving parents.

[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:56.960]
And I'm sure that Karen says, not going to be the last story that you'll find where you have over there in parents like that.

[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.180]
Yeah.

[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:07.000]
This, this, this, Chamos, which is really interesting, I think that these stations have made it really more complex than it really ought to be.

[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:17.080]
And believe it or not, because of that, people out there who really don't know which program is going to be aware for instance.

[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.960]
Well, you know, I hate to break the news to them, but for 50 cents or whatever it is, they can go out and buy a TV guide.

[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.680]
Or if they're too cheap to do that, they can actually get their weekend newspaper.

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:34.460]
And for free inside, they'll get that TV book and all they got to do is, I know it's difficult, but if they look in there, they'll find exactly where the programs are going to be.

[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.120]
I know it's a little bit difficult, but trust me, it can be done.

[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.240]
You're talking about 10 or 6 in the snow, right?

[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:41.660]
Yeah.

[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:51.460]
And I was watching, I think there's no 10 or 6 in the 10 or 10 where they were interviewing these people and you know, these people were all confused about where they're favorite programs were.

[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:59.200]
And there's this one lady who said, I don't need to know, she said, when I watch 10 or 6, I get smell and if I want to smell, I'd go back up north.

[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.000]
Yeah, that's cute.

[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:01.740]
Yeah.

[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:07.560]
Okay, thanks a lot for the exciting call. 10, 48, 12 minutes till 11 at WIOD and Open Line in date.

[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.260]
If you move real fast now, we're going to really pick up some steam.

[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.840]
I didn't have any heat.

[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.060]
I didn't have any problem, yes, they looked in the TV guide.

[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.620]
No, because you live right down there by 6 is towered.

[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.460]
And I punched in the channel I wanted and there was the show I wanted.

[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:19.880]
It was a thing.

[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.220]
7-5-1, 9-4-6-3.

[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.240]
Now the only Open Line is in Boka, 278 WIOD.

[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.140]
And we have another caller on one who saw the movie last night.

[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:30.480]
Hello.

[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.660]
You guys are rehashed to the radio, if I'm much more I can say to it.

[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.920]
What's left to say?

[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.220]
I mean, other than the mother, I didn't, I was the father, the mother, when she's, when she's, when she takes me as quail, you'll feel better.

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:40.600]
Yeah.

[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.000]
That was terrible, I didn't realize that to start him on that.

[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.700]
Well, if you ever notice, they always seemed like, and I'm not saying this arcastically, but they seemed like Barbie dolls.

[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.660]
I mean, in real life, you know, they just was something not real.

[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.100]
I wonder if that's not really all happened, basically, you know.

[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.520]
Well, I don't know, but evident, I think Richard wrote that story.

[00:14:59.520 --> 00:14:59.960]
Oh, really?

[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.420]
Didn't they?

[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.560]
I'm pretty sure he did.

[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.760]
And he's got some pretty bitter feelings against the parents, evidently.

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.280]
I guess so.

[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.260]
Her older's got an interesting show, about your extra addicts are on today.

[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.080]
Oh, great.

[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.240]
Mercury and Steve Howell, the baseball player, who was a great player, but...

[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.000]
Alcoholic, yeah.

[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:14.480]
Unbelievable.

[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:15.740]
Anyway.

[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.920]
Well, listen, you got to be on something to watch her, Aldo.

[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.520]
I guess.

[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.960]
What happened, you know, I didn't see the paper, Michigan State, did they get blown away?

[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.700]
Let's not talk about that, okay?

[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.540]
Neil, I really want to know.

[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.320]
3427, Georgia.

[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.020]
Also, was the course game there?

[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.260]
No.

[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.420]
Well, the score doesn't indicate it.

[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.680]
It was lopsided all the way through.

[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.260]
Michigan State played an abomination of a game they suck.

[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.940]
Most of the game, in the first half, especially, was like Duffy Doherty had come back to life.

[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.420]
You know, two yards in a cloud of dust.

[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.280]
Okay.

[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.740]
And this perless man, I'm telling you, he's nothing but a slob.

[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.920]
That's basically what he is.

[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.860]
And the line's thought they were going to hire him for the head coach.

[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.260]
Good.

[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.660]
He'll fit right in there, man.

[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.180]
Bird, when you go to Rochester, wherever you're going, I think it'll be more interesting if you, you know,

[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.920]
Colin wants to go to a major league ballpark and Colin and discuss some baseball games.

[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.620]
Yeah, that'd be a good idea.

[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.240]
No, but, you know, I might call in anyway, but not from a ballpark.

[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.240]
That might not be a good idea.

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:06.540]
Well, how about from where?

[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.180]
From the stadium.

[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:07.700]
Really?

[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.640]
Well, I don't know about that, but I think I should call that week from different places.

[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.960]
From the other stadium in Rochester.

[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.480]
No, the things are playing Buffalo.

[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.080]
I could call you from Don and Bob.

[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:16.820]
That'll be good.

[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.700]
Something like that.

[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.420]
To keep us alert about the sports, I think you have to do, you know, play it by player, you know, for some time.

[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.080]
Now, are you going to be okay because of that way that game came out?

[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.700]
Are you going to be all right?

[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.160]
Well, I've got a lot of friends from Michigan. I just didn't know the score.

[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:27.580]
And I was...

[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.620]
Wait a minute. From Michigan?

[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.260]
Yeah.

[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.000]
Yeah, we've talked a million times.

[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.560]
I got a lot of...

[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.360]
I called you from Detroit.

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.040]
Yeah, but you don't say Michigan.

[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.220]
You mean from Michigan's state?

[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.120]
Well, yes, from Michigan.

[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.020]
Because then people think you mean university in Michigan.

[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:38.260]
You're not saying Michigan.

[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.280]
They always say to me, oh yeah, University of Michigan's playing, you went there.

[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.460]
And I say, don't you understand?

[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.100]
Are you really that dumb that the University of Michigan and Michigan's state aren't the same?

[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:46.940]
No, it's...

[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.180]
It's like saying that FSU and the University of Miami are the same.

[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.700]
I agree.

[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.820]
It's totally different.

[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.120]
He's planting the fun place and...

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.820]
And Arbor's like...

[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.740]
Oh, and Arbor's the fun place.

[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.220]
It's all right.

[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:57.600]
Yeah.

[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.660]
Why is there hands several times after they go to the bathroom?

[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.080]
I can't believe you remember that.

[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.400]
Have a great day.

[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:04.860]
Take care.

[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.400]
10.50 won at WIOD and we'll be right back after this.

[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.320]
You can't hear it.

[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.060]
The first day of the New Year for us, and boy, we're real excited about it.

[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.900]
We're thrilled to be here.

[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.160]
Coral Springs. Hello.

[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.280]
Yeah, good morning, Neil. How are you?

[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:17.620]
Great.

[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.020]
All right. Coral, first to thank you for CYAM's doll.

[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.400]
It was absolute delight.

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.360]
We'd never even heard of the place, but because of your radio,

[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.300]
your little plug on the radio, we went there the other night.

[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.800]
It was last week, and it was absolutely delicious.

[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.480]
Yeah, sensational.

[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.900]
And they're nice people, everybody.

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.880]
Very nice people.

[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.760]
Unfortunately, they were sort of empty.

[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.340]
I think it was Christmas night or something.

[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:38.600]
Yeah.

[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.280]
Well, now that, you know, between thanks, giving a New Year's for most restaurants is a pretty dead time.

[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:43.680]

[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.800]
Now that all of this stuff is out of the way, finally, we'll get back to abnormal.

[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.520]
But it was delicious.

[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.140]
Absolutely.

[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:49.700]
It was absolutely delight.

[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.620]
I'm glad we heard about it.

[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:50.740]
Good.

[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.660]
And we told them we heard it from you.

[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.300]
Of course.

[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.260]
And my wife works in an office that has a lot of blue hairs.

[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.340]
So she's not allowed to turn on your station during the day,

[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.800]
and I keep telling her about some of the rather strange songs like Candy Bar or your asshole song that I hear,

[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.880]
and she says, that's impossible.

[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.340]
They don't have that kind of stuff on the radio.

[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:10.860]
Of course not.

[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.400]
But I have my wife home today, as well as a lot of work.

[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.320]
Well, actually, you know what I'm glad that she's home.

[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.520]
We're not going to play any requests today, but some of those might actually get in there before the day is out.

[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.660]
Right. We're hoping it will.

[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.160]
We're going to keep you tuned in all day.

[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:23.540]
Great.

[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.480]
We'll save it for the last half hour.

[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:25.960]
Okay.

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:26.680]
Nice talking, man.

[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.580]
Okay. I'm no fool.

[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.260]
Have a nice day.

[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.960]
1055 at WIOD.

[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.820]
No requests today.

[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.280]
Those of you who are just occasional listeners who are off from work and think that you can call in.

[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.000]
And in some sneaky, backdoor way, you're getting a request or a suggestion.

[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.860]
Forget it, because we don't play that game anymore.

[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.200]
Okay.

[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.040]
When we're ready to play this stuff, we'll let you know.

[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.620]
In fact, probably the surest to clue will be that you'll hear it.

[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.640]
And then you'll know we're playing it.

[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:51.540]
Okay. There's an open line in date.

[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:52.980]
And in Broward, look at that.

[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.360]
A little crisis on the phone.

[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.660]
751 WIOD in date.

[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.980]
524-9463 in Broward.

[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.560]
I can't believe Rich had a run in out front the other day.

[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.400]
Way up there in the front end.

[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.480]
I don't want to mention any names.

[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.480]
But what are we going to do about her?

[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.500]
I don't know what the story is, but Surley.

[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.680]
Just real.

[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.300]
Surley.

[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:12.800]
Yes.

[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.000]
That's correct, Roger.

[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.860]
Did you have to ask?

[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.180]
Everyone says the same thing.

[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.680]
Nasty.

[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.180]
Awesome.

[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.680]
We just have to try to enlighten her up a little bit.

[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.240]
Let her stop taking life so seriously.

[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:22.620]
Okay.

[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.420]
Don't want to mention any names.

[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.700]
Fort Lauderdale.

[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:24.980]
Hello.

[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:25.760]
Hello.

[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.400]
Yeah.

[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.460]
Hey, I'm a first time caller.

[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.740]
I'll be gosh darned.

[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.920]
And I'm from West Virginia.

[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.820]
I couldn't tell.

[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.360]
No.

[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.180]
Well, I just wanted to say happy new year to you.

[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.060]
And the same to you.

[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:38.940]
Thank you very much.

[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:39.800]
And go Mountaineers.

[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:40.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.580]
Good luck to you.

[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.840]
Hey, we're going to win.

[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.420]
I don't think so, but good luck to you.

[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.300]
Why do you say that?

[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.840]
Well, I think Notre Dame could be a little tough for you.

[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.760]
But you know, you never know.

[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.940]
Go out there and give it your best shot.

[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.460]
Like Michigan State did last night.

[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:51.960]
Yeah, right?

[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:52.680]
Right.

[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.720]
Wasn't good enough, but they gave it their best.

[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.120]
Sure.

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.880]
Well, I just wanted to say that I don't understand what you complain about down here.

[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.220]
It's just so wonderful living down here.

[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.420]
But no, do you live here?

[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.020]
How long you been here?

[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.560]
Oh, I've been here three months.

[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.620]
Oh, three months, yeah.

[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.240]
Wow.

[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.520]
That qualifies you as an expert.

[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.760]
There's no question about that.

[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.960]
Oh, you got all these modern conveniences in the big old town.

[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.500]
Yeah, I know.

[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.360]
Like flush toilets and running water, hot and cold, I know.

[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.680]
It's even in the house.

[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.240]
I know.

[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.060]
It's frightening in it.

[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.840]
But we do have some ported jones for people like to, you know, feel like they're still at home.

[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:25.740]
Right.

[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.720]
Right, I understand.

[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.780]
In fact, if you go to Hellendale, they got a special, a portable jone there for all of politicians.

[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.120]
I've heard of Hellendale.

[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.760]
I hear all the rich people live down there.

[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.060]
Yeah.

[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.240]
Yeah, and they still got every day they were born with, man.

[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.620]
Well, I just want to know that since I moved down here, I started wearing shoes again.

[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.160]
Yeah.

[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.900]
And I quit having babies.

[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:45.700]
I'll be damned.

[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.020]
Well, that's great.

[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.880]
But anyway.

[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.660]
We got a lady just moved in from Nashville.

[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.660]
I bet you shoot you and her just hit it off great.

[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.980]
We'll get you in touch with her, okay?

[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:54.980]
Okay, great.

[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.260]
Okay, y'all have a great time.

[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.420]
Good luck, Mountaineers.

[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.400]
Yeah, go Mountaineers.

[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:58.760]
Okay.

[00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.300]
Bye.

[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.160]
Bye-bye.

[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.540]
It's 1058 at WIOD.

[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.000]
Now, pretty soon.

[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.740]
Now, what time does the first bull game come on?

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.380]
By the way, Calder is closed today.

[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.500]
And I don't know why I would have thought maybe it's because of the bull games.

[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.020]
But last week, they did race on Monday.

[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.600]
And they were closed Tuesday.

[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.260]
But this week, they are closed in Calder a day.

[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.400]
They'll race tomorrow, I guess.

[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.620]
I'm sure.

[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.040]
And Pompano was open tonight.

[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.160]
Now, what time's the first game on?

[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.940]
They've got just pages and pages.

[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.540]
The only pages I have is there aren't any pages.

[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.100]
We'll try to get a few extra minigames.

[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.480]
Next year, the good news for you is there will be two more.

[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.220]
Only two?

[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.020]
Now, the cotton bull starts at 130.

[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.660]
That, of course, is UCLA.

[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.460]
Can you make it to 130?

[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.020]
And, um, what are they playing?

[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.160]
Oh, Arkansas.

[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.440]
The hogs.

[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.460]
Or is that the razor backs?

[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.000]
I don't know.

[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.820]
I get that all confused.

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.620]
Now, how many, uh, does an hour's to, well, this one won't be-

[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.080]
Now, the fiesta bulls at 440.

[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.700]
That's a big one.

[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.380]
That's a 10p if we can say that.

[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.360]
That's a Notre Dame West Virginia.

[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.680]
That's only that we just call in about only moments ago.

[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.240]
Only about 10, 11 hours of this.

[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.740]
That's, uh, I don't know if that's enough.

[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.500]
So the first one's 130.

[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.820]
I would think there'd be something starting much sooner than that.

[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.380]
Well, I think they already go in.

[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:17.640]
Probably.

[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.360]
And we probably see Bob Barker out there marching against, uh,

[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.480]
for coats and stuff.

[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.940]
Okay, it's 10.59.

[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.380]
That means the news is upcoming with Gil right at 11 o'clock.

[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.400]
We will come back with three more hours on his great holiday.

[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.340]
We hope you stick around.

[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.060]
We might even actually get a little bit of a chance.

[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.520]
We'll hopefully play some of the stuff that you want to hear.

[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.920]
We definitely are playing more carpenters, okay?

[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:34.280]
Good.

[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.400]
Which will help us get through lunch real easy.

[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.580]
And we'll be back at 11 o'clock.

[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.380]
Steve is working this afternoon.

[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.660]
Believe it or not, he's going to be here to bitch about it from two until six.

[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.500]
What a way to start the new year, right?

[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.940]
We got an open line in Peron Beach.

[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.860]
655 WIOD.

[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.180]
We've had some really brilliant calls from a Palm Beach County Concord today.

[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:53.380]
Oh, boy.

[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.400]
And Nick has another caustic one of his notes on here.

[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.900]
One of his depressing morbid notes.

[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.940]
It says the carpenters are one of the few groups that were worse than the

[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.700]
Partridge family, okay?

[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.960]
He's comparing the carpenters to the Partridge family.

[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.420]
So when you call it on the show today, tell Nick he's a subhuman douchebag

[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.080]
and that his taste in music is, well, we can't say where.

[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.260]
Right next to Jupiter.

[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.820]
It's 11 till noon at WIOD.

[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.120]
Two days in a day here on TV 12.

[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.760]
Great shows come your way.

[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.540]
Whatever you turn to 12.

[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.660]
The price is right here.

[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.080]
And guiding lights here.

[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.120]
Someone to turn to TV 12.

[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.580]
The young and the restless as the world turns and Falcon crest.

[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.740]
These are some of the great CBS shows now on TV 12.

[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.840]
They join your favorite programs.

[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.700]
We look fortune and TV 12 eyewitness news.

[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.760]
In South Florida, the one to turn to for CBS's TV 12.

[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.700]
Your favorite programs will bring them all to you.

[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.900]
Daytime and prime time South Florida with you.

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.420]
With CBS since 12, Steve, you're watching the best team.

[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.180]
You're at the heart of it.

[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.640]
12 is the part of it.

[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.520]
The ones to turn to TV 12.

[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.040]
We've got twice the traffic, twice the airborne coverage and date and

[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:27.780]
broad and twice the qualified traffic staff to bring you to work at home twice as fast.

[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:33.120]
Now, more with Neil Rogers on News Talk Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.740]
1153 at WIOD.

[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.860]
I've got an incredible Carpenter's story.

[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.280]
Carpenter's radio story.

[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:44.140]
I was working at WIOS News and she died on a Saturday afternoon or Saturday night.

[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.900]
And I was doing Sunday mornings.

[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.260]
I think I was still doing eight to midnight during the week.

[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.080]
I was doing Sunday morning show from 10 to 2.

[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.340]
So I came on, I'd heard the news and I gathered up all of my Carpenter stuff.

[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.900]
I came in early and I carted it up because actually over there you could get in the production studio.

[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:10.260]
I'm like here and I carted up all the Carpenter's hits and I did a tribute to the Carpenter's because she had just died.

[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.740]
And I'm sitting there and playing the music and I see the bat line is ringing.

[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.300]
So the board up and I picked it up at the same time.

[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.660]
And I hear this voice.

[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.220]
It was the former general mangler of WNWS Lou Kron.

[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.020]
We used to call him Drone on the Throne Cron.

[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.180]
And he's saying, what's he doing?

[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:29.780]
What's he doing?

[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.660]
And the board upset he's doing a music tribute to Carpenter.

[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.860]
She died yesterday.

[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.860]
Well, whatever the hell he's doing, make sure he gives the call to let people know we haven't changed the format.

[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.760]
I just got to call for him when he's Sudbreak and he wants to know what the hell's going on.

[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.540]
Now, back in those days, I had like 10 and 11 shares at night.

[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.900]
I had number one show in the market by so far and these idiots in management in this business,

[00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:02.560]
oh, he didn't give the call letters and I'm thinking, oh my god, it was so typical of the kind of idiots that are the powers that be in this business.

[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:08.700]
Like because we took one day and did something a little bit different right away, the whole audience was going to have a panic.

[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:15.240]
You know, I mean, I came on between every couple of cuts and I said what we were doing and there was no big deal.

[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.680]
Typical of this businessman, absolute and he was hostile about like, well, what the hell is he doing?

[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.200]
Whatever this thing is he's doing.

[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.200]
Yeah, it's called music, you idiot.

[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.980]
You subhuman douchebag.

[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:38.060]
Yeah, the former general manager at WNWS, boy, was he a piece of work, man.

[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:43.860]
I've never forget the stories when I was in Nashville for those exciting couple of weeks or it was there a month.

[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:53.560]
And Jerry Williams was the program director at WNWS and of course Jerry is so far above and beyond what was going on over there at that time.

[00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:02.220]
And he used to go and have these screaming, ranting sessions with a crone and one time threatened to turn the desk over on him and had it about halfway up in the year.

[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.720]
And I would have paid admission to finish the job. I'll tell you that. Miami, hello.

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.320]
Hi Neil, how are you doing?

[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:10.800]
Okay.

[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.280]
And the YouTuber.

[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:13.220]
Okay.

[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.080]
I'm going to be an opposite of whatever.

[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.260]
But he said, you know, happy new year to everybody. We appreciate it. But let's get on with the show.

[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:29.800]
I know.

[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.340]
Hey, Neil, I was so depressed last night after watching that show.

[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:33.640]
Yeah.

[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.360]
I went out. I got a gallon of cookies and cream.

[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.400]
Did you?

[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.560]
I'm telling you I was a good.

[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.040]
I hear about half of it.

[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:40.240]
Yeah.

[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.080]
It was tragic.

[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.440]
Got a little lettuce on the side.

[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.040]
Oh, no, well.

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.800]
Hey, look, I've got to, I got to.

[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.740]
The saddest part of the whole thing is when they finally got her straightened out and rehabilitated.

[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:56.280]
And she sat down on Thanksgiving and ate a turkey dinner and had stuffing and two helpings of turkey and potatoes.

[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.780]
And she went upstairs and her mother after all this time finally was able to say I love you.

[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.580]
I love you, Brian.

[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.800]
And she croaked, you know, she, her heart rate.

[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.420]
She couldn't believe it. I mean, evidently, as she was so shocked that that's what did it.

[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.020]
It was just right around Thanksgiving time, wasn't it?

[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.740]
Well, evidently, it was on Thanksgiving night or the weekend.

[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.380]
Yeah.

[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.460]
Anyway, see, I have the exact opposite problem with what Karen has.

[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.880]
I'm thin, but can't get it.

[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:26.600]
Really?

[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.740]
Boy, it breaks my heart.

[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.240]
I'm on you with my fist, okay?

[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.020]
I'd like to take a mallet and just beat your brains out.

[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.160]
I have to tell you I'm on TV.

[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.120]
I don't want to hear about it.

[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.980]
I have six, two, and 150 pounds.

[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.960]
I don't want to hear about it.

[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.020]
I can't stand it.

[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.540]
I just detest people like you.

[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.520]
They just keep eating and eating and shoveling it down and never getting an ounce.

[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.780]
Exactly. I mean, I eat two sandwiches for lunch every day.

[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.460]
I'll bet you do.

[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.840]
And, you know, I have healthy mayonnaise.

[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.020]
I eat lots of pasta.

[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:54.660]
Yeah.

[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.780]
Good. I hope you get a cholesterol kind of 600, okay?

[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.060]
And diet, nasty, definitely.

[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.600]
You turn me on to the pizza last day.

[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.100]
Great. It's fantastic, isn't it?

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.020]
Oh, my God.

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.360]
Yeah.

[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.440]
It's orgasmic.

[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.860]
Good. I hope they shovel it down.

[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.580]
You throw it with a shoe home, okay, sir?

[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.320]
I hope you get terminal belching in the...

[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.020]
By the way, Neil.

[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.220]
Follonious flatulence.

[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.020]
By the way, Neil, you're not...

[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.900]
I know you're not going through games, so I don't...

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.560]
That is correct.

[00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.220]
I have no interest in that game.

[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.820]
And if that makes me a bad guy, so be it, I couldn't give it to him unless.

[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:25.440]
Hey, book.

[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.660]
And if Nebraska does happen to win, hey, you know, so life goes on.

[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.420]
Absolutely.

[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.800]
You know, to eat cheese on and...

[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.920]
I went to Michigan State, sir, and we lost last night with real distinction in class.

[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.380]
They stunk the place out.

[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.560]
I know, I was watching the game.

[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.820]
They make me sick.

[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.420]
They couldn't win a fixed game at Michigan State.

[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.240]
And then you see that purlyse man, he looks like...

[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.760]
Oh, he is a good guy.

[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.260]
Remember, sir, calm down, sir.

[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.220]
He is a good guy.

[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.020]
You remember Abe Gibber and it used to coach the Bears who weighed about 700 pounds

[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.700]
who made that reach look like Minnie Mouse?

[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.520]
All right, fellas.

[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.620]
That's who purlyse looks like.

[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.960]
This guy was so ugly last night.

[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.240]
Yeah.

[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.840]
If he was absolutely a combination of the television.

[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.820]
Well, all of the players were ugly on both teams, sir, which I can't watch in a car.

[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.680]
By the way, that reminds me, Neil.

[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.360]
Here we go.

[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:13.600]
Yep.

[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.440]
The call has been so but so far.

[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.040]
So why can't you just keep it that way?

[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.160]
Well, weeks away, and then you can see the center fielder for the U.M.

[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.120]
I can't wait, sir.

[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.940]
I'm telling you, this guy is okay.

[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.160]
Okay, have a nice life.

[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:28.400]
Yeah.

[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.180]
Oh, I'm afraid.

[00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.980]
I'm just going to say Ron Fraser is just doing cartwheels.

[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.640]
Now, see, Ron told me years ago that he always tries to find the ugliest players on the team

[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.240]
because then if they got to run into a fence, no problem.

[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.400]
They're not worried about their cosmetics, you know, about keeping their face lift up and all that stuff.

[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.720]
Anyway, that's going to do it for this hour.

[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:51.040]
And we have just whizzed by, if you pardon that expression, whizzed by two hours here on this first day of the New Year.

[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.220]
Roger, happy New Year too.

[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.960]
You have a wonderful life and that's you on Friday.

[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.760]
Oh, it was different, boy.

[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.540]
It was sure different.

[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.580]
April, worth of my believe is in the...

[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:04.400]
No, she's not there.

[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:04.760]
Gail?

[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.520]
Gail is still there, boy.

[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.020]
That Gail.

[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.780]
While we're doing a little punishment on Gail today for that show she would Steve that day.

[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.120]
Yeah.

[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.300]
She's going to be in there till midnight and then we'll come back at the 1205.

[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.200]
Lion.

[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.540]
I can't find it.

[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.080]
You know, I get full of all that food on my face.

[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.440]
I know, I'm going to punch.

[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:20.460]
I'm going to punch.

[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.300]
I know.

[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.120]
A wreck.

[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.320]
That's what I am.

[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.660]
A mess.

[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.440]
Well, here's the carpenters again.

[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.060]
And there's Barry Manalo.

[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:29.840]
Look at that.

[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.740]
My page is away.

[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.220]
You think that's just an omen and you see who he's with?

[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.140]
That's interesting.

[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.080]
And you do notice that you never saw Richard Carpenter and Barry Manalo together at the same time.

[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.200]
Mystery of the dancing cop.

[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.120]
He told bosses he was disabled then landed a job at Chipendale.

[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.540]
Oh, what a story.

[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.620]
You see, you got to have this magazine.

[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.240]
I keep telling you what happens to the black Elvis.

[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.520]
I think there's Liberace who looks a little bit like the black Elvis.

[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.000]
Yeah, you're in the right neighborhood.

[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.320]
Getting more.

[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.580]
Here's the white Elvis.

[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.220]
There's a big thing about the colonel.

[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.000]
It says how the colonel shafted Elvis.

[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.580]
New book.

[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.200]
Dick Volengos spent 11 years researching Parker's management of the millions made by Elvis.

[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.700]
And concludes that the colonel got the best of the deal.

[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.640]
Now that is the colonel.

[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.200]
The colonel.

[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:26.220]
The colonel.

[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.580]
That's right.

[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.920]
The colonel has the boy that you wanted.

[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.300]
And now he's taking a dime.

[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.320]
Yeah, that curl.

[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.240]
How a barber bush lost an ugly 157 pound.

[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.200]
You got rid of George.

[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.680]
I don't see the black Elvis.

[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.480]
He was in here.

[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.880]
Yes, I saw it.

[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:44.820]
And I think, oh, here he is.

[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.640]
Teen sensation.

[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.820]
They're calling the black Elvis.

[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.080]
Al be sure.

[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.160]
Al be sure.

[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.380]
Al be black.

[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.560]
And Al definitely, as I said, do not be Elvis.

[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.080]
Okay.

[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:04.880]
Courts of screaming female fans hurling bras and panties on stage is being held as the black

[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.460]
Elvis by a new generation of teeny buffers.

[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.840]
One of the steamy singers, Biggest Fans, is Madonna.

[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:16.080]
Yeah, that's how he loves to work out to the 20 year olds pulsating.

[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.440]
Yes, music.

[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:18.820]
Oh.

[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:27.000]
Oh, let me say again, she loves to work out with his 20 year old.

[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:33.000]
He also reminds her of her screen art, Idol, Marlon Brando.

[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:33.600]
What?

[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.520]
My God.

[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:41.880]
Speaking more advice on handling his frenzy fans, the younger singer also turned to Michael Jackson's

[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.940]
main man, Quincy Jones.

[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.380]
See, if Marlon Brando was mentioned in the article, and not too far beyond it, it has to

[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.920]
be Michael Jackson, right?

[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:48.680]
Every time.

[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:49.200]
Right.

[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.840]
Anyway, it's eight minutes past noon at WI of the one thing I promise you, because I know

[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.740]
there are a lot of people out there get hysterical when they hear the carpenters like Nick.

[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.920]
He has no taste at all.

[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.220]
His taste in music absolutely sucks.

[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.960]
And tomorrow we're going to bring in the partridge family, just an honor and nick, just to adjuditate

[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.200]
him and get him hysterical.

[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:06.680]

[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.860]
And every group that he puts on there, and believe me, I've got him.

[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.940]
I've got a library that's second only to Johnny Dark, and that's because I never got a chance

[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.460]
to steal all the albums that he did.

[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.280]
But any group you don't like, man, we'll bring in here, we'll do like a whole serenade for

[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:21.420]
you.

[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.280]
Yeah, see, I was only going to play one or two, but because we want to make your new year

[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.460]
old, Richard Fullman.

[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.700]
And we got some lettuce for you too for lunch, so stick around.

[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.060]
Just a little tiny bit.

[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:34.320]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.360]
I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.360]

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.360]

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.360]

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.360]

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.360]

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.380]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:34.520]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.040]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.640]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.640]

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.640]

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.640]

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.640]

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.640]

[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:01.640]

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:01.660]

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:01.660]

[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:01.660]

[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.400]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.020]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:37.000]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.000]

[00:36:54.380 --> 00:37:06.980]
And I'm going to play a little bit.

[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.160]
I don't know how anybody could not like the Carpenter's, but there are some sour

[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.720]
pushes in the world and just have no taste.

[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.160]
It's 11th at WIOD.

[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.320]
Are you getting a big bang out of that magazine?

[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.200]
That's quite a little magazine.

[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.180]
Yeah, I like the one about the preacher.

[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.140]
We're at 13 children with his daughters.

[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:42.780]
Mm-hmm.

[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.600]
Buy his daughters.

[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:44.900]
Miami, hello.

[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.320]
Hi there, Neil. How are you?

[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:46.620]
Good.

[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.640]
It's Cookie again. Hi, Bird.

[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:49.360]
Cookie.

[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:50.080]
Yes.

[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.340]
I'd like to tell you I'm not getting married.

[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.540]
You told me that last time.

[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.800]
Everybody, everybody call me saying,

[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.480]
you're getting married for no...

[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:57.680]
What?

[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.440]
Well, when I called you last week,

[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.120]
apparently at the end,

[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:04.100]
you said Cookie soon to be married

[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.060]
and everybody called me up.

[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.320]
You're getting married?

[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:07.660]
I'm like, no.

[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.580]
I don't have any idea what you're talking about Cookie,

[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.180]
but you're not the first one.

[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.140]
You're not supposed to.

[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.940]
Yeah, I don't expect you to remember every call.

[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:14.520]
Okay.

[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.020]
Whatever you say, Cookie.

[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:17.940]
Sorry about that.

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.180]
But I did get to see the carpenter story

[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.820]
not on this entirety because I thought I wasn't home.

[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.660]
But I was really shocked.

[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.740]
I don't know. I was shocked when the mother was talking to the psychiatrist.

[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:29.440]
Yeah.

[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.000]
And he said,

[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.020]
you, well, you got to say,

[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.440]
I love you, you know?

[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.060]
And he's like,

[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.320]
it's not our way.

[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:35.800]
Yeah.

[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.740]
I mean, what kind of a mother does not say,

[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.520]
I love you to come.

[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.320]
Well, what kind of a mother feeds quailudes

[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.180]
to her son to go to sleep at night, you know?

[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:43.320]
Yeah.

[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.860]
Obviously, the family was just a little bit screwed up.

[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.780]
I thought that was really bizarre.

[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:48.340]
Yeah.

[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.860]
I mean, because my, I mean,

[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.680]
well, Cubans are really affectionate anyway,

[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.220]
but, I mean, my family,

[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.000]
I mean, you say goodbye on the telephone

[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.660]
and you'll live in a little bit.

[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.960]
And I know those Cubans are real affectionate, believe me,

[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.420]
especially when nobody's looking.

[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.840]
You know what I mean, cookie?

[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:03.540]
Yeah, I know it.

[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.240]
I bet you do.

[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:04.540]
Yeah.

[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.560]
Also, I hope you have a great new year.

[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.180]
Okay, you too.

[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.900]
And squash all those rumors for us, okay?

[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:12.760]
I'll try.

[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.540]
Whatever the hell they were.

[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.000]
What, oh, I'm sorry.

[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.300]
No, no, I'm just, it's just a joke, cookie.

[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.920]
Have a good one.

[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:19.400]
You too.

[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.080]
1213 at WIOD,

[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.080]
we have an opening in date.

[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.520]
If you move real fast now,

[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.520]
751 WIOD,

[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.660]
that 7519463 will be right back.

[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.660]
Steve Kane is South Florida's

[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.620]
highest rated afternoon talk shows.

[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.980]
Find out why weekday afternoons

[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.200]
from 2 to 6 right here.

[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.300]
Now, more of Neil Rogers,

[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.400]
a new Stark Radio 610,

[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:42.880]
WIOD.

[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.420]
1216 at WIOD,

[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.960]
we have something shocking

[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.780]
that we've just discovered in the weekly,

[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]
what is the name of that thing?

[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.660]
Weekly World News.

[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.340]
Not to be confused with the weekly news.

[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:53.680]
Correct.

[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.940]
This is a unique college that's opening.

[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.220]
It's for stupid people.

[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.660]
Perfect for most talk show callers, okay?

[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.840]
And it's a stupid people can get different degrees.

[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.980]
And it's going to be opening in the door.

[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.020]
And also people in radio management qualified automatically.

[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.680]
Don't even have to take an entrance exam.

[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.340]
If you're in radio management,

[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.260]
they immediately will give you entrance into this university, okay?

[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.280]
Now, here's some of the classes you can take, Mitch.

[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.340]
Bitch pay attention to this.

[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.780]
You may want to take some of these classes at this new college.

[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.760]
Camel management.

[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.640]
Especially the camel said inhabit the goby desert.

[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.120]
You can be a clarifying man.

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.100]
Yeah, UFOs spotting bird watching with special emphasis

[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.220]
on the songbirds of the Ukraine.

[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.620]
Professional pin-pal management.

[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.020]
Artist modeling, posing nude for hours on end

[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.800]
is a very special skill, of course.

[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.200]
Chicken and turkey plucking.

[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.360]
Oh, yeah, that's one of my favorite.

[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.940]
Now, they're also going to include Mitch,

[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.660]
ducks, geese, doves, and quail.

[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.200]
Bicycle riding.

[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.520]
Now, this is a good course to get a degree.

[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.700]
And that's a very, very desirable degree.

[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.280]
Don't you think if you take a bicycle riding?

[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.820]
So I have more information on it.

[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.700]
Also gourmet donut dunking,

[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.220]
you can take a course in there.

[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.400]
And here's a man,

[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.320]
and there's another article here on the same page.

[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:18.060]
A man in Oklahoma City who suffered physical damage to his right elbow.

[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.720]
It was from leaning on a blackjack table for 18 straight hours.

[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:25.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.020]
I'm spot coming up at 24.

[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.660]
I just mentioned this in passing.

[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.540]
For which are illustrious continuity department has given me all the way.

[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.180]
I do have some stuff from Roy Slanthoff.

[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.320]
Thank goodness this is kind of a backup.

[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.340]
So we will do it.

[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.300]
But just astonishes me.

[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.520]
You know, you know that old saying,

[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.560]
what is it that they do?

[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.920]
We used to wonder that at the other place.

[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.120]
Now, we know that if you have food brought in here,

[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.540]
that they do spend a lot of time eating.

[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.320]
No question about that.

[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.100]
Well, we got about like 7,000 people

[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.860]
that wanted the halls here ordinarily.

[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.780]
Of course, they're all off on a busman's holiday today.

[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.860]
But, you know, maybe somebody in the audience can send us a postcard

[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.780]
and let us know what these people do during the week.

[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.020]
Other than come in like make sure every other Friday and pick up those checks.

[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.180]
Just like at the other place.

[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.100]
Because it's frightening.

[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.240]
We don't also have a pump in a one-a-log.

[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.220]
Do we? Would you just check between now and two?

[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.000]
Because I know they start either today or tomorrow.

[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.340]
I'm praying that it's tomorrow.

[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.860]
Okay. Thank God for that.

[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.360]
They're incredible.

[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.340]
Who is all the people that work here?

[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.780]
The people in continuity.

[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:28.940]
What is her name? Laura.

[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.580]
She's a very, very nice young lady.

[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.680]
She eats a wicked meal.

[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.860]
Man, you put any food downstairs.

[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.580]
She will suck it up in no time at all.

[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.120]
But this copy, man, it's like little pieces of paper here and scraps over there.

[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.300]
In fact, in the waist basket, there are four or five spots that start next week.

[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.700]
Okay, it's 1219 to WIOD.

[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.560]
Bokeh, hello.

[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.700]
Nail bird.

[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.700]
Good y'all, Jeff.

[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.860]
I just want to wear a neck neck.

[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.100]
You're a sub-human douchebag.

[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.100]
I can't believe you don't like the carpentry music.

[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.080]
Watch what the gig neck.

[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.100]
You'll cut your officer.

[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.780]
And if he does, it'll be his last living neck.

[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.400]
They all his teeth fall out except one so he can have a coffee.

[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.840]
He'd break the news to you, sir.

[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.920]
But that only happens.

[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:09.120]
They have a broad turn to whiskey so that 100 bet bugs get drunk on it and dance to Mizzurka in his belly part.

[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:09.680]
There you go.

[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.020]
Good suckers, gentlemen.

[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.820]
Okay, excellent call.

[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.960]
20 minutes past noon at WIOD and I second that emotion that Smokey would say.

[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.760]
We have an open line and you shouldn't say Smokey because he probably don't like the miracles either.

[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.480]
Right? Don't like the miracles?

[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.340]
Oh yeah, down. Thumbs down.

[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.180]
How about Martha and the Vandela's?

[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:29.600]
So so?

[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.080]
He doesn't even know who that is.

[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.540]
Don't know who that is.

[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:32.800]

[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.520]
How about what's his name, the Black Elvis?

[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.020]
Albie Baird? Albie Shurr?

[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:40.680]
Albie Shurr?

[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.680]
I don't like him either.

[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.140]
Okay, there's an open line and Broward now if you would dare to talk to Nick.

[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.540]
524 WIOD.

[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.900]
In fact, we're waiting for that special call from Richard Carpenter is going to be calling me before the end of the show.

[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:53.520]
Oh, well.

[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.740]
And we will be playing one more Carpenter's cut this hour.

[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:56.880]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.320]
Okay, in spite of all of his protests.

[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.040]
And then tomorrow it's the Partridge family on WIOD.

[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.900]
My Emmy, hello.

[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:05.560]
Hi Neil.

[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:05.960]
Yeah.

[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.340]
Good.

[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:06.960]
How you doing?

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:07.380]
Fine.

[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.100]
And we also have a few David Cassidy solos just to rub it in.

[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.640]
Hey, I'm David Cassidy.

[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.260]
Yeah, you sound just like Friday, right?

[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:15.520]

[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:16.640]
Yeah, there you go, Rod.

[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.520]
Let's go and tell you.

[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.400]
It was down in Florida City.

[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.240]
I figured out where all those Canadians are breeding.

[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.240]
Really?

[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.940]
It comes down in my great town here.

[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.840]
Oh, it's terrible.

[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:30.420]
It is bad.

[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.500]
You have to see that, Neil.

[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.500]
Okay, well, whatever you say, it sounds kind of boring to me.

[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:35.720]
Sure.

[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.660]
We have an open line in date, 751 WIOD, that's 751.

[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.840]
In fact, we're down to four stinking calls on the board of this board.

[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.840]
Oh, really?

[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:43.260]
Yeah.

[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.140]
I told you.

[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.900]
This is going to be just like last Monday.

[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.580]
Nobody in the business works on these two days, okay?

[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.260]
On the official holiday of Christmas and New Year's.

[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:56.740]
Only at this God forsaken douchebag place does the upper level management sit at home.

[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:01.900]
And just they're just all they're doing all day is just enjoying the fact that they're making a few of us say.

[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.960]
They select few of us work.

[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:03.440]
That's all.

[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.160]
That's the only thing they're doing.

[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.280]
They're not enjoying a holiday.

[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:15.180]
I was driving somewhere over the weekend and sunny and Joe were doing sports talk or hanking.

[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.280]
Somebody was doing it.

[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:22.040]
And they were saying nobody is going to be calling between now and the end of the show because nobody's listening.

[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.420]
And who do you think called into the board out to say make sure they know that I'm listening?

[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.360]
The Mike Disney.

[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:28.760]

[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:31.500]
I knew it had to be either him or on a holiday.

[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:32.900]
Either him turn it off.

[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.440]
Mike, okay, give it a rest.

[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.000]
Go out and do something useful.

[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.940]
Okay, go play in traffic in Allenville.

[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.580]
Do something worthwhile for a change.

[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.580]
Don't be out there listening on a holiday.

[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.160]
It's bad enough that you're making us work.

[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:44.600]
Okay.

[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.400]
Both the Palm Beach lines are open, which is a rarity on this show in Boka 278WYOD.

[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.700]
Can we get that West Palm line out of there?

[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.020]
Can we get rid of that thing?

[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:54.920]
It's a waste of time.

[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.380]
It's costing a lot of money, right?

[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.520]
It's a big way.

[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.900]
Right there is a big waste of money.

[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.540]
I mean, we could probably bring an efficiency expert and hear clean half of this joint out.

[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:03.860]
Okay?

[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.900]
So the right of us could make some real money, okay?

[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.160]
The half of these fakers out.

[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.100]
They wonder around here.

[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.100]
Oh, where's my paycheck?

[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:11.900]
Where's my paycheck?

[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.560]
There's people that worked here like 20 years ago that come in to get a paycheck.

[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.240]
I saw Big Wilson in here, Friday looking for a paycheck.

[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:20.800]
It was incredible.

[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.880]
Yeah, we're playing for the Stinking Palm Beach line.

[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.560]
And all we get there is abuse and hostility and a lot of loony tunes.

[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:29.840]
Like I said, let's leave it in.

[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.820]
23 Pans 12 at WYOD.

[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.940]
And let me read my little message here from my good friend Roy Slanthoff at Gulfstream.

[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.580]
It says Neil, happy suckers.

[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.640]
And of course, there's something in here that I can't, it says regards to Claude Reigns.

[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.100]
I did receive a Christmas card from him in Mary Ellen.

[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.500]
Oh, I know who he's talking about.

[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:52.840]
I'm not going to talk about them either.

[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.640]
They make me want to scream.

[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:59.200]
Anyway, Gulfstream will be opening next Sunday, a week from yesterday.

[00:46:59.360 --> 00:46:59.920]
Can you believe it?

[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.860]
They'll be racing January the 8th through Tuesday, March 7th with Major League Thuroughbird

[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.840]
racing at its very best post-time daily is going to be 1 p.m.

[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:14.060]
And opening day only next Sunday at Gulfstream, they'll be rolling back the prices for all you

[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:18.520]
cheap skates out there in Halendale, grandstanded missionally 50 cents, clubhouse admission is

[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:18.820]
a buck.

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:25.360]
And listen to this, soda will be a dime popcorn beer and coffee 15 cents hot dogs 30 cents

[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:30.040]
and free to patrons paying admission, which will not be me limited edition collectors item

[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.320]
key ring engraved with the 50th anniversary emblem.

[00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:38.440]
And they will be showing throughout the day over the tracks in house TV monitors five of

[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.420]
the greatest races ever run at Gulfstream.

[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.760]
And they're also introducing a lot of brand new things there.

[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.640]
They always spend millions of dollars every year to renovate and keep it up to date at Gulfstream.

[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:52.080]
The rooftop bar in grill right at top the clubhouse dining room, which will afford seating for

[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.840]
400 fans in a spectacular view of the track.

[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.320]
And the good thing about that is when you have a real bad day and you plunge bad, you can

[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.500]
jump right off wide, you're dining at the rooftop bar in grill.

[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:05.760]
So you can have like a chicken wing in one hand and losing perfected ticket in the other

[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.560]
hand and right down to the finish line.

[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.320]
It's fantastic.

[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.700]
And don't forget children accompanied by an adult will be welcomed during the entire meeting now

[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.160]
that the miners bill is a fact here in the state of Florida.

[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:19.080]
And we'll be telling you is the days progressed throughout the week about all the exciting

[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:24.540]
activities that are coming up and about some of the big states races during the exciting 1989

[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.900]
thoroughbred season at beautiful Gulfstream.

[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:32.160]
Only one South Florida radio station is super enough to be named your Super Bowl Super

[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.020]
Whole Station.

[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.900]
We'll bring you every bit of the excitement as the countdown to Super Bowl 23 rolls on.

[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:43.120]
Now, more with Neil Rogers, our new start radio 610 WIOD.

[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:50.120]
Now, Laura, evidently called Nick during the break is hysterical as apoplectic says don't

[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.620]
talk about her and he does not eat a wicked meal.

[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.760]
All right, she eats a not so wicked meal.

[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:56.500]
All right.

[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.700]
Now, she's a wonderful person and all that, but this copy situation is incredible.

[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.220]
Is that the nicest word that I can use?

[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.120]
I mean, little scraps of you know what would be nice.

[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:13.100]
I know this is revolutionary and I know I know this is rocking a boat again.

[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.980]
But you know, the space right over here where there's nothing sitting here, one of those

[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.780]
nice file cabinets where they have a hanging file in alphabetical order and all the life

[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:27.920]
copy sits in there instead of in these books and sheets of paper and folders and envelopes

[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.580]
on the floor and the waist basket.

[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:30.920]
Wouldn't that be incredible?

[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.420]
I know it's revolutionary.

[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.100]
He's trying to change things.

[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.580]
He's been here just a few weeks and right away he's got to change everything.

[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.580]
That's the way they used to do it over there at win.

[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.280]
So that's the way he might do it here.

[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.140]
I got news for you.

[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:47.120]
They never did anything right over there until we forced them to do things that made sense.

[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.400]
Mitch is smiling because he knows how true that is.

[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.600]
He used to tell him if you turn the transmitter on, it'll work a lot better, okay?

[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.840]
They'll actually hear it and they said, why bother?

[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.000]
And they had a point, okay?

[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.780]
Most of the day they did have a point.

[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.020]
But they say like hell on electricity.

[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:05.300]
When Rick Edwards used to come in and turn the transmitter off and it's out of the same.

[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.900]
Like at night when you were in Pembert Pines, it's still on it.

[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.280]
Like this.

[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.360]
With or without the transmitter on, it was great.

[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.360]
But anyway, hanging file for the copy would be great for the new year.

[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.640]
So Laura, I know you're listening.

[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.800]
We love you dearly.

[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.580]
You're a super person, but straightened out your act, okay?

[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.900]
It's 1230 at WIOD and let's go to Cooper City.

[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.280]
Hello.

[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.280]
Hello, Neil.

[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:25.840]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:26.440]
How are you?

[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.160]
I'm fine. Listen to the first time, Corey.

[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.520]
Great. We think.

[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.180]
How do you tell you a melting pot?

[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.240]
A melting pot story?

[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:33.720]
Yeah.

[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:34.800]
A little floor.

[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.720]
I'm listening, sir.

[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.900]
Drive up there about 12 o'clock at night.

[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.240]
Make a reservation for the family about 12 o'clock.

[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.920]
The first time that you're showing us how to do it.

[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.620]
They're showing you how to do it, huh?

[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:48.920]
Yeah.

[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.800]
Put the food in the oil.

[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:52.220]
I've been waiting.

[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.100]
Waiting about an hour.

[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.780]
Nothing's cooking.

[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.800]
Call them over.

[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:57.660]
It's on you.

[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.420]
Don't worry, Wade.

[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.340]
Take a little while.

[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.000]
I'm 130 quater or two.

[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.780]
I reach under the table and I pick up the toilet.

[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.540]
I'm hungry for eating out.

[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:06.340]
Yeah.

[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.080]
Oil, rice, cold.

[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.440]
And then I'm taking the food home and cooking it.

[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:11.140]
Well, great.

[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:12.380]
Give you something to do.

[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.860]
It was a great first experience.

[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:14.560]
Okay.

[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:15.480]
Well, listen.

[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:18.400]
Wouldn't you think that you'd understand that there'd be something a little bit?

[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.860]
I don't want to suggest you're a little slow.

[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:25.520]
But after the first hour went by, wouldn't you think you might become suspicious when nothing was happening to the oil?

[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.600]
But with the matter, do everybody come to come and go over and say, well, the way we go.

[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.880]
Well, by that time, what was this on New Year's night?

[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:31.740]
No, no.

[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.700]
This was about a month ago.

[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.080]
Oh.

[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.480]
Well, they were getting ready for New Year's night.

[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:35.800]
Right.

[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.340]
They kept coming over and saying, well, that little red light goes out and about a time the bulb goes in it.

[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:40.620]
Yeah.

[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:41.960]
Well, what do they know?

[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.300]
Listen, you know, we have four good New Yorkers.

[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.600]
No, I haven't got any ideas.

[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.060]
It's probably down there in the Catskills.

[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.160]
That's really from the same town that they...

[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.720]
I don't know anything about the Catskills.

[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.960]
To me, sir, that area is like a giant void.

[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:53.360]
It is.

[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.480]
That's why we moved down here.

[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:54.800]
Yeah.

[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.720]
But it's from the same town that Alan from the track is from.

[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.760]
Alan Finkelson?

[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.080]
Right.

[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:02.340]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.020]
You grew up, grew up, grew up, grew up with Alan my whole life.

[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:04.720]
Did you really?

[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:05.100]

[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:06.420]
Isn't that incredible?

[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:07.480]
And you survived it, huh?

[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.040]
And I survived.

[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:08.780]
That's great.

[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.660]
Well, he's a some kind of guy.

[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.280]
Let me tell you.

[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.760]
I don't want to tell you what kind.

[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.400]
Now, he's all right.

[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:15.420]
How do you, uh, the whole thing here?

[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.700]
He's the whole thing.

[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:17.200]
Yep.

[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.920]
I'll tell him you said that.

[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.320]
In fact, I'm going to be there tonight.

[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.860]
And I hope to see you a lot of...

[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.220]
Well, there's off again.

[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.360]
You'll probably be back at WS News.

[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.040]
Right, Robert?

[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:36.620]
Right.

[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.440]
So what's going on?

[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:39.320]
You have a good new year?

[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.160]
Yeah.

[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.660]
You going to the track tomorrow?

[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.420]
No, I think I get to...

[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.360]
I want to...

[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.280]
Well, I bet you they're racing today.

[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:49.240]
Let me see the sports section.

[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.500]
I bet you because it's a holiday.

[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.240]
I bet you they're racing today at Colter.

[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:53.800]
Well, I can't...

[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.860]
Well, I got to get my grandpa out of the way.

[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.440]
Really good.

[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.880]
So I just go with him.

[00:52:59.160 --> 00:52:59.380]
Yeah.

[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.020]
And what happened?

[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.020]
Um...

[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.740]
I still lost every single day I had.

[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.120]
You lost it all, huh?

[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:09.480]
Yeah.

[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.300]
Well, that should teach you a good lesson, Robert.

[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.340]
I noticed that there were five winners in the lottery

[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.180]
that Rebecca Paul, boy, she's got a great sense of humor, doesn't she?

[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.380]
You noticed those numbers she came up with?

[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.320]
20, 30, 40, and if there would have been a 50, she would have used that,

[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.840]
but they come up with 49 because that's the last number there, right?

[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.080]
Who the hell are they kidding?

[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.080]
I noticed it was 15, that...

[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:30.280]
About 49.

[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.160]
Yeah, I'm going to bet 50 and 60 next week.

[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.580]
Okay, Robert, well, I wish you good luck, okay?

[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:34.720]
Right.

[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.240]
Bye.

[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.280]
Now, I don't think they are running today.

[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.480]
Although Pompa-Dopark is offering free grandstand admission to children 17 and under

[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.460]
beginning with tonight's program.

[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.800]
They're also doing something else tonight.

[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.480]
Um...

[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.300]
And I don't know, I can't remember what it is.

[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.320]
In December, Pompa-Dopark announced a senior citizen policy

[00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:00.620]
that provides grandstand admission and reserve seat for 75 cents for patrons 55 plus.

[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.280]
Wow.

[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:05.880]
I'm not saying a word about that.

[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:06.640]
I've been shocked.

[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:10.340]
But, no, there haven't something special I think tonight at Pompa-Dopark,

[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.860]
and we should have some information here because they're starting on a show very, very soon.

[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.060]
But, uh, it's free...

[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:17.780]
I shouldn't say it should, unless I'm sure.

[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.440]
I think it's free admission for everybody to all levels of the track tonight.

[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.100]
That sounds right.

[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:28.840]
But, they're starting on a regular basis free grandstand admission to children 17 and under every night starting tonight.

[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:34.960]
Which is about time that the pyramuchal started really getting into this family bill,

[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.860]
right, getting some younger blood out there at the track.

[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.900]
1032 at W.I.O.D.

[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.320]
Now, what were you saying about upstate New York?

[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.220]
I'm... Now, I'm talking about like July or August.

[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.100]
Just when I'm talking about...

[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.820]
Definitely the time to go up, preferably August.

[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.160]
That's when I'm talking about like August.

[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.980]
I'm gonna go up there, and I'm gonna go to all these places

[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:56.200]
that I've heard endlessly, you know, said over and over and over.

[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:57.320]
And you know what I'm gonna do?

[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:01.360]
I'm gonna have my picture taken in front of these places.

[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:01.660]
Great.

[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.360]
While you're up there, by the way, why not go over to Niagara Falls?

[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.060]
It's right nearby, right by Buffalo.

[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.260]
And they can cross over.

[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.400]
Be sure and take your lead.

[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:09.620]

[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:10.140]
Yeah.

[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.720]
You go over to Niagara Falls on Tyrio and you're ripped off.

[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:14.640]
Get ripped off.

[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.380]
Real bad.

[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.660]
You can go to the Wax Museum,

[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.060]
and you can go at all those tourist traps over there and get ripped off.

[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.660]
The worst in the history of mankind.

[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:22.620]
Niagara Falls on Tyrio.

[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.400]
I think I have plenty to do, you know, with Don and Bob's and everything.

[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:25.560]
Yeah.

[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.500]
And you're right.

[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.860]
And you wanna get a sub, but what's that place in Buffalo where they got the subs?

[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.140]
You'll figure all this out and write it down for me.

[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.860]
And so I have a list when I go up there.

[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.560]
On Main Street, there's that great place where they have those subs.

[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.180]
You'll remember.

[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.980]
In fact, uh, Nemo's, remember Nemo's roast beer?

[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.900]
Sure, and I think it's somehow related to this someplace.

[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:46.800]
And I can't think of the name.

[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:47.660]
Somebody you'll call in.

[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.780]
See, you've probably inspired a lot of upstate New York calls already.

[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:51.820]
Now, that's not the purpose.

[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.240]
Which is exactly what we want of my comments.

[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.820]
1034 at WIOD.

[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.000]
The Palm Beach Line is available.

[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.440]
We just mentioned that in passing.

[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:01.980]
655-9463-655-WIOD.

[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.580]
And when we come back after a gale,

[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:08.420]
oh, Gale is here answering the musical question in the newsroom is Gale Bright.

[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.460]
And after we do the headlines in his little break,

[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.240]
I think we ought to do some carpenters, don't you?

[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:15.400]
We'll play that one that we got cute up.

[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.240]
I brought in not one, but two albums.

[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:21.180]
Because I was positive that everybody would have seen that movie last night.

[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.040]
This happens to me all the time.

[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.740]
I will watch something on Network TV,

[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.640]
which is a rarity for me other than sports.

[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.780]
And come in and talk about it and get all enthused,

[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.580]
and nobody will have seen it.

[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.160]
I don't know why they do this to you.

[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.220]
Yeah, they do this to you all the time.

[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.220]
It's pretty pondering, you know?

[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.500]
Anyway, I'm sure Gale probably saw it has a couple of comments to make during the news.

[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.620]
It's a 1034 at WIOD.

[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.300]
Oh, 1038 at WIOD.

[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.180]
Are we going to play that record?

[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.060]
Are you going to talk it up?

[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:52.620]
No.

[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.040]
Oh.

[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.020]
Well.

[00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:00.640]
Back to the Neil Rogers program on 1240 WGBA.

[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.500]
Here again, America's youngest talk show host,

[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.440]
six-year-old Neil Rogers.

[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:11.120]
OK, I guess we're done with Neil.

[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.480]
And there's four minutes left in the hour.

[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.160]
Who will stick some cards?

[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:17.600]
Only. Hello.

[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.460]
And Neil, how's it going?

[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:20.620]
Great.

[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.120]
That's good.

[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:27.100]
Well, so I can't film my subscription to the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.

[00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:29.300]
The Google agency.

[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.220]
What an abortion that people raise.

[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.400]
Then I asked how many other people did lifeline.

[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.480]
And they said, now my business.

[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.420]
Yeah, well, they're real nice over there.

[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.740]
OK, well, I just thought I'd let you know.

[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:45.340]
You're a fine American.

[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.720]
Have a nice life.

[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.260]
Hello. Hello.

[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.660]
I want to speak to Neil.

[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.200]
You got him.

[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.480]
Am I on?

[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.660]
Yeah.

[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.080]
Neil.

[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:56.380]
Yeah.

[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:01.420]
Neil, you're a stinky pink old glue sniffing bedwaters at a pansy.

[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:03.940]
They call.

[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:05.760]
They say, huh?

[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.560]
Did he say pansy?

[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:08.920]
I don't think he'd get off.

[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.720]
What a mong brain.

[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:15.960]
I ride my bike 30 miles every Saturday to the list shop.

[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.220]
And this guy calls me names.

[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.720]
Shame on you, sir.

[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.300]
Shame on you.

[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:26.980]
By the way, have you seen some of those bad boys at the new AMP?

[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.140]
No, what are you cackling about?

[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:33.620]
A.

[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.220]
This is my car.

[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.600]
A.

[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:40.440]
A million producers in the world.

[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.340]
And they fix me in here with some A.

[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.480]
This is my car.

[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.440]
This is my car.

[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:50.800]
This is my car.

[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:51.660]
Hello.

[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.960]
Hello, Neil.

[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.240]
You're just a big, such a nice boy.

[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.760]
Come around with your front car, hovers.

[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.880]
Yeah, but you can't turn it off.

[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:02.580]
You can't turn it off.

[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.740]
I don't even need this.

[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:09.180]
I'm an office from Everestation.

[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.520]
The cave, the Almira, Fredonia.

[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:22.780]
But instead, I stay here in Imaging's U-Gro-Test, Sub-Sewing, Doodabas.

[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:24.960]
Unbelievable.

[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.000]
To me, the hell.

[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.200]
Oh, is this Neil Rogers?

[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.560]
What kind of phone are you on, sir?

[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.040]
How's that again?

[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.040]
Do you have a dial phone?
