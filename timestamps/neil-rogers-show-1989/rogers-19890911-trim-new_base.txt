it goes with anything that's

[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.000]
uh...

[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.900]
opulent jingles are kind of fit with anything we have an open line in

[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.880]
brown right now or really uh... very concerned about it

[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.940]

[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.120]
a staff meeting about it during the eleven o'clock news

[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.700]
at five to four w i would be the gentleman who eats corvettes with his

[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.660]
mustang is on the line right now

[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.180]
five and all

[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.720]
well mustang is a lot there's no question about it hot car and uh... i don't

[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.520]
i don't know though

[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.180]
perhaps probably

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.060]
you probably stay away from the z r one though i would well yeah

[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.740]
anything that's out of the lembrick in the six

[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.780]
yeah exactly and i don't know the nineties pre-i can't really notice yet

[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.600]
because they've only had it for one day but it's uh... it's fans

[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.460]
all you'll get you'll get around to it you'll

[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.100]
you'll feel the

[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.280]
the the feel the power

[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.640]
see i start out when i you know i get to stop light i pull along when i get a

[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.540]
new car pull on side like a fero or something like that

[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.160]
but i think i'll maybe a chavette you know

[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.840]
on the contrary i lost to super not long ago did you

[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.300]
well i'll tell you what i'll meet you with my super will see what happens

[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.220]
well you know

[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.260]
i'm in the highway will start out slow then we'll work up to the bed

[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.740]
you know i still think for the well for the money i mean the vet is beautiful

[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.180]
car but you know the mustang is a fornably fast

[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.760]
i don't need to be the first one i got to be for how much

[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.580]
fourteen thousand dollars oh no that is that is uh...

[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.000]
lawyer right but i got to tell you because you know i have that for are that

[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.280]
incredibly expensive piece of uh... garbage very fast well it is very fast but

[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.380]
it's just uh... it's so damn expensive but but the one great thing about

[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.820]
for are is though the increase in value that that cars were thirty thousand

[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.880]
dollars more now than when i bought it

[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.420]
all right absolutely here

[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.980]
what i don't think they're not gonna make it more so the June of next year

[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.260]
yeah and so they say in five years that cars going to be worth a fortune and

[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.780]
all of that

[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.420]
but it's a beautiful but the plan to make is that of that

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.500]
and not the zr one but just a regular corvette is is is really a bargain is

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.800]
compared to like a lot of those uh... real expensive foreign cars you know

[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.200]
like for are is an important no no like you're saying early about the seventeen

[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.980]
inch treb you know you can't you can't lose a thought i think the uh...

[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.900]
the night of eighteen inch

[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.000]
i think i don't think i know you're right there bigger than even the other

[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.380]
ones you're right

[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.340]
they're incredible but you know when you uh... when you blow tire you got a

[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.360]
work uh...

[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.780]
you got to work hard to buy one yet

[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.800]
yet all i know

[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.400]
i thought are they about three hundred bucks

[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.180]
uh... i think don't you have the uh... the good year eighteen inch catered

[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.160]
back from that mistaken

[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.420]
how do you know that

[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.860]
well i'm in the cars yes

[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.660]
they're expensive they're like two ninety five yeah i guess about that now i

[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.800]
argue about five bucks okay when you get to three hundred uh... you just round

[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.200]
it off

[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.640]
forgive me

[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.040]
in fact as my fact that was my choice i was either going to put new tires on the

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.800]
eighty eight that i had a fine new and i figured might as well buy the new one

[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.300]
well with so many miles of your idea

[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.800]
uh... about twenty nine thousand all that car was a cherry

[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.840]
i don't speak

[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.900]
absolutely

[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.720]

[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.300]

[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.640]
town i think with a 90 vet probably not but that's what they told me that more let me tell you

[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.920]
let me say something to you that bill colder gave us full details i know i heard him mention something

[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.400]
about yesterday or this morning and then some guy called in and was talking about my white

[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.600]
cattle act or something well no no i have a yellow cattle act you have a white vet let's put

[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.760]
there we go let's let's get it straight okay now i think the only thing i want to mention is that

[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.660]
i want to congratulate you of course and i want to thank up a collection

[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:38.180]
what help me pay for the car stereo system more as i kiadris one of the other yeah well i think the

[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.880]
last one is probably the right one i'm like i called my mother last night to uh brace her for the

[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.160]
shock because you know every Tuesday i go over there for dinner so tomorrow i'll be driving over

[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.100]
there in the new vet and i just wanted to brace her for the shock and of course she said well

[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:59.880]
you needed that like a whole other yeah oh boy well when i say i go out and buy a new underwear

[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.260]
she gets all hysterical you know all right couldn't you have so many old ones together

[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:10.580]
what you have a nice day okay bye now see ya it's 20 past 11 boy everybody's in such a good

[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.380]
mood today it's shocking isn't it i guess that dolphin loss brought them back to reality or something

[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.900]
although i i shouldn't say that because they played a hell of a game they really did far far

[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:26.720]
beyond anybody's wildest dreams and then only to blow it in the last two seconds for that's

[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.340]
that is so typical of Jim Kelly you know that's just right up his alley

[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.100]
i wish i wish Jim Kelly could play for the cowboys with jj and they could go oh in 16

[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.900]
wouldn't that be great that is really a shame though that the cowboys never even put a point

[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:47.020]
on the board they were really tossing their muscle around so to speak in the preseason and

[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.480]
showing everybody how great they were now all of a sudden when the game is really count jj gets

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.420]
slaughtered 28 to nothing by the saints no less well i'd be embarrassed wouldn't you i'd be

[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.320]
humiliated and probably when they play the first home game in Dallas the fans are going to start

[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.840]
screaming we want landry you know stuff like that and goodbye jimmy probably have jimmy johnson

[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.920]
blue doll stuff like that 21 past 11 at wio d i guess we better take a little break here because

[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.740]
we got those trends coming in don't we this hour oh my god you're getting real nervous about that

[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:25.560]
wait a minute maybe we got to do a little dick feral promo i pledge allegiance to the flag

[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.040]
okay just a little bit at a time in fact i have a great idea remember how we used to play two

[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:47.200]
carts like alternately back and forth sure okay we can kind of get harry and dick feral's kids

[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:53.760]
together there that's appropriate oh god 21 past 11 at wio d we don't want to talk too loud

[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.040]
it's a Monday we don't want to wake up the natives but we do want to tell you about the melting

[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:26.340]
under one i don't care if i ever get back okay i'm harry they're out of control

[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:43.140]
once they get going we're just stopping these people 25 after 11 at wio d

[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.240]
for those trends are coming in 20 minutes a lot of pressure now who would you say is that of the

[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:54.280]
most pressure in this trend i better not ask them now Miami hello yeah how are you today great

[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.180]
busy you missed that guy's call he told you he was black and bay who light red and he'll be looking

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:08.360]
for you the trooper oh that's what i got once he's got a supercharged five oh yeah okay with that

[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.780]
i didn't understand anything he was talking about he has a supercharged front end

[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.680]
no supercharged supercharged one say that say that for the king show okay we don't discuss those

[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.960]
kind of things are first and who do you think ladies is sleeping with the keepers job come on now

[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.740]
what kind of a statement is that i don't know have any ideas okay let's let you know

[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.120]
that's all those people that put the dolphins down they're playing the team that's going to be

[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.100]
in the super ball and they didn't i don't know why you say i don't agree with it i think buffalo

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.720]
i mean don't give me wrong not taking anything away from the dolphins but i think buffalo is

[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.160]
overrated buffalo is not going to be in the super ball you know just because Larry king says so

[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:54.240]
doesn't make it so yeah i only wish not after yesterday i don't okay call me 50 dollars

[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.240]
okay 26 past 11 at w.i.d the lines are beginning to thin out now we have a couple of open lines

[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.420]
one in data one of Palm Beach it was only just make believe here at the beginning

[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:14.580]
just want to give us a false sense of security okay let's see if there's one more on here

[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:21.000]
that i think would be really good exercise for Johnny boy pressure down here is the name with the

[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.780]
most pressure

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:44.060]
yeah this didn't step on now that was fair close to show you even Johnny's not perfect

[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:50.460]
coconut creek hello hello Neil how are you great yeah it's called up i want to complain a little bit

[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.520]
possibilities oh i'm gonna get a little too close i don't be saying those awful things because you

[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.960]
know jacks on the award processor right now sending letters off to our good friend senator our

[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.260]
good liberal democrat from hawaii senator in a way this one i thought it's such a masterful job

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.820]
at the iran country hearings yeah so up and on is about you okay well wait a minute did you see

[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:13.800]
the peace what about channel seven no i didn't see it was on last night no it's not i think what nobody

[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.460]
saw it boy that's quite a commentary that almost nobody in the world has seen it we had one guy who

[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.760]
called it who saw it and nobody's watching channel seven news i guess i think that's quite a

[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.940]
quite a barometer the rich and i don't know i just rose in the wrong way so to speak oh boy don't

[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.200]
that's a line i'm not even gonna touch and my army herald two weeks ago last sunday they had a

[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.720]
thing on the in the tropics section you know the magazine section yeah my favorite yeah on the front

[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.740]
covers dav Barry he was holding a basketball up okay with middle finger okay on purpose yeah showing

[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.740]
you the benefit yeah what kind of a disgusting gesture is that all those little kids see that

[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:52.040]
Dave what are they gonna think of that that's right they might do something all those matter

[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.060]
fact most of those kids are giving Dave back the same gesture because they read his column okay

[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:01.900]
and they know how boring is Dave Barry is the epitome of this community okay he's pathetic he's

[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.180]
never said a funny thing in his life but it's some of the things i've read the only funny thing he

[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:13.160]
ever said was only fifty dollars well couple things i've read a magazine section i mean i can't

[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.520]
believe print it i mean in bookshareed so they think they use the vulgar vulgar vulgar vulgar

[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.680]
i think we need a senate investigation of everything i think we ought to have rampant censorship

[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.120]
and all the kids in school instead of the pledge of allegiance ought to be forced to sing dutch land

[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.620]
uberales what the hell are these people doing complaining about you when they can just turn your

[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.300]
damn radio off instead of listening to your well they don't have any they don't have anything better

[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.660]
to do and they don't like the fact that they think i troll for sex on the air it's incredible

[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:47.660]
thing sir if i'm trolling for sex on the air i'm probably the most unsuccessful radio broadcasters

[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:53.580]
in the history of america because i've forgotten even what it's like it's terrible i can't believe it's

[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.400]
terrible well i guess i'm missing a thing

[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.720]

[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:07.760]
parter everybody in the audience who knows ferals look at that every nobody knows ferals

[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.560]
you know he knows ferals Marvin uh once met somebody named feral i think he was joel

[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.440]
you don't know from ferals it's an ice cream parter i think they had one or they have one in day

[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:27.640]
land don't they are they used to what is it what is the one in um in westland oh well he don't

[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:33.560]

[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:48.900]
i used to live a block away from my emmy lakes high yeah now if he knew that and the amazing part of

[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:55.200]
it is i never drove through the parking lot i never trolled for anybody over there and um huh i guess

[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.200]
i missed out based on what jack is saying these days but no i lived there for a year 1977

[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:08.760]
so i'm very familiar with that with westland yeah that may you're not hmm i don't think they let me

[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.280]
in there and do they don't you have a passport it's eleven thirty five together with a page

[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:19.420]
glue kind of like from the w n w school by the way speaking of wld want to say especially

[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.460]
good morning to Dennis Collins this morning because we certainly know that Dennis is either

[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:29.160]
monitoring directly or indirectly still over the weekend fought a lot more communications between

[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:35.680]
our friend jack and um Dennis Collins no just uh seeming like a never ending back and forth

[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:42.200]
pattern now you talk about the general manager at the w n w s yeah yes are Dennis yeah isn't that

[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.980]

lottery hello okay nice to talk into you candle a zeta spy report yeah good zeta

spy report this is amazing you mean and are they still on the air um well they've gone beyond

[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.480]
turning the corner i think now they have governed themselves accordingly um you may have heard

[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:09.500]
this one before though what about who is this yeah you know this is boy this is uh listen to that

[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.160]
herited the sound so to speak last week okay i didn't hear that because they can't sell the show

[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.100]
now they go with commercial free i thought they were already doing they were used to that ever since we

[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:50.220]
left they had commercial free two day Thursday Saturday i don't wait for the commercial free week

[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:55.220]
the week i you know i when you get a new car you set the buttons on your radio and i put a button

[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:59.020]
on there because used to be once in a while i got every fifth record i enjoyed so i had a button

[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.720]
on there and last night i punched them up and i don't know i don't understand what they're playing

[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.720]
anymore do you i don't know the traffic in the stones i took them off my radio i took them off

[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.940]
i don't know what they're playing i put love 94 back on i did oh my god you are trying to really

[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:21.080]
get i did look at this gloves 94 i did they need your help i know i know they're really need you

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:27.020]
badly don't take it personally Greg but uh you know it can't hurt all right the trends will be

[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.660]
in soon and you can get the truth of cloud you'll probably have them on your computer right oh not me

[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:41.120]
any second not not me have a great day probably okay it's 11 40 at w-i-o-d wow this is really exciting

[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.440]
that was by the way jack that was justice sarcastic joke that he'd have him on a computer ready

[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:51.300]
was just a joke you don't have to call up our patronage all of oh god it's it if you could see

[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:56.260]
those notes sweet what we need to do is get some tv time because on radio it's not effective enough

[00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:03.340]
get some tv time and show first of all we have a camera panning in on these stacks and stacks and

[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:10.040]
stacks of letters and notes and ramblings and uh oh it's just amazing i mean this is two years of

[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:16.220]
somebody's life involved in harassment and surveillance and uh being a general pain in the ass

[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.600]
what a way to go huh but of course the god that told him to do this that's right that's what

[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.820]
turkey modest said too del ray hello yeah hello nil yeah i was watching that abc program

[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:36.840]
and in a way also said wait a minute abc program and bc i'm sorry no the one was in no

[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.100]
used to be in bc now we're getting warmer all right what i want with sally fits whatever it was

[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:48.560]
okay uh obvious you're gonna have a good grasp of what it was in a way also said that the

[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:55.140]
he's gonna have the scc check into the uh licensing of wio due because it's coming up for

[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.180]
e-newrow yeah we already know that okay uh what did you wait wait a minute don't now just a minute

[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:08.200]
did he mention me by name yes he did senator in a way and uh the program itself had a picture of you

[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:14.760]
at your board with all your lights and the telephones and everything else so uh let's clarify

[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.720]
this again senator in a way said he's gonna get neo roger's off the earth it's

[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:24.060]
said that he's gonna try to get you off oh he's gonna check into it to find out

[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:30.740]
exactly because he has some papers of you yes and he's gonna check into that and have the scc check

[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:37.020]
into wio these wouldn't wouldn't you think before he'd make an intemperate and juvenile remark

[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.060]
like he's gonna try to get me off the air that they would conduct the investigation first rather than

[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:48.080]
to uh make such such an outrageous statement well let's uh let's put it this way he's still a roger

[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:55.440]
okay uh one other thing i wanted to bring out the video besides this yes uh i'm only down here

[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:12.040]
about almost a year and on uh wmca in new york there was a tortshow host uh barry jr would

[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:20.180]
be very gray no not very gray no sir very Epstein he's on well whatever his name is well this guy

[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:28.500]
was a maniac very good very many act uh one thing he said was that he wanted all the boys that

[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:37.560]
uh were circumcised to suit their parents for for disfiguring them hmm this guy screamed and yell

[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.440]
when i say screamed and yell he did and finally he got a whole of one guy that called in

[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:55.140]
and this guy really laced into this guy the guy only lasted on wmca 13 weeks they forced him to

[00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:01.900]
make a public apology to this man that he lambed that on the on the on the well let me ask you the

[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.780]
guy that he lambed that year was he circumcised well whether he was maybe his nose was circumcised

[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:14.400]
now knows but the thing was that the guy was no fool and he told them he wrote a letter to them

[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:21.560]
and he put in the bid for wmca his license so he must have had quite a bit of money also yeah

[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:29.400]
now the thing is that the people that probably watched that uh news broadcast are probably smart enough

[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.840]
not to listen to you that's why you don't have too many people well what do you what does that say

[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:43.860]
about you sir okay well i'm glad you had 1144 at wio d we have an open line at least his honesty was

[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.380]
refreshing what correct not too intimidating but somewhat refreshing we have an open line in

[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:56.860]
dates 751 wio d and one in boca at 278 9463 278 wio d so evidently now that was an entirely different

[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.560]
version of the story from the one we heard from the earlier caller and here we've been on for

[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.800]
almost two hours and we've got two whole people who saw that on channel seven news so they

[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.620]
obviously are really having a tremendous impact in the market and like i said since the story

[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.580]
allegedly was about me it's unfortunate that we're so far from their studios that they couldn't

[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:21.580]
have come across the walkway and talked to me about it could they would have been a little bit too

[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:30.200]
tough candle hello hey hello yeah not much how about i'm sir they're doing it hey

[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:39.300]
some serious but some serious but yeah hey bird how about those cuts he isn't going to respond

[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:47.740]
hey me i don't know if i you know if it's kind of important but i heard that lady in wws what's her name

[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.480]
sandy yeah or debi Ellis they have a lot of ladies like w and w was some of them have got

[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.920]
one that was from ten to twelve or something oh Alice rantell no no the other one

[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:03.640]
debi Ellis right she almost said she was saying to be in the way at the end of her show and she

[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.520]
almost said w i o d really that's probably wishful thinking on debi's part we are we you know we

[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.660]
have a problem because i can just barely squeeze through the doorway debi would never get in the building

[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:20.900]
she'd have to do the show from the parking lot oh yeah yeah um well uh can i call somebody

[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:26.040]
do you yeah don't don't beat around the bush this is a listen no matter what senator in a way says

[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.840]
sir the first amendment is still alive and well this is america and we're not going to let some douchebag

[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.520]
from hulae come over and tell us what we can say on the radio okay that's right go ahead

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:41.040]
yeah i want to call Alex and uh her the douchebag and uh and guy he's a douchebag there can be no

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.940]
question about it hey Neil yeah i mean i don't want to have any harsh feelings nothing like that but

[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:52.480]
this is like kind of a chronic cough is it yeah who is this uh fabian well you were okay today all right

[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.740]
you just wouldn't have told us that at the end it would have been a lot better 1146 a w i o d we

[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:05.740]
do have an opening in date at 7519463 751 w i d i like that guy they called about that emcee telecast

[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.560]
who didn't know what network it was on what channel it was on who the people were but he sure

[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.600]
all knew about that nea rogers and how embarrassing it was to admit that he was listening to the show

[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.120]
see people intelligent enough to watch the news he has a good point wouldn't be listing the

[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.820]
so what was his excuse that's the 64 dollar question and when he calls us again like two years

[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.360]
from tischerbohg maybe he'll give us the answer 13 till new and boy those trends are going to be

[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:37.680]
out any second now i mean you like um god what under tremendous pressure you can just feel the

[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:43.380]
walls vibrating oh that must be gtr cranking it up again in there we'll come back we don't have

[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.740]
anything to do here right now we're just uh say a little long singing the song we'll be right back

[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:54.140]

metal music we're bringing in a tuba player 5 30 tomorrow morning on new stock radio 6 10 w i o d

[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:34.440]
be out probably i something about him you know he um because i remember very vividly the day we

[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:41.380]
did that show with him in the studio there he's he's one of those people who looks um entirely he's

[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:47.520]
like a chameleon you know i mean in other words on like monday he can look one way you know what i'm

[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.120]
picture yeah he you're in down to his puppet he doesn't look like himself in that picture with patty

[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:58.400]
her no that's what i'm talking about it looks like about 20 different people yeah but anyway you folks

[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.280]
don't care about that it's 10 before noon at w i o d we're just sitting here breathlessly awaiting

[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.720]
the arrival of those trends who's gonna bring these now the charities in here and your land has

[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:13.120]
gone to who's probably nick that's right and are you going to believe the numbers that nick brings

[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.200]
in here that's the question okay he's probably going to doctor the numbers before he brings him

[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:25.040]
to the studio pompano good morning now yes sir boy does this is a big day big day for cubs fan

six left three Chicago and three in Montreal i know that and uh you know this could be a this

[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.880]
could be something you're gonna you're just gonna hate why is that you imagine a Montreal Toronto world

[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.700]
no i really can't in the way the expos are playing they've lost 13 eight of their last 13 and 23

[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.100]
of their last 36 well they're really doing it well they're doing it if they continue doing it in

[00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.740]
about a week you can forget about you know oh canada yeah is uh is uh them are back on this three day

[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:08.340]

[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.260]
and he's pitched a great game well we get a chance then there you go let's go get him who

[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.980]
Montreal Montreal yeah well good luck to you sir that Langston is pitching today boy he's really hot

[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:24.740]
okay Neil good luck to you sir you'll need it Montreal fans he must be an Alice Rantellisner huh

[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:31.300]
because you know Alice is a big that's right very very monster expos. He must be nuts yeah he must

[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:38.160]
be on the right on the edge especially when these trends come up boy there is somebody now now we

[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.960]
have the new lineup Dennis Collins new revised and the refurbished lineup over there they shuffle those

[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.480]
cards and I think this trend will go a long way to showing us what that's going to be all about can't

[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.340]
wait hmm that'd be exciting and uh Greg and Donald of course is sitting out there in separate rooms

[00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:01.040]
waiting breathlessly yeah who else is like hanging on a thread of course callers hoping for a little

[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:07.280]
upswing here this would be a first indication perhaps of something Irene Richard Irene Richard is

[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:14.260]
out there just shaking in her nose now if she has a bad trend you're not going to knock her are you

[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.620]
not me make some kind of vicious assault on Irene Richard if she has like a really bomb of a trend

[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.380]
you're not going to do that what you got me confused with some other guy yeah you would never do now

[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:28.040]
okay there's an open-line and brow now if you move very very fast because they've been just

[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.280]
coming out of here like crazy they haven't they like termites coming out of the woodwork 524

[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:38.840]
wiod and let's go to Miami hello hi Neil how you doing okay um I saw that channel seven reporter

[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:43.740]
about you okay now let's now this is the third one so this is kind of like the tie breaking vote

[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:49.260]
on what it was all about okay now was it an ABC report no it was channel seven oh Jane

[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:55.420]
Acre with the reporter for it and um what they were basically they talk Jane who Jane Acre

[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.520]
Acre well however they pronounce that's correct Jane Acre well anyway that isn't correct

[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:07.300]
that's not how she's pronouncing her name Acre yeah I think so yeah it is yeah oh well anyway

[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.720]
what a Yahoo way to pronounce your name man anyway what they they interview my Disney

[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:21.280]
for a while speaking of Yahoo yeah really and um they show a pick they show a tape of you eating oh yeah

[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:27.280]
well that figures that figure and um shrimp no doubt that could have been anytime exactly um Zeta

[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:33.320]
yes oh they showed that tape they showed that Zeta tape well it's too far for them to come over here

[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.860]
and take new uh file footage you know it's much too far so they just rely on the old stuff yeah

[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:42.680]
obviously oh that's about it I'd like to call no no wait a minute that's not about it you didn't

[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:49.060]
tell me anything all they were talking about was the uh the uh challenge the to the FTC license

[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:55.900]
right right and what did Senator in a way say um they didn't actually show him talking they showed

[00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.580]
a tape of them but not speaking directly about you as far back in remember uh-huh well it's

[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.460]
certainly conflicts with that old fart that called it a little while ago who I think was making it

[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:12.060]
up as he went along weren't you from Delray what the hell is he now yeah well that's it okay well

[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:18.060]
it's fascinating we've had three calls on that news clip and every one of them is a totally

[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:23.160]
different story yeah isn't this great now all this guy wants to do his call his friend a douchebag

[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.140]
okay go ahead all right I'd like to call Bob LeBaron and boy no wait a minute wait a minute now

[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.100]
you laughed over his uh thing there come on who is it Bob LeBaron and Boyton Beach uh real

[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:38.480]
nearly a douchebag okay and by the way Jack governed this accordingly okay good cause okay by

[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.240]
the way he'll be right over to take down your number it's eleven fifty five at w i o d another

[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.840]
open line now and date on the heels of that sensational call oh I know what I wanted to tell you

[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:54.280]
Friday guess what they had on c-span you know every now and then they show a talk show on c-span

[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.860]
they they go in and they tape a whole show and they just go into studio and you see a radio show

[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:05.040]
with the commercials and everything they had the jury William show from w r k o in Boston it was so

[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:12.600]
ponderous that it was comatose it was incredibly boring um shocking talking about heavy

[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.800]
we're talking about barney frank were they yeah and they had the three people on there who um

[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.840]
were dressed in drag and uh no seriously they talked about that and then they got in to say he had

[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:28.500]
an open hour and the calls went on much too long first of all yeah and the spots the live spots

[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:33.440]
he was doing like we're so geriatric it was sounded like w o l d i mean he had a lot of them

[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.260]
and I and don't get me wrong I think Jerry's terrific but it's just he's doing that same old

[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:43.300]
stick boring you know and then he was promoting the fact that next the sometime next year they're

[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.080]
going to have the second annual c-span was kind of enough together the first one they're going to

[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.680]
have the second annual talk show host convention and he's the president of this group of self-important

[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:57.320]
talk show host right also be there oh Alice and Mike segal he mentioned Mike segal's name is

[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.660]
it buddy you know his underlings it was it was really boring dick feral probably be there

[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.420]
now are you going to pick on dick girl i will grant you i must say that he's called that we had

[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:13.700]
a little while ago is really ponderous and very puzzling yes wasn't it for a guy that's coming to work

[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:19.240]
here and looks and wants us to say nice things about him i thought it was really a disgusting call

[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:25.400]
it was like a troublemaker yeah exactly but that's his nature he's a troublemaker and a provocateur and

[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.660]
and of course the thinking is here that he's going to come in at night and stir everybody up

[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:34.900]
and get a lot of listeners and the certainly good luck to him because boy Gary and his sibling

[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:40.840]
a little little loella what a joella joel we're the ones who evidently came up with this masterful

[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.860]
stroke and it the no doubt will be tremendous okay let's take a call from pepper pine cello

[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.000]
hey don't miss the Roger okay to me you got the first time caller and you got the

[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.380]
greatest shield in the history of broadcast there i'm just the ability i listen to you every

[00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:03.040]
morning well bless you sir and uh a friend of mine told me he was having trouble with

[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:11.640]
the server system i got one and uh i could you know this great you know i wouldn't have a cable

[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.000]
for anything in the world well you're absolutely right i would and i've got mine all straight

[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.400]
in that night i wouldn't i don't disagree with you at all you get everything that's ever been

[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.260]
invented and the cable companies are just a stick it to you they give you whatever the hell they want

[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.560]
and uh it's wrong right in fact the senator in a way wants to get involved in something useful

[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.660]
why doesn't he go after the cable company that's the true instead of running around telling

[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:37.760]
everybody he he might get neo roger's off the air just uh no he shake up to me on back he's

[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.980]
fair yeah you know thanks a lot mister okay sir have a great day okay bye bye two minutes till new to

[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.840]
w.i.o.d the time is getting closer and i see they said eleven forty five but i guess that's when

[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:52.140]
they started feeding them on the computers perhaps probably or not as the case maybe but during

[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.860]
the new news we'll go back there and check it out and see who's being naughty and nice and maybe

[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.700]
they're holding stuff back on us now a spike wise in the building doing now probably if it's trend day

[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.100]
because if it's trend day and there's stuff in there we can count on him to come rushing in here

[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:11.660]
especially if gtr goes up even even marginally okay even just no seriously he'll come racing in here

[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.760]
and keep mentioning ninety seven gtr over and over again to the point of being juvenile and embarrassing

[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:22.360]
that's our bill yeah well he liked that the Beatles record act naturally that was his favorite and

[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:26.800]
he certainly does it all times okay well that's gonna just about do it and i can't believe we've

[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.980]
uh... excuse me killed two hours and here we are at the halfway mark for this is great it's

[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:38.460]
kind of like all downhill from here on in steve this afternoon with that uh... incredible show

[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:44.680]
marvin winestein with parents of murdered children and then on sports talk uh... speaking of crime

[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.000]
we have uh... the dolphin edition with rick weaver talking about uh... how just letting that slip

[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.080]
away from us in the last seconds yesterday be a lot of gnashing a teeth and speaking of gnashing

[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:59.420]
chuck my outstanding by with a new and wio d news and we'll come back as it gets closer and closer

[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.440]
to the moment of truth for broadcasters all over this god for sink and town

[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:17.860]
kick an ass with fifty thousand callers ladies and gentlemen this is the lightning row on the

[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:27.680]
new rudder show okay well it's twelve oh six uh... uh... i i don't know what wion z jingle i don't

[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.420]
want to hear that you know it's ponderous and it's embarrassing well we're up to a four eight

[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:39.180]
again on uh... wio d from a four four and it still includes that bogus motha june uh... so when

[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:45.220]
the summer book comes out christ we do have the alix benefit on the uh... which remains to be a

[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:50.200]
scene they have four asterisk but they're gonna but seriously uh... twelve plus w i do my back

[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:56.020]
up to a four eight and i have a feeling that w snooze and wion z probably are down there in the uh...

[00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:01.240]
in the upper twos or low three upper twos is my prediction uh... two eight two nine right around

[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:07.740]
in there twelve plus with ancient demographics so now we're just waiting all the hot shots bill wise

[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:13.280]
is out there and disney is standing around like he understands the number and uh... boy gary has got

[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.600]
real he's got double suspended on the uh... while he was nervous the trends were coming in the

[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:24.400]
figure of the first pair snapped he better have a backup and uh... his by his partner in crime

[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:29.140]
joelle was back there i i haven't even seen joelle does anybody know who that is

[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:33.140]
yeah i met him sure oh yeah guy uh...

[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:41.560]
yeah curts he's curts that's what the key is and so i see uh... like uh... the guy that called

[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:46.000]
in before okay it's twelve oh seven of the dot dot almost nothing i don't know what happened but

[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.540]
i think that everybody's just on pins and needles now for these numbers probably and well

[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.700]
that's a good sign the station overall twelve plus one up from a four four in the last

[00:45:54.700 --> 00:46:00.740]
trend to a four eight now this is june july in august ok for the arbitrage trends the arbitrage

[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.640]
and uh... all june is not a valid part of the summer book but they go three months at a time it's a

[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.980]
rolling number and of course there are a lot of people in the business rolling in the aisles

[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:16.300]
right now okay waiting for those numbers to come in and the people at eleven ninety four are just uh...

[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.540]
oh god they're just forming a team of the got their fingers crossed their knees cross you bet

[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:27.360]
and of course in irine's case that's probably a good idea at all time and uh...

[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:33.560]
who else well this is exciting motivation station the motivation stations hoping that they're

[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.460]
gonna make it again that they're gonna show up just a little not a lot just a little bit

[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:42.060]
and of course a woofie radio is really nervous over there at f.i.u they're praying that they

[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.240]
their number is a real big one the u.m. and v.u.n. is a very tense

[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.860]
so anyway this this happens once a month it's kind of like uh... something else like every month

[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.820]
we go through this in this business and of course it's just uh... more pressure than anybody should

[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.840]
have to deal with see those of you pians out there in the audience that have these meany old

[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.020]
meaningless jobs you know people have their subred hot dog stand or whatever you do

[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.780]
and you figure you're not making the big bucks but you don't you don't have to go through this

[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:13.620]
every month okay okay okay if you have your own subred hot dog stand probably nobody's

[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:17.940]
even coming by taking down your license plate number so there are a lot of things to be said

[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:23.500]
for being self-employed okay we've got five stinking lousy calls on that board it's embarrassing

[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.660]
as hell i'd be embarrassed for example of senator in a way came in the studio right now

[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:32.080]
i would be so depressed as well air six but two of them date aren't lit up

[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.260]
seven five one

[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.900]
wio d i'm really curious to see how many different versions we can get about that story on

[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:43.320]
channel seven news last one's there he has to read we've had three calls each one of them is as

[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.720]
different and the unique and it was an abc report was uh...

[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.560]
uh...

[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.720]
channel seven

[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.460]
well that guys a little confused you probably didn't have his metamusal yet today

[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.740]
well i shouldn't say metamusal jackal get very upset really you should see all the letters he wrote to

[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:02.360]
metamusal and i made that joke about leasing metamusal oh jesus

[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.280]
i'll be serious matter and the people's lives are at stake at all

[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.080]
you know this guy's got a sense of humor that is so incredible it's almost uh...

[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:11.900]
all here's a

[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:17.340]
and here's boy gerry right behind him i'd look behind if i were you right now i'd be

[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.040]
very cautious

[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.600]
top twenty uh... what music

[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.900]
top twenty ahead son gtr

[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.260]
here we go this is six a.m.

[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:26.820]
and at night

[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.700]
the june july august trend life what does that give you an idea what this market

[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.240]
is all about life is number one with an eight point six

[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.960]
how the mighty have fallen hot i'm telling you hot's going to slide

[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.380]
because people are going to start realizing that that music their plane is garbage

[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.160]
yeah have you listened to it i don't listen to it i don't understand what that

[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.140]
music i can't get it

[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:53.960]
i went down to an eight one power of five to magic oh my god how the mighty of

[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.340]
all i know i don't i don't i hate to say this but i don't believe this

[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.140]
okay it's bad sampling again because

[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:04.600]
listening habits don't change that dramatic one month the station doesn't go

[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.680]
from nine to like hot to an eight one especially in the summer when all the

[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.060]
kids are out of school unless the sampling yeah is screwed up of course if we do

[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:14.560]
real well in this i like it uh...

[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.820]
but anyway so hot was second with an eight one power had a five to that's

[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.240]
up slightly so they're closing that gap that's there what i bet you will hear from

[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.040]
built-in today

[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.380]
cubie no-speak at english they had a four nine i would be a four eight so we

[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:29.480]
were number five

[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.680]
uh... overall of the english speaking station well of course number one a

[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.180]
m by far english

[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:40.160]
uh... cm qf m another a no-speak at english had a four five magic went down

[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.620]
from a five three to a four two

[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.980]
bad sampling well i killed johnson's gonna be

[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.080]

[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:49.420]

[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:20.060]

[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.740]
had a six eight

[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.900]
now that's still with that awful month of june in there now what's gonna happen

[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.060]
when june disappears of course we do have the alix Bennett factor

[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.080]
in the last month of the summer book now that could be a real blowed

[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.940]
and hot had six and so we had a nice increase there from a six to a six eight

[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:55.820]

okay and if you're a potential advertiser by the way you spend any money on

[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:24.300]
background elevator music i just want to caution you because nobody listens to

[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.960]
it and nobody but unless you believe in subliminal advertising i'd save the

they had just turned the corner and they blew everybody out can you believe that

[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:13.460]

[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:56.920]
nest that must be a big number that must be a heavyweight number okay so congratulations Dennis

[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.780]
maybe you don't have to drive me out of the market after all you guys are really kicking some

[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:05.140]
serious ass and life went through the roof so you better call jack and tell them to just

[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:09.460]
to cover it himself accordingly okay from the car probably be a good place to call from

[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:16.260]
twenty one till one at w i o d daniel hello hey niel hi i'm one of the people who saw that channel seven

[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.960]
reported all right now your number four so far we've had three distinctly different versions

[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.480]
well uh you know it basically just showed you in the very beginning like they said that

[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.600]
old picture of you and i was eating right all over and stuff but you know what got me about the

[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:38.120]
whole report is that here they give talk about that guy and how he's been trying to get you off

[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.820]
you don't mean jack do you oh my goodness i mean i won't even you know

[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:48.040]
uses name but uh they never gave you a chance i mean what happened to fair journalism here

[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.160]
well they don't know anything about that well they didn't speak to disney and of course i

[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:55.480]
guess that was their idea of giving uh equal time because you know if somebody's going to have

[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.760]
all these allegations towards you you'd think they'd at least talk well they are pretty far away

[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:05.360]
you know yeah and as far as that senator goes he kind of like in a way to go he's going to look

[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.400]
into all of this uh well let me let me ask you all right let me ask you did he specifically

[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.380]
mention me by name and say if it's i don't think he really used Neil Rogers i think he said

[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.620]
we he's going to listen to them like your tapes and uh oh i see if they're you know if he'd have to

[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:26.340]
do anything about getting it off here because he thinks the shock radio is getting too far blah blah

[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:30.180]
right well i'll tell you i know the tapes that were sent there and there was a lot of stuff taking

[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:34.740]
out of context and a lot of material that we haven't played on here at all times the thing yeah

[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:39.260]
it was very nicely edited by jack but uh you know that that's not the way they do things in

[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:43.920]
Washington you know i can't believe that if somebody like that can really really go around

[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.720]
devoting their life to this and absolutely every waking moment of every single day this is the

[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:57.180]
only life that the man has is just harassing 37 30 37 oh my god no he isn't retired his wife is an

[01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.540]
attorney and she works and brings home a paycheck and this is the way he um i just can't believe

[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:06.180]
that somebody would go that far to you know like what you're saying about life and

[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:10.320]
space and everything i mean give me a break yeah you know whatever happened to the right to privacy

[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.540]
well maybe he read too many Sherlock Holmes stories something like that you know it may work in your

[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:19.380]
favor like married with children used to be really you know not very well i always liked it but

[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:23.220]
the ratings were never that good yeah like this show when a woman made that big think about it the

[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:29.860]
ratings went up great yeah like this show we never had much in a way of ratings right well and in

[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:35.300]
about you know really about neo rod are you cereal and then i saw it in the paper i go cheese

[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:39.060]
somebody who would wear a foul and dale that sounds like my kind of show that's great because i

[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.820]
know that the sunshine magazine over at the sun sent us going to do it they got a woman is going

[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:47.100]
to do an incredible hatchet job on the show it's coming up real soon so i'm sure that'll probably

[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.820]
increase the queue by 20,000 people at least yeah but you know i love your show and they better not

[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:55.860]
take it out here because it really is about the only thing to listen to well you can say that again

[01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:02.780]
now Florida okay and you all have a good day okay see you 1242 at w.i.d now we have four different

[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.560]

[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:23.140]
shaking and quaking out there they stop coming in though did i miss something we got to 25 to 54

you know what's anything about those

[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.040]
if it'll be taken out of context and the twisted around the west of the round by say you used

[01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.220]
to that aren't we you know you know it probably senator in a way i'll get a copy of the

[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:06.300]
uh... comments my m e b hello hello uh... this is a fifth report on the channel seven

[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.600]
okay well listen we can get up to about twenty we can have twenty separate reports well

[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:16.400]
as what he said they uh... showed him sitting at his desk he said simply said he seemed to be

[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:22.880]
quite under term smiling slightly and he said go mind your own business well we don't use any

[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.900]
of those sevens for good words i'll remember that well he's not on the air i've heard him you

[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:28.800]
say he's a

[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.640]
uh... you've been eating being shown eating there's no ender they showed you two three times momentarily

[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.980]
and uh... you're pretty good there was no indication uh... that you're eating there was no

[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:47.060]
food you're not showing there's no food is incredible because we've had two different reports on

[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:47.500]
that

[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.260]
well let's take a poll eating or not eating folks

[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.640]
well you may i don't know what position you take where you sit down and lean over your microphone

[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.940]
if you just that's probably what you want to be doing lately i've been uh... like

[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:04.540]
jim baker i've been doing the show in the fetal position to curl up under the table

[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:09.960]
okay now what about senator in a way what the kind of smart-ass stuff that he had to say

[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:18.060]
well they show it in a way uh... and now uh... somebody said before that he didn't speak that uh... that uh...

[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.260]
they just talked about it

[01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:22.920]
either jane aether reported or he said here's what was said

[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.160]
jane aether yeah jane aether that's the way it's an outspoken

[01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:30.120]
he's not a name a k i e but you pronounce it aether

[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.960]
well i always called her jane aether

[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.380]
well somebody else uh... some of the others did too but it is a great

[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.160]
choose to be on that show green acrease

[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.920]
okay now what did the senator in a way have to do let's get right down to it

[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:48.080]
he was looking at a paper and from and uh... he said just what he said at the

[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.600]
uh... and i thought they said i'm shocked that's the words you do you know the

[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.280]
original jane aether said he said that i he said it then he said

[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.280]
i will send for the tape

[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.220]
well that but that's a long time ago that's about two months ago see so that's

[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.680]
footage that they took uh... they piece together a thing from uh... weeks apart

[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.840]
see that goes way back in the beginning

[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:12.240]
well see that wasn't that indicated yeah that's all i have

[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.320]
well that's the way they do it on tv you know they just take a bunch of stuff and

[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.100]
they uh... you know

[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.820]
snited all up and they slap it together and that's it

[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.380]
well he shocked the idea yes well uh... uh... no one is one of the thing i want to say

[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:29.520]
that's about that report uh... of uh... of uh...

[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.500]
high-chains uh... being performed by the union uh...

[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:37.780]
football players that they're taunting and so on and so forth

[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:42.080]
a lot of things are really provoked that there was a story the day before

[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.940]
coming out of uh... uh... a little bit that uh... that

[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.260]
that there was going to be a big upset there was one uh... when uh... uh...

[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:55.960]
was close to football play and we did the detail about it and that probably

[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.260]
the whole thing and that's the reason for the spawning up the score

[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:04.160]
uh... in the first five or six minutes of the game it looked like an upset

[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.240]
with about to occur uh... and i think that only had completed one pass

[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:14.560]
the nine tries yeah and uh... and they and the other team uh... i was

[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.400]
conscious for us it was three that i saw that part i was at the track they had to

[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.500]
well there's a uh... uh... the idea was uh... uh...

[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:28.060]
so get her to get get a confidence up and so he uh...

[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:32.620]
uh... when he started running uh... uh... the coach left them in there long enough

[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:36.040]
so that he he had a firm uh...

[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.820]
a firm grip on things do we say that firm grip on things

[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.440]
right and uh... we don't want to sit center in a way i'll get upset about it

[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.100]

jolly galley was a rookie in r&d excellent when it came to brainstorming

[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:40.240]
but not real strong in the practical application department

[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:44.700]
i remember one time flying midway airlines to the home office and jolly was

[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:48.440]
captivated by the low fears by his off the copper

[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.880]
arithmetic the company had saved a bundle by year end

[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:56.340]
enough to put in a health club build a new r&d wing and

[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:59.160]
fly everyone to st. croix for the annual meeting

[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:04.680]
his logic was a little sketchy it somehow he made it all sound possible

[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.740]
last i heard he'd turned his twenty seven's million at age twenty seven

[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:12.020]
maybe there was something in his logic after all

[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:17.920]
or maybe he still flies midway midway airlines our spirits a daily part of

[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.660]
business lives happy not only to save you money

[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.400]
but time and effort as well

[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.100]
oh

[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.640]
midway our spirit will lift you

[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:36.740]
sounds like an alibi to me also to be twelve fifty one at wio d we're still

[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.380]
looking for ernie sochin on this

[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.780]
he didn't make the

[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.740]
what you're looking for they don't have ratings on when you're

[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:46.680]
now i know not a word

[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:51.560]
okay let's continue with the calls here we have an open line in dade

[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.420]
county seven five what look at that there it goes boy but you don't get

[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.660]
calls like that on ftl

[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.560]
and even pomegranate look at that fall man air every line is just blazing here

[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.580]
and it's a monday after it is off and lost and the

[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:06.520]
and the ratings are out and they were great for us and they're still calling

[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:10.420]
now i think i think it's marvin it must be because everything else is the same

[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.600]
the fact that we got nick out of there well i don't want to put it in those

[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.500]
terms the fact that nick is busy with other duties during these hours

[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.740]
nice diplomatic way of putting it i think the audience has just changed their

[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:24.200]
whole attitude now that he's not me i'm not the one who's intimidating it was

[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.640]
nick the one who was intimidated that's why there were times a lot of people

[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.540]
were terrified to call right exactly

[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.640]
anyway uh... i want to thank my friends over channel seven for doing that

[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:39.920]
through we've had five different reports on that story so far each one of them

[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:43.820]
has been entirely different and uh... do you have any idea what it really was

[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.960]
all about would you like to wander over there to a client no

[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.500]
are you out of your mind i got the exposed length and against what it's with me

[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:55.780]

[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.800]
well for your talk about how about you wander over there you have nothing else to

[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.620]

[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.680]
the audience had been today that even with a good trend here and with a dolphin loss and with it

[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:25.860]
being a Monday and they had come just been incredibly involved in the show and enthusiastic and some

[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:31.160]
of me even had something to say which this show is very very rare and now all of a sudden i have a

[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.340]
feeling they're going to slack off one thing i should have learned a long time ago you never ever

[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.700]
compliment the audience because then they rest on their laurels okay they sit back and they rest

[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:45.020]
on their laurels okay we do want to remind you that that incredible channel seven news is coming up

[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.840]
later on with the Sally and that whole crew don't we don't we want to give them a little plot since

[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.840]
they've been so kind to me and uh where's that thing with steveshow on it again oh here i keep

[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:59.120]
trying to hide it because it's so morbid um-hmm Marvin Weinstein is the guest on the cane show

[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:04.800]
parents of murdered children and then on sports talk Rick Weaver will tell you why the dolphins were

[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:10.300]
robbed in yesterday's heartbreaking loss to the bills followed by oh bush spring bang who's got

[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:14.940]
just a few appearances remaining until baseball season ends until the start of the dick feral show

[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.280]
that dick feral he i'm gonna do it seriously he is so good that it defies description in other words

[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.700]
there is nothing i can say to you to make you understand just how talented this man is so

[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:30.340]
so i even bought it right and we'll come back after Chuck Meyer in the one o'clock news here on

[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.800]
610 wiod

[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:45.940]
news talk radio 610 wiod presents neo roger to get in touch and talk call 751 wiod in day

[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:54.800]
524 wiod in broder or 655 and 278 wiod in the phone beaches other areas make all collapse the opinions

[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.360]
expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station now here's neo

[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:08.620]
rogers on news talk radio 610 wiod it's so run to two hour it's a little loose there but uh

[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:12.420]
right in the middle of a sentence you wow we don't have time for the show we got so much important

[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:20.400]
stuff going on inside okay yeah well anyway 18 to 34 now spike wise i got to admit even

[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.660]
though he is among head he just uh he did hand me all of this stuff he was a real gentleman about

[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:31.000]
it he looked really depressed well look at this 18 to 34 midday now i don't want anybody to get

[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:42.200]
nervous but wgtr went from an 8 4 to a 7.8 we went from a 6 1 to a 6 7 now 7.8 and 6 7 are not

[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:48.960]
that far apart am i right a point of part this is 18 to 34 which we're not even some those

[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:56.260]
people aren't even supposed to listen to a m when we came here it was what point three point three

[01:29:56.260 --> 01:30:00.860]
zero point three or something like that i think it was a point now we've got a 6.7 i will tell

[01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:06.940]
you gloves 94 had a great 18 to 34 midday they went from a 5 1 to a 7 2 that is great

[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:14.260]
so they jumped right into the free there which is incredible now let's get to these 25 to 54s

[01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:20.360]
because all of you in the audience know that 20 if you're not 25 to 54 in the radio and

[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:26.140]
television world nobody cares about you okay it's like you're a non person right and in the

[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:32.220]
morning rnary had the four let me see four one from a four three so about flat

[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:38.480]
what else do we want to see in the morning now this is the Alice Rantel factor at work it is

[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:48.300]
shocking collins must be going nuts they went from a 0.7 0.7 in the morning to a 1 in 25 to 54

[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:53.820]
last 25 in the only ranked 25 in these they're still last but they're at a point one so they're

[01:30:53.850 --> 01:31:01.510]
moving in on w x dj no one the cat 1.0 did a one yeah and the mbm they're closing it on those

[01:31:03.150 --> 01:31:08.670]
those stations here now what happened here in midday 25 to 54 let's take a peek here i promise

[01:31:08.670 --> 01:31:13.890]
i won't bore you with too much more this magic from a 9.5 down to a 7.8 how the money are dropping

[01:31:13.890 --> 01:31:23.830]
well i was a fluke anyway had i od we went from a 6.3 to a 7.4 and 25 to 54 and of course that

[01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:34.330]
why are you snickering a hot car 7.8 to a 7.2 love from a 3.5 to a 4.7 love had a real nice trend

[01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:41.210]
here okay so it's good that we made up with them just in time just in time hey Greg how you

[01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:53.810]
do a bit yeah uh 25 to 54 in the afternoon now let's take a look at mr. Kane from a 3.5 to a

[01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:59.290]
i don't know what but it's all up see now wait a minute let's check out wld here in midday 25

[01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:06.530]
Debbie might have put a real uh rink let's see i and z 0.7 to a 0.9 oh oh Debbie Ellis she had that

[01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:12.550]
bigger number in midday but it wasn't it was old because 25 to 54 they went from a 1.5 to a 1.3

[01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:19.490]
so evidently Debbie has added the geratol and metamusel set to that after the midday

[01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:24.750]
afternoons let's see if sandy has brought her usual sparkling touch with the younger demos yes

[01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:33.230]
she has from a 1.8 to a 1.5 25 to 54 so uh Dennis it isn't just what it appears to be you continue

[01:32:33.230 --> 01:32:40.390]
selling that it's a great combo that life and wld old older and oldest man let's talk about those

[01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:49.370]
nursing homes and those aclf so good remember though oh yes those adult congregate acd s adult

[01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:56.770]
congregate dying facilities it's just shocking isn't it oh i love that Debbie Ellis so they don't

[01:32:56.770 --> 01:33:04.970]
come any bigger than her so the worm is turning ladies and gentlemen we had that depressing

[01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:09.870]
month and a month of june and i guess jack probably thought well they're going to be off the air

[01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:12.710]
anyway you know their audience is just vanishing but

[01:33:18.730 --> 01:33:24.230]
