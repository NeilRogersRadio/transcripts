[00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.620]
Other areas make all collect.

[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.640]
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.660]
Now, here's Neil Rogers, a new SOC radio 610 WIOD.

[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.040]
It's the van to Tuela!

[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.740]
Hi, V.

[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.000]
He is still the most biggest asshole.

[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.640]
Oh, Tom Denver.

[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.280]
Tom Denver.

[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.680]
Oh, thank you.

[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.280]
Who is it?

[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.900]
It's Mitch Lewis in production there who is one of the biggest fans.

[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.260]
Wake up, wake up.

[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.600]
Oh, they're on the rock.

[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.920]
Okay, now why not, what was that other wild weekend that was Tom Shannon's theme song that you guys ripped off the rock and rebels on swan records?

[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.120]
Well, that was his group.

[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.000]
They never got a dime.

[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.460]
That was Tom he's never got a dime.

[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.800]
He's screwed him over.

[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.700]
You know, tiny Tim re-recorded a rest in my room last year.

[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.680]
What does that have to do?

[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.740]
Notice how he changes his stuff.

[00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.440]
No, I was just...

[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.900]
Because he's talking about ripping off record.

[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.480]
I was ripped off too.

[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.380]
The record was released about three different times.

[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.540]
It sold over a million copies while we...

[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.360]
No, did not sell over a million copies.

[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.980]
Yes, it is. You're the Mr. Misinformation.

[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.880]
It did.

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.160]
It's not a million seller.

[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.800]
You're wrong.

[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.680]
The guy who wants that company lives down here, Bernie Bennett.

[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.500]
If he's listening right now, he owns swan records.

[00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.620]
He brought the Beatles to this.

[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.120]
Well, anyway, whatever it sold, they never got a dime for it.

[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.520]
Yeah, they did get some money for it.

[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.120]
They made about 80,000 sales, I think it was.

[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.200]
They never got it.

[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.780]
I know that right from one of the members of the group.

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.640]
Tony D. Maria, who's working in some little douchebag bar and buffalo now freezing his ass off.

[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.160]
Why don't he get all the chicken wings he wants?

[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.700]

[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.680]
All right.

[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.000]
What is this?

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.320]
You know, I'm getting the feeling that my show is on hiatus or they hate us.

[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.100]
Which is it?

[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.460]
Anyway, let me read this because you're ready to be four and you have no credibility.

[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.980]
Starting today at five o'clock, the W.I.D. Roving Radio will be at Bayfront Park near the world's largest Christmas tree.

[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.980]
To collect clothing, canned food and money for the Camilla's house.

[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.220]
And they'll be open five to midnight tonight, noon to midnight tomorrow and Sunday.

[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.080]
Five to midnight, Monday through Wednesday of next week and then 10 a.m. to midnight when we do our show.

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.860]
Next Thursday live over there.

[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.100]
And we'll be also selling the cassettes for 20 bucks and up.

[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.600]
And also those two orange bowl tickets.

[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.840]
I think you're pouring where are they?

[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.320]
Where are they? They're in the hands of the appropriate people.

[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.920]
Would you want one?

[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.520]
Yeah, I heard that.

[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.300]
But you did give 20 bucks.

[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.900]
Well, if I just want to see it, I don't want to take it home.

[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.120]
OK, it even has W.I.O.D. in the best of the deal.

[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.280]
It looks pretty fancy, fancy and don't forget if you get your cassette.

[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.980]
It's on both sides.

[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.020]
OK, there's 15 minutes on each side.

[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.720]
So don't feel like we're sure changing you and get all hysterical.

[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.420]
OK, now you do this every year.

[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.300]
Camilla, this is like your pet charity.

[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.040]
That's correct.

[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.160]
This is getting the biggest year so far.

[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.200]
It will be.

[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.980]
We raised 38,000 last year.

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.960]
And this year we got 22 almost and we got two weeks to go.

[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.080]
So we'll do 50 easy.

[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.100]
You're not like Jerry Lewis.

[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.100]
You don't live off the money most.

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.900]
No, we don't.

[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.380]
That's a great part about Camilla's house.

[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.800]
It all goes direct over there.

[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.280]
And there's no middleman and no, you know, we don't have to buy time.

[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.700]
And, you know, I don't like that stuff.

[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.240]
I don't know.

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.800]
Anyway, here's a mobile that was desperate enough to call from Boko who says.

[00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.880]
Hi, Neil.

[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.240]
That's pretty good, isn't it?

[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.640]
Yeah.

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.460]
How you doing today?

[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.020]
Excellent.

[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.620]
Well, I got a question.

[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.380]
I live up in Boko.

[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.680]
You know, I didn't want to say I figured Boko would sound a little better than Boko.

[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.060]
Because nobody ever calls for Boko.

[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.400]
We like Boko better than Boko, to be honest.

[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.660]
All right.

[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.180]
Well, I'm from Boko.

[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.420]
I'm from Boko.

[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.420]

[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.960]
That's where I'm from.

[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.400]
Good.

[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.820]
Anyway, I just got a real quick question for Joey.

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.200]
If your show may have stayed on the air, if they would have only advertised your face on

[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.680]
those little papers that go on the trays and Wendy's?

[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.820]
Neil, do you remember that?

[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.620]
Yeah, I sure do.

[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.840]
Did you ever heat it when they just fell like throwing up your sooner looking at John?

[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.440]
A lot of people were losing their meal inside and the people from Wendy's decided it wasn't to appetize it.

[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.140]
You're kind of like staring back at you.

[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.720]
I quit eating at Wendy's when that thing was on there.

[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.140]

[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.440]
But anyway, it was for Anna Rexx.

[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.840]
Is that what it was?

[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.220]
Yeah.

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.800]
Anyway, you guys got a good show.

[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.060]
You guys do sound good to get.

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.840]
Oh, Stone, oh, Brian.

[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.740]
You sound bad.

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.560]
You sound bad.

[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.260]
I mean, I didn't say that because you know, Stan will get his nipples hard when he hears something like this.

[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.260]
And we don't want that to happen.

[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.320]
We gotta be driving in and I'll be nervous as heck.

[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.720]
Neil, do they give him a contract yet?

[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.100]
Who?

[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.440]
IOD.

[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.340]
No, no, no, not Joey.

[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.800]
Stan for Venice, Joey.

[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.880]
No, no, Stan.

[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.400]
No, they didn't give him one yet.

[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.480]
And he came in yesterday and did that tacky thing about it.

[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.100]
He'll give him one.

[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.880]
He'll give two grand to the Camilla's house tonight.

[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.180]
I had about a half a dozen people say to me yesterday that was the tackiest thing that they ever heard.

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.580]
I mean, that was almost as desperate as Joey be here today sucking around for a job.

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.040]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.800]
Don't compare him to a no.

[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.040]
Don't compare Joey to Stan.

[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.440]
I'm not.

[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.420]
I mean, Stan's desperate, but he's not desperate.

[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.600]
Not that desperate, you're right.

[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.820]
No, sir.

[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.520]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.260]
All right, you did a second.

[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.440]
Bye.

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.880]
One handed WIOD.

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.100]
It was.

[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.340]
It was tacky as hell, but he's a neurotic because of business does it to you.

[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.860]
Don't blame him.

[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.540]
It's this business.

[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.920]
Nobody's ever blamed Stan.

[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.680]
Everybody gets jerked around in this business.

[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.180]
We call Stan like son of Neil because he does whatever you do for the next four hours.

[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.180]
He don't do what I do.

[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.460]
Okay.

[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.280]
Five WIOD.

[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.000]
Well, I said he's making up all his crap.

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.720]
I'm trying to defend him against all your...

[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.940]
Why don't you wait till he gets here?

[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.620]
You know, we're going to fight him.

[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.740]
Like I said, right to your face.

[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.960]
Did I say to your show sucks?

[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.780]
And you look like Cal and you're old and did I say that right to you?

[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.860]
Isn't that just to a thing?

[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.480]
Is it that a wonderful person that says that?

[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.520]
No, it's like guys ignore me.

[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.700]

[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.280]
It's a pill, right?

[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.660]

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.160]
You walk up to your street and you know where it's.

[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.300]
And here's the second opinion.

[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.140]
You know.

[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.960]
I mean, why would you say that to someone?

[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.720]
You have no manners.

[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.560]
You're out of order.

[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.980]
You're out of order.

[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.720]
You're out of order.

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.080]
You're out of order.

[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.540]
I'm out of order.

[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.600]
I mean, when you leave here.

[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.480]
I'm out of bounds.

[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.400]
When you leave this place, the two o'clock in the afternoon.

[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.440]
I'll be happy as hell.

[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.800]
But can you go home with yourself?

[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.040]
Yeah, go home fast and wash off that spot on my neck where you schmutzdol over me.

[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.220]
Believe it was your lips.

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.980]
Like, listerine.

[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.860]
Oh, this man, I'm telling you, that the most disgusting, not just a kiss, but like wet and gooey and disgusting and cold as the coffee.

[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.580]
That is mong.

[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.560]
Oh, my gross.

[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.020]
Say that.

[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.460]
They gross.

[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.080]
Yeah.

[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.960]
Why they speak to you?

[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.260]
Okay, listen, we have an open line in Palm Beach at 655.

[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.660]
They write it under a message and flip it under your bedroom door.

[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.040]
Anyway, we'll come back and continue.

[00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.480]
I got to do.

[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.700]
I got a lot of business here, man.

let's get him on the far what did he say what did he say

[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.240]
he said that the show was not performing well and the story

[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.540]

[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.220]

day a week to call races up there why don't you do it i'm not gonna make a fool out of idea i'm

[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.120]
not making a fool out of myself there's no way you're one of the grace force announced i am why

[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.320]
don't i respect these guys i couldn't do it i did harness racing years ago at the county fairs

[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.240]
of michigan but there's only eight horses and see what harness racing you can identify with the

[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.500]
drivers colors that are always the same and thoroughbreds the silks the jockeys were the

[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.840]
silks of the owners so they're different every race and there's like twelve or i couldn't do it

[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.300]
sometimes they're different at the head of the stretch when you've got a horse that has maybe a

[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.980]
white sash across his chest but after he's been trailing horses down the backstarts that white

[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.500]
sashes now brown yeah you don't know who he is well that's what Ross Morton was always said

[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.000]
how do we have to did you have the second race no i haven't even looked at anything you're not

[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.560]
you're not gonna don't know let's wait what candy cap what does that mean

[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.240]
and he kept that means like in your case mental

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.680]
yeah no let's let's not waste time with that let's take the minute that we got in the push for

[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.080]
a real bit what do we got out there today we got some people at all we got some people the

[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.500]
wetter's not all that great and it's a little drizzly but we do have some people and they're

[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.680]
uh... they're starting to trickle in like the rain has a little bit yeah the word around the

[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.420]
the racetrack without a doubt it's not it's not the brunette he can he know thing anymore it's the

[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.280]
Camille's house first people are starting woody Stevens is going to ship in a couple of hours

[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.580]
yeah right uh-huh angel pet he's mad because you know he wants to he wants to start his horses

[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.720]

[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.660]

[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:54.020]
into the field they said get out you can't run the Camille car outside it must be getting pretty

[00:24:54.020 --> 00:25:00.740]
deep over there in the backside well the micron yeary race anyway um... free admission tomorrow

[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.280]
Sunday and Monday and then of course we still have this new cloud hanging over our head now now I

[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.060]
said something early right now nobody will ever pay any attention anything I say but isn't

[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.960]
something to think about is there to the best of your knowledge there's no limit on the number of

[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.000]
races that you have to run on a given day just to say that you're operating is there i don't think there

[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.300]
is no fact that we've run eight nine right right so if if just to avoid a disaster couldn't they

[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:31.200]
run like three races are uh... you know on on two day wednesday and friday there was a time when

[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.760]
brimming him was just about to go belly up and they were worried about losing their

[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.740]
primitive license and i don't know but i know that they talked about it there yeah i do not know

[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.800]
that's been talked about here i really you know i mean they could do it like between two they

[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.500]
could do it for my two to three thirty in the middle of the afternoon which is a later start get it

[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.700]
you know i don't have to have a lot of people out there's not that many would come up at least

[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:55.320]
it would be a gimmick but at least it would give me circumvent all this craze in his about

[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.780]
closing it down i think the horseman could fill three or four races on those three days a week

[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.120]
but i'll tell you leave it with the your staff of attorneys we have and by the way they're excellent attorney

[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.200]
um...

[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.880]
i'm sure it's been thought up and but it's not it's not as a well-in-idea of you might think because

[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.140]
it would technically i suppose that i really know i think it would it would appease that situation

[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.980]
you have a daily double you have a bit three and have whatever the heck you wanted to have

[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.060]
also by the way they're starting konella's this week on i think i'm just gonna say that they started

[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:29.480]
in today the first second third and seventh race and here's an example of mr brunette trying to

[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.840]
work with a horseman they felt that konella's would help the handle they felt that they'd like to

[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:38.640]
to be okay fine well that's because you're in florida you haven't been here that long but in florida

[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.580]
most of the gamblers are into exotics konella's perfect is perfect is i mean that's the name of the

[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:48.580]
game down here whether it's a dog's or a high-wire harness racing and uh... you know that's just one more

[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.160]
pool one more way for the people to put their money in there and i think it's a good idea

[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.520]
and that's really after that i want to take this time to say what a gracious man he is and what a

[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.280]
very nice man yes he is he's a great man we're sort of the out of players in this big thing we're not

[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:05.500]
the heavy hitters with the the half of we're just trying to make a buck and work every day and

[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:11.680]
he was a gracious and and open host and and i felt great he he's a fine man and i have nothing

[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:15.560]
but respect for him yeah he's a good friend and a super guy and i'm sorry that he's like in the middle

[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.620]
right now of this other thing that's going on with the sand track over there but you know it's not

[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.940]
a personal thing and he knows that yeah okay they will see it tomorrow we are now counting down

[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.460]
okay the committance house excellent nobody should miss it all right you can love this as a five

[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.520]
minute even joley's coming out great yeah i'll be there see a big one commercial meal what's not a

[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:46.680]
commercial what is it it was a discussion uh... uh... hot product hi lia can i ask you a question yes

[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.420]
the metro rail yes how much free time to the local stations you weren't here then were you no but

[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:58.340]
i heard all that i've never had you on on on on on for hours here come out the mini heat cigarette

[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.780]
oh did a real good job i'll commend him for but he took a lot of time for weeks on his sports

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:08.320]
cast on four pushing uh... sign up of the seasons we need to have ten thousand or twelve thousand

[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.860]
season tickets uh... so you know and you did a good job okay for the but here's the same kind of

[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.280]
thing the heat is a privately owned thing it's good for the community you know i'm out of mba

[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.280]
but it's great we've got it that they're being supported hi alia is in business in partnership with

[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.720]
the state we get tax revenue from there you know it's not just a private thing everybody's got a

[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:33.040]
little bit of a stake in that why are you gonna close what's the reason well he listened a lot of

[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.980]
people come in and i have this thing you know i've been listening to you for weeks and i never heard

[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.320]
the official reason i don't know they've been dying for years over there at alia the handles been

[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.500]
going down it's a psychological thing people don't want to go over there they think it's a Hispanic

[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.360]
thing or it's not safe or it's too far they got a million excuses they've forgotten how beautiful

[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.720]
it is in the flamingos and what a sensational track it is and this year the state came up with

[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.960]
this deregulation which is that anybody it's right we can't handle it anymore they can't get along

[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.440]
with three track owners will have deregulation run whatever the hell you want to run okay so now

[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.500]
rune de it highly runs up against calder and gulps team you can't do it i mean each had track has

[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.460]
rough enough time by itself without trying to compete with another track so they've created a monster

[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.580]
so they live off the money that is gambled on is that it's their percentage out of it to take

[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.900]
that they get that's right pay the first money for the horseman and it pays for their expenses and

[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.380]
for hopefully a profit which you're obviously not making all right now you said the two year olds

[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.060]
are running at the other race tracks and that's really not good six seven races almost every day today

[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.560]
i think what's five what does that mean that there amateurs to your own yeah young or like it would

[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.160]
be like 15 year old dish jockeys you can relate to that i just uh probably not going to be all

[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.900]
that great a lot of them have never started before their first time starters so while you've got

[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:49.660]
to go on is their workouts which is is meaningless all right the big race is the older horses then

[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.740]
is that well i said it's better quality all right really is and you know if it's cheaper

[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.000]
persons it's still better for from a betting standpoint so they got to have a big crowd in order to

[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.860]
have the better horses they get the bigger persons right did i figure it out right and that's what

[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.320]
you're trying to do for highly right so they can release break even and not close it down if they

[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.480]
close it down permanently it's going to be really would be a terrible loss you've never been out

[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.360]
now beautiful i heard it's magnificent it really is great and you know you got your heart in

what they said on the air about me the other day him and that other jaboni from the herald

[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.840]

[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:45.540]
true isn't that what he says true what i'm trying to say about me is this i probably had the

[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.360]
wrong show for me okay that's the wrong show for me but that does not make me a bad performer

[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.880]

[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.860]
all i wanted you and i put him down by saying that i shouldn't do that all i wanted you guys to say

[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:20.560]
was the guy's a talent he's got some talent he's good and and he belongs on the air but this is

[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:28.280]
the wrong vehicle form and i never heard that he did say as i recall that uh he didn't know how

[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.140]
much input you had into the show not all how much control you might have on the show and i'm not

[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.400]
good in that format i'm good i'm not a reader i'm a guy who i'm learning this format why do you

[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.720]
