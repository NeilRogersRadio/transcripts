[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.240]
putting all these plates together for everybody

[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.500]

[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:26.360]
yeah right away especially that blonde Chinese woman oh man that was interesting

[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.500]
never saw anything like it's 11 past 11 to w i o d toyota of hollywood is making deals as i've

[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.200]
been telling you that are just could be the chance of a lifetime and if you think i'm exaggerating

[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.320]
just to get you in there you're wrong because card dealers as you know are trying like crazy

[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.580]
everything under the sun to get people to come on in right now and buy because things are a little

[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.120]
on the slow side it's a little bit of the um doldrum days you know what i'm saying the dog days

[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.540]
but toyota hollywood as you know always has the lowest prices and now they've got gigantic factory

[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:59.460]
rebates on top of which they're slashing even extra chunks off the prices on a sticker of

[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.380]
virtually every car in a lot so if you're in the market to buy or trade or if you thought you were

[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.320]
going to do it in a couple of months maybe give a second thought to go in and look in around

[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:10.060]
right now because you're never going to get a better deal than the ones that are waiting for you

[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.160]
right now at toyota of hollywood don't forget you got just a few days left to take advantage

[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.300]

[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:54.500]
these poor suckers out there these sickle fans who are cutting up their cards and sending them in

[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.260]

[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:36.120]

[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:43.640]
is so boring when he calls in on his show he's a wonderful guy but he is so boring god look at that

[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:49.380]
we just as you mentioned his name the collar and go drop right off the line two seven eight w i

[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:55.960]
and d and bokeh here's the filled Beckman in hollywood another former radio superstar that's it and i

[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.100]
want to say one thing i really enjoy that rickshaw air check that you play the latest one with

[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:05.620]
there isn't that great talking up the dream lover that's yeah i think i may have to i may have to

[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.960]
get that out here yeah that's my favorite word is is that from 1959 or or is it newer than that or do

[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.360]
well i really don't know but we'll have to check the date on it okay probably early

[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.000]
i had a bite of double of something for you from last hour i guess now i would think it

[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.540]
probably was from when dream lover was out which is about 61 i would say 1959 believe it or not

[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.900]
was it yeah 30 years ago wow okay about the circle you know you mentioned that they were managed by

[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.520]
brine Epstein they were also were the opening act for the Beatles in their last tour i got to really

[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.920]
they and bobby have in the run et's all open for the Beatles and it cost you four dollars and

[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.160]
fifty cents for a ticket oh by the way speaking of the run et's if anybody at our friends and

[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.160]
specs or anybody has got any run net yet there's a reason why this guy named alan Klein who is the

[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.740]
manager of uh who was the manager of abco industries that tied up the Beatles stuff for so long

[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.940]
messed up the rolling stone stuff for so long is now involved with the Phil Spector stuff are

[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.300]
you that's why i can't find it it was within a month of release and he got involved in it and

[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.360]
put the whole thing on hold isn't it incredible i mean that rhino has i've been scouring looking for

[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.380]
a Phil Spector CD but all those great Phil Spector fill it off your groups you know the run et's

[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:16.120]
and all the others that i can't find any rhino had like an eight or nine set of CDs retro

[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.340]
respective of Phil Spector's career was was almost to the printing plant the pressing plant and

[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.000]
they've got got held up well i don't know how long that's going to take shocking i don't know

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.900]
if anybody would know yeah i don't know the thing about pop sickles and icicles i don't know if it

[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.420]

[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.800]

and that's going to be it for the 11 o'clock hour god it seems like we've been here for at least

[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:35.720]
15 or 20 hours this is giving new meaning to the word ponderous for this has been just incredible it's

[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:41.280]
been awesome but it's been ponderous yeah April does have the sensuous exclusive 12 o'clock WIOD

[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.340]
news we'll come back at 12 o'clock five Steve with his big blockbuster show at 2 this afternoon

[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:55.620]
more than you ever dreamed you would know about the circle high ladies and gentlemen I

[00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:09.180]
ready to broadcast I love myself now I'm gonna tell you we owe a tremendous

[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:19.120]
debt of gratitude to Steve Stancell over it GTR because what 97 what is that he won

[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:24.800]
put it on the screen I can't read Laura's lips Laura she's got something to say about everybody

[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:34.260]
who breathes in the building he broke his nose who's Stancell how do you do that he broke his

[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:42.320]
nose playing bachiball by softball yeah well that's a GTR softball team oh and if you saw those

[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:48.060]
trends it came out they didn't only lose in softball anyway no but he did that cart and it's it

[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:54.140]
just fits in with everything I mean there isn't a record there might be one record can I play it

[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.040]
yeah it could be this could be tough I was gonna say there isn't a record that's been made

[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:04.620]
that that particular part will not do the fuck up yet well this could be it really

[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.640]
or these are ones that have the different cuts no I thank God they put the same cuts on the front

[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:15.920]
the numbers on the front weird as they had on the back why would they do that and it's amazing

[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.460]
because it's the same it's the billboard series but with some of them they got carried away and they

[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.840]
did different numbers because they want to do a scotch shwar it's hit him playing softball isn't

[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:30.540]
that something Laura's Scott hit Steve Stancell playing softball because Steve made some

[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:38.900]
in temperate remark about Laura and her very tiny eyes or something like that so it says there's

[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.040]
one less shooter well I would say that Steve Stancell is not a bad looking guy in fact he's probably

[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.040]
the only guy over a GTR looks human isn't he's not he's pretty good looking guy right yeah

[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:58.780]
Laura's he's okay by me in fact she says now and Glenn Wilson Glenn Wilson oh Glenn Wild

[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.420]
well that's a Glenn Drowbot yeah well Glenn's um

[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.600]
schmutzie looking at me he's not a he's a pack oh he's very cute

[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:13.160]
Laura says Glenn Wild is very cute do you think he's very cute never thought of it no I never

[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.460]
thought it was cute I think that Ross is cute okay and Todd would be a lot cuter if he'd come

[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.720]
in and stop doing all those jobs on the outside yeah

[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:49.740]
not bad he did it not bad he did it okay it's 1221 and WIOD we do have it open line and

[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.000]
brown or it's 524 WIOD I guess we're getting the second race today with Phil Saltsman

[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.880]
oh Calil Lady with Rodriguez is my pick out of desperation I don't have any idea the heralds

[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.420]
not there anymore the sports sharing sharing came in and messed with our all when I have it here

[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.460]

[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:14.180]

[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:20.020]
oh Calil Lady's also 6 to 1 in a herald morning line but they got just beware with Kesti it was

[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:27.380]
the best bet of the day and nobody picks oh Calil Lady well of the name like that I think because

[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:32.300]

[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:39.280]
