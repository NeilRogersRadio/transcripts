[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.760]
Talk about perfect.

[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.340]
Yeah, I thought it was perfect.

[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.740]
By the way, I just want to make a comment for our friends next to our channel 7.

[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.180]
I know it's a long walk.

[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.000]
They are. I got to be honest when they invented the word douchebag.

[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.940]
They must have been looking as somebody who works next to her.

[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.540]
Not Sally, all of which she screams a lot.

[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.760]
Wow.

[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.360]
You might want to sing it.

[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.840]
No, it's for no, don't worry.

[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.440]
Be happy.

[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.960]
Yeah, that kind of fits in with everything because Hamburg is going to channel 6.

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.280]
We are just tickled about the game.

[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.900]
But it's the pleases punch as Hubert would have said.

[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.420]
Hubert's coming in a little later on with Lou Gehrig, so I'll probably say that again.

[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.060]
What is it?

[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.480]
Hey, listen, a lot of these people are making a comeback now.

[00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.020]
President Grant is going to be on the show on Renere Show with Henry Drinking on Monday morning.

[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.980]
It ought to be great and expanded Drinking report.

[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.960]
Yeah, they are going to have a little chugging contest on the year.

[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.720]
Great.

[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.060]
But anyway, Hamburg is going to channel 6 very soon.

[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.280]
I have a feeling they are going to let him go.

[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.180]
In other words, they don't know that they did not do it.

[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.560]
Not be on the game.

[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.340]
Also, some other information that obviously was blown away out of proportion.

[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.920]
I'm just going to tell you right up front and I'm sure I'll have to say it later on.

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.320]
And Stan will tell you the same thing.

[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.520]
We can't discuss it.

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.940]
Okay.

[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.520]
In any way, shape or form.

[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.420]
And there's nothing more for us to say.

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.900]
But we can't discuss it.

[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.020]
Period.

[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.640]
That's right.

[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.100]
Period.

[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.440]
No exceptions, no ifs buts are in.

[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.680]
So rather than have a lot of you waste your time, that's where we are.

[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.000]
So anyway, life goes on.

[00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.840]
And, um,

[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.320]
Pompano Park.

[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.200]
It's, I last night I was up there practicing plunging my guts out for the big night tonight.

[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760]
A fat rich night, both were up there practicing.

[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.520]
We had an excellent practice round.

[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.200]
Plunged our guts out.

[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.060]
And tonight is the big night.

[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.620]
Brears Crown Night at Pompano Park.

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.740]
And I saw Stan Birgstein up there wandering around kind of like a lost step child last night.

[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.560]
And I want to go up and say hi and introduce myself.

[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.200]
But I don't, I just don't like doing that.

[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.220]
You know, like, you know what I mean?

[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.820]
Do you do that?

[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.740]
You walk up to somebody that you'd like to meet depends.

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.740]
Well, I know when Giselle Fernandez comes up, Stan's show is like, I know him.

[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.420]
Now that'll be timely too, because Hamburg is going over to Channel 6.

[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.220]
I hope, and I hope Dick Lowe's always listening, okay?

[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.400]
I hope that everybody who enjoyed Hamburg on four will watch him on six.

[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.940]
I will.

[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.820]
And then like twice that many more.

[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.060]
I hope they stick it to four is so good, because they just don't know what they're doing.

[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.820]
They don't know what they're doing.

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.800]
In fact, see how that ties in.

[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.180]
Remember that great campaign?

[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.280]
Oh, man.

[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.680]
I forgot.

[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.160]
Yeah.

[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.160]
When Susan was doing a Kazzazki and sitting around like a cradle there.

[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.640]
Oh, man.

[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.720]
That was embarrassing.

[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.200]
So those of you who can pick up Channel 6, it'll be great.

[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.640]
Hamburg's going to be on there and that'll be in about a month.

[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.380]
And I wish him the very best.

[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.060]
He's a great guy, super guy and an excellent anchor.

[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.200]
And of course not an anchor like Ann.

[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.800]
When you're as big as Ann is, man, you could anchor the Queen Mary, but that's another story.

[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.540]
Is that what they call them, anchors?

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.440]
Oh, brother.

[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.280]
They can tie her to the entire naval fleet and just to never budge in.

[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.680]
Well, she's the dean.

[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.260]
The dean.

[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.120]
The Florida town.

[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.700]
Is it the dean or the deaness?

[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.640]
Well, deemess?

[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.020]
Deemess.

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.220]
Deemess.

[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.800]
Deemess.

[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.400]
Well, I'm not going to touch that.

[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.220]
1009 at WIOJ.

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.820]
It's a great Friday.

[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.820]
We got paid yesterday.

[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.840]
We want to thank publics.

[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840]
Of course, every Monday in Friday brings reinary food.

[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.520]
And since he was out of town today, I'm doing a show from Disney World.

[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.520]
We've got it all here.

[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.080]
And also the people from where though, now I'm not really sure where those people from Max's place.

[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.180]
I don't, you have to ask Mr. Barrow that Henry had in here.

[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.220]
Boy, Henry had quite a session in this studio.

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.040]
I've never seen him.

[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.040]

[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.020]
Even when we're in here, we never mess it up like this.

[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.160]
But it's okay, Henry.

[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.840]
Somebody will come in and eat it.

[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.420]
In fact, it riches in the neighborhood and wants to eat his sorrows away.

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.100]
I don't want to, I'm doing the influence him.

[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.080]
But man, there's a lot of food.

[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.400]
Yeah.

[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.260]
And shells is coming later with our food.

[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.720]
I can't wait for that chowder.

[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.540]
Oh, God.

[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.340]
I'm such a great mood for clam chowder.

[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.500]
Anyway, I got the program for tonight for Pompo'no for the Abrivers Crown.

[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.960]
Is my favorite, Jackie?

[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.260]
Or driver.

[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.660]
Is he driving tonight?

[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.680]
Who's that?

[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.860]
You know who's he?

[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.500]
No, he's not driving tonight.

[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.480]
I can't say it, I have to.

[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.860]
I watched that race on the replay last night and he won just like a champion

[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.180]
and Jeff Gregory was second.

[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.240]
In fact, that's the only thing I had last night in the first race, Gregory, came second.

[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.040]
From way behind, couldn't get out, finally got out and finished second.

[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.120]
I had a nice perfect end.

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.960]
I was ahead, a few bucks.

[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.780]
But it didn't last too long.

[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.400]
Anyway, I wonder in this program if they have the charts, I guess not.

[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.060]
They should be in here somewhere, the charts from all they must have, they made this up early.

[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.580]
They made it up early.

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.540]
And a great part about tonight's program at Pompo'no for Abrivers Crown.

[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:27.240]
In every one of the breeder's crown races, they have a page next to it where they have a run down on each horse in the race with some comments and some little tips there.

[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.920]
So anyway, we're looking forward to that Bill Cauter and I will be up there plunging our brains out tonight.

[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.180]
Rumor has it that we're going to be sitting at the table with Mr. Moreno and his wife.

[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.700]
Am I spodadios crest?

[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.360]
I mean, this is the Dolphin station, you better be friends.

[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.800]
Oh boy, I'm impressed.

[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.700]
That's incredible.

[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.720]
Lucky number 13.

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.120]
Lucky, isn't that a radio station?

[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.760]
Lucky number 13 used to be.

[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.000]
Well, I guess it's still there.

[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.640]
I'm lucky 13.

[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.560]
I can't hear it.

[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.500]
Anyway, nobody else can either.

[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.140]
12 minutes after 10, a WIO.
