[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.860]
carried away here let's go to Kendall hello now yes sir how you doing okay pal I have a question

[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.960]
yeah why do people move to Miami Beach is now is this like a rhetorical question now this is

[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.260]
an uh a little question that city officials um ask some people and they got a start on

[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.680]
conclusion you want to hear about go ahead sir I can't wait people move to Miami Beach for the beach

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.040]
oh isn't that funny I'll be damned you mean they probably can they conducted a big study on

[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.900]
I probably spent about four hundred thousand dollars not just five thousand of course rates

[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:04.580]
raised by the private sector yeah and the average resident age 88 no 35

[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.820]
yeah and you believe that right of course yeah you know that's question about it a major

[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:16.480]
soft floor to magazine article mm-hmm I think who wrote that barber capidman and I think

[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:23.500]
there ought to be like a major TV uh investigation of that yeah what do you think about this

[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:29.140]
eastern stuff unbelievable what do you mean what do I think about it what does that mean

[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.140]
well the way Bush handle it and that Bush isn't handling it at all that's what I mean Bush

[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.700]
is a whim don't you understand that Bush is about as presidential as a pewy herman I know I'm

[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.460]
embarrassed to say I'm voted for that well I mean I don't know what made you people think that

[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.220]
this guy of a sudden grew some over the summertime or something I mean he got was always a whim

[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.820]
he's a bigger whim now than ever he's busy uh you know just putting on a pressure for his drinking

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.260]
body it's just an embarrassment there it's just a joke I mean the guy's in his ass too yeah

[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.920]
he's only been in office less than a month now about three weeks and he's already made more

[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.500]
mistakes than most people making a lifetime I guess he's uh it's anyone is over I think

[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.820]
I think he could probably reduce the federal deficit if he would put a tax on every mistake that he

[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.900]
makes I wonder who he was hanging with that that that wife of his got a go man yeah you mean his

[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.500]
grandmother yeah well that's what America won didn't you remember when Reagan got in they said that

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.780]
everybody wanted a father figure I guess they want a grandmother figure yeah okay with margo

[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.220]
Delray hello hello see how you doing okay thank you and name's Truman believe it or not well

[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:47.380]
I like your book in cold blood it was really the reason I was calling it well several you know

[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:53.460]
sitting here one thing sort of struck me listening to that marina and inflatable commercial I

[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.900]
wish on why is it every time I hear inflatable by I think a marvel I don't know why that is but yeah

[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.720]
why is that I don't know just the two sort of go together I guess but the reason I was really calling

[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.460]
is I grew up I think you made me blowing it out of proportion you know what I mean okay

[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:14.240]
the reason I called originally was that I grew up in the Chicago area and I you know I've

[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:20.340]
followed the Chicago white-clothed handcuffs to some extent and you know ugly baseball players

[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:25.560]
were a trademark a Chicago Sherman Loller I think was probably as catchers he and Andy Etcherbeer and

[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.320]
I think have the catching award and yogi and well there was a no one for the cubs two of

[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.060]
a fact two of them there was Perry Cheedy you remember yep I sure do and he wasn't exactly you know

[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:40.260]
a good place to look at but there was people like early win and Nelly Fox with those great big jol

[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.860]
the yeah that was the classic and here's the guy was my favorite jungle Jim Rivera you remember

[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.400]
that yeah you got arrested for raping you have to write and you know what happened he fled you know

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.240]
he was the first guy to really go head first you know the record well we don't want to get in bad

[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.120]
well you know but that's all you need in the second base yeah well it's and then speaking

[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.260]
of people getting shot or in jail any wait kiss to the Phillies he was one of the ugliest people

[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.620]
in a history and and will he put in had Jones yeah that's another way there was a really ugly guy

[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.060]
and here's one that I think that you couldn't really call him ugly because you could never see his

[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:18.700]
face especially the night games many monoso he was talking about you guys being nanny and Nelly

[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.600]
and putting head well out of the guy that's really what you're saying right and Hank Sauer that

[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.200]
was a nice I was another one and Hank Bauer yeah he was my favorite player when I was a kid

[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.320]
Hank Bauer right and Walt Dropa and here's Dropa yeah there's another moose for you my favorite

[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.720]
moose collection so we got Bruce Gower and Mr Dropa I guess who have make me okay now what let me

[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.440]
say one other thing here I I you know this I can't believe nobody has hit on this yet and I

[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.720]
think football football just doesn't have the class and the color that baseball does you know football

[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.700]
most guys I mean there are nicknames but not like in oh not like in bad like in base you know

[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.760]
I hear he couldn't I mean we we don't have an icky uh the words for example but we got some pretty

[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.360]
wild baseball players right I mean you're not gonna hear Nelly's in football well there's a few

[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.560]
Nelly's that's what Dave Coppe said and they got crystal glass or somebody like that and crystal

[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.860]
gear yeah okay well listen you've been a really informative caller but you're right on

[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.280]
television you like the white socks man you're right ugly as the day is long oh they're

[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.060]
they just one brief question I and nobody got it on me to play on the team nobody said on this

[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.140]
and I can't believe it the Easter when the Eastern pilots walked off the line yes sir all the other

[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.120]
pilots from all the other airlines I think maybe I heard this wrong but didn't they tell us

[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:36.640]
that hey in sympathy we're now going to fly safe yeah well they're just installing a little bit oh

[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.460]
is that what most of the people are used to that anyway so what's the big deal because I never used

[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.700]
to be too scared until they told me now that I fly in all these years on the face you know yeah

[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.520]
all right well that was just what I had today okay well listen you've been quite a caller believing

[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.840]
I have a great thank you 124 a w i d that was on a vocal line oh damn man we are really picking up

[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:02.280]
some serious team now because it's the big one to two obviously 278 9463 278 w i d on

[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.720]
america's only radio show where you also get the weather channel thrown in as kind of a bulls

[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.800]
no extra charge now we have a little something from the facts machine

[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.920]
obvious number one Billy Martin number two yogi pera yeah Billy had a schnauz that could stop

[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.660]
saying Lewis is no question about that anyway speaking of that if you have a big schnauz don't

[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.480]
bother to come by on Sunday but if you look almost human we certainly invite you to come out to

[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:33.520]
Toyota of Hollywood even a 128 w i o d here's another good vote on the facts machines as the

[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.120]
obvious man ever to put on a baseball uniform is none other than no neck Williams former Detroit

[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.020]
tiger no that yeah well these names it's a good vote but no neck played most of his very brief

[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.340]
illustrious career with the Indians Walter no neck Williams and I think also a little with the white

[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.760]
socks not that they wanted him to play but he was ugly enough and a white socks like those ugly

[00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.420]
guys okay the white socks had a guy named Jim brideweezer who was astonishingly shockingly ugly okay

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.640]
and that's what it takes to qualify to play for the white socks Harry carried by the way he

[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.700]
used to men easily forgotten because he was so many years with the cardinals and now for many

[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:16.840]
years with the cubs but in between was with the white socks which is why he left now you were

[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:23.660]
talking you said about a half hour ago that Joe Grazio is no longer doing the play

[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:29.380]
but yes he's got the contract okay so mr. he's going who is works he works anywhere that they'll

[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:35.440]
hire him uh he's moving from NBC to CBS or because he always does golf on CBS yeah well this is

[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.160]
really a thing when the games with Tom Seever for one year I see because it used to be when Joe

[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:46.560]
used to do the baseball game show when they when it would they have a rain a rainy day yeah and

[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.700]
they would remove the tarp from the field they used to remove the tarp from his head at the same

[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.260]
time that is correct but those were the days in fact when the lights would go out in the stadium they

[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:01.060]
used to use the reflection of the camera of Joe's dome in order to keep the broadcast on the screen

[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:07.180]
to get the lighting rowered hello Neil how you doing just great pal can you hear me on this

[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:13.040]
most well it's not always good it's cold maybe a George Bush spent too much time in England is

[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.380]

say that all right if the score is two forty five for three what is it let me tell you the

[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.280]
British are the only people in the world who have sex on Monday and have an orgasm on Thursday

that's true that's true but it launched through Sunday that is true okay now what is the question

[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.960]
in cricket in cricket if the score is two forty five for three yeah what does that mean

[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.760]

[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:19.900]
we're sorry that we can't recommend the nearest wimpsies and all those chips and all those horrendous

[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:27.620]
uh oh shepherds bonfire oh my god yeah but anyway char-hut is the it's 150 a WIOG and I was this

[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.760]
thing about British Royal they have always been confused because I wondered why you can be born

[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.860]
for example if if the king gets married then his wife is the queen am I right mm-hmm

[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.700]
but if the queen gets married like what is her husband's name I can never think of

[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:47.260]
or queen Elizabeth's husband's name what is it oh um yeah yeah mr. bland I mean he's like

[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:53.940]
totally without any personality at all what is it no he's not the king he hasn't become he's not

[00:30:53.940 --> 00:31:00.620]
the king so as Elvis once said he said almost anybody can be a queen but only a very select few can

[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:07.140]
be king that's what Elvis said mm-hmm anyway what is his name anyway I keep all the duke of

[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:15.240]
Windsor no he's not the duke of Windsor no he's not is he the duke of Windsor was the one that was

[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:21.900]
married to Wallace Warfield and he gave up the throne so to speak wasn't he's not the duke of Windsor

[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.660]
and that's like that's like when he said that um what was the Dennis Ecclesley

[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.680]
was the new coach of the hurricane yeah Nick is getting I think he's catching it from you or something

[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.000]
not the duke of Windsor there's no cure for the Windsor was married to Wallace Warfield right

[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.820]
isn't that correct well and none of you people know anything about um prince Philip that's it he's

[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.520]
not the duke of Windsor he does have some other official name like that like uh duke of Earl or

[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:56.320]
something like that yeah okay Miami hello hello duke of mass I think it is yes I kneel yeah listen

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:02.500]
now please don't hang up on me yeah I told you earlier about man that no no I can't talk to

[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.380]
twice in the same days sir please spare me the pain I mean your first call was embarrassing

[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:12.400]
enough Miami hello no in fact uh that reaches pacemaker just one of the calls yes

[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.840]
no I think he's left the club of world consort well excuse me uh big a pardon

[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:23.180]
hey wait no isn't that prince Philip yeah he's prince but it is true though I've that's like

[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.840]
an honorary title but it that's right it's not a joke though in the king if somebody inherits

[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:35.400]
the throne and becomes king then when he gets married his wife is the queen right right uh but if

[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.020]
the queen gets married her husband doesn't become the king because he's not part of the uh the

[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.760]
bloodline he's not in the right kind of like horses you know that's why you notice that the queen

[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.260]
and her family are all heavily into horses I think there's a little more there than meets the eye

[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.740]
anyway go ahead I have a question I noticed I got the call her thinking you know this it was a long

[00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.760]
I have a question over the week for you from a priest the fratigate to lose the

[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:08.400]
skull for obvious reasons yes he wanted to know just how sturdy jack really is

[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:18.500]
well I have to find that out for himself sir yes excellent question okay no I have to go see

[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:43.180]
but she had three names she I'm telling you wall is warfield Simpson I think she would marry twice

[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.320]
or something that's why she wasn't accepted because she was a divorce uh huh but her first

[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:54.140]
husband's name was Simpson and her name was warfield okay the other way around it could have been well

[00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:02.940]
touch on yeah is that it that's it okay wow 153 at W.I.O.D. you never read that book about the prince

asshole get off doing this blank what am I supposed to do I get verbally abused and I'm calling my

[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.380]
cable company well I would call and talk to one of the supervisors they're continental and tell

[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.040]
they're rude to any of my callers see where I get off doing it is that we have sports channel

[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.220]
of Florida buying advertising their their message the thrust of what they're doing is to try to

[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.840]
get public support and they you know if they get enough people to call the various cable systems

[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.060]
public demand will dictate that they're going to have to eventually more and more put on the

[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.760]
sports channel of Florida they can't wait if that anyone's in the gaming if he hasn't got any

[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.380]
business he's got any business treating you like that and I'm going to call continental cable

[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.660]
when I get home today and chew them a good ass okay because I got the number in the names of some

[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:11.460]
of the uh stupid advisors over there and they got no business treating customers like crap that's

[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.580]
the problem with cable operators man they got a monopoly in every community and they figure if

[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.920]
you don't like what they're giving you a drop dead go to hell and stick it in your ear okay

really piss me off he should tell the same story to yeah when he calls and talks to the supervise

[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:39.920]
I mean all we're doing is pass in a message along and letting the public know the facts I mean

[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.540]
we you know we're supposed to keep it a secret that the Sunshine Network has an sensuous

[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.860]
relationship with the most of the cable operators they got a piece of the action and as a

[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.060]
result they're trying to keep the sports channel floored off and put them out of business

[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:57.100]
and keep the public from getting to see the heat games and hurricane games and NHL hockey and all

[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:02.740]
