[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.200]
You're too high.

[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.220]
What makes me so warm?

[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.300]
I had clay and I clay.

[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.000]
The whole night through.

[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.240]
I'd best take a sunsray or no, with all curly birds, wanting to die in cafeteria little pieces.

[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.760]
On night on music, you'll remember what you probably want.

[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.240]
Goodbye.

[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.620]
Please, please.

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.600]
We'll still have the privilegely possible, a common door custom presentation.

[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.800]
Goodbye.

[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.660]
Okay, it's 1007 at WIOD.

[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.280]
Is somebody mess with his mic again?

[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.820]
Yep, sure enough.

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.960]
Boy, they just keep messing with these things and they mess with the settings.

[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.820]
Could you hear how tinny that was?

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.160]
Let's turn it around all the way to the front.

[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.460]
How do you like that?

[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.060]
Is that good?

[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.240]
Yeah, I like that.

[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.980]
Anyway, it's just a case of everybody's got nobody can leave their hands to themselves.

[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.920]
Okay, you know what they say?

[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.760]
Idol hands make, what, what, how's that saying go?

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.020]
Devils, the devils work.

[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.120]
The devils play ground.

[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.140]
Something.

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.880]
Idol hands.

[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.800]
With the blue dress on.

[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.400]
Your grandmother used to say,

[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.580]
Idol hands.

[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.460]
No, my grandmother didn't use to say that.

[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.720]
She used to say,

[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.880]
Hawkman is can't try to do that.

[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.940]
Anyway, it's 10 at WIOD.

[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.920]
The first call must be a crank because it says,

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.160]
Hello?

[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.600]
Hello, Neil.

[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.000]
Yeah.

[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.040]
Isn't that cute?

[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.680]
Isn't that wonderful?

[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.140]
Maybe you could talk to the French wine man that was on with the henna lady the other day.

[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.980]
We couldn't understand what he was saying.

[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.640]
Well, I was very cute.

[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.540]
I have a few things I have to say to you.

[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.080]
Yes.

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.820]
First of all, Robert Clary over there?

[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.580]
Huh?

[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.820]
Robert Clary.

[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.600]
He's a big baby talk.

[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.480]
I'm very sorry that the cops lost.

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.400]
That's okay. We're used to it.

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.660]
Yeah, I know.

[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.680]
And a few weeks ago before they did,

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.120]
I called you up and asked you if you would play that song.

[00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.760]
Did they vote?

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.200]
Did they play in Chicago all the time?

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.680]
Did that help?

[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.540]
Did you have a cup of sand?

[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.020]
And maybe if you have it, you play it for the rest of the day.

[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.580]
Now, we just got you playing it as a matter of fact before you called.

[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.520]
Well, maybe on another day then.

[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.100]
Yeah, maybe.

[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.980]
Maybe.

[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.140]

[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.560]
Also, I wanted to tell you that I'm going to be there for quite some time, aren't you, Brad?

[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.420]
Hmm.

[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.660]
And I've tried to remember ever to call some other people I've done and say,

[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.740]
hey, can I hang on the phone for four hours and run up to Bill for that?

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.740]
No, chance.

[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.580]
But I would like to know who it was possible.

[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.620]
It's maybe once a month, twice a month, I could call and be your unofficial foreign correspondent.

[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.800]
Sure, no problem.

[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.940]
Is that okay?

[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.520]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.980]
Hi, Brad. How you doing?

[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.620]

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.120]
and broard now nothing I mean we haven't really asked for calls yet but it is it

[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.880]
is fascinating to see how this town works so well together anyway speaking of

[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.980]
being in a car I'm listening last night and I punched up oh now the first let

[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:46.180]
me give you a little history since wftl went talk okay I punched it up one

[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:53.080]
what now was it oh I know it was a couple of weeks ago and Mike Roberts

[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.500]
his father program director his father had passed away and he was out for several

[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:02.580]
days and norm Kent was supposed to be filling in and Craig Worthing was still

[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.820]
on by the way got a nice letter from Craig did I thank him for that Craig is a

[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:11.360]
great guy unfortunately he's at fdl big meetings so Ernie Sochin wasn't there

[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.900]
and she's and I'm listening and she's just dying she's talking about everything

[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.280]
she's reading out of the paper and I can't blame her because she does not

[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.980]
talk shows and she kept saying well I thought she was saying was well I be

[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.960]
babbling I be babbling and I thought what kind of a thing is that to say I be

[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.300]
babbling is that some kind of an ethnic thing or what what is she talking

[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.820]
about I be babbling and then what Ernie finally came in and he sat down and

[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.060]
they turned on the second mic and it was all broken up in the story of it

[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.300]
no seriously it sounded like something that they found in a backyard at radio

[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.360]
check that they thrown out that couldn't be repaired it was embarrassing and he

[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.540]
called her IV and I realized that was her name was IV and she kept saying IV

[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.300]
babbling IV babbling and if you want to call it in babble with me and kill

[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.600]
some time and I kept thinking she was saying I be babbling and I thought she's

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.100]
that's the packiest thing I've ever heard in my life but anyway she was on I

[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.780]
couldn't shut it off because I kept waiting to see if he would ever show up I

[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:20.980]
be babbling was here yesterday what look at her job what is that man I

[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:35.540]
missed her it says that is her aka no not IV she caught IV I be what do I mean

[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:43.000]
that's her aka I be no he called her IV what do you mean I be babbling well

[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.380]
that's a name pretty good talk to you then fondled her it says I oh now that's

[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.020]
not the girl I was sitting over here and the thing in here no is that was that

[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.420]
event it was sitting in here oh he doesn't know well that's because that's his

[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:05.040]
replacement anyway just a joke Nick sure I be babbling is a name what kind of a

[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:12.880]
name is that I be babbling aliace aliace I be babbling it's an aliace

[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.720]
pretty good you be babbling I like that name that is something else we got to get to the

[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.260]
bottom of that all right 21 past and of course with the vast audience that they have

[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:27.160]
a W.A.L. tremendous there can be no question and then Ernie was going on about

[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.940]
to the P person I guess that's Paul Lyle are they they hate each other and he

[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.480]
wouldn't shake his hand they have this meeting and I think that's really unfortunate

[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.280]
when you're working in a station when you can't when all the people on your can't

[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:44.200]
get along like one big happy family like we do here at W.I.O.D. just wait to hear

[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.000]
how many promos you hear for the eight to eleven show on the show by the way oh

[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.020]
not I'm just I'm just leaving it out like it doesn't exist because as they told

[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.240]
me in that meeting the less said the better and after having listened for a

[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.480]
few days and gotten kind of the feel of the ambiance for the whole I think

[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.000]
that's probably correct okay 22 after 10 at W.I.O.D. we're going to do a little

[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.080]
break here we'll be right back

[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:36.580]
is it bring any bells with you well it says real men listen to the red hot

[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.400]
chili peppers so yes that's how before you're coming to prom

[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:55.000]
I never heard this before in my life no higher ground great are they playing

[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.920]
this a GTR well they better start why do you think it's be you

[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.940]
okay there it is it's red hot ground chili peppers from their

[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:23.700]
from their LP mother's milk 26 after 10 at W.I.O.D. now who did you fondle

[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.900]
yesterday you fondled the anemori atomic check can I say that on the air no

[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.980]
but her I was cool her arm you know oh you fondle her arm a little feel

[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.780]
as what you're trying to say yeah it was cool well there's nothing wrong with

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.360]
that oh good all depending on who it is I guess okay Steve has open phones

[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.480]
today sunny and joe from Tony Romans and soft Miami on sports talk at 605

[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.860]
tonight and after that we have no information

[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.420]
you're right it's just blank oh and then I take it back it's three times I

[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.900]
guess I'm fascinated I won't last it's all the fascination is over but I did

[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.860]
punch up FDR yesterday afternoon what was Steve doing it was something

[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.280]
terminal and I punched up Mike Roberts was on and he had a 400 year old woman

[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.800]
call in and then about 10 minutes later he played me true to your sure which

[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.940]
I just I just almost fell on the floor in the car but anyway this woman was

[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:29.900]
saying oh my clatter he's so true what he doing is so bad if he was in

[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:35.600]
400 years old man she wasn't a day I'm serious and that's the F.D.L. crowdboy

[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.840]
they are really doing it they are doing it and the thing I like is they really

[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.780]
have a professional sound too they are the best so anyway 28 past 10 at W.I.O.D. there's

[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.840]
one line in the middle there in Broward that's not lit yet when we get it lit up

[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.560]
then I'll then I'll feel that we're ready to start taking some calls hot and

[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:59.700]
heavy seriously okay we'll wait oh I know what else I was going to do I we're

[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.520]
waiting for that other Broward line to light up and we will wait to believe me if

[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.400]
I have to sit here and leave two hours of dead air I'll wait that's how I feel

[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.160]
I'm not putting up with your crap I mean this could be the Mike Robert show just

[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:16.260]
so anyway I'm coming to work today and you'll never guess what I saw on 79th

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.600]
Street just a few blocks just we could walk to there and not work up a sweat one

[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.780]
of my favorite places in history and I'm trying to think if it conflicts in

[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:32.360]
any way with anybody we have on the air and it doesn't Taco Bell Taco Bell

[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.700]
doesn't remark in no emotion whatsoever he doesn't care about it but that's

[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.980]
just one of my fey I love Taco Bell I just love Taco Bell and there's one right

[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.440]
up the street now it's two blocks up there just brand new it is open and I

[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.720]
was thinking maybe somebody would bring us food from Taco Bell today I like

[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:56.180]
burrito supreme with no beans today I love well I know we've got that us

[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.860]
tray and stuff coming but this first you know I'm sure Taco Bell opens 10 30

[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:05.920]
or 11 that other stuff's coming much later it is yes okay hey I don't know if

[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.040]
I'm gonna like that other stuff I'll sample it and I don't want to get mullin

[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.160]
crazy again but he really frosted my ass yesterday with that told deal he set

[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.440]
up that he just does it over and over and over again there just no talking to

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.240]
this man he just keeps doing these little deals and he's kind of like the

[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.100]
Oli North of W I O D he's got his own little government within a government

[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.460]
although like Oli North he's probably getting his directions from yeah you know

[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.240]
what I'm saying so we'll have to check that out but anyway there's that Taco Bell

[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:44.000]
and I see even Rich's like yeah you probably do that yeah I'm Tony it's right

[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.500]
right up the street it's just on the other side of the causeway yeah Richelmecker

[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.080]
was closer even than Flora's much closer it so you could practically throw

[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.480]
a rock from here to there so I like a burrito supreme with no beans and a

[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.700]
couple of tacos and then they have I can't think of it no listen to me this is

[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:05.040]
important this is not something to laugh about they have a little thing and I

[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.080]
can't think of what they call it is it a pizza melt a pizza what the hell do they

[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.320]
call those little things it's like a fold over thing and it's got cheese and

[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.780]
sauce in it and those are delicious they're small what the hell do they call

[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.480]
those no not a case idea what the hell do they call those no it's got it it's

[00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.450]
like up their own name for it and I can't think of what the hell they call them

[00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:33.110]
it's driving me nuts because I'm a regular I mean I don't go to fast food places

[00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.090]
very often anymore but what I do if there's a Taco Bell around I can't read I

[00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:42.650]
can't drive by that's how addicted I am to Taco Bell I love it and I just can't

[00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.190]
think of the name of that and it's really does Laura know you go to Taco Bell

[00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.790]

sampling of what I'd like four or five of each but the burrito supreme no beans I

[00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:18.510]
don't like beans on anything okay because beans create serious

[00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:26.270]

all the other places there but the nine to ten hour is like his Achilles heel in this

[00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.710]
particular book so it's not like he lost a bunch of audience here it's just that that

[00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:05.950]
one hour really just does that or could it be Roger's entertainment report I would

[00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.710]
want to hurt Roger's feeling because we love Roger's a great guy but you never know

[00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:17.070]
you never know all right let's oh this is going to be exciting and all you people who

[00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.910]
run whole look at that couple of them hung up already because they know me they know

[00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.850]
we're going to get into a big is this mobile collar still on yes of course well I'm

[00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.970]
sorry to keep you waiting if I would have seen that I would have gotten to you three minutes

[00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.790]
earlier well that's okay because I won four dollars and fifty cents on the fantasy five

[00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:35.150]
the other days so I can't for an okay well listen it's almost the run out now but do

[00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.010]
give your best shot I just want to congratulate you on your numbers I knew you were going

[00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.730]
to get your book while I was on hold isn't this exciting that something see I mean when

[00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.550]
the when the advances come out that's nice but when the whole book comes out you can kill

[00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.290]
hours with this if you really play your cards right I'll be right with you I drive a

[00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:56.750]
cat I'm unloading groceries here some old bags yeah figures I just wanted to congratulate

[00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.930]
you again and wish good luck to the dolphins this week against Cincinnati yeah we can use

[00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:04.450]
it I think they got a good shot this weekend though I think Cincinnati is a little marginal

[00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:08.550]
to be honest with him I agree and I think boomers a little bummer this week yeah he's

[00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.190]
overrated he bugs the hell out of me yeah it's really the only way they win is that hurry

[00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:17.270]
up off end hmm that's the only way they can win but anyway have a good day thank you take

[00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:22.310]
it bye what a nice guy huh 20 to 11 at W.I.D. let's look at Calder there in the morning

[00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:28.450]
at 5 a.m. of 0.9 and a 0.6 then a 1 at 7 a 0.8 and a 0.6 which may not sound like much

[00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:36.150]
but after he goes off Q.A. and has a 0.3 and so he's got the highest numbers in the daytime

[00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:45.890]
hours and then at 6 p.m. who's on at 6 1 a.m. 7 I think now what isn't it so now they got

[00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:53.730]
a 0.8 at 5 a 1 3 at 6 and then Kaplan's got a 2 a 3 a 3 2 a 2 and a 1 and a 1 1 not anywhere

[00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.370]
near our sports talk of course except the nights when Hank is on when it's because there's

[00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:03.950]
an asterisk is that when Hank is on nobody now just a joke Hank you are my best friend

[00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:08.770]
even though you're a troublemaker and a compulsive but pain in the ass what else I don't

[00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.790]
know what to look for at this point I'm so excited you know should we look at many

[00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:17.570]
18 to 34 because that would be embarrassing wouldn't it huh come here some people yeah

[00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:24.910]
comparing contrast speaking of embarrassing ladies and gentlemen here he is we have the

[00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:30.610]
book stand by the way I forgot to bring you that I forgot to bring you that thing I've

[00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.330]
got I know where it is in the house I thought it was here but it's in my house so you get

[00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.790]
that tape plus don't ever going to be able to put that together anyway you're dreaming

[00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:44.470]
what's our little scratch on your core bet yeah very funny let me see now here's many

[00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:52.750]
18 to 34 10 a m to 3 p m w gt r with a 9 5 and we have an 11 6 well we already knew that

[00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:59.150]
but it just looks so much better on a separate page doesn't it oh geez it looks just incredible

[00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:04.190]
well we can do get into the demographics can't we now wonder how Steve did with those

[00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:12.590]
the younger demographics again I don't know come on be nice give him a chance man 18 to 34

[00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:18.590]
at two o'clock we have 14,400 and Steve loses an even a half that's a nice even number

[00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:26.230]
7,300 women 18 to 34 we have 2200 Steve has 400 that means he loses 18 what is 18 out of 22

[00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:34.350]
that's 9 11 that's a lot yeah it loses almost everybody there so Steve at two o'clock I don't

[00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:43.110]
know what happens there but look at this women 18 to 49 we have 4900 he's got 1400 men 25 to 54 we

[00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:50.470]
have 25,700 he has 14,000 later but I but I will say this the 14,800 is the next biggest

[00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:58.210]
hour to anybody outside the show although by the 5 o'clock I reached out to 9,700 well we don't

[00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:03.330]
want to take on Steve because like I said they consider the alternative you know who it would be

[00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:11.730]
there's no doubt in my mind trust me when I tell you if somebody go into a Taco Bell with Burke

[00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:19.870]
no I did not I'd work with Alan Burke I did dummy I did and I know you worked with Alan

[00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:26.490]
Burke and he wouldn't even give your name on the air because my ratings were higher well I don't

[00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:37.890]
discuss ratings in the industry I discussed issues geriatric issues dummy anyway why are you

[00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:42.790]
so Mike is still in the building I'd work on that Henry's cooking report I think is what did it

[00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:48.130]
to you guys because every other hour is fine but that 9 to 10 hour is like a bomb it's just

[00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.730]
what Roger of course is standing there too so I don't want to say anything while he's there

[00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:57.270]
but Henry's cooking report I think is what does it I think too much whining and dining mostly the

[00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:03.270]
whining is in that 9 o'clock hour that could that could have some effect but anyway it's

[00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:07.970]
amazing to see how Steve loses half the audience here at 2 o'clock anyway it's 1043 what

[00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:14.770]
why were you in your car so long last time I was out and about well actually I had to go pick

[00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:19.310]
up Dave because he locked the keys in the car oh and I was driving around because I couldn't find

[00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:24.630]
he was at some insurance place on sunrise and I couldn't find it so I spent a lot of time that I

[00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:32.550]
didn't plan on spending in a car and bicky Farrell kept you company in the car mentioned that name

[00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:40.850]
you dummy so what do we want to see in the book is there anything how about Zeta boy this

[00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:44.390]
ought to be exciting Pete Bouldard called me the other day do you think it's only an accident

[00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:49.810]
that they finally had some good numbers no because no no and he after a year he called me at home

[00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:56.590]
you you think if they'd had a bad book he would have called me well that's a first

[00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:07.830]
well let's see these are 12 plus Zeta 21 at 6 o'clock 2523272526252724282426 it sounds like basically

[00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:13.230]
the same bunch of people listening all day I could be wrong but it's still on son at exciting to me

[00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:19.670]
although if we roll over and look at WGTR well they are consistent yeah I've noticed that

[00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:25.090]
oh boy GTR look at this at 6 in the morning herman and McBean have a one nine

[00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:35.130]
oh no no did you hear what I said what demo is that 12 plus well I realize that that's not the

[00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:40.710]
bad but I don't sell 12 but no that's not the point the point is that that's a very minute

[00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:54.670]
number for anything oh here's a facts for Stan from rich pardon me for being a chronic junior

[00:30:55.090 --> 00:31:02.010]
Paul Harvey last night my peace and quiet was shattered when the phone rang a voice on the other

[00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:08.090]
end started singing the classic smoky robins in composition my girl it wasn't the temptations

[00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:13.970]
even David roughen and lyrics were the j michael's rewrite Stan major when I got over the shock I

[00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.710]
realized it was my brother Steve who was warbling away when he finished he told me the big news

[00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.670]
about Stan's return to the airwaves I was astonished since you recently had predicted the

[00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:28.170]
impossibility of this but happy anyway since Stan hasn't had a show literally and figuratively

[00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:33.670]
for a long time we came up with some possible themes for his first few shows oh great favorite

[00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:40.950]
South Florida restaurants favorite episodes of vimey vites Don Johnson's here Don Johnson's kids name

[00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:48.790]
good baby name if Stan Laurie have another one I'm gonna put my own in there a psychiatrist if

[00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:56.490]
junior day with Paul Harvey junior EJ and DJ guest-farring Ed a Dixon for possible sidekicks

[00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:03.030]
hot local female news reporters the negligee and swimsuit show and the best malls in South Florida

[00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:08.770]
to cruise for twinkies that's where you put that in your memoir so along with those

[00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:14.950]
letters that you were sending to okay it's eleven forty six and w i these Stan will be on on

[00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.770]
Saturdays now no more tape no more best of niels so those of you who want to hear this show you

[00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:24.050]
better get your act together get your priorities straightened out no more cheap freebies with those

[00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:28.470]
I want to miss the dead air on crappy tapes those you'll put together crappy tapes on

[00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:35.450]
theater day okay no more that crap I almost called it what it really was what Henry said in here

[00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:41.710]
the other that's Henry maybe it's wise on vacation now so what is it that we want to see average

[00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.810]
quarter hours we have at ten o'clock fifty eight thousand eight hundred fifty nine thousand four

[00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.150]
hundred next to our so let's say the good stuff for the eleven o'clock hour because just by a

[00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:55.170]
hair that's the biggest hour hmm okay I don't know what else I want to see in here I'm a little

[00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:00.510]
bit disappointed with that one's right wins an afternoon drive well here's an asterisk

[00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:09.650]
one point six at two a one eight followed by a one seven and a two four and then at the big

[00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:14.450]
six o'clock hour one nine oh they're consistent yeah they're right in there boy and that's

[00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:19.890]
twelve plus now if you get to the like twenty five to fifty four my favorite for the oh damn see

[00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:25.490]
I was twenty five I wish all these others were in shares hour by hour that would make it a lot

[00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:30.210]
easier they give you the total numbers but they don't give you the share hour by hour but it's

[00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:35.750]
still would be fascinating you see here like men twenty five to fifty four w i n z afternoon drive

[00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.830]
oh they have a share yeah but not the hour by hour one five

[00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:46.470]
I want average quarter hour twenty four hundred men three to seven I wasn't in all news stations

[00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:51.850]
supposed to be predominantly men yep and midday of course they got a big number in there point seven

[00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:59.010]
fourteen hundred twenty five to fifty four men in midday on w i n z I think this calls for a special

[00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:05.250]
card it's incredible don't you a little salute I used to be number one in that demographic

[00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:13.810]
yes you did stand but they can you're at because they don't want all your problems

[00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:22.190]
kicking at with fifty thousand watts of power all over south florida from the keys to the

[00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:30.770]
palm beaches even out to the Bahamas this is w i n z thank you do grave lie now that you get

[00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:40.450]
your highest numbers ever in this this book no we did not we had a seven three in the spring book

[00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:44.010]
here with then we got that awful hit and tune and don't forget there was a lot of vacation stuff

[00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:48.190]
going on here too you're never going to get the highest number and then we had the Alex benefactor

[00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:54.210]
took a leak to point so I predicted a fall book based on this tremendous response that we're

[00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:00.550]
we could go right over the hump so to speak but no but i think i think i think that's one truth

[00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:04.350]
about eighteen to thirty two that's the biggest we've had i think that's the biggest we ever had on

[00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:10.330]
a m with that eleven six eighteen to thirty four now on data last summer we had a fifteen in

[00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.370]
many eighteen to thirty four and then in our last book over there remember we beat her

[00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:17.430]
many McQueen in the morning eighteen to thirty four and they were really upset about it and

[00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.650]
now they're even more upset because now we're here on a m in midday and even though we're not on

[00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.190]
the same time as they are we're beating who's on a midday so that'll teach him to mess around with

[00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:32.810]
Steve stands for that's what they get that they deserve fat walling oh the fat wallie factor yeah

[00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:38.610]
wait to meet him oh boy i think he and moonman came up out from under the same rock

[00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:45.610]
it's ten till noon at ten till one ten till two well it might as well get out of here i guess uh

[00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:50.710]
see how we move this thing along major this show i want to tell you about a lot of pepper netta

[00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:55.370]
that's why it a little punk i even stand in lory have had some freemials at lot tavernetta

[00:35:55.370 --> 00:36:00.410]
and they enjoyed it more than they can begin to tell you one of the very finest Italian restaurants

[00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:05.110]
anywhere even in italy i used to do that well better than some of them in italy i'll tell you that

[00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:09.370]
and they've got excellent food in italy but a lot tavernetta just makes it phenomenal in fact the

[00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:14.370]
cold is also just love lots tavernetta and you know how picky they are they're so hard to please

[00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:18.470]
it's almost it's not even worth the effort but they're just in love with lot tavernetta and you will

[00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:22.610]
be too everything is put fresh on the premises the soups are so thick you can eat them with your

[00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:29.030]
hands not just with the sport and the best minister and pasta fajola you've ever had great pasta

[00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:34.430]

[00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:39.310]
seafood and poultry it justice as good as it gets and then the dessert tray by the time they bring

[00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.350]
you dessert you don't think you're going to be able to eat it because they give you so much food

[00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:47.730]
but give it your best shot because their desserts are also phenomenal lot tavernetta here's the

[00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:53.570]
number for reservation 722 1831 and i urge you to make reservations because it's a small

[00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:57.110]
in-it restaurant they don't have a billion tables so you don't want to be disappointed

[00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:02.510]

from love love called or somebody like one of five uh-huh from hot 94 and uh they wanted they

[00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:23.270]
were going to tell the whole truth about the glim and oh no and as far as I know that story has

[00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:29.250]
never been told a liar that story has never been told someday we'll tell that story oh what

[00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:33.610]
happened I don't want to get into that now let's look at wfto and see the gigantic pickup that

[00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:39.190]
they may not heard the micro Roberts yesterday by yesterday by alibining about the fact that um

[00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:43.510]
at age right they didn't start till July with the new format but you think there would be

[00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:48.350]
something here look at this you said it's going to take them at least a year to turn it around

[00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.530]
now if they continue with these numbers for least a year they're going to be a parking lot

[00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:59.790]
listen to the numbers hour by hour wfto five a.m. zero they don't tune then a point three point three

[00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:04.590]
point four point five point four point three point three point four point three point four point three

[00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:11.310]
then starting at five p.m. point one point one point one point one zero point one zero point one point one

[00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:19.730]
well trust now when you get into some of the younger demographics of course it's almost all zeroes

[00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.330]
sounds like Zeta's numbers before you move over there remember

[00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:30.370]
what a disgusting thing to say can you imagine their numbers over what's uh what's

[00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:35.590]
a ambitious getting on snooze oh yeah let's look at wold i forgot all about them it's so easy to do

[00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:41.790]
that because they got that good zone or new let's see it at big five o'clock hour five

[00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:46.470]
dwell at four o'clock they have a three five at five when the news comes on down to a three three

[00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:52.050]
and by six they're down to a two two who but then in the elela let's see uh nine p.m.

[00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:58.750]
witchner has a three four then a six three a nine two and a ten seven hmm so most of his

[00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:04.230]
audience most of his old drunks are still after the clock at night so i'm serious that's basically

[00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:11.130]
what it all is scratchy voiced old broads and hello dude yeah i'm ahead of you yeah the half hour

[00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:16.530]
in news oh yeah well that big eleven o'clock are they got a nine two in there thanks to anon

[00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:23.490]
Dwight yeah well let's see what it's allis doing the morning here at the six four one three one two five

[00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:31.210]
two seven but Debbie was the shocker with a four two three nine three seven oh no the three seven

[00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:37.690]
is uh sandy three nine four oh three five but those are but as you look at the demos like in any

[00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:44.090]
of the younger demographics it's almost nonexistent so sixty five plus almost all of it

[00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:49.990]
but that's a rough break now let's see did we go over Steve here did we rough him up a little bit

[00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:54.190]
actually he's um i think he improved a little bit then he's got all in the four he doesn't have any

[00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:59.150]
four six four one four one and four two what does that come out i know this doesn't interest

[00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:02.930]
anybody in the audience but let's figure it out for the four hour day i want to know

[00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:09.970]
numbers with decimal point three four ten nine thirteen seventeen divided by four is four three

[00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.730]
four three four three is what it averages out for the four hours is nothing wrong with that now

[00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:18.010]
should we average our four hours yeah since we want to beat ourselves on the chest and tell

[00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:22.770]
everybody how great we are and how do we get two five fourteen twenty three nine sixteen twenty

[00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:30.590]
three thirty divided by four is seven point uh six seven six and something it's good

[00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:38.770]
considering the Alex Bennett fact and the swimsuit yeah oh i forgot about that was that in

[00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:43.650]
there too sure oh that's good for at least another point uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh we might

[00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:48.650]
have had a ten if it wasn't for that swim suit all right that's it for this hour who's doing the

[00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:54.750]

The car.

[01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:02.310]
Hi, I'm Deel.

[01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:04.630]
old Dean and let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:06.110]
D.D.O. you're doing great.

[01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:06.990]
Yeah, how's it going, Bert?

[01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:08.110]
Okay. Good.

[01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:12.150]
D.D.O. I was skiing on the cross the AM dial the other night like I do sometimes

[01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:15.630]
at night and picked up K and O.E. Ever heard of that?

[01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:16.350]
Mm-hmm.

[01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:16.850]
Mm-hmm.

[01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:18.550]
Way down on the left end of the tunnel there.

[01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:19.550]
Coming in pretty strong.

[01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:20.070]
From where?

[01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.910]
K and O.E.

[01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:23.030]
I have no idea where it was.

[01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.490]
New Orleans.

[01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:24.690]
New Orleans?

[01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:24.690]

[01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:25.410]
With a K?

[01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:26.150]
Is it?

[01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.690]
New Orleans?

[01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.050]

[01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:30.250]
Got a rock and roll?

[01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:34.470]
No, it was kind of a talk thing. It's funny because I used to live in New Orleans and

[01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:35.430]
it didn't sound familiar.

[01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.970]
Mm-hmm.

[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:39.510]
Ever heard of W.W.L.?

[01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.950]
Oh, of course.

[01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.310]
You know Rick Zerick?

[01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:41.810]
Nope.

[01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:44.370]
He's a giant in the street.

[01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:45.110]
Mm-hmm.

[01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:46.230]
What is he a truck driver?

[01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:48.870]
Believe it or not, he does news talk on W.W.L.

[01:08:49.230 --> 01:08:50.810]
Yeah, well that's the truck driver's station.

[01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.690]
Yeah.

[01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:55.010]
I've been sold at Catholic Church. He's built a call to use to work there.

[01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:55.970]
Oh, we did?

[01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:56.550]
Mm-hmm.

[01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:57.230]
I didn't know that.

[01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:58.230]
Well, he worked everywhere.

[01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:05.410]
Yeah, so, um, yeah, I did listen to Dick Fairwell the other night twice and that was

[01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:07.030]
it, enough for me, that's all I'm going to say.

[01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:07.530]
Okay.

[01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:10.070]
And, um, it's all that needs to be said, actually.

[01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:10.510]
Yeah.

[01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.790]
You know, Dave Dixon?

[01:09:12.150 --> 01:09:12.370]
Yeah.

[01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:13.430]
Speaking of name, dropping.

[01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.970]
He's in Detroit.

[01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.890]
Right, right?

[01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.170]
He's at BMW ABX.

[01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.470]
Yeah.

[01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:18.050]
And then he was down here for a while.

[01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.830]
Nobody has ever seen Neil and Dave Dixon at this.

[01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:22.010]
You know, Harley and Francis?

[01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:24.490]
You know, Dan Nebrath?

[01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:27.570]
You know, um, uh-huh.
