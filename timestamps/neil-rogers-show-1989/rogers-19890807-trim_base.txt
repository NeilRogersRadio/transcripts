[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.320]
One, two, three!

[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.700]
Boys, this is going to get somebody upset.

[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.580]
Max, be a big article in the paper tomorrow.

[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.820]
We're taking away that WEDR audience ladies and gentlemen.

[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.560]
Do they play that?

[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.280]
They don't play that anyway, do they?

[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.300]
Marvin and Tammy, it's too...

[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260]
Well, that is some article in the...

[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.520]
Is it in the Haroldus Morning?

[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.040]
Look at that in the Yokel News section in the Harold radio war,

[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.840]
it's nerve in black Miami, isn't that something?

[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.700]
Big story.

[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.080]
Big story, but Andres Viglucci.

[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.740]
Oh, Andres.

[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.020]
Who was a full brother to America of us butchee, right?

[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.200]
And Andres writes that the people at WEDR are really pissed,

[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.000]
okay, they are not happy.

[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.920]
They're unhappy campers because Hot 105 has the audacity

[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.140]
to be beating the crap out of them in the ratings

[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.460]
and to have all those young black listeners.

[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.660]
Now, somewhere in the Constitution,

[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.440]
it does say that WEDR.

[00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.860]
Seriously, doesn't it?

[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.300]
It says in the Constitution that all young black people

[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.080]
must listen to WEDR and if they don't,

[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.980]
it's like some kind of an act of something, isn't it?

[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.320]
Revolving.

[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.400]
Revolving.

[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.040]
That's what they did, it's revolving.

[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.560]
That's exactly what it says.

[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.220]
And the Hots got a night, they've got the audacity

[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.160]
and the Spring Book have a nine share,

[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.920]
and EDR only had a one four.

[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.760]
And it says,

[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.940]
Flyers have circulated in nightclubs and flea markets,

[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.780]
urging blacks to stay faithful to WEDR,

[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.700]
noting Hot 105 shortage of black disc jockeys

[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.840]
and announcers.

[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.880]
WEDR Vice President Jerry Russian says

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.620]
the station didn't put out the flyers,

[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.880]
but he says Hot 105,

[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.740]
while happy to lure black listeners and advertisers,

[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.680]
provides work to few blacks and contributes little

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.660]
to their community.

[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.840]
First of all, how many people do you think

[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.900]
could work at that station?

[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.660]
Fifty.

[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.660]
Maybe.

[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.120]
Topps.

[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.460]
On an FM.

[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.880]
Maybe less?

[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.940]
No.

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.940]
Probably 50.

[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.480]
Yeah.

[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.420]
So do you think that that's the answer to a black

[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.640]
unemployment in South Florida?

[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.100]
No, I mean, the whole thing is such sour grapes

[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.020]
and so ridiculous.

[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.740]
I mean, that's the nature of our business.

[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.020]
Okay, in other words, if they like what's on a hot,

[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.860]
even though I think hot is, sounds pretty weak.

[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.920]
I don't know what that's all about.

[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.480]
But I mean, if they like it and they're listening to it,

[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.260]
it's a free country, okay?

[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.680]
Oh.

[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.660]
This idea that there's some kind of a legion soda,

[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.940]
it's like the same thing with the Spanish language stations,

[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.560]
you know, like there's some kind of a legion soda

[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.320]
and like you're voting for some kind of ethnic heritage

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.820]
or something by listening to the radio.

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.080]
People aren't doing that.

[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.500]
They're listening to what they want to hear.

[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.980]
Oh.

[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.360]
Right?

[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.720]
Oh, I see.

[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.620]
Oh.

[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.840]
What a crack a crack, boy.

[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.680]
So they're going to have to go back to the drawing board

[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.500]
and evidently what it says later on in the story.

[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860]
They've come up with some new format or something.

[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.500]
EDR?

[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.980]
Yeah.

[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.180]
And they're going to really put up to the test.

[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.760]
They are.

[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.840]
Well, I don't.

[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.040]
I don't know what it says.

[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.640]
Anyway, here we are.

[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.060]
Stan Major is going to be along at 11 o'clock this morning

[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.840]
to eat, which is very nice.

[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.220]
Stan can eat with the best of him.

[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.280]
No question about it.

[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.900]
And what a weekend, huh?

[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.640]
I want to thank them.

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.540]
That's very much from the bottom of my heart.

[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.080]
I want to tell you how much I appreciate personally.

[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.020]
The sweep of the Montreal series took a long time yesterday

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.120]
and the Cubs mean time.

[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.420]
I'm not, you know, everybody said,

[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.200]
you did a hit a chain to lost at 18 days.

[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.600]
You can't win every day, okay?

[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.020]
They're tied for first place.

[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.020]
And they got three with Montreal starting tonight.

[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.100]
And we'll see.

[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.520]
This will separate the men from the goyum tonight.

[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.560]
Isn't that the way the saying goes?

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.500]
The men from the goyum?

[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.180]
And we'll see exactly what happens.

[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.860]
But thanks to the Mets, they really did it.

[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.880]
I was looking by the way at the team by team breakdown

[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.860]
of who's played who.

[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.260]
And I hate to break the news to you,

[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.960]
because the Mets are only four games out now.

[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.500]
And I know that those New Yorkers are just salivating,

[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.240]
foaming at them out.

[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.980]
But this is a little bit of bad news.

[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.600]
The Mets have won almost half of their wins against

[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.400]
the three worst teams in the national league.

[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.760]
The Braves, the Reds.

[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.860]
And who is the other one?

[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.440]
I forget who the other and the Phillies.

[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.640]
They won 10 against Atlanta, 10 out of 12.

[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.720]
So, you know, that may not mean anything now,

[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.980]
but I just mentioned that in passing, okay?

[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.700]
But they did win three from Montreal,

[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.040]
which is quite an accomplishment.

[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.500]
And we'll see what happens.

[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.760]
This is going to be a big week.

[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.560]
So obviously, there'll be a lot of discussion about that.

[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.460]
In fact, our first call is a Mets Williams medical update.

[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.260]
He got a higher end.

[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.000]

[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.380]
10, at WIOD.

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.740]
That was an excellent call with reverb and everything.

[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.740]
Another crit to start off the week with a crank.

[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.700]
Because that great Mets Williams did pitch yesterday,

[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.000]
among almost everybody else on the team in that 18-ing loss.

[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.320]
So, even though he was hit in the head on Saturday,

[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.160]
he came back.

[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.100]
He does have a hard hit.

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.680]
Almost as hard as the guy who just called.

[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.900]
Oh, a Mets fan who wants on right now.

[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.380]
Right now, Nioh.

[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.900]
Or else.

[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.140]
He's a worst team in the league.

[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.100]
What are the X-Bores?

[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.480]
We just swept them over to WIOD.

[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.420]
I just got through saying that.

[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.680]
Well, how can you say it gets the worst team in the league?

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.500]
I'm talking about the number of games they've won.

[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.960]
They won 10 from Atlanta.

[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.960]
Are you going to listen to me?

[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.540]
You loudmouth New York asshole.

[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.320]
Are you going to listen?

[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.000]
Good.

[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.280]
They won 10 against Atlanta, 8 against the Reds,

[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.600]
and 7 against the Phillies.

[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.980]
Those are the highest totals in the win column they have against any teams in the league.

[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.960]
But that's because all our games are done against them.

[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.560]
The cup's reason.

[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.100]
The cup's reason.

[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.160]
It doesn't beat them that much because they've played them that many times.

[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.900]
They haven't played who?

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.260]
They haven't played who?

[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.680]
They haven't played as much as the Mets have yet.

[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.480]
But then you're missing my point.

[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.860]
You're missing my point.

[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.580]
What are you supposed to do?

[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.300]
Loan to them?

[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.340]
Of course, it's supposed to be.

[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.140]
Yeah, okay.

[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.440]
How about all the games they've played against the Giants

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.880]
that they have a losing record against?

[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.860]
Well, the Cubs split their 12.

[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.220]
How come they've got a losing record against the Cardinals, too?

[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.840]
You're one of those typical New Yorkers who doesn't want to listen to sensor.

[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.880]
In other words, don't confuse me with the fact that the Mets are in first place by 10 games.

[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.320]
Okay?

[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.900]
And your standings, the Mets are in head by 10.

[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.720]
Don't call here and start screaming and acting like a jackass in the beginning of the week.

[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.600]
There's another one of those New Yorkers.

[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.940]
It's just a game, okay?

[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.040]
You idiot.

[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.140]
Call up sports talk and give them a hernia on sports talk.

[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.180]
Don't call here and start screaming and behaving like some kind of a band sheet on a Monday morning.

[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.200]
Is this coming?

[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.180]
Or any other morning?

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.260]
Is this calm down now?

[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.780]
No.

[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.100]
I just made a point, okay?

[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.560]
Didn't I?

[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.480]
And I said, how many times I say congratulations?

[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.720]
Thanks to the Mets, they swept back to you all.

[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.740]
It's quite an accomplishment.

[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.440]
Yeah, call Joe tonight, okay?

[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.700]
He's dying to talk to you, sir, to a bebrain like you.

[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.140]
So it has in here.

[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.520]
Another one of those, but no wonder everybody hates the Mets.

[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.380]
It's not the team.

[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.040]
They're fans.

[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.180]
They stink.

[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.940]
They're disgusting.

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.720]
They're even worse than the Yankee fans.

[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.560]
They always cry into blues.

[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.240]
Always twisting those statistics around, okay?

[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.520]
I hope Biola allows 48 runs in the first inning tonight, all right?

[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.680]
And then cries about it.

[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.720]
He belongs on the Mets.

[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.840]
He's a crybaby, just like the Mets fans.

[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.900]
What does that say?

[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.580]
Oh, he's back on again?

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.000]
Why?

[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.420]
I don't want to talk to him again.

[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.580]
Get him out of here, Roger.

[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.780]
You've been on vacation too long.

[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.140]
I get I want to talk to him again.

[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.560]
Like I'm going to put him on the ear.

[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.700]
I want to be on right now, right now.

[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.980]
Yeah, go call Craig Worthing, okay?

[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.340]
Talk about the Red Sox.

[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.160]
Boy, what?

[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.760]
What happened?

[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.240]
I don't know.

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.820]
I've taken two calls so far.

[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.340]
The first one was a mouth breather.

[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.840]
And the second one is a Mets fan.

[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:52.340]
I don't know.

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.920]
Do you think about this?

[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.000]
Well, that's obvious.

[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.760]
What do you want?

[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.280]
Oh.

[00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.740]
What's wrong?

[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.500]
What happened?

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.920]
Didn't we start out with everybody?

[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.900]
Everybody was in a good frame of mind when we sat down.

[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.220]
And I've taken two calls from these disgusting South Florida jackasses.

[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.780]
Go back to New York.

[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.180]
If it was so great there, why don't you go back and breathe the infested disgusting filthy air, okay?

[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.520]
And I hope you get tuberculosis from it.

[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.440]
All this hate and venom and screaming is over meaningless ball games.

[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.300]
What's wrong with you people?

[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.240]
Don't come down.

[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.120]
They're not meaningless.

[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.120]
They're not?

[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:28.660]
No.

[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.700]
I thought it was sports.

[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.880]
In fact, you know, it's interesting that you should bring that up because it's interesting.

[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.080]
In the first place in the American and the National Egees, we got a tie.

[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.540]
It comes in my career.

[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.100]
I noticed the Mets aren't in there.

[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.740]
A Baltimore is two and a half ahead of Boston.

[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.540]
Three ahead of Toronto, three and a half ahead of Cleveland.

[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.040]
Milwaukee, four and a half ahead of Yankees.

[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.460]
Only six.

[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.960]
There are six teams within six games in the American League East.

[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.920]
In the West, California and Oakland are a half a game apart.

[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.580]
And in the West and the National League, San Francisco thanks to Houston's Winnius.

[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.260]
It's the only two ahead.

[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.380]
So this is why everybody with a brain is in Love's Baseball.

[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:09.760]
Because here we've played over a hundred games and we still have four red hot pennant races going on or divisional races in baseball.

[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.480]
Which is why anybody with a brain.

[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.420]
I have a brain with a brain loves baseball.

[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.120]
Oh, I have a brain.

[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.180]
Now we have to do a break.

[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.060]
Now this mobile and bell-glade probably is some kind of an idiotic call, isn't it?

[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.620]
Say thanks, Neil.

[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.820]
Good morning.

[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.880]
But well, I was right.

[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.880]
It isn't an idiotic call.

[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.280]
Why aren't you trying to call QAM?

[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.360]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.260]
QAM? No, I just want to ask.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.920]
That's not like one of those hillbilly nose pickers to me.

[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.760]
You're right.

[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]
The same guy is a, uh, uh, you know, a cubs man.

[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:37.580]
You know, yeah.

[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:43.440]
But I saw, when I was with Paul Dorit, the track a couple of weeks ago, he, since he started working at QAM, he's been picking his nose a lot.

[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:43.900]
I know this.

[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.700]
Yeah, I just want to ask Bernie's having fun with the cubs and the maps and all the other junk.

[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.500]
I don't know what all this is.

[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.200]
So you say the cubs were junk?

[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.920]
Sir, did you say the cubs were junk?

[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.000]
No, I didn't say that.

[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.400]
I just don't know what I just heard you say.

[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.120]
The cubs and the mets and all the other junk didn't.

[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.420]
Wasn't the implication there that the cubs are junk?

[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.540]
No, we got it.

[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.100]
It's 1015 at W.I.D.

[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.440]
What a way to start the week.

[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.300]
This is great.

[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.700]
Oh, it's nice to see everybody had a good weekend.

[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.840]
You're all on a good frame of mind.

[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.440]
Must have been that Browns game the other night that got them all upset.

[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.900]
Boy, I'm just not in the mood for football yet.

[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.620]
OK, at all.

[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:17.920]
At all.

[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.600]
Like I said, all the penta races are heating up, but everybody with a half a brain is really,

[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.980]
even people who weren't baseball fans before are getting excited about it now.

[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.040]
This is the time getting close to the playoffs in the World Series.

[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.620]
Like I said, anybody with an IQ of over six?

[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.960]
Then I love.

[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.300]
Larry King's got this thing.

[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.260]
Of course, Larry's everywhere.

[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.500]
He's like Legionnaires' disease.

[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.440]
You know, he's in the fence.

[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.160]
He's everywhere.

[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.860]
And he's got this little thing he does on Calder's show.

[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.000]
In fact, how is it that his show is on this station?

[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.880]
And yet he does a sports thing that's on QAM.

[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.020]
Would you explain that to me?

[00:10:54.660 --> 00:11:00.300]
Isn't it like sack religious conflict of interest?

[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.280]
Oh, I think sports, you know, it's like.

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.520]
So he does this little feature in this morning.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.000]
He gives us this big run down on the American League East and how all the teams think

[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.300]
which everybody already knows.

[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.140]
He doesn't say anything, but he does tell us that Milky Wilson is going to be a big addenda,

[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.140]
which is the grammar isn't even right.

[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.240]
The big addenda for Toronto.

[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.960]
Mookie's sitting like 136 with Toronto, OK?

[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.440]
Not too much unlike what he was sitting with the Mets.

[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.620]
Anyway, it's 1017 at WIOD.

[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.460]
We want to pass 10 at WIOD enough.

[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.220]
I can slow down now that I don't have that idiot on the phone.

[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.280]
The point I was trying to make, you know, the only reason I'm repeating it is because the guy

[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.600]
was screaming and carrying on and getting hysterical is that the Mets record against teams

[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.960]
with winning records is appalling.

[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.680]
It's bad.

[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.380]
OK, they have losing records against almost every team that's a winner

[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.260]
and most of their victories with the exception of the three against Montreal this weekend

[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.020]
have been against horrible teams.

[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.400]
That's all, that's a fact.

[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.320]
I'm not making it up.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.340]
It's part of the statistics, OK?

[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.660]
Boy, right away he wants, he wants to argue with the facts.

[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.140]
Don't confuse him with the facts because he doesn't sound good.

[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:07.620]
What should we do?

[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.360]
Lose against the brakes?

[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.480]
That's not the point.

[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.940]
The point is they've bulked up on the garbage teams and when they've had to play the good teams

[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.380]
with the exception of this weekend, they've bit the bullet, they've stunk.

[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.660]
Like the three they lost in Chicago two weekends ago.

[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.460]
Oh, a potential hate call.

[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.420]
This is a great start.

[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:24.780]
Hello.

[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:26.820]
Hello.

[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.960]
I want to tell you that.

[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.500]
Wait a minute, you hear that?

[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:30.860]
Yeah.

[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.860]
Not even the guts.

[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.120]
Another one of those Mets people.

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.880]
Not even the guts to stay on the line.

[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.840]
That's how good that one was.

[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.180]
I wanted to ask you some questions about the CDR article, but I guess maybe tomorrow.

[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:40.680]
No.

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:41.460]
Huh?

[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.180]
It's the first thing I brought up, isn't it?

[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.220]
Yeah, but...

[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.400]
Well, no, I did mention that thing.

[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.360]
Like I do at the beginning of the show and right away we're faced with hostility from these

[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.760]
obnoxious New Yorkers.

[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.020]
You know, we don't have to ask.

[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.980]
There are two problems with South Florida.

[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.480]
I mean, the weather is great.

[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.680]
We've got the sand and the beaches and the sunshine.

[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.440]
There are two problems with this town.

[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:00.780]
Okay?

[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.380]
Too many old people and too many New Yorkers.

[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.720]
Okay?

[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.500]
Those are the two problems in this town.

[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.740]
And some of them are crossover, right?

[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.120]
Some are in both categories.

[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.620]
Now, it was so wonderful in New York.

[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.520]
We didn't do this.

[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.640]
It was like, well, good, go to hell back there, all right?

[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.180]
And don't ever come back here again until you get a gold-plated invitation.

[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.480]
Right?

[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.600]
Boy, they were miserable up there and they brought their misery and disgusting obnoxious,

[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.220]
pushing outrageous attitudes with them here.

[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.280]
You make me sick.

[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.500]
Why don't you all go up to the top of the World Trade Center and take a nice fall?

[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:44.360]
They're probably not listening to EDR either, just what?

[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.780]
At least in New York.

[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.200]
Exactly.

[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.720]
How come you're not listening to WWE?

[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.660]
Because in the Constitution, it says you ought to be.

[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.500]
And Jerry Russians pretty upset about it.

[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.840]
Oh, he's always crying and wine, and he's always crying about the ratings and about this and about that.

[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.000]
And now he's always whining.

[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.920]
So it says here in the article, by the way, Trendcoming on Friday morning at 11.30.

[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.980]
And if it's right in, how hot one are we going to have a bad trend?

[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.360]
Because June is going to be right in there and, oh, it's going to be really weak.

[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.060]
If it's not, it's going to be a miracle.

[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.160]
I'm sorry, I keep interrupting you.

[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.340]
No, it just says.

[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.200]
How hot 105 to KDR's audience, you know?

[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.080]
Let me see if I can find it.

[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.840]
This is such an unbelievable article.

[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.060]
A fast-paced format with less talk, uninterrupted blocksy music,

[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.740]
and on-air money giveaways.

[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.820]
I'll be damned.

[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.460]
That seems to be true.

[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.280]
Well, that's a new thing.

[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640]
That was hot 105.

[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:39.480]
Oh.

[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.100]
And it says EDR sounded old-fashioned.

[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.360]
It's DJ's ramble on and often played obscure songs on impulse.

[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.700]
Some ads were amateuristically produced.

[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080]
So that's how they did it.

[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.360]
And more music, less talk, and money giveaways.

[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.240]
I'll be damned.

[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.880]
I wonder if there's anything to do with it.

[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.380]
Well, I think it's pretty disgusting.

[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.640]
Everybody who listens to Hot 105, to turn it off right now.

[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.360]
And keep it off.

[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.900]
Got some nerve that keeps eyes on.

[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.980]
Now, what the hell is this?

[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.960]
What kind of a dirty picture is this?

[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.820]
Oh, we have dirty pictures this morning.

[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.680]
What a day.

[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.120]
What is this?

[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.460]
What's that stationary?

[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.080]
Now, it's got a little note there at the end.

[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.720]
Don't read it on the air, but see the note.

[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.900]
It's not funny on the bottom.

[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.400]
Oh.

[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.100]
The PS.

[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.300]
Yeah.

[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.480]
Well, that's unfortunate.

[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.280]
It's a 24 past 10 at WIOD.

[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.140]
Let's take a call.

[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.260]
And these calls, man.

[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.540]
Have we talked to anybody?

[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.600]
What's going on?

[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.220]
Who isn't all a whacked out this morning?

[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.340]
I can't believe it.

[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.440]
Boy, I must have been the heavy-duty drugs from Colombia

[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.260]
came in over the weekend or something, boy.

[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.660]
There's something going on in this town.

[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.940]
I had a shave.

[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.080]
Am I sorry I mentioned anything about anything to be honest with you?

[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.140]
I had a great weekend.

[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:57.740]
I understand.

[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:57.980]

[00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.820]
I wasn't coming until 11.

[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.240]
He probably is behind all of these calls.

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.800]
Manny Beach.

[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.300]
Stand it and win the poll on Friday, D.

[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.060]
Spencer did.

[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:06.540]
Yeah.

[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.400]
Well, you guys did that.

[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.460]
Spencer is busy working.

[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.120]
Okay, Stan doesn't have that excuse.

[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.020]
Oh, you're right.

[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.280]
Let me ask you something.

[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.640]
Don't ever apologize to him.

[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.160]
That's bad.

[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.140]
They are the worst of the most obnoxious.

[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.980]
They completely rack objectivity about baseball.

[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:21.940]
I come on.

[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.240]
I say, thank you, Metsu.

[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.080]
You did a great job.

[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.420]
You swept Montreal as a great accomplishment.

[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.440]
And, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.960]
And all I do is mention that I was looking at the statistics

[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.060]
and that they've had a horrible record against winning teams this year.

[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.960]
And a guy called, oh, what do you want us to do?

[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.060]
Loose to the breath of a...

[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.500]
Starts getting all hysterical, like I just attacked his mother or something.

[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:39.960]
You did.

[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:40.600]
J.

[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.300]
Your mother is the word, I think, too.

[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.620]
To New York or nothing exists but New York.

[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.120]
Well, like I said, if it was so great, what the hell is he doing here?

[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:49.940]
There are.

[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:50.800]
Go back.

[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.740]
Let me ask you something.

[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.620]
No, wait a minute, seriously.

[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.160]
I think one of the great things that we could do is to take up a fund

[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.160]
to send all the New Yorkers who want to go back immediately back where they came from.

[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:01.540]
Okay?

[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.900]
And the next time anybody calls up and says, I'm a New Yorker because I'm from Rochester.

[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.700]
Let me straighten you out.

[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.020]
Okay?

[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.400]
Upstate New York, ain't New York.

[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.140]
It's New York state, but it's not New York.

[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:13.900]
Okay?

[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:14.800]
Get it straight.

[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.980]
I wouldn't want to be from New York.

[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.480]
Go out, sir.

[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.480]
I'm getting emotional now.

[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.500]
The Cubs play three against Montreal Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.080]
Tonight, tomorrow, Wednesday.

[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.300]
That's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.500]
The last time I looked at it.

[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.800]
My question is Thursday.

[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.900]
Do they have a game?

[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.020]
Yeah, Phillies.

[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:31.780]
At home?

[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.520]
Oh, great.

[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.380]
I'm going to be up there.

[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:34.980]
I'll go to the game.

[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.380]
Great.

[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.000]
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.060]
Four big ones.

[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.640]
Oh, it's a matter of fact.

[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.120]
I don't want to.

[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.800]
Listen, I don't want to get that guy upset.

[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.720]
But during the month of August, the Cubs have a whole bunch of games against the Braves,

[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.880]
the Phillies, and the Reds.

[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.240]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.680]
First of the games, you have to win.

[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.580]
That's correct.

[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.000]
But don't let the Cubs break your heart.

[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.700]
I'm a Chicago, and they broke my heart too many times.

[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.640]
Listen, they're having a great year.

[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.220]
Oh, they are.

[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.220]
One way or the other, it's been a thrill.

[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.980]
I've had more excitement from baseball this year since then.

[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.900]
I was a little kid.

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.280]
Okay?

[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.040]
It's been tremendous.

[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.240]
And, you know, I'm not going to be one of those fair-weather people.

[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.900]
If they don't win it, they still have a tremendous year.

[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.880]
Not like these New York people who are all bent out of shape and getting hysterical,

[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.040]
like it's some kind of an insult to their ego if the meds don't win.

[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.120]
Were you down on Scotty Sanders and last week?

[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.140]
I'll be pitch-y off today.

[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:25.460]
Wow.

[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.860]
Look, he sucks.

[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.860]
Okay, so he finally pitched...

[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.980]
And then top it off, he gives a home run ball to a guy who's in 160 or something.

[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.060]
Yeah, he pitched a bunch of good innings in between, but you know, it's the pirates.

[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.360]
Don't get too carried away.

[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:39.880]
No.

[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.620]
How many...

[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.420]
Don't apologize to him.

[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.320]
And don't apologize to a med fan.

[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:47.820]
Okay.

[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.200]
I would never have a great life, sir.

[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.700]
Bye-bye.

[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.500]
Okay, he was a little boring, too.

[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.380]
1027 at WIOD.

[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.260]
Everybody's in a great boy.

[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.460]
Talk about a shock.

[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.480]
It's like the Monday that we came back from vacation.

[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.100]
I'm shocking back from Chicago.

[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.660]
I was not prepared for that.

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:04.940]
Wow.

[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.720]
Just on a Monday out of the right out of a gate.

[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.760]
Well, you know what it is.

[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.380]
We're almost a dolphin season now.

[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.560]
Do you remember those Mondays?

[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.380]
Every Monday, a lot of pressure on the dolphins.

[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.020]
Man, if the dolphins lose, they get all hysterical.

[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.080]
And they're in a surly mood.

[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:18.640]
Same thing.

[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.620]
And if the dolphins win, they get hysterical.

[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.260]
And they're hysterical.

[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.380]

[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.100]
Because they didn't cover the spread or something.

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.200]
By the way, talking about covering the spread, I'm so sick and tired of these people

[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.840]
that come on to your and talk about gambling.

[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.520]
And have no interest in sports at all.

[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.860]
I don't want to mention Hank's name.

[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.100]
No, seriously, I mean, either you're a sports fan and you can watch a ballgame and enjoy it

[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.740]
because it's, you know, for the sport.

[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.480]
Or you're just a compulsive gambler and you can't watch anything.

[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.780]
You can't watch two dogs run down the street without betting which one will get to the corner first.

[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.500]
Okay?

[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.000]
That's called a compulsive gambler, not a sports fan.

[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.840]
And that, you know, that's mostly a New York thing.

[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.320]
Okay?

[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.600]
I'm not saying that people all over the country don't bet with bookies because they do.

[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.760]
But the bottom line is it's primarily a New York sickness.

[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.100]
Who they covered the spread?

[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.980]
Who they held cares, okay?

[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.120]
They're talking about like a high school volleyball game.

[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.080]
They covered the spread.

[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.020]
It's 1028 at WIB.

[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.980]
Boy, I had no idea.

[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.640]
My blood pressure must be like 900 over.

[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.380]
I can't believe it.

[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.480]

[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.920]
I was so calm and cool and relaxed.

[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.040]
Everything was great.

[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.060]
Steve, by the way, as long as we're getting upset.

[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.920]
Now, I want Sharon to come in here immediately, okay?

[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.920]
Because I hope that this is not true.

[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.640]
Steve's topic today, you know how I feel about tattoos on anybody.

[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.640]
Women with tattoos.

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:49.220]
And it says Steve convinces several gullible young ladies to be tattooed on the air.

[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.160]
I'm speechless.

[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:54.600]
Yeah.

[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.260]
Now, you young women who are about to be tattooed.

[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.020]
Can we say that?

[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060]
Don't do it.

[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.300]
Okay, don't do it.

[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.200]
It's, I mean, on anybody, on guys, on anything, on dogs.

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.100]
I don't like that.

[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.240]
It is so disgusting and grotesque.

[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.240]
And the bottom line is, once you get it on there, it's a real excruciating thing to get it off.

[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.720]
Unless they got some new, you know, go home and take a bath.

[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:20.960]
I don't think so.

[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.180]
I think it's a real ordeal to get it off.

[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.220]
And it's disgusting.

[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.860]
Those of you out there who have tattoos, you ought to stay in a house and never come out again.

[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.360]
I'm telling you, never ever come out of the house again.

[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.880]
Unless maybe it's real dark.

[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.300]
Share.

[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.680]
A lot of this is Cusses.

[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.080]
Fath.

[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.060]
Boy, it is ugly and disgusting.

[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.840]
And if you ever, I'm sure you have, you've seen these guys that are like covered and women too.

[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.860]
Of course, covered with tattoos.

[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:48.400]
Sure.

[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.940]
I mean, talk about something you just don't want to look at.

[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.500]
Disgusting and grotesque.

[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:01.380]
So here is Steve Cain again, leading the young women of America down the garden path with

[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.960]
another one of these hedonistic, disgusting, vulgar radio shows.

[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.520]
Ladies don't do it.

[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.060]
Okay, we're trying to save you.

[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:08.940]
It's disgusting.

[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.140]
Who the hell wants to look like?

[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:11.900]
Share anyway.

[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.780]
Boy, in fact, with a tattoo on her shoulder says, meus.

[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.720]
You know what that means?

[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.300]
Yes.

[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.020]
Gross.

[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:26.040]
Boy, she looks like she looks like she had, like been on the Karen Carpenter diet for six years.

[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.000]
Doesn't she?

[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.100]
Bad news.

[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.140]
Okay, the calls are so good, we shouldn't overlook them because look at that, we got a ton of calls on here.

[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.040]
Things are really zip it along, right?

[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:35.480]
Boy.

[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.460]
If you said so.

[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.580]
Mighty, what a start.

[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.460]
Have we talked to any, well, Alaska was fairly rational.

[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.240]
Was it any?

[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.360]
The closest to a real caller.

[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.000]
What happened?

[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.940]
Pompano Beach.

[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.100]
Good morning.

[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.120]
Boy, you've got my Irish shop this morning, right?

[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:49.780]
Your Irish?

[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.360]
Yeah.

[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.660]
My Irish shop.

[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.080]
Have you heard that expression, Neil?

[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.860]
Yeah, I've heard, I've heard them all.

[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.700]
I got a question for the bird.

[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.140]
May I ask him a question?

[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.120]
Go ahead, sir.

[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.820]
Bird, did you see Stan and the Louis last night on HPR with James Irvin, almost?

[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.880]
No, I haven't seen it yet, I'm going to see that later.

[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.140]
I saw that it was on.

[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.600]
I know, man, it's a great, great eye.

[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.320]
How come you're asking him that question?

[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.540]
Because I don't want to talk to you.

[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:14.980]
Oh.

[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:15.700]
Oh.

[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.620]
Olmus was nominated for an Oscar for that, by the way.

[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.860]
1031, he was almost got an Oscar?

[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:23.940]
Uh-huh, exactly.

[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.620]
1032, I guess.

[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.160]
Boy, look at that.

[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.640]
Like in about two seconds, we zipped, if we at that rate, the show could be over in two

[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:29.840]
minutes.

[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.220]
And after these calls, what a blessing that would be.

[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.000]
Look at that.

[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.340]
We got two lines open in day.

[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.260]
They just dropped off after that last caller.

[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.240]
751 WIOD.

[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.020]
7519463.

[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.180]
He sounded like a New Yorker to me.

[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.180]
That's what he's upset about.

[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:45.520]
Okay.

[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:50.780]
Like I said, if it's so wonderful there, and if everything there is so much better, go to help back there.

[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.080]
Okay.

[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.740]
There's a bus.

[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.960]
There's a Greyhound leaving.

[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.660]
Not a bus, a dog.

[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.100]
I'm sorry to keep bringing this article up, but it's just asking a response.

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:02.100]

[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.280]
Well, they're not that really good.

[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:03.660]
Do it.

[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.560]
No, it hasn't been a response.

[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.320]
We don't have any black listeners anyway.

[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.840]
Thank God, because if we did the jury Russian, be all upset about it, probably.

[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.120]
Yeah.

[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:18.020]
It says in this article, many teenagers don't realize the importance of having WEDR around.

[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.980]
It says Craig Anderson.

[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.240]
Yeah, who used to be a board off at this station?

[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:23.880]
Isn't that great?

[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.180]
It used to be a board off.

[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.480]
Now he has a weekend talk show on WSNEWS.

[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.420]
That's the important.

[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.040]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.280]
WNEWS.

[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:30.960]
Oh, yes.

[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.080]
Please, that's the news.

[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:32.940]
WNEWS.

[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.120]
Yes.

[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.040]
Somehow I forgot to tune in Alice this morning.

[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.680]
I think I've gotten that out of my system.

[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.000]
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.840]
Now, boy, this is some start to what's going to be an exciting week.

[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.320]
I was supposed to be on vacation this week.

[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.380]
That's right.

[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.920]
Well, if I had my brothers, you know, I'd so much rather be here with all my pals and other stuff.

[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.440]
You were the land of course.

[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.680]
Who the hell wants to be lying on the beach in Hawaii?

[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.840]
You would have missed this.

[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:03.220]
That's the, uh, Hyatt Regency Hotel overlooking the Pacific Ocean and all that great walking stuff out there.

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.220]
What would have happened if you hadn't been here?

[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.740]
How would I have handled all this?

[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.360]
I would have no clue if they were talking about it.

[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.100]
I wouldn't have happened because you wouldn't have said anything about the Metro.

[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:11.580]
Nothing.

[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.100]
You'd have keyed the key that started all this was men.

[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.100]
That was your mistake.

[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.760]
Wait, spell STEM backwards.

[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.640]
That's correct.

[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:18.700]
Hurrah.

[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.040]
Touchbook.

[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.000]
Some people got lots of touchbook.

[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:22.420]
Yeah.

[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.020]
You know, all these people calling them give me a hard time about the mess.

[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.720]
Well, what do you want to give us a hard time about, sir?

[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.380]
No, no, no.

[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.380]
Even come up with something.

[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.680]
Can 34 at WIOD.

[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.900]
Boy, they're sure all out there this morning, aren't they?

[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.840]
I'm full regalia.

[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.800]
I'm starting to enjoy these calls.

[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.120]
Yeah.

[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.200]
He fit right in very slowly.

[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.640]
Starting to really like them.

[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.780]
It's not going to get on the year, sir.

[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.580]
So I don't know why you keep wasting our time with that donut crap.

[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.100]
Okay, in fact, I think your head is a donut, you know, like with a big hole in the middle.

[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.740]
I think that's your problem.

[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.840]
Look at this.

[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.180]
Somebody sent us some nuts.

[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:56.900]
Oh, what is it?

[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.660]
That's what that is.

[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.480]
Which I think is the last guy's problem.

[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.820]
Maybe we ought to send these to him.

[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.220]
Okay, a lack of.

[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:03.980]
Savannah Moon.

[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.320]
What the hell is this?

[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.760]
Savannah Moon restaurant invites you to a cup of pots like a thing.

[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:09.600]
A thing.

[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.540]
You want to be like an invitation.

[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:11.000]
Oh.

[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.560]
And when you open it up,

[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.680]
there are nuts inside.

[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.620]
I think unless, I don't know what these are.

[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.500]
Anyway, it's 10.35.

[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.540]
We certainly hope you've all had as nice of a weekend as the people we've spoken to so far.

[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.620]
Hello, what to think about all this?

[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.120]
I don't know what to think about.

[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:32.820]
They are nuts.

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.940]
I can't get the damn bag open though.

[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.720]
Now, what kind of nuts are these?

[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.360]
Are these hazel nuts or something?

[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.260]
What do you call these?

[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.020]
Does anybody know?

[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.320]
Do we have any nut experts that we had several nuts on the phone?

[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.520]
I don't know what these are.

[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.960]
And it doesn't say it's just a Savannah Moon, which I guess is a new restaurant that's opening up.

[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.400]
You need a nut cracker to open these up.

[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.700]
I guess that ritual will probably be stopping you.

[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.060]
Any excuse, man, when there's food in the building.

[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.740]
We do have wings pluses coming today.

[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.960]
An honor of Stan Major's appearance.

[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.160]
So that ought to be pretty exciting.

[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.540]
A plantation.

[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.100]
Hello.

[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.160]
Hello, Neil.

[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:11.660]
Yeah.

[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.200]
I was up at Hilton Head last week.

[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.940]
Hilton Head Island, up in the South Carolina.

[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.800]
I know what it is, sir.

[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.720]
I'm not some kind of a dummy.

[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:19.500]
Oh, OK.

[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.660]
I just wondered if you'd ever gone up there.

[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.480]
That was fabulous.

[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.320]
No.

[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.020]
1036 at WIOD.

[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.320]
Why do we care that he was up at Hilton Head?

[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.260]
Do you care about it?

[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.240]
Is this supposed to impress him?

[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:30.600]
I'm not.

[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.540]
The least bit interested.

[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.300]
You got a real boring voice or you don't ever call a show again.

[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.920]
I'd rather talk to the Metz guy than to him.

[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.780]
We have an open line in Brown.

[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.340]
No, we don't.

[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.060]
Well, they're really sizzling today, man.

[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.420]
Sizzling with mush.

[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.120]
Loaded with calls, and there is a single one of you

[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.340]
never want to speak to again.

[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.600]
You live to be 500.

[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.440]
There is one of these people you'd ever want to be

[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.080]
unfortunate enough to speak to again.

[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.400]
It's so amusing.

[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.600]
That guy, man, was screaming and yelling and puking and jelt

[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.080]
having a nervous breakdown.

[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.400]
God, about that.

[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:04.780]
So weird.

[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.480]
Don't you understand?

[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.620]
That's the New Yorker's tactic.

[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:06.880]
Yeah.

[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.420]
Okay.

[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.160]
If they can't outthink you or outreason you, they just

[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.720]
will outshout you, which is why so many of them.

[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.760]
Not all, just 80 or 90% of them are loud, obnoxious, disgusting,

[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.180]
and should go back to New York.

[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:19.580]

[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.660]
By the way, we got the Yankees in Cleveland tonight at 730.

[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.640]
The Indians are hot.

[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.340]
And, boy, are they going to beat the crap out of the Yankees tonight?

[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.120]
Won't that be a shame?

[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.700]
And you can hear it happen right here on WIOD exclusively at 730.

[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.200]
Oh, good.

[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.340]
It's like a public service.

[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.440]
And those of us with a satellite can watch it.

[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.120]
Every disgusting second of it, although some of us might be occupied

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.320]
watching the Cubs in Montreal at 8 o'clock our time.

[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.420]
Okay, just mention that.

[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.620]
Bokeh, hello.

[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.260]
Hi.

[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:47.840]
Yeah.

[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.320]
I made a terrible mistake.

[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.320]
I was supposed to be on my way to Chicago today,

[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.860]
and I can't put my reservations three weeks ago.

[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:58.680]
I never dreamed these Montreal Cubs games were going to be so hot

[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:58.960]
and I'm going to be so.

[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.600]
Boy, you, if I were you, I'd be slitting my wrist right now.

[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.800]
I hope you guys can cheer me up because I'm very depressed.

[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.700]
Why aren't you uplifted by the cause we've had so far?

[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.020]
Let out a do it.

[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.020]
You know, the shocking thing about the baseball

[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.660]
has been Yankees over the last 14 games.

[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.900]
They're actually gaming ground.

[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.040]
Yeah, they're losing in their gaming ground,

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.340]
which is almost impossible, but it's true.

[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.200]
Yeah.

[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.000]
Glenn, I understand your point.

[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.260]
Your point is well-fanking.

[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.700]
Rick Weaver on Saturday was giving half-hour updates

[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.120]
of the scrimmage and sports has gone too far.

[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.560]
But hey, it's a scape isn't from the SNL,

[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.600]
Palestine, the H&D scandal.

[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.440]
Hey, don't forget, sir, at WIOD, it's not just a game.

[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.260]
It's an obsession.

[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.920]
Well, talking about obsessions and depressions.

[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.700]
Have you ever seen the movie Boys of Summer?

[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:45.680]
No.

[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.620]
Okay, Jackie Robinson.

[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.000]
We all know what he went on.

[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.240]
I did see Boys of the Band.

[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.060]
Is it similar?

[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:51.580]
No.

[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.000]
Anyway, anyway, what do you got to do?

[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.560]
I wanted to also see Komisky.

[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.940]
Now, I know you didn't like the, you saw a picture of what it's supposed to be,

[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:00.400]
the new one.

[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:00.800]
Yeah.

[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:05.740]
You know, one thing that they do, they close in the center field,

[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.580]
not like in a wriggly field, we can see the skyline.

[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.120]
That's so nice there, they're not going to do that with the new Komisky.

[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.360]
They're going to block it and like...

[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.020]
Hey, I'm Tanya with the exception of the new park they're building in Baltimore,

[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.540]
which is still three years away,

[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.880]
and which is going to be asymmetrical.

[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.520]
It's going to have, you know, it's going to be like the old ballpark.

[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.300]
But all these other new ballpark are like plastic, man.

[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.440]
They're all looked the same and I don't like them at all.

[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.200]
Yeah, and there's artificial turf, there's like, you know,

[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.020]
how kids just play stickball and Brooklyn.

[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:33.560]
Right.

[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.360]
All right.

[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.200]
Don't say Brooklyn, sir, please.

[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:36.480]
Sorry.

[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.520]
Okay, guys, how good we...

[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.440]
Okay, do you have...

[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.760]
Are you going to be able to see the games on television?

[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.200]
I'm not going to see...

[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.980]
Well, I'm going to see all the meds games because it's on both networks.

[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:46.720]
Yeah.

[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:47.680]
But no cups.

[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.780]
I'll give you reports, sir.

[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:50.340]
Okay.

[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.020]
In detail.

[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:51.780]
Please.

[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.260]
Okay.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:52.900]
Bye-bye.

[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.360]
21-11 at WIOD, we have an open line in Boca and Del Rey.

[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.980]
I think we just about had almost a rational caller.

[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.840]
I'm not sure yet.

[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.460]
We're going to send it.

[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.840]
We're going to run it by our experts and see what they have to say.

[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.940]
278 WIOD in Boca.

[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.740]
278 9 4 6 3.

[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:17.440]
I think we should take another breaking kind of all pause and reflect on the incredibly great stuff that we've shared with the audience so far this morning.

[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.260]
And we'll be right back.

[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.340]
It may be a rare event that Alan Finkelson at Pompano Park is listening.

[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.340]
I did get the package today.

[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:24.980]
Thank you, Alan.

[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.720]
I got the tape.

[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.000]
It's got all these big races on it from the metal ends.

[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.880]
And I've also got the...

[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.140]
Look at this.

[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.200]
This is for the Breaker's Crown.

[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.440]
This is one of the early...

[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.740]
I don't understand this at all.

[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.240]
What these are.

[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:44.880]
But these are like the entries for the Breaker's Crown at Pompano Park coming up in the end of October.

[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:46.660]
Here's one.

[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.760]
Oh, this is incredible.

[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.620]
Look at these horses.

[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:56.640]
And by the way, we want to congratulate Bill Fahey, who drives at Pompano Park or has been for several seasons now,

[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:07.820]
who's hot as a pistol up at the metallands, who in the third heat at the Hamiltonian at the metallands on Saturday, finished in a dead heat with Ron Wapel's.

[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.640]
I forget the name of the other horse that won the Hamiltonian.

[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.060]
And still finished second because in the three heats he finished first, ninth and first.

[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.060]
And Wapel's horse finished first, second and first.

[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.660]
But anyways, an incredible race off of Matt's race.

[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.740]
And they finished in a dead heat.

[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.600]
Which was exciting.

[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.620]
I just mentioned that.

[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.520]
And Bill Fahey is a hell of a driver.

[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.960]
So next time you go up to the metallands, just plunge your brains out on Bill Fahey and Jack Moisey F and your bond to come on broke.

[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:35.360]

[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.100]
Should we go to Pompano Beach?

[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:38.920]
Uh-oh.

[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.640]
Hey, it's going to be a great call.

[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:40.980]
Hello.

[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.260]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.100]
See, I told you.

[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.460]
I'm a first time caller.

[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.220]
Great.

[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.660]
And the reason I call is because, you know, you're in the same kind of mood I was Friday.

[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.060]
I do test control work.

[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.580]
And the company I worked with for at least to do nothing but condo, it's still so late.

[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.800]
But condoms?

[00:32:59.220 --> 00:32:59.840]
A condo.

[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.360]
Oh.

[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.800]
And it's starting to bug you a little bit, right?

[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.540]
Oh, I mean, I just changed jobs a couple months ago too.

[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.220]
I don't blame you.

[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.720]
I do houses now with cats and kids and dogs, as I like a lot better.

[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:14.780]
But anyways, when I lost an account one time by making fun of the mess.

[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.060]
You know, they're in the clubhouse, you know, and they go,

[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.800]
Who do you like the doggers of the mess?

[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.860]
And I said the doggers, and about a week later they cancel on me.

[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.360]
Yeah.

[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.660]
And I just, and I don't want to know why, you know, this stays like that.

[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.980]
You know, this makes me pretty serily.

[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.240]
And when I'm like, kind of, you got to be, you got to put on that happy face, whether you're not happy or not.

[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:35.640]
Yeah.

[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:40.380]
When you lose a hundred, you can lose a hundred accounts one day because like a hundred people to do.

[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:40.840]
Yeah.

[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.680]
But I just thought you might want to kind of relate to that, you know.

[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.320]
Well, I think it all does tie in together.

[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.440]
And matter of fact, I think the Metz fans ought to move into the Roach Motel myself.

[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.840]
But anyway, I'll tell you there.

[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.620]
I hope that from now on, now that they got the job done against Montreal,

[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.680]
I hope that from here to the end of the season, a Metz lose every game, okay?

[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.760]
And I don't want to get the nervous, but Ken Howell who's pitching for the Phillies tonight against Viola

[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.740]
pitched a tremendous game against the Cubs last week.

[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.580]
A six-nothing shutout if my memory is correct and he is really sharp.

[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.220]
One of those great Dodger organization arms, he could be tough tonight.

[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.560]
I don't want to get the Metz fans nervous.

[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:24.080]
I'd say I like this, for instance, because I know Glenn, I'm sorry about this.

[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.220]
I like TV cases like the next guy, but you know, this is what we're talking about today.

[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.520]
Well, it's that time of the year, you know.

[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.820]
It's that time of the year.

[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.560]
It's a hundred degrees.

[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.300]
Everybody's got the baseball fever.

[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.960]
We got four great divisional races going on.

[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.600]
And that's what people are excited about.

[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.700]
I like Oakland, but he just, before I say, I can tell you.

[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.160]
Well, he's out of his realm today.

[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.100]
That's all he does.

[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.000]
He'll find the paper.

[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.600]
He'll go, you know, and that mad style, you know.

[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.220]
Well, once the food gets here, it'll occupy him a little better.

[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.480]
Well, it's just that I don't understand.

[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.320]
If I get to another way.

[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.500]
You don't understand what?

[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.620]
Well, all this...

[00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.680]
Should we get an interpreter?

[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.320]
Is Zagaki still in the building?

[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.160]
I mean, Joe, to come in and interpreter.

[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.980]
And these names are put out like their universal name.

[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.360]
They are.

[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.140]
Like what name?

[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.160]
Which name has been mentioned?

[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.200]
I don't know in the market.

[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.900]
You don't know who Mark Grace is?

[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.760]
I don't know any of them.

[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.400]
You don't know who Mark Grace is.

[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.720]
Well, I've heard you mention him a lot.

[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.900]
What team does he play for?

[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.500]
Well, I know he plays for the cups.

[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.700]
You're saying he's not the type of person he's putting out an act.

[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.560]
He knows not.

[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.440]
I'm putting out an idiot act.

[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.300]
Vinegar bent my zone.

[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.640]
And I don't know who...

[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.620]
Virgil Trucks.

[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:29.860]
No.

[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.440]
And I don't know who the manager is.

[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.520]
Joe D'Ageola.

[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.660]
Oh, of course I know Joe.

[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:36.060]
Oh.

[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.480]
Everybody knows Joe McCarthy.

[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.100]
There are a couple, I guess, that are your first.

[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:40.880]
Joe Demagio.

[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.200]
There are a couple that are your first.

[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.180]
He's just playing stupid, sir.

[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.600]
No, one day we were on Zeta.

[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.560]
And some trivia question came up and he said,

[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.460]
Mickey Mantle.

[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.300]
I'll never forget this as long as I love it.

[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.340]
And it was the right answer.

[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.160]
Well, that was the right answer.

[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.420]
That was because that had been like a gigantic news story.

[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:58.720]

[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.040]
In the 60s.

[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.780]
In the 60s when I was a kid.

[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.040]
You know, he's in his living room on Sundays and Saturdays when he has his days off.

[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:06.700]
He's jumping up.

[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.640]
He's a closet.

[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.740]
He's a closet baseball fan.

[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.320]
You're wrong.

[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.660]
But you know what the problem is?

[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]
He's a brave fan.

[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:13.640]
No.

[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.920]
And he doesn't want to admit it.

[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:15.620]
You're wrong.

[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.380]
He's been pummeled and trampled upon as an Alan trample with the Tigers.

[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.000]
Don't say that.

[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.060]
And he can't take it anymore.

[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:21.800]
That's not true.

[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.940]
Well, the public's gone through some pretty bad times too.

[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:24.880]
You're damn right.

[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.460]
And they deserve what they're getting now, you know?

[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.980]
Yeah, hard for it.

[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.320]
Well, I hope they make it, you know, because I like the underdogs teams.

[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.560]
I'm probably, I'm bringing for the Orioles in the cup.

[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.560]
And you know, neither one may not make it.

[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.660]
Yeah, and everybody like Big mouth that capplin' over there at QAM

[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.060]
kept saying all the Orioles would be out of first place every day.

[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.920]
And here they've lost 14 of their last 18.

[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.080]
And they're still two and a half games ahead.

[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.680]
That's how bad that division is.

[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.920]
And that's, thank God, because, I mean, their team is still young.

[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.100]
They're going to get better as they go.

[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.940]
Damn right.

[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.680]
You know how to go with them?

[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.100]
Anyways, I know it's about news time.

[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.340]
I know you're sure well enough.

[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.040]
Well, you timing your sensationally or a great call and have a great life, sir.

[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.500]
And don't pay any attention to you, no.

[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.000]
Oh, I'm trying not to.

[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:05.440]
Okay.

[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.000]
But you just remind me that I'm in the same mood as you are sometimes.

[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:08.880]
Okay.

[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:09.880]
I can relate to that.

[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.360]
Say goodbye.

[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.760]
See, he wanted to say goodbye, then he got to start like a second winder or something.

[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.980]
Look at who's in this one race.

[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.960]
This is the Peter Hut Memorial at Poppano coming up on Reader's Crown Weekend.

[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.540]
He's got a pace off with John Campbell, the Jewish horse.

[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.360]
Look out now.

[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.960]
You can be big in Poppano Beach, you never know.

[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.100]
Anyway, that's going to do it for this hour.

[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.420]
It seems like we've only been here for a while, like a century away.

[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.320]
And Stan Major is going to be coming muscling into the show at 11,

[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.460]
because we invited him the other day in a moment of weakness.

[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.600]
And we've got food coming from Wings Plus.

[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:48.440]
And Steve today is going to be a glued and tattooed on the cane show Sports Talk with Joe Zagaki at 6

[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.460]
and Yankees in the Indians at 7.30.

[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.820]
You're under arrest.

[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:54.560]
Absolutely.

[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.940]
I'm not going to do that.

[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.340]
My buddy, my buddy.

[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.180]
He said, well, we got that out of the way.

[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.540]
I was talking to him last night.

[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.360]
Y'all bet you were.

[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.260]
No, he goes to Amsterdam, doesn't even go into a museum, which makes his mother very happy.

[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.880]
This would be a real moment.

[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.240]
This could be a rather short visit.

[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.920]
You go to the Vatican?

[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.720]
No, in Rome.

[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.180]
No.

[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.480]
In defense of the bird, let me say this about the St. Louis Cardinals.

[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.800]
Hey, they're only four out.

[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:33.320]
Yeah.

[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.120]
Look out.

[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.740]
Oh, now you're a Cardinal fan?

[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.200]
Oh, listen.

[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.820]
I fluctuate.

[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.300]
Yeah, whoever is hot this week, that's said, it's interesting.

[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:48.060]
It comes to my house and if the Cup Game is on, oh, hey, look at that.

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:48.640]
We're ahead.

[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.360]
We, we, you know, that's true.

[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.640]
No, I'm basically a Cup.

[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.540]
No, you're not.

[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.460]
You're a fairwater.

[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.260]
No, I'm just saying.

[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.440]
You know, nothing about sports.

[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.420]
You're nothing about sports.

[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:02.100]
You nailed the lid of the coffin and the Cardinals a long time ago.

[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.300]
And suddenly, they're four games off.

[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.440]
No, you're absolutely wrong.

[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.400]
Your memory is better.

[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.520]
Are you choking a little bit?

[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:09.680]
Yes.

[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.580]
Well, that's good.

[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.700]
A bit.

[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:12.780]
Huh?

[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.160]
Oh, I said, first of all, I said, Montreal was the team to beat.

[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.180]
Everybody laughed at me and they've been in first place and they still are time for first for a long time now.

[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:22.860]
They're going to beat me.

[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.040]
Then I said it's going to be a 14 race in that division all the way to the end.

[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.740]
Cardinals, the meds, the Cubs and the X-Pos and it is.

[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.960]
So don't give me this chance that I wrote them off.

[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.160]
It's tough.

[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.580]
I got to ask you a question because I have it.

[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.320]
But I don't think the Cardinals got the pitching.

[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.680]
Oh, and then do you see how they won the game yesterday?

[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.740]
You see how they won the game?

[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:46.640]
They put up Joe Magrina, I think, was the pitch hit who's hitting like 186.

[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.980]
And they walked him.

[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.960]
The guy, the pitcher for the Phillies, walked him with a basses loaded a force in the winning run.

[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.740]
Yes, Stan.

[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.520]
186 up pitcher.

[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.040]
The eagle here.

[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.180]
Oh, he's got the dolphin schedule.

[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.000]
Now you're really, you're up against it now.

[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.120]
Ah!

[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.660]
About my Eagles yesterday.

[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.860]
Big Eagles.

[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.020]
See, I thought it was a big football weekend.

[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.980]
That's what, that's what confused me.

[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.460]
I don't know what to say about baseball.

[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.080]
I don't either.

[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.740]
Completely through me.

[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.080]
I thought about all the NFL season stars.

[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.740]
All the races here for Breeder's Crown Knight at Pomp and Pond.

[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.260]
I don't know what to say because I know your real expert in this also.

[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.160]
Well, I always stand was great.

[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.200]
That was Stan's problem is that he didn't know about anything, you know, on the air.

[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:30.940]
That was a problem.

[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.100]
He didn't know about the Phoebe Kates moves.

[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.180]
No, no, no, no.

[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.360]
I got to ask a little bit about my new heartthrob.

[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.800]
Jacelle, what's her name?

[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.940]
My name is Janice Fernandez.

[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:41.880]
Jacelle McKindes.

[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.080]
Yeah, I was talking to April Koldis.

[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.560]
I guess Friday I was talking.

[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.520]
She was at all.

[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:48.820]
Oh, God.

[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:49.760]
She's a dork.

[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:57.260]
Don't you love the billboards with the blonde on the right and the brunette on the left and the twinkie guy in between from Canada or where?

[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.700]
I saw her.

[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.300]
Neil doesn't watch local TV but I saw Jacelle last night.

[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.260]
You think Neil would have a crush on Sixus New Anchor guys?

[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.920]
Pretty good look.

[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.400]
He was in here.

[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.020]
He did the Rineryshow one morning.

[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.760]
He was supposed to be the Salinger.

[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.120]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.060]
And he was good.

[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:15.820]
He sounded good.

[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.000]
He's an old radio guy.

[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:17.960]
Yeah, he was a good looking guy.

[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.140]
Yeah, but he was good on the air.

[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.320]
Look at that.

[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.820]
Higher love with Jimmy Tactor in the Mary Annabelle final at Pompa Do Park.

[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:32.220]
By the way, those of you who go to the track, Jimmy Tactor is one of the best trotting men in the sport.

[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.060]
PUNS YOUR BRAINS OUT.

[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.060]
Any relationship?

[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.840]
If you see him driving a trotter.

[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.540]
Boy, he is a great trotman.

[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.280]
I know Alan Finkelson would be proud of my saying that because it's true.

[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.100]
Well, I turned Debbie on on my way in during one of your commercial sets.

[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:48.520]

[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.160]
And boy, I want to tell you, Neil.

[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.400]
Yeah, she's tough.

[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:57.360]
We're having a hell of a time combating it since he came on our calls have dropped way off.

[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.720]
The audience is down.

[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.300]
I'd say 90%.

[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.420]
Well, you ought to be talking about the HRS.

[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:03.040]
Yeah.

[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.620]
No, we're talking about WEDR.

[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:07.400]
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.180]
Oh, incredible.

[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.640]
You know, but they do have a point.

[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.740]
I'm getting a sore throat.

[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.120]
I want to tell you something.

[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:12.460]
Yeah.

[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.260]
He's pulling out one of those disgusting stokeys.

[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.000]
You don't look like a super light or a for Dumbo the Yellow King.

[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:19.880]
I won't light it.

[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:20.540]
No, go ahead.

[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.560]
I don't mind you lighting it.

[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.660]
But I'm getting a sore throat just looking at it.

[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.400]
I don't know how you smoke those things, man.

[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.160]
Those are disgusting.

[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.360]
So those of you who are wondering how come on those days when he used to be on the ears?

[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.840]
Why that is.

[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.160]
Nobody follows me.

[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:36.380]

[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.320]
Now, Kane comes out here.

[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:42.000]
That's why I smoke this when I'm on your show because Kane hates him.

[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.240]
Okay.

[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.100]
No, he doesn't.

[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:44.740]
Anytime I have to.

[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.540]
He came in here.

[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.720]
No, he came in here.

[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.860]
Anytime I have to go.

[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.960]
He always mooches one.

[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.660]
And you know why?

[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.740]
Because if it's for free, he'll eat or smoke anything.

[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:00.640]
Then it's just a stand major because when he came in last time, he does clean it up the studio.

[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.660]
Here's his part of my job, gusting on the show.

[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.240]
I think he hates you all the night.

[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.580]
Much as he hates Bill Caulder.

[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.240]
Really?

[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.320]
Well, I said, because we're talented.

[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.920]
Oh, here's an early Sochen report.

[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:11.600]
Hello.

[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:13.780]
Stan.

[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.420]
I, uh.

[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.380]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.340]
I bring him out of the woodwork.

[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:21.380]
Oh, shit.

[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.160]
Wait a minute, sir.

[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.160]
We have an emergency bulletin here.

[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.420]
Just a minute.

[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.680]
We all do it.

[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.120]
Oh.

[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:33.980]
Oh.

[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.280]
I don't know.

[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.280]
Harry's been in a lot of places where he didn't know where he was.

[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.160]
But on the show, he was absolutely someplace else.

[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.220]
I don't know where.

[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.800]
That show was great, by the way.

[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.580]
Yeah, it was great for him to drop by.

[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.740]
Oh, did we play that Saturday?

[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:48.660]
We played it.

[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.100]
No.

[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.480]
I thought you said we played it on Saturday.

[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.120]
The best, the, uh, Harry Carey thing in Chicago?

[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:55.540]
No.

[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.500]
Isn't that the message he put up there that we were playing the whole thing?

[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.560]
Or was the beyond?

[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:01.940]
The, uh, again?

[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.060]
What do we play that three times now?

[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:05.360]
Get out.

[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:05.860]
What do they want?

[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.320]
They're starting to play the same tape every week now.

[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.160]
They want to play it.

[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.940]
No, we just shut off or transmit or adjustment on Saturday from 10 to 2 instead of playing those tapes.

[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.660]
The numbers would be the same.

[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.560]
Go ahead. What do you want?

[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.500]
Anyway, I listened to Ernie's show on Friday.

[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:19.980]
Yeah, you would be the guy.

[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.780]
Did you, did you call in by any chance?

[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:22.400]
Ha, ha.

[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.080]
Yeah, nervous laugh.

[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:25.680]
You and Ed.

[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.540]
Anyway, he was, he wanted to know what everybody thought of heaven.

[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.060]
And what, what heaven would be?

[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.620]
He wanted to know if they had a audible beat.

[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.820]
Heaven would be dying and going into a place where Ernie didn't have a show.

[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.040]
He wanted to know if they'd have used cars up in heaven.

[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.340]
Simple kind of cars would be.

[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.140]
Anyone to know if they would have talk shows in heaven.

[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:53.420]
Anyone to know if they'd have good talk shows like his or bad talk shows like Mr. N.

[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:54.920]
Those are his exact words.

[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.640]
Mr. N.

[00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:57.020]
Yeah.

[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:57.900]
Mr. N.

[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.340]
Boyd.

[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:03.100]
I mean, and then he give the phone numbers out and he start coughing and choking.

[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.440]
He goes, oh wait, there's a call.

[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:04.920]
There's a call.

[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.600]
The lines are full, the lines are full.

[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.180]
They wouldn't single call on the board and start bull crepping.

[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.260]
Nobody call in.

[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:12.200]
Well, was it night, right?

[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.040]
I don't know what kind of was.

[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:14.960]
I was the hilarious one.

[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.160]
Let me say it again.

[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.140]
Ernie's a nice guy.

[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.440]
He belongs on the air like Mortimer's Snurge should be a brain surgeon, okay?

[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.880]
I think maybe Ernie should get a tattoo.

[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.400]
Yeah, that would be good.

[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:34.180]
All right, you know, that is an interesting topic though that if we were killed on the expressway

[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:39.120]
and we went to heaven, what talk show hosts up there would be predominant today?

[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.460]
David Gold, Alan Courtney.

[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.440]
I think Alan Burke.

[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.500]
We've been premature, but you could be right.

[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.700]
Happy Fields, close.

[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.740]
So I was just curious, Paul, where you were when you heard Ernie's show, I was just curious about that.

[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.180]
I was lying in my bed.

[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:00.960]
Really?

[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:01.780]
You pick it up.

[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.020]
I don't want to pursue this.

[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.060]
Your house is right under the transmitter.

[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.740]
No, I picked it up in bulk, I believe you're not.

[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.900]
A lot of people have picked it up in bulk at two, which is why they're opening that new clinic up there next week.

[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.260]
Oh, look at this.

[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:21.680]
Here's Volgao with Jimmy Tactor in the Mary Annabelle Consolation at Pompadot Park.

[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.140]
He was coming just, you know, just hold it.

[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.920]
Well, it's only like two months away.

[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.760]
Two and a half months.

[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.080]
You know, you know why he's like this.

[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.100]
He knows the red car instead of the black car to work this morning.

[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:37.740]
Is that it?

[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.580]
Yeah, that's what it is.

[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.080]
In fact, Jimmy Tactor is down to drive both horses in the entry.

[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.420]
Maybe he's going to do like Stanley Dancer did the other day and drive a...

[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:47.400]
What do they call that when they have two horses hitched to a...

[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.360]
They have a name for that.

[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.140]
Glenn, what you ought to do is you ought to call it...

[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:57.500]
You ought to call it a big day at home after you know Nilo Sleff and ask him which car Nilo is driving to work in.

[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.540]
What the hell are you talking about?

[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.420]
The red one, Colin Sleff.

[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.340]
You know which one it is because you're the only one that keeps calling me in that car running up my phone.

[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.680]
I got a question for you.

[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.100]
Getting out of the shower this morning at 830, the phone rings.

[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.620]
I know it was you in my house.

[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.160]
And then I get in the car in the phone rings.

[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.320]
Just leave me alone.

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.160]
Will you change your number?

[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:15.920]
What do you want?

[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.000]
Now, didn't you say this was never going to happen again?

[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:18.580]
What?

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.560]
When you wanted to talk about baseball, we would talk about baseball.

[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.740]
Well, have it, we'd call.

[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.500]
1115 at WIOD.

[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.340]
He just disappeared mysteriously.

[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.260]
We have an open line in J.

[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:29.980]
751 WIOD.

[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.280]
First of all, I didn't come on a year and say I want to talk about anything you do.

[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.220]
You mentioned a couple of things.

[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.240]
These are the people that are calling.

[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.580]
This is what America wants, don't you understand?

[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:39.680]
What do you think?

[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.140]
What do you think?

[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.600]
America wants Bob Costas, then they deserve him.

[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:42.960]

[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:43.960]
It's the salt of the mess.

[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.320]
A little torpy butt-looking douchebag.

[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.100]
That's what he is.

[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.080]
Oh, we carry that show, don't we, on Sunday nights.

[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:49.940]
I always like him.

[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.420]
I'll come, you never get a call from an IRAky Yankee fan.

[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.300]
There are no Yankee fans.

[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.100]
They're carry-on baseball on WIOD.

[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.040]
Haven't you seen those numbers at night?

[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:05.500]
by the way trend coming out on Friday Friday morning at 11.30 we have a trend

[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.460]
coming out it's gonna be an unbe-

like Bill Fahey okay it gives me a good effort every time no no I already

[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:17.920]
took a good bath once I'm clean for life is that it well it's because they don't

[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.680]
know anything about harness racing we got the big fact they know nothing about

[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.320]
racing period except for Hank who only complains when he loses his three to

[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.860]
five shots you know they don't know anything about horse racing on that show

[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.860]
however I can't you know he's free to very good and other things to fight for

[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:38.820]
how how what sir if you got like a sock over your phone or something what's a

[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:42.760]
popping I don't know this kind of want to talk to this one of those sports talk

[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:47.480]
callers you know called Joe tonight and bitch to him don't bitch to us about the

[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.800]
fact they don't know anything about harness racing you see how I'm think of

[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.500]
some keeps saying hey bring those sports guys out here what should I bring them

[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.940]
out therefore they don't understand what's going on did you see a Hank on the

[00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:02.280]
tube over the weekend no he was hilarious he was what the dude he loses

[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:07.500]
another best thing no no he was just the highlight I watched that see Hank is not

[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.640]
a sports fan he's a compulsive gambler I've come to that conclusion he's a great

[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:16.020]
guy he is my best friend by the way too but he's a compulsive gambler he's not I

[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.780]
mean that's that New York syndrome again he needs to be deep program he needs

[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.460]
instead of going to California to go to the track he needs to go to San Diego to

[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.380]
get that operation to get that out of his system this is a mess from

[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:29.380]
a massive gambler oh I don't know about his baseball I don't is he a

[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:33.220]
mess fan I don't think so we got an idiot in vocal well that's not unusual

[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.020]
call I had called earlier but I had to hang up before I could talk to you why

[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.780]

Nick was right one of your liquor fans there I think that's a mess fan probably

[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:15.320]
they sounded like he's from New York it's probably his third call of the show

[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:23.360]

we'll take a poll on this okay I favor meatloaf but you have to form it like a

[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.240]

what a treat for you huh what a way to start the week in

[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:38.400]
cruelly manazza to why he listen you know it sounds like a recurring theme today has been this

[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:44.340]
paycheck thing it's been why pretty disgusting talking about people's paychecks and such

[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:50.600]
now and it is true Steve's made some noise about how how much money he makes you know

[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:57.100]
disgusting sir it's absolutely in poor taste it comes across as a real self-lagulating ego thing

[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.200]
and I hope he cuts it out it's really really sucks it's disgusting and the thing that kills me is

[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.000]
you were talking last week about how he's always wanting about it broke all the time you know he is

[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.600]
well you know what it is it's all this money spends on therapy is that it hundreds of hours and

[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:17.560]
and the sad part is well I sure hope you don't stop doing that well I was gonna say the sad part

[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:24.540]
is that it's not doing any uh they're probably uh they're probably charging him double two

[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:30.040]
considering the source you know but uh you know I was thinking he could save a lot of money if uh

[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.920]
if he just take care of things uh with a simple operation and it's called a lobotomy

[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:43.120]

[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.400]
one too big faker um I think you got all hot and bothered when Terry Bradshaw wanted to get his

[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.520]
hand hands under someone else well okay you got me you got me with my hands done you're no

[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:59.920]
question about it I was jealous you know I always jealous because I've always been in those like

[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:05.560]
what's the guys name it does it games with him on uh CBS what's that kind of for a very long

[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:10.560]
quiz man he's my type anyway I thought he was you know he's been deserve his whole career and I

[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.360]
thought he was good at it but he could also play football well there's no question about it but

[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.720]
without Terry handraddy's advice he didn't know what planity was on okay yeah you think I made that

[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.960]
up do you remember did you ever watch the Steelers games when he was playing yeah he was reckless man

[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.780]
he was great no but I mean he would at the most inexplicable time he would call time out and even like

[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:33.080]
Chuck Noel would start hyper ventilating and he'd go over and he'd say that Terry handraddy uh what

[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:39.580]
quarter is it where am I and what's he out with huh super cold and he was freezing that that's

[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:43.080]
true that's a good point that's a good point Chuck Noel's out of a guys he never called to

[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:49.460]
congratulate Mel Blunt or uh what's his name Bradshaw why I couldn't believe you were criticizing him um

[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:56.600]
why his performance was psychotic well I don't know I would go remember that from Zeta we haven't

[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.240]
heard that expression remember that yeah I'm really impressed the only person in the world

[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:07.180]
you well you know I can't even say it you well enough to come up with an expression like that

[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.660]
I am impressed with these colors yeah we go through the whole call and then at the end we have

[01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:17.100]
to come back to the same usual homophobic problem that this guy's got his penis envy syndrome

[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:22.180]
he like I said on Friday you know I've heard enough of that crap already when we were on wins

[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:28.000]
we except for a few of Stan's listeners we almost heard none of that crap because that's old news

[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.440]
okay because the listeners were with it enough that it wasn't like a major shock to their system

[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.940]
and they didn't have to keep protesting so much you know what I'm saying like people had protest

[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:43.740]
all the time I don't want to mention anybody specific you know what I'm talking about

[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:51.000]
like maybe just south of here for example but um and then on Zeta we had very little but since

[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.660]
we come to w i d I guess because this is so much the it's so much the sports and macho and

[01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:01.780]
joc station you think that could be it because if you don't if you don't come to work in a joc

[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.500]
strap at w i o d they start talking about you at the water cooler I'm telling you even the women

[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:15.640]
wear joc straps here I can't believe I'm here it's so weird and that's why some of them have to go

[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:20.820]
into early retirement because the crew ex bill here is just incredible man it starts chafing and itching

[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:25.640]
at its nightmare well she's gonna wreck it before you guys out there that it got like this penis

[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:33.420]

poke the call for Miami woke up to the yeah yeah that was me anyway Neil you know the difference

[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:57.180]

[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:08.940]

[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:17.860]
crawling at your doorstep yeah that's cute yeah that's good yeah how long did you work on that

[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:22.400]
three hours I believe it well keep working on it for another three something might happen

[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:29.300]
sure although in your case I doubt it I did too okay okay all right see yeah what a jackass

[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:34.760]

taking a Bokeh line off to you like we used to do it an insolent I won't talk Bokeh's loser on

[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:48.240]

[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.340]
Bokeh you said that for nine months it's true I mean on a West Palm line that's that's a line that

[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:58.860]
kind of like other people use from out of town and stuff but the Bokeh line there's no purpose

I gave in a for truck repair and when I got the truck back it was on wiod on your station wasn't

even when you get somebody's stupid calls it's still interesting oh it's even more interesting

today was a great show in spite of the fact that we had about a half a dozen people try to ruin it

[01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:45.630]
they made it better great but the the important thing is I know how much you love to eat and when

[01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:50.690]
you've been talking about these restaurants and how good they are I've tried most of them wings and

[01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:56.130]
lot of people aren't feeling the same way at this point now I've got something I've got to say

[01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:00.070]

[01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:35.330]
Rangers Orioles game just the other night on Friday night and we are considering asking the president

[01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:40.490]
to pass a Constitutional amendment which would prohibit anyone from not following baseball okay that's

[01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:46.690]

[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.960]
way for that to happen and I'm going to do it right after the show today we're going to move our tower

[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:17.380]
closer to your house okay no would it be better like Kazimie okay so like in other words if we move

[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:22.640]
right on the lake would that be good for you no I've been listening to you since the early 70s

[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:27.820]
right and we just moved up there about well that's interesting for the early 70s where here in Miami

[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:32.680]
well that's amazing because I came here in 76 well you must have been ahead of your time still kind

[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:38.840]
of the early 70s isn't it and I really miss your show very much and it's and it's you don't have

[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:43.920]
to worry about it it's been pathetically okay it's awful it's so bad it's embarrassing I get it

[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:49.200]
better on the radio you could probably pick up Bob Lassiter there if he were still in Tampa she

[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:55.300]
could as a matter of yeah but he's not there anymore well there's some kind of a top show that

[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:59.600]
comes out of Orlando in the afternoon yeah it's called redneck right wing that's what it's called

[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.560]
very dull and and something happens to the radio but they do have a big sheet sale on their

[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.120]
Friday show just in time for the meetings on a weekend well I'm calling because I heard these

[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:29.060]
good you can't hear the show okay I'd be embarrassed if you could hear what's going on I'm surrounded

[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:34.780]
by ignorance you know what I mean you can't offer any suggestions what I know the only suggestion

[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:39.100]
is to move okay what do you want to live up there with a bunch of Yahoo rednecks for in Kissimmee

[01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:43.720]
I just think that's like the armpit of the universe okay yes I the only reason that that town

[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.740]
exists is to make this one look good and then they want to put Disney World okay it's terrible

[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:53.980]
still look worse it really is the only thing that's nice about it is the green grass and the

[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:59.020]
cow pass that's what Tom Jones said yeah the green grass of home well that's great hearing from

[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:09.100]

[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.240]
wire or something I could buy for a radio well I tell you just stick your finger in the back of

[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:22.980]
the radio and keep it there and we'll see what happens okay one fifty three it what I mean she

beaches of Hawaii right now looking at all see now on the beaches of Hawaii I know this comes

[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:43.000]
as a shock but the people you see are like not on a TV screen they're like real you could almost

[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.240]

[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:17.560]
minuscule no I don't do it you can't get it off okay once they put it on there and you'll look at it

[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:23.140]
and it'll you'll say this is haloshes here she what on your it doesn't make any difference where it

[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:29.980]
is it's like a permanent what would you call it permanent thing yeah like a thing you don't want

[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:35.720]
to have a permanent thing okay trust me there's it's having a temporary thing maybe okay but don't

[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:42.060]
why are you letting him suck you into this is there some reason it wasn't your idea oh it is your

[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:47.980]
idea it's an exciting don't let him do it he's just a an au jamb revacca tour for Steve that's all

[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:52.120]
he goes around Steve could do anything he'll have you drinking urine by the gallop

[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:59.440]
I'm serious with the urine lady trust me don't do it and when he has the BM doctor on next we

[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:16.460]
I don't like him oh god that's what Don Johnson said to you has just a little one on his ankle

[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:22.300]
which I guess is why Barbara got sick and tired of the whole deal okay anyway that's the topic I

[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:27.160]
know it's almost even for Steve it's almost too bizarre to be true but it is women with tattoos

[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.780]
oh if I hear if I hear guys calling in on that show and I will be monitoring part of it okay

[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:36.480]
