[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.480]
Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or

[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.420]
callers are not necessarily those of the station. Now here's Neal Rogers, our

[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.680]

[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.100]
Hellendale just out of spite. Okay and then maybe after I lived there a little while I

[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.660]
run for public office in Hellendale. Want to thank some amazing people this morning we

[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.400]
made both the Broward section of the herald and the Sun Sentinel Ron Ishoy and

[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.240]
this is really amazing because Ron he really don't like the show. Okay let's be

[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.080]
honest but we thank him anyway because it says the only thing sillier than Neal

[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.400]
Rodgers saying all those stupid things saying those things yeah on the radio is

[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000]
the Hellendale City Commission trying to censor what he says and get him fired.

[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.700]
Come on folks this is America just turn the dial. Oh we heard that before.

[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.880]
Including on the work down he show last night which we will talk about it length by

[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.080]
the way it was oh god and in a Gary Stein who writes in a Sun Sentinel on a

[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.700]
front page of the Metro section is inviting people to get mad about certain

[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.280]
things and one of them he says get worked up at politicians in Hellendale who are

[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.180]
still wasting time battling with caustic but highly entertaining radio talk show

[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.060]
host Neal Rodgers the Commission approved drafting a resolution urging the

[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.800]
denial of a license renewal for WIOD which is Rodgers show you people in

[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.020]
Hellendale pay your city commissioners to get involved in censoring a talk show

[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.120]
host and what talk show host might be censored next. Question Mark so we thank

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.540]
Ron and Gary and what can I say I mean anybody would come and sense

[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.540]
understands that we live hopefully in America except for those people who have

[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.080]
minds like fascist and want to do the censoring themselves but anyway we had

[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.720]
Joey on yesterday. Joey was very entertaining here. Joey is one of those people

[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.140]
whose own show sucks but when he's on somebody else got like Lee Fowler with

[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.040]
his phone calls you know there you go but we had a good time with Joey yesterday

[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.180]
he's a good guy although I will say when he started critiquing this show I mean

[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.480]
I appreciated the positive comments but when he started critiquing the show I

[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.180]
became a little bit nervous and Joey was lucky we ran out of time and he was on

[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.060]
with Warthowny last night and I want to get into that show because that show

[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.900]
really hits so close to home as bad as the show was with all of the things that

[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.200]
are going on here first of all we got to collect call from Princeton New Jersey

[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.800]
every day on the show it seems we start with a long distance call from some

[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.640]
God forsaken place hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. How you doing? How you doing?

[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.040]
Okay now isn't that wasn't that the home of Woodrow Wilson. I give up.

[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.580]
Princeton New Jersey I think so. I don't know. I'm listening. I'm. It's right near

[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.540]
freehold isn't it? I'll be honest with you. Yeah you don't know.

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.320]
Not cancer can I ask you a question? Yes sir. Is there anything you do?

[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.400]
I know that you and the bird are the best talk show in the nation. Like I said

[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.460]
sir we love this call. I tell you what the first thing I want to say is Roger is

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.060]
the coolest because I called an hour ago by accident I had an accident telephone

[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.280]
accident not a radio accident. Yeah I called you because I was listening to

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.720]
how I started I got I got talking to you. So anyway I called you know how those

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.980]
AT&T operators really rude on the phone you know how they break into your

[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.500]
line. Yes I did. I really rude. Well at first Roger the answer to phone he goes oh hello.

[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.600]
At first I thought there was a wrong I got the wrong number and I say and he said who is it who is it

[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.880]
the AT&T operator? Sir would you like to make a person a person a person a person

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.540]
you know where's he called? That's right. So you're really.

[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.200]
Right. A state comms sir. Yes sir. I'm trying to like leave

[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.900]
followers. Well it sounds like leaf-fowler now sounds like you're shouting out the

[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.840]
window with call is distorting now you're getting you're eating the phone. Okay I'm sorry.

[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.220]
Try to use a little better telephone technique. Okay I use my

[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.540]
polite phone technique. That's better. Anyway Roger says okay sweet heart I'll take the call.

[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.300]
If I can't wear it then you know you'll go and I'll take the call. Well Roger says the operator was a real jerk.

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.480]
He was. A jackass. Yeah. A douchebag. Yeah that's a guy. A mung brain but other than that he was okay.

[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.740]
Well the main reason I wanted to call you because I turned how it turned on because

[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.660]
I'm a PI and I live in Miramar and I'm here up here for the weekend and then we my mother-in-law

[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.400]
which is our tripping itself. Anyway I turned him on and you know you have a big problem with

[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.260]
censorship and everything down there and the first thing I turned on they're talking about condoms.

[00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.680]
Yeah. You're talking about he's wearing these lamb condoms on the air. Yeah.

[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.120]
You call it the A-totline and if they're they've got a recording that you can only call the A-totline

[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.480]
from nine to one or something it goes off to real good hotline and then it comes on in

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.220]
Bible English and then then he says in Spanish and then he says well now we know who has AIDS

[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.040]
and so he's talking I mean you're talking about condoms and AIDS and AI on the air.

[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.960]
Yeah. Well okay it's like that that's pretty you know the trend trying to censor you.

[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.820]
Well that's what I'm talking about at the beginning of the show today if these yo-yos if these

[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.540]
parochial yo-yos in this town I got news for you okay there is nothing that we ever do on this show

[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.780]
that we couldn't do on television in a more downy junior show and here these two here these two

[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.520]
wackos from Houston and I'm not saying that they ought to be censored but I am saying that they're

[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.580]
really they do a lot of really dirty stuff and here they are and they had to delete the whole segment

[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.740]
not just bleep parts of it out they had to delete the whole segment at the beginning of the show

[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.760]
because it was so dirty okay and then they were constantly bleeping words out I mean not just one

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.680]
or two but constantly throughout the show and the one guy came on and this is the stick they do on

[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.840]
the year on the radio yeah yeah one guy came on and he was talking about the first thing he's

[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.440]
going to show off is asking people the others places they had to set yeah yeah I mean that's crazy

[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.540]
yeah he's that that was the guy from San Diego he was a real loser well listen this call is breaking

[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.980]
up it's great here and from you have a wonderful life and when he coming back come back Sunday night

[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.120]
okay well just in time to miss the cold weekend yeah well listen yeah the chance I don't know

[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.720]
if you're getting Marvin I know it's nice and warm up there in New Jersey yeah I got off the plane

[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.680]
you know how you have the walk away from the plane to that inside the terminal yeah I took one

[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.480]
breath of fresh air and I froze my nostril here okay say goodbye okay bye Neil see you 12 minutes

[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.080]
after 10 at W.I.O.D. and Sharon be calling in a little after 10 30 she stealing my car today

[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.480]
and they're putting a low jack device in it and then we're going to track it down hopefully

[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.880]
and well you know just in time for the weekend of course I got a couple of other cars

[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.680]
you're okay that's why it's always good to have a spear oh I want to talk about that too

[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.380]
because Steve had a really interesting call from some young punk out there who drives a pickup truck

[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.480]
talking about how Steve ought to have a Corvette but anyway right now I want to remind you that

[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.400]
in less than 20 minutes charhots going to be unlocking those doors and that means you can be okay now

[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:39.240]
what did I give out yesterday oh gee whatever it was oh green performer wasn't that the one yeah it

[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.140]
was in the eighth race at Gulfstream ran seventh and general Tim ran second just missed by half a

[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.760]
God beat by a 29 to one shot with Mike Gonzalez oh if I didn't know Mike was riding that horse

[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.380]
out he I'd have given that one but he still got beat but the perfect in it race paid 264 in a

[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.940]
traffic to pay 2100 bucks anyway we don't want to get sidetracked with that I do want to remind you

[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.440]
I'll be at Gulfstream on Sunday morning and we're going to be raising money for the community alliance

[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.740]
against AIDS at Gulfstream on Sunday morning at 11 30 which we'll tell you more about later Sharon

[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.800]
is in the process of stealing my car right now etc etc you know go back to the show last night

[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.860]
which you saw parts of it and I would say of all the work down the junior shows not a watcher

[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.500]
that much anymore because it's a horrible show and he's making millions of dollars and more power

[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.900]
to him and everybody knows him says he's a great guy and that's fine but the show is ponderous and

[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.860]
of course here they were they they taped this one in Houston and the subject was schlock radio

[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:44.240]
in schlock TV and they brought these two morning guys from Houston who have worked in Dallas and

[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.320]
Houston and back and forth they were on there Joey was on a fry I think a total of about two and a

[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.660]
half minutes he was like one of the beef boxes in the audience he wasn't up on the stage and they

[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.520]
had some guy from San Diego who claims he worked in this market Jeff somebody and I have no idea

[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.200]
who he is or I've never heard of him in my life and he was awful he was shaking did you notice

[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.620]
how nervous he was he was like panic stricken although when you're on with mort I can understand it

[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.880]
because it's you know yesterday I was saying to Joey get me on that show because more it's a good

[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.880]
friend of his I would never go on that show no for all of money in the world what would it accomplish

[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.540]
I mean the only reason you go on that show is if you're prepared to make a just a total jackass

[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.920]
out of yourself which I can do here I don't need to go on there and do it in front of the whole

[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.940]
country but so anyway he had they had thrust of the conversation was just how far should radio

[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:38.040]
and TV go and does it exploitation and is it this and is that and anyway they had to bleep out that

[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.840]
whole segment with these two guys from Houston then they had to keep bleeping words out in fact one

[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.640]
of the words was like I use in a different context like if you had a needle and you prick your finger

[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.000]
that was one of the words that they kept bleeding you could see them form the word you know with the

[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.160]
mouth you had to be a moron not to see what they were saying and there were lots of others as well

[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.740]
and a bottom line is that you know the one thing that kept coming up over and over again if you

[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:06.520]
don't like it turn it off yeah how about that so each person out there can be his or her own

[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.020]
individual sensor I'd say the overwhelming majority of the people in the audience who had a

[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.220]
comment were saying that turned out although the people in the audience where did what is down

[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.240]
to get those audiences you know in New York you expect that because that New York the Bronx cheer

[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.640]
whatever that is you expect in the Bronx okay but although they do it in Sikakis but same

[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.680]
difference here it's in Houston and he had a bunch of red necks going like that and man that was

[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.660]
that was even more fitting than in the Bronx I mean they were just a bunch of wild children you know

[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.560]
it was incredible more rules more rules I thought that I thought maybe Harlan must have made that

[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.840]
time a rule yeah these kids man they come up you talk about ponderous expressions they come up with

[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:55.160]
these stupid expressions and they just you know bury them into the ground hey man more rules yeah

[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:02.100]
yeah I don't word in edge wise on that show if you went on there oh they were just seriously Joey

[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.280]
I'm exaggerating when I say he was on two and a half minutes maybe he was on 80 seconds tops

[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.160]
a little over a minute no time no not at all he might as well not have even been there yeah and of

[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.920]
course I got to be honest with you because I grew up listening to Joey who claims to be 48 30 he left

[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:24.420]
a number out in the beginning of that he has never done that is he really the great grandfather of

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:30.020]
slok he's a great grandfather of radio but not of shlock radio he never did that stuff that I know of

[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:35.360]
right he really didn't certainly not anything like those guys in Houston are doing or like Steve

[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.020]
dollars doing in Chicago or Howard's doing in New York and that's why really I'm saving that tape

[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.540]
because that tape is going to come in handy for us here because if there's anybody and I do mean

[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.860]
anybody including our good friend out there in the audience who believes that anything we're doing

[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.700]
even comes close to the stuff that goes on you see how to how can you be an expert on community

[00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.620]
broadcast standards and major metropolitan markets when you spend all your time in coral gables

[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:06.140]
tape recording radio shows off one station I mean this individual isn't even an expert on

[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:10.160]
community standards in this market because he now listening to the other shows including the

[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.660]
morning shows on FM where they do far racy or stuff that we do okay oh I don't want to mention

[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.780]
our friend Tanner but he's one example and there are lots of others many examples and right over

[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:27.220]
here next door yes no question no one would argue with that yeah but it's funny I hear the stuff

[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.200]
it's funny it oh hey listen don't get me wrong I'm not knocking it and I'm not saying anybody

[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.980]
ought to be off the air but I'm just saying to you everything is relative okay and this show

[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.880]
and anything we've ever done these last couple of years since I changed my format is so tame and so

[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.700]
mild by comparison that it's a joke and that's why if people were to look if they could see like our

[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:54.220]
attorneys have the files from INZ and Zeta after the FCC investigated all those complaints which

[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.600]
all came from the same person by the way there's nothing there there's nothing there because they're

[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.640]
not concerned about anything we're doing and they never have been and so when people keep repeating

[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.260]
the same thing over and over and over again because of a personal vendetta it just isn't going to hold

[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:14.220]
any water okay there's just nothing there and I got news for you man this stuff that's going on

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.460]
TV now and don't get me wrong again I'm not saying that it ought to be censored but you talk about

[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.200]
scraping the bottom of the barrel and reaching the lowest common denominator this is where it's at

[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.320]
and they were saying last night hey this is what the public wants and it's just like what Donohue

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.320]
said here a few weeks ago if the public wants him to go into a ring and mud wrestle with some woman

[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.440]
and get thrown out of the ring that he'll do it if that's what it takes yeah because it's a business

[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.760]
well I think it's so funny that we have a lot of new listeners people who have read about this

[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.000]
in the paper and you know human nature as soon as they read that it's condemned and it's

[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.200]
controversial people immediately you have to see what's going on yeah and to tune into this show

[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.240]
and hear it they must be scratched together I don't understand what's so controversial what what

[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.480]
they talk to the area when's it going to happen well they have to consider the source 22 past 10 at

[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.980]
W.I.O.D. it wants to come out and out to 1026 at W.I.O.D. we're going to be talking to Sharon in a few

[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.420]
minutes she's in a process of um see you in my car and going off and hiding it and of course the

[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.180]
low-jack people have put one of those devices in the car and then they're going to attract it down

[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:23.660]
and find it we hope now why did Sharon by the way have all her stuff she had like a whole bunch of

[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.840]
stuff packed up yeah that she was sticking in the car before she let looked like she was not prepared

[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.760]
to come back real soon you know what I'm saying anyway we'll be talking to her in a few minutes

[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.060]
isn't it amazing that on the front page of the hero not the brow to this but just the regular old

[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.100]
herald to show you that they have nothing more important to do in halandale here is a picture of

[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:50.980]
John peanuts tronnellone and it says reputed crime boss snared in halandale jewel sting

[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.960]
an undercover detective posing as a gambler cut a reputed high-ranking mobster in halandale on

[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:03.640]
Thursday arresting John peanuts tronnellone for accepting $77,000 in allegedly stolen jewels

[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.000]
his payment for gambling and loan-sharking debts tronnellone 78 said to be the boss of the Cleveland

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.580]
organized crime family a suspect that of running south Florida bookmaking and loan-sharking operations

[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.580]
that handled fifty to seventy million dollars in vets each year it's not peanuts at

[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.240]
peanut and anachi for to stay wide prosecutor he's one of the big enchiladas now that shows

[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.640]
why they have so much to do nothing going on here in halandale matter of fact i don't know how many

[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.280]
years ago that this was really operative or if there's still a lot of mafia people uh by the way

[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:40.780]
good morning to everybody in golden beach but um halandale was one of the uh hangouts in fact there

[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.700]
were a whole bunch of little restaurants i don't want to get into a netnic thing but there were

[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.860]
a whole bunch of little restaurants that were like the meeting places for the top mob people in

[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:55.400]
halandale about 20 years ago you mean so are you talking more like 30 i would 30 years in a 50s

[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.700]
north bay village too was a and then like everybody got tired of halandale because it was too

[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.500]
geriatric and they moved to gold to golden beach but anyway it's good to see that they have nothing

[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.040]
else to do over there we want to thank everybody to send their facts things yesterday i'm going to

[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.100]
give that number out again if you want to send us one of your letters of support one of the most

[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.120]
interesting letters of all of them was somebody because i get to a copy of every one of them and

[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.080]
there were just tons of came through yesterday in the morning somebody said he doesn't like this show

[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.540]
but he's just appalled by the attempt to censor in other words he turns it off he enjoys Steve

[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.960]
show he hates this show but he is a hundred percent behind us which you know some like most of the

[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.460]
letters people who love the show but there that was a pretty interesting i think we're on this

[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.080]
choice at a time i don't know that Ron hates the show just that he has that incestuous relationship

[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:46.660]
with Greg Miguel and he just now listen hey sincerely i really appreciate that both enjoy who

[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.480]
does not fund of the show and gerry stine in the sunset well i mean but as i said you don't have

[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.220]
to be a brain surgeon to realize if you don't like the show turn it off there's nothing so outrageous

[00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.020]
going on here i mean here we are the big complaint from halandale is that we're picking on old people

[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.160]
and making jokes about metamusal and hear these guys who can't even do their radio stick on more

[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.880]
downy they have to bleep the whole thing out because they use such filthy material okay now who

[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:17.780]
the house kidding home also i watched last night the david letterman anniversary show finally and

[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:25.200]
very stine fuel the comedian was on doing jokes about elderly drivers oh no i can't do that so i

[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.320]
guess next halandale is going to be and i guess we'll probably have to condemn the new york times too

[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:35.180]
because it was that sunday uh times magazine article the roles are different here or whatever yeah

[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.600]
that was kind of like the uh highlight of that whole halandale thing we did two years ago that was

[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.300]
like one of the center pieces of it and uh she said everything that i've said about the drivers

[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.480]
about the early bird about the sweet and low about stealing the roles and stuff and stuff in your

[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.320]
purse and the behavior in supermarkets i'll never forget that one market in sunrise and i can

[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.940]
never think of the name of it i think it's in sunrise or tamarack that was a sponsor of mine several

[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:04.020]
years ago when i was on one of those oil d stations and i went in there and the people who owned and

[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.160]
ran it the very nice people but they were giving me the honest lowdown i went in there and they said

[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.000]
on sunday morning when they open at ten o'clock in the morning or whatever time the old parts are

[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.060]
standing online and they go in they they're rushing inside they have some kind of specials i guess

[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:24.060]
on sunday to go rushing inside and they're fighting with each other over packages they're grabbing

[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.640]
packages that i've each other's hand uh they they have to have a special security guard there because

[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.820]
of the barbaric things that go on i mean they told me stories that would make new hair grow on your

[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.100]
head yeah and uh and and these are people who you know who derive an income from them but they're

[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.440]
just appalled by the behavior but i guess we can't talk about those things because they're pretty

[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.900]
outrageous and controversial right anyway here's the facts number at w-i-o-d seven five seven

[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:55.560]
seven five one six seven five seven seven seven five four you know that's it Larry Kent

[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.800]
is it true that lary can is the new sales manager at magic one oh two point seven is that

[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.500]
true is that just a rumor and that he starts on monday that's the that's the popular rumor around

[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:11.040]
town well listen he's going to be one of the biggest sales managers he is a monster in a broadcasting

[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.760]
industry and certainly a giant in sales no question about that so we wish Larry all the luck in

[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.180]
the world because what goes around okay look at that every line on the board slowly but surely

[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.480]
here while we've been spewing our bs every line has lit up with the exception of the Palm Beach line

[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.060]
of course so if you're out of Palm Beach there's your chance of a lifetime and especially if you're

[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.240]
mobile and you call in that let that line not only we get right through but you'll probably be on

[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.460]
first because there are no mobiles on the other seven lines six five five nine four six three six five

[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:47.240]
wio d now before we get into the thing with Sharon i just want to say this about yesterday Steve

[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.260]
had this call and the thing that made it a funny call is this young guy at the end of the call he's

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.220]
giving Steve a lecture about how he should buy American cars in the Toyota Hollywood and all

[00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:00.600]
this on the end of the call he says well i drive a oh what's that kind of pickup truck it's a

[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:08.280]
a Chevy some kind of a bronco or something like that whatever the name is and you know he's

[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.520]
giving a lecture about how Steve ought to buy a Corvette and he drives a pickup truck

[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.220]
now i didn't have the heart because Steve made some kind of comment about how Neil had a Corvette

[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.540]
and now he's got a super a turbo uh Neil has both i don't want to start being a yuppie or

[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.620]
anything like that but there are two completely different kinds of cars and i love them both

[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:33.660]
okay the super is a four cedar first of all the turbo secondly it's a very smooth riding car

[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:39.700]
doesn't ride like a sports car it rides like a limousine like like a Cadillac kind of ride that you

[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.580]
would expect and the Corvette of course is an eminence got a bad ride but i mean you know you're in

[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.300]
a sports car when you're in the Corvette but it's a totally different kind of car that's a faster

[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:55.480]
car i love them both but uh so the best thing is going by one of each and get ready your pickup

[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.860]
truck here's a mobile on that line boy ask and you shall receive hello i'm here Neil yes sir

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.000]
but we're here too i need rick shot talk i'm so bad today do you well don't hold your breath

[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:38.000]
like about 20 hours a day doing those ponderous 50s talkups again whoo by the way speaking of FM

[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.040]
and i got to tell you you know the old saying the more things changed the more they stay the same

[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.660]
that rose the music over there is becoming more obscure by the moment what a surprise and it bothers

[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.360]
me because i tell you at nighttime i don't like listen to talk at night because there's nothing

[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.040]
listen to anyway to be honest with me and uh when i'm in the car at night i like you're in some

[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.640]
music you know and i don't always remember to bring out some CDs and put them in the car and i

[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.820]
got news for you man finding a record that you want to hear is not easy on FM and this market

[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.480]
the music on and i don't want to get them upset next door gets spike running around like a lunatic

[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.940]
but uh the music on FM and this market really sucks okay it really does i mean you hear all this

[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.740]
marginal and in the old east asian like to play all these novelty records like last night i

[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.560]

Fred in the playboy band and judy in disguise with glasses now that's maybe once every six months

[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.400]
you want to hear a record like that's like the purple people leader you know but god they play so

[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.660]
many of those silly silly i think is the operative word it's a silly market with a lot of silly

[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:48.940]
people in the business okay like ricky tickey a silly guy it really is like joe joe johnson's a great

[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.820]
friend of ours and a super guy and he has sent us over some tremendous material but he's a silly guy

[00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.380]
okay we love him but he's a silly guy in fact that whole station it's a good state but it's a silly

[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:06.340]
state well they got run saying john on there well like i said it speaks for itself okay all right

[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:19.720]
by the way and maybe jay and ken from low jack are going to be on there too hello hi now let me ask you

[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.940]
a question yes why did you have a nap sack and all that stuff put together before you left here

[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.960]
this morning god in my car well Neil i had to tell you i had second thoughts about the whole thing

[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:35.060]
you know Stephen driving me crazy lately i thought well i got to get out of here well i want to

[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.280]
remind you i want to remind you one thing uh you pretty got some nerve wasting all of this

[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.340]
valuable time you could be booking guest for steve because your steves producer not my produce

[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:48.260]
oh yes let's get that clear let's straighten that out right up front okay but i know you're a generous

[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:54.440]
man you yes your car well i hope you enjoy it yeah i think i have my skate fun okay don't go

[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.520]
putting any cheap oil in it either okay it's got to use their real expensive stuff it's a one of

[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.300]
those high priced hot cars and super test right so where are you well we don't want to give any

[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.500]
clues as to where you're going but anyway shearing is in the process of hiding the car and then

[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:13.320]
Ken and Jay from our good friends over there at low jack are following like so they've stuck the

[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.600]
device in the car right yeah they put the device in the car but i tell you they're going to have a

[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.600]
hard time you know my diabolical mind i have really really hidden it very well good how about the car

[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.380]
okay so uh what are they doing now in other words they gave you a head start how many minutes

[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.840]
have you started i hate to tell you this because they're really hot on my tail there's been a

[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.220]
coral gables police car that's been circling around the area coral gables police car right

[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.420]
uh didn't that know because the trend they look they notify all the police agencies and then the

[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.740]
police have transmitters as well well if there's a coral gables police car tailing you i'd

[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.420]
govern myself accordingly if i were you yeah well i didn't want to go out the howl

[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.020]
unveiled okay so you're gonna hide it now and then how much later are they gonna start looking

[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.960]
because i know we're gonna talk to you again well you already have hidden and they're looking

[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.100]
yeah they're looking okay but they haven't found it i i knew i'm telling you it's

[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.880]
hidden very well i bet okay well let's just to make sure that uh you don't hide it too well you know

[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.500]
what i'm saying Sharon well i have one thing i had second thoughts about it i thought if they don't

[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.440]
find it that's my ticket out of here yeah okay trust me trust me the device works real well okay

[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.960]
and find out you know how many minutes it took them to find her it really isn't amazing thing anyway

[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.660]
Henry's probably getting a little a p.o.d now because we're running way over and that's his problem

[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:44.300]
okay just take another sip and relax it's 1037 on six 10 w i o d 1041 at w i o d let's get some of

[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.380]
these calls okay you're never gonna guess who's on one of the lines but i noticed that roger's put

[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:54.260]
him at the bottom of the list okay are you there i can't imagine doing it hold on put him on hold

[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.680]
because i don't want to put him at you know i had anybody else but i just don't want to get him to

[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.840]
get the feeling that we're gonna leave him for last although i'll tell you this we probably will

[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:08.300]
okay hold on oh my amy hello yeah neal yeah good morning hi did did i hear you say that peanuts got

[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:13.920]
busted peanuts yeah is that mean i can tear up my io use fact do you better let snoopy on for a

[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.820]
little walk because i think he's having some serious stomach problems at the moment yeah i believe

[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:24.280]
that listen these guys up in halendale uh i uh you know i'm really having a hard time swallowing all

[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:29.640]
that too i mean if they want to hear controversy i think what they need about a 20-minute shot of

[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.420]
the grease man yeah that would do it i think 20 seconds might do it yeah it would be 20 said well

[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:41.460]
i i cruised down here from dc and i heard him when he was in jacksonville and in dc and and i'll

[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:49.480]
tell you it's non-poreal what can i say yeah um but a reason i called is i read an article in the

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:55.880]
papers more made me kind of sad did you happen to see the uh mugger muggeria fishner article

[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:03.360]
about Gulfstream in the yeah yeah right yeah this is kind of like a death knell hey it just makes me sad

[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.520]
i i don't know uh then i hear on the news this morning that the city commission is trying to throw

[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:15.840]
chalks off of uh what's an island yeah now what's next uh let's see all the flamingos over next next

[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.260]
thing probably do the worst thing we'll probably throw barber camp atman office out the beach and

[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:25.560]
then we'll really be in trouble well listen i just i just one day don't you understand the operative

[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:33.760]
word in this town sir is death uh death creeping inevitable innexurable death yeah and it's in

[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:40.460]
it's truly sad i mean i'm third generation Florida and well i i march first to be 13 years that i've

[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:44.360]
worked in this market and i'm going to tell you just in that short time i have seen such a decay

[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.480]
and such a deterioration and so many great restaurants close and so many great landmarks disappear

[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.920]
and and the so many living and breathing people calling in on a show to tell us that they're leaving

[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.960]
and uh so many people coming in on rubber raft you know uh who really have little to contribute

[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.880]
to the area and it's just it's just pathetic it is uh it makes me sad i mean i grew up here my

[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.340]
dad grew up here my grandfather grew up here and uh but uh maybe i'm too hard hit i'm not going to

[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:18.080]
know me either in spite of it all never okay i got a role uh see you sunday at the trite okay thanks

[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.140]
you bet ten forty four at w i o d we have an open line in date if you move quickly now seven five one

[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:29.960]
nine four six three seven five one w i o d i wonder if we're getting any facts stuff because Sharon is

[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.620]
out there uh that's right doing her thing well i'll probably be a gigantic mile four when she comes

[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:41.020]
back i'd like with my daughter very relatable same principle anyway what was that facts number it's

[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:50.360]
seven five seven seven five one six four lottery hello hello Neil hi this is barren hello glenn

[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:56.420]
i'm doing okay i won't ask you Neil you look great at hollywood toyota i came out there to

[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:02.260]
get my snare drum head re-autographed i know i promised a song about ricky ticky's cap but yeah you

[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:07.320]
did huh well back yeah what happened to the boys in the band thought he's just too small potatoes you

[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:12.760]
know and with all this stuff happening elsewhere we came over the song that i think will fit everyone

[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:18.920]
in everything i don't want to give it away but it's a Beatles song i don't know if you like the Beatles

[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.440]
and uh i'm just worried about michael jackson's doing this because he owns it all now i hear

[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.800]
yeah he'd probably be getting a letter if we played on the area yeah t-10 d-6 govern yourself

[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.180]
accordingly yeah well my brother and my bass player decided to head down although it is interesting

[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:38.120]
that there are those people who record this program which is copyrighted by Cox Broadcasting who

[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:42.540]
owns all of the material on the entire radio station and then take it and use it re-broadcasted

[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:47.760]
in other places and you know violate the copyright laws of the station on a daily basis uh-huh

[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.140]
oh we figured instead of going to the u.s. post office we'd better bring it down there in person

[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:57.300]
because you know they're into some real set-ups from what i hear and uh but uh they're on their way

[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.860]
down there it's not food or nothing but they're on their way with a tape and they want they want

[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:07.940]
to leave it with your secretary and uh it's uh it's a Beatles song it's called nowhere man but we

[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:13.340]
kind of changed it around to maybe something you could kind of figure on and uh i don't know if i

[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:19.500]
want to say it but you always say it on there say it uh well we changed it to kind of a asshole man

[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:26.620]
oh really it's kind of fitting for what's happening now and uh and i also wanted to stress that

[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.840]
it's not something that we uh just cut out half the side of the the tape and just put words and

[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:37.120]
like i know a lot of people use just you know they use those maskers or whatever they're called where

[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.300]
you just erase half the song and you know what you're not worth it's all us it's kosher and it's kosher

[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.280]
yeah it's approved well that's good maybe we'll have a little bit of it for lunch too thank you very

[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.240]

[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:19.740]
eleven wio d let's go to west bocah hello hi and ill yes sir i sent you a fax yesterday and uh nice

[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.580]
you did we appreciate it that's my pleasure i just wanted to say that you know a lot of people

[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:30.360]
listen to your chronic you want me to say no come on don't get don't start getting emotional with us

[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.760]
come on okay i won't forget it i just want to say all the people that listen to the show and enjoy

[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:40.180]
the show and never get rated by arbitraron or anybody now's a good time to express your support

[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.340]
whether it's by fax or letter or that kind of thing i just think it's a good idea and i think

[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:50.680]
everybody should do that amen are you able to speak it at all now about the situation at your

[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.060]
previous place where they kind of muzzle you on this situation here sure well i'm able to speak

[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.560]
is the way that the i see it in my attorneys use it you know when the stories are out and by the

[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.740]
way they're going to be all kinds of stories in fact here we had a thing in a hero again this

[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:07.280]
morning and one in a sun sentinel and we've had stories even in the prestigious halem dale digest

[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.720]
so i guess once it it's there you know it's fine the whole world knows about it but you know it

[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.920]
talks about the 19 months of harassment in the ongoing campaign so i guess anything that you know

[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.640]
is within the realm of that is fair game because it is part of an ongoing news story and uh you know

[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.400]
when you say uh you know what do you want me to say if far as being muzzled i mean these people were

[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.540]
harassed over there constantly by this individual and he found a willing ear up there in portland

[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:35.520]
main in bob gilbert's in who's one of the corporate head haunches of guy gannet right and uh I think

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.000]
you know gilbert's in his somewhat i don't want to paint them together but some of the same

[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.840]
conservative mentality as this individual so uh every time you get a phone call we would get a

[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.120]
call about here you're playing this and take it off or you're playing that take it off and it got

[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.520]
to the point where you know we we couldn't do anything i mean the the number of things that were

[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.540]
left for us to talk about on zeta was like the weather and what was coming in for lunch that day

[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.440]
and beyond that man it was not much i mean i'm telling you and i mean this there was no sexual

[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.020]
content of any kind permitted on that show now if you ever listen to an fm morning show anywhere in

[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.900]
this country uh i don't know of any other morning show where all sexual content has been eliminated

[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.960]
because most most of the humor is related to something about sex and we you know so the fact

[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.760]
that we were able to do as well as we did under such restraint was a major miracle i mean i don't

[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.940]
know how we did it it was it was pretty amazing but uh i don't know i i i was just kind of curious

[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.100]
because i had heard rumblings about there had been some kind of agreement that they forced you to

[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.460]
sign over there so you wouldn't be talking about this character that is correct that's absolutely

[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.760]
correct and it was uh there's some very bizarre legal uh machinations behind that by the way which

[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.940]
would make your hair fall out but again the but the exception in that agreement see we didn't

[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.540]
sign agreement we signed a letter attached to it but the agreement has an exception which is very

[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:55.100]
clear and says that the exception is if it's a legitimate bonafide news story we can discuss it

[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.960]
and uh which you know one would hope you could because this is america i think so far yeah so far

[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.940]
okay all right just curious about that did you ever get those met him useful recipes i sent you

[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.240]
oh yes we sure do all right well maybe now you should send him off to sonny there

[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.740]
no i'm working with my dogs on it but but to give you a prime example of what we're always talking

[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:19.460]
about rich about Palm Beach County you won't see this in the bokeh paper it wasn't it was not in my

[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.420]
addition to the Sun Sentinel or the Harold well the Harold up here is kind of the national edition

[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.860]
they just had the super bowl results i think yesterday from last year yeah that's tailored to

[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:34.780]
Palm Beach oh come on go not here he is rich i'm serious well anyway it's it's kind of

[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:40.540]
pinderous but anyway a lot of us are supportive of your own i know thank you some gree

[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:44.980]
well she violated but you up okay okay i'll try speaking of but you up let's get it over with

[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:50.900]
okay why not why not that wasn't fat rich wasn't no no that was slim rich hey let me ask you

[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:56.440]
question about rich real quick before i get on what rich fat rich or fat rich yeah his last

[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.400]
name doesn't begin with a p doesn't know it sure doesn't okay it's not the same rich i'm thinking

[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.100]
of no this one that we just spoke to begin with a p okay then that's the rich that i'm thinking

[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.940]
of oh okay well boy this is really exciting i'm sure the rest of the audience listen so for those

[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:13.820]
of you out there he lives in Palm Beach County you want to open up the telephone directory and

[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.820]
look under everybody under p and find somebody whose first name is rich you might actually

[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.760]
just want them okay but anyway oh the situation back on theta with the high school and the coach

[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.600]
oh yeah that that that call was definitely a part of this whole thing beyond the shadow of a

[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.780]
dog is this one and only same individual yeah well no i don't know who made the phone call the phone

[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.720]
call wasn't from the individual but there can be no question that it was involved in this whole

[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.640]
campaign because at the end of the call is this wacko's a governor self-according to which of course

[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.280]
is the phrase that he used in all of these threatening letters by the same individual so as

[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.140]
somebody i know one said there are no coincidence is it couldn't possibly have been just a coincidence

[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:58.760]
in addition to which later on the notorious individual we've been talking about was making phone calls

[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.360]
to some of the kids at Cooper City High and their parents who were listeners of mine see this

[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.620]
this is the thing you know we as you know we attracted a lot of teenagers the high school students

[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.260]
who really got into the show and we have a lot of them now you know and so right away here's the

[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.140]
inference he's trolling for sex from boys on the air and all of this other crap and i mean some

[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.700]
of the things that were said were just so outrageous and slanderous as to be unbelieveable

[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:26.760]
well you've heard it said that sex sex sex pre-success will in this case success pre-dendee

[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.620]
and this guy obviously hates himself and can't handle the success of others and he's taken it

[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:36.540]
on it's as simple as that well what can i say what you'd like to imagine one other thing i went to

[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:42.320]
science dolly of the night and i told Boone i said give me whatever kneel eats and he came out

[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.380]
with something i've never had before curry pop oh yeah oh yeah those are delicious aren't they great

[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:52.780]
oh i don't know how many of them we were eight eight but they were unbelievable okay all right well

[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:58.460]
listen i'm closing everything's gonna work out and it's all gonna turn out to be a good day good day

[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.440]
okay we had a little update on what's going on with my car and shearing and a low jack who's this

[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:10.240]
hi this is my thonstein with low jack yeah my car are you okay uh what's happening i'm in a low jack van

[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.660]
and i'm uh in the area of coconut growth somewhere

[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.980]
but i got a feeling shaman may be taking a trip yeah you better catch up there hurry quick because

[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:25.320]
i got a feeling she's on her way to san hose you know what i'm saying catch up but we're closing in on

[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.900]
earth and we'll be there shortly all right now wait a minute i want the people to if you just don't

[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:35.880]
say anything for zag any listen to those beeps there is that those are the sounds of the little

[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.200]
signal that's tracking and again there's a device that you're looking at which the police have

[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.380]
and it shows the direction in other words it's like a compass kind of wouldn't it wouldn't

[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.860]
that be a good description exactly kind of like a compass and as you're turning it it zeros in right

[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:54.520]
on that that one spot where you're right on the tail of the signal just the idea of the uh relative

[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:59.440]
distance as well as a relative bearing that the stolen vehicle is you know it's actually

[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.180]
shipped to the police car well don't take too long because i got a feeling when she had that

[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.040]
suitcase in that nap sack i had a feeling we might not see her again soon okay well i'll hurry up

1108 at wio d we have an open-line ad date 751 9463 751 wio d here's a call from the city of choice

[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:32.360]
halandale hello yes nia yeah i just want to take a minute to first of all compliment you on your

[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:39.280]
description of all the people in harlandale i work in harlandale i really can't say what i do because

[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:45.620]
i'm right on harlandale beach burrow bar in the brokerage firm i'm not going to name any names now

[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:50.500]
and i find i just want to let you know i think it's incredible i've been doing it five years now

[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:56.440]
how the people on that south ocean drive have so much money and when you look at it from this

[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:01.620]
end of the business you wonder how in the world they got it or how the how in the world they keep

[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:06.900]
that money because they really think they just know everything and know nothing and secondly if you

[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:13.040]
go back about six years ago when i was back in college i worked the uh valet at Gulf Stream racetrack

[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:19.000]
and i just want to reiterate what you say when those gates are not 10 30 in the morning those

[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:26.760]
so-called animals are lined up there with their cars like like they're like it's post time for them

[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:32.780]
you open those gates at 10 45 and they just race up to the valet i mean just like are heard of

[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:38.940]
animals and by the way i just thought i'd like you know they really can't take you off the air

[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:44.340]
because the people of harlandale really won't have a lot to complain about yeah yeah they don't have

[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.600]
anything else going on over there they've only got like mafia people and uh and people getting

[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.220]
hit in the middle of the street jay walking and nobody can get across the uh you know how in the

[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.960]
olbeats boulevard and they got no problems over there yeah and if you want to retire early you just

[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:01.920]
got a how in down and have your uh road that okay okay how are we going now and of course the

[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.500]
reason i play the tamarack thing is because we don't want to lose our perspective it isn't only

[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:10.200]
how in the olbeats seem to be in a class by themselves but we've also got very large parts of

[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.460]
Miami Beach and tamarack and sunrise and of course we got that little problem up there in boca

[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.740]
i don't know what the boca thing is that's that probably will be our next uh assignment

[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:25.120]
because there is uh boca you think is living and breathing people i thought boca was like young

[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:30.460]
families i was really under that delusion and then i discovered that a lot of the uh seniors who

[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.000]
move from iami beach their next stopping point under you know while they're in god's waiting room

[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.900]
their next stopping off point is in boca so i don't understand that and guess which is the open

[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:47.600]
line in the board by the way in boca at 278 w i o d and the meantime we've got an update on my car

[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:54.660]
which shearing by now probably is in the keys hello hi nil hi how you doing okay okay we found the car

[00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:02.460]
great uh it does look like she was uh looking to hide it and get on a boat and leave yeah i think so

[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.060]
and if anybody i know could get on a boat and leave she's the one because she lives on a boat

[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:10.480]
uh huh well it's not probably not too far from where she lives this isn't that i'm cooking a

[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:17.960]
grove uh huh uh with just a little bit south of the uh city hall my ammy city hall and she

[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:26.820]
hit it in a dumpster holder it's one of these uh little enclosed buildings where they store the

[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:33.120]
dumpsters yeah and that's where she stuck it are you serious? certainly i'm serious well that's

[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.800]
cheering man i'll tell you she never gonna drive my car again i'll tell you that we're in the other

[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:42.760]
time i'll go to the Neil is no problem the car is in excellent shape there's no garbage on it

[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:49.740]
yeah okay now what i'm doing is i am now placing a pair of high handcuffs on her

[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:56.140]
i don't know if you heard it yes i did well now we'll take her in we get now don't take her in take

[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.880]
whichever is the biggest dumpster down there and the air around for a little while okay air around

[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:04.160]
for a little while yeah okay you probably find some good guests in there first see

[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:11.380]
well you can't hear you right now that's good okay so it took what time did she actually leave

[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:21.960]
he left at about a quarter of ten and i left about ten o'clock and we've been out there tracking

[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:29.000]
her and it took us i would say about an hour and five minutes maybe an hour fantastic uh when you

[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.500]
think that the average recovery time is an hour and a half this is good well it's excellent especially

[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:38.160]
since she didn't just go a few blocks away from here she a hauled ass and went you know all the way

[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:43.320]
to the grove that's true as we know she would yeah okay listen thanks a lot we'll talk to you in a

[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.860]
little later and get a final a wrap up okay thanks bye bye okay so and just over an hour low jack

[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.560]
they tracked down the car thank god and we're all breathing a little easier if you want to get

[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:59.100]
more information about it really is an incredible device call her toll free number 1-800-333-6863

[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:07.940]
1-800-333-5 for the best protection against the theft of your car low jack there can be pretty amazing 11-16

[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:15.500]
and w-i-o-d the bokeh light can i just check it yeah it's uh it's okay it's dead no it's working but it's

[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:19.400]
the only one it's not lit because uh now i think you know we've really done a number on halyn dale and

[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:27.820]
the beach and sunrise and surfside uh-huh and some of these other like point east and win more and

[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:33.640]
there's so many of these uh-bashions of creeping death but bokeh there's a thing there that we um

[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:39.480]
we just can't figure out that can't believe rich says you know i'm i'm being too tough on bokeh or

[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.500]
something you know we said this not i mean much too nice to bokeh they'll be next then the

[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:51.420]
bokeh city commission can pass a resolution let's get that nasty kneel off the air okay but they

[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:56.740]
have better things to do no i don't think so a lot of plastic people up there in bokeh too by the way

[00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:00.560]
if we ever have like a good day when it gets over a hundred in the summertime about a hundred and

[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.260]
two i'm serious those those bastards will melt out here here's a mobile and brown word hello

[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:11.780]
a nail yes sir no i live in halyn dale don't sound mobile this is a very good connection

[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:18.100]
yeah i have a question asked i don't think it's a mobile nail yeah i have a question asked you why do

[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:23.900]
you continue to pick one of people in halyn dale uh-why do i pick on him yeah another word so let me

[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.960]
let me let me say this to you for the last was that we've been here three months we rarely were

[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.860]
talking about halyn dale we have this little comedy thing the halyn dale vice can we play a

[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:39.720]
halyn dale music you are you want to answer your question okay first of all when you say pick on that's

[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.060]
a rather juvenile approach to life okay why do we pick on him that's something a little third grade

[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:50.500]
kid might say uh you know there is a situation that exists in halyn dale which is in one case sad

[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:55.420]
but another way if you look at it from a satirical way can be funny but we don't ordinarily talk about

[00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:00.200]
halyn dale anymore we do about tamarack or boker anyplace else but the city commission decided

[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.800]
unilaterally last Tuesday that they were going to go ahead and pass this resolution based on the

[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:10.060]
rantings of one individual and based on sunny rosinberg's prejudice to try to deprive me of

[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:14.900]
a livelihood in this station of existing okay that's why we're talking about halyn dale

[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:19.060]
yeah but but even assuming that they didn't do it what difference does it make halyn dale is a

[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:23.980]
horrible place all right could i say something now i'm listening sir this is not a mobile phone by

[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.940]
the way you say it's all right let me say it again it's not a mobile phone why you told Nick that I

[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.920]
don't know but i guess little white lies you know you say it's a horrible see why is it you're not

[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:37.820]
responding never sir never why is he you pretend like you've got a hearing problem why did you tell

[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:43.780]
Nick you're on a mobile phone i am on a mobile phone oh yeah sure oh yeah sure yeah part of me let's

[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:59.780]
invention in halyn dale we don't want to wake up the living dead so we have a new kind of horn it

[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:06.320]
doesn't make any sound okay it affects their pacemakers all right you press the horn and

[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.260]
immediately there's something in their pacemaker that tells them oh there's a problem look around

[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:15.100]

and yes i will grant you that there were some old fart some sour people in ham tramic

[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:45.960]
we got all bent out of shape and guess what uh they never took it off the air and they never

[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:49.720]
took dick pertin off the air and they didn't take away the license of any of the stations he worked

[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.340]
at and nobody you know passed any resolutions there were a few sour pushes didn't have a sense of

[00:53:54.340 --> 00:54:00.120]
humor but life went on okay just like it's gonna go on here that may come as a shock to some

[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:05.500]
out there but the life goes on why are you picking on us i mean grow up don't you understand if you

[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:09.560]
don't like what we do on the show if you don't have a sense of humor if you take every if you're so

[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:15.140]
uptight about life go someplace else okay don't try to tell me what to say or what to talk about

[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:21.280]
because it's not gonna work okay it's never gonna work and i got news for you as long as i'm breathing

[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.100]
there will be a station in this market that's gonna hire me and gonna put me on the year and

[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.560]
gonna take an all-revenue that this show attracts and gonna have all of the listeners that this

[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:36.240]
program attracts it's gonna happen okay so you can keep cletching and you can keep having meetings

[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.860]
and you can keep carrying on like a bunch of children it isn't gonna do anything okay it's not gonna

[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:46.120]
happen well it's gonna make the ratings even bigger yeah that's right it's gonna get a lot more

[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:50.760]
publicity we've been in the newspapers every day this week which is not the way quite frankly i'm

[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:56.000]
interested in being in a newspaper but if that's you know if that's what you want to do more publicity

[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.700]
absolutely free it works couldn't buy it for a million dollars sunny good old sunny Rosenberg

[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.240]
god just when you need a little bit of push and let people know where you are there's

[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.320]
sunny Rosenberg to do you good favor okay do a good deed for you what a guy yeah what a hell of a

[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:21.500]
great American is that a mobile is that a new mobile or is that not our friend again huh

[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:26.340]
that was one of the best mobile calls the collection was so clear you've never heard what like

[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.980]
and that horn but I wish I had a horn like that it's it's painless I mean

[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.420]
hey nobody's ever gonna get upset about that see a lot of times you're afraid to honk your horn

[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:38.720]
because people in this town to get uptight they pull out a gun they shoot you if you blow the horn

[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.940]
when you got a silent horn like that man there's no problem doesn't make any sound at all it was

[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:49.400]
great here's a mobile a real one in Broward this is a real mobile well now you know it's a different

[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.420]
yeah yeah because it's crackling and break let me get out of these wires over here oh my

[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:57.780]
I'm making a wrong turn out of those wires sir try to try to escape oh Jay I just wanted to make a

[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.780]
point that's what you might appreciate see I don't always agree with you and I bury you off and

[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.500]
just holler back at the radio when you say things that I don't agree with but the point is I like

[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:12.340]
you on you know and I listen to you it's not radio accident or anything and the other thing

[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:19.400]
that I wanted to say was that these people that are the barbarians these oldies they don't become

[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:24.300]
that way when they turn old they usually were young asses and not are becoming old snack dasses

[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:29.840]
and you know I've often said I've often said Helen Dale is like a movie and when people ask me

[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.720]
which movie I say Conan and the barbarians without Conan absolutely true and the thing is I've

[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:40.880]
always thought that people never really get they don't change they just get better at what they do

[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.320]
so if they are do you expect they can get to be bigger and better they're better let me explain

[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.440]
something to you when you go to New York now New York's got a lot of problems a lot of crime and a lot

[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:54.540]
of poverty but the living and breathing the vibrant people in New York are not people who are

[00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:58.860]
waiting to die they're people who you know go to sporting events and go to Broadway shows and go

[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:04.580]
to all kinds of activities that are going on they're alive the people that came here from the northeast

[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:09.240]
and off a lot of our people who left there because they didn't fit in with that in other words

[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:13.040]
they were prunes even when they were young and they'd much rather live in this closed kind of

[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:18.460]
condom mentality where they can isolate themselves and just kind of vegetate anyone everybody else

[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:22.120]
to suffer along with them that's why they try to destroy everything else that people love like

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.640]
this show because they want everybody to be as miserable as they are well then basically what

[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.820]
you're saying is that we're specializing in do show here that's correct okay well that's

[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.040]
and by the way our good friend a channel 10 Alan mashingale sends his regards

[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:43.320]

[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:15.540]
how they're they claim that there's a talk close to play but they know

[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.180]
is there on their phone

[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:28.340]
you

[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:30.940]
so

[01:01:36.980 --> 01:02:00.920]
And I'm just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:30.900]
I'm just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[01:02:45.500 --> 01:03:00.880]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:13.600]
I hate you more... never listen to your dumb Everyone's just

[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.120]
Just the box of metal music and with the radio

[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:36.700]
And how they'll explain that it's a dark horse to play, but you know they can't wait for

[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:37.340]
his son.

[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:56.080]
But you know they just can't wait for his son.

[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:10.380]
1134 on 610 WIOD boy does that bring back some memories, huh?

[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:10.900]
That is.

[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.640]
And it's like Desi Rue as Jerry Wichner would say Desi Rue.

[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.300]
And as we're going through the whole Hellendale thing all over again, which is just of course

[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:25.420]
a tiny little part of this whole nonsense that's been going on, but it's really amazing

[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.020]
that what goes around does come around.

[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.240]
Great radio philosopher one said in the Steve King show how many times said on the Steve

[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.800]
King show anyway, let's tell you about our good friends over at Toyota Hollywood where

[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.600]
you're going to get one whale of a deal, man.

[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.300]
Acres and acres of automobiles.

[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:45.260]
In fact, there are lots of spans over eight acres between Tapt and Sheridan streets in

[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:45.500]
Hollywood.

[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.480]
Now don't get confused because on the one side it would be the west side of 441 is

[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.500]
the use does make me a little bit nervous when I watch the behavior in the eye because

[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:58.260]
I know that they goose them and they coach them before the show and it's all, you know,

[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:58.980]
it's contrived.

[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:05.120]
But even so, when you see the way that they just respond on cue, I mean, what would it

[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.920]
take you to sit in the audience of a show and on cue go, you know, make guttural barnyard

[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:15.020]
sounds and behave like you're just an absolute Neanderthal moron, you know?

[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.340]
Of course, some of those people I don't think have to ask in that audience.

[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.400]
But anyway, now we do have somebody.

[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.620]
By the way, to Palm Beach lines open, I just mentioned that that's a one open line.

[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:30.400]
I don't know why I bother to mention it at 655 9463 655 WIOD.

[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.700]
It's kind of like the scourge.

[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.820]
And of course, when I randled off all of those places before Boca and Tamarack and Sunrise

[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:38.360]
and Helena, I left out Palm Beach.

[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.400]
I guess we could probably use the whole county, right?

[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.960]
Palm Beach County in general, not just pick on Boca.

[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.760]
Here is somebody in Broward who saw the show.

[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:46.660]
Deal.

[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:47.180]
Yeah.

[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.040]
Yeah, I saw a little more downy show.

[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:58.100]
I think Steve and Joey on TV, you know, no way you could tell me that Steve is older than Joey.

[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:02.160]
Well, you know, Joey has got this thing about his age, man.

[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.720]
He says he's 48, but I still think he left one number off at the beginning of it.

[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:05.920]

[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.280]
But he does look good for a guy.

[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.860]
I'm telling you the reason I know that he's older than that.

[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.620]
And I'm sure he's listening.

[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.700]
You're probably going to all bend on his shape.

[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.160]
But the reason I know he's older than that is because when I was a kid growing up in upstate New York,

[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.700]
Joey was on WKBW in Buffalo and he was like 100 then.

[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.500]
He was like 100 years old then.

[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:22.820]
Yeah.

[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:24.940]
Now that was like almost 30 years ago.

[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.060]
So he had 130.

[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.660]
So maybe he's 140 years.

[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.160]
See, he has his 48, but he could be 148.

[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:32.640]
And I'll be honest with you.

[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.400]
He looks pretty damn good for a guy that age.

[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.600]
Yeah, I told the guy during the phone that I was on a mobile and I thought I'd get on quicker.

[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.020]
And this is, you know, I'm here.

[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.520]
Now Nick likes those guys with the silent horns like that guy in Helen Dale.

[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.620]
Oh, you want him in my horn?

[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:44.960]
Yeah.

[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.900]
Okay, this guy's also on a horn, right?

[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.200]
I can't say which kind.

[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.880]
It's 1140 at WIOD.

[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.200]
We have an opening at Broward.

[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.040]
5249463.

[01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.100]
524WIOD.

[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.400]
Now see, it's, you notice he said he watched more downy last night.

[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.660]
There's the kind of guy you'll find in the audience.

[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:02.920]
Yeah.

[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:05.300]
Okay, that's why this guy related to it.

[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:05.980]
Yeah.

[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.480]
Because he's the perfect kind of guy to find an awards audience.

[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.200]
Anyway, Mort made somewhere between 20 and 40 million.

[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.500]
We haven't got the exact figures in front of us yet.

[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.580]
Boy, that's a stonish.

[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.760]
Joey did tell us some good stories about old Doc Daly, didn't he?

[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.080]
Yeah.

[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.060]
Yeah, pretty good.

[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:21.640]
How about his teeth?

[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:23.960]
Miami, hello.

[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:24.580]
Hello.

[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:30.680]
You know, Neil, I just thought you can always pick your cordless phone or the audience could go out to their car porch,

[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.860]
and your car and people are horned.

[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.500]
They're not a mobile, but don't get the time considered.

[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.060]
That's correct.

[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.760]
They'll get on immediately if not sooner.

[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:36.820]
And we still have a horn.

[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.140]
I'm like that guy in Broward.

[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:38.980]
He's still looking for his.

[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:39.560]
I thought he should.

[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.780]
I also saw the mark, Donnie.

[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:47.420]
I missed the first 20 minutes of it last night, but the audience really ruins it because you know it could be anything going on on the stage.

[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.780]
Their reactions are just...

[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:53.680]
Well, the interesting thing about it is when you watch the show, if you keep your eye,

[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.260]
like when they have people like Joey was out at the podium,

[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.400]
and when they show shots where you can see the audience in the back.

[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.220]
They're looking at the monitors.

[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.620]
Yeah, they're looking around.

[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.020]
They're not doing anything at all.

[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.120]
They're not really even paying any attention to what's being discussed.

[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:09.960]
And then as soon as the cue comes, as soon as Mort gives them those trigger phrases...

[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.320]
It tries to one side, we can't...

[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:11.840]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.140]
It's kind of like...

[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.360]
You know, I can't stand watching it.

[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.380]
Like an artificial birth on television where the people are looking at watching the birth.

[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.260]
And it's like the same thing.

[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.820]
And they're not really reacting to what's happening.

[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.680]
It's all...

[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:23.860]
So I'll put up.

[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:24.260]
Yeah.

[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.800]
Anyway, I like...

[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.520]
I quite because...

[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.680]
I've been pretty upset because I've been looking in my Miami Herald all week.

[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.280]
And I never see anything in there.

[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.840]
I hear about you referring to articles.

[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.040]
And they're all on the Broward section apparently.

[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.900]
And they don't want the people in Miami to see it.

[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.280]
Well, I thought there was some little blurb in the dates.

[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.060]
And there he is, shearing his back with a low-jack.

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.840]
People they got her handcuffed and she's got stripes on.

[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:46.260]
Good.

[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.560]
Yeah, there was...

[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.900]
Finally got out of that dumpster, huh?

[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.420]
There was just a small article in the dates actually.

[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.100]
Yeah, there was just a little thing in the dates.

[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.380]
Well, they told me they would send them to me.

[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.900]
But I told them, I think that you...

[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.360]
A major part of your audience has engaged.

[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.440]
And thousands of people would like to see it.

[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:01.820]
Yeah.

[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.900]
So I'm supposed to call them back later because...

[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.840]
Apparently, there was no one who could actually take my complaint.

[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:07.840]
Really?

[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:10.100]
And yeah, and I think maybe your friend...

[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.460]
Well, there's probably nobody who could speak English over there in the date edition, you know.

[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.980]
Well, I think maybe your friend, I don't know if you don't want to use his name.

[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.980]
Jack, maybe that sound effect you have would be sufficient.

[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.300]
Whenever you want to refer to his name.

[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.820]
Because that sounds like a co-onical or a sister, doesn't it?

[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.020]
Have a wonderful day.

[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.920]
In closing, let me just say.

[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.980]
Okay, it's 1143, 17-dil-new in a WIOD.

[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.640]
Okay, shearing his back, they got the handcuffs off finally.

[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.360]
And that'll teach her a thing or two, right?

[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.100]
Yeah, seriously, she was on her way to the keys.

[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.000]
Yeah.

[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.400]
She had her napsack in a suitcase.

[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.780]
I got a little paranoid when I saw that, but she's back.

[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.740]
Oh, you still have them on, that's good.

[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.560]
Well, Steve gave him instructions.

[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.380]
Don't take them off to the start, looking some heavy-duty guests, okay?

[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.820]
Just remember, your Steve's producer, not my producer.

[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:52.720]
It's gonna change the world.

[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.720]
You don't have time to be messing around with stuff like that.

[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.400]
Thanks very much.

[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.240]
You guys are incredible.

[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.600]
And just over an hour, they track down the car.

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.460]
And I'll get busy, Sharon.

[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.420]
Get some work done.

[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.100]
Can I do one thing?

[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:01.600]
What's that?

[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.660]
I'd like to thank Ernie over at my senior Marine.

[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.560]
He's the superintendent of the dinner key project.

[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.200]
And he found me a very neat spot, so that's where I hit it.

[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:09.920]
No, you came in.

[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.780]
Okay, let's, we got a mobile who saw wart last night.

[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:13.080]
Hello.

[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:14.220]
Bill.

[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:14.700]
Yeah.

[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:15.540]
I'm okay.

[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:17.540]
I saw...

[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.600]
Well, that's a matter of opinions.

[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.100]
I saw the show last night.

[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.620]
And you're still okay, huh?

[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.500]
I just saw.

[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.760]
You know, Jill, he looked a little sweaty, a little dumpy.

[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.520]
But, you know, he had a nice outfit on,

[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.680]
but he looked a little dumpy, a little nervous.

[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:32.400]
Yeah.

[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.800]
Well, a guy from San Diego was so nervous,

[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.200]
I thought he was going to fall on the floor.

[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:36.920]
He was shaking.

[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.980]
When he asked him to go into the audience with the mic

[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:41.860]
and do his bit in the audience,

[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.020]
I thought he was going to drop dead.

[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.380]
I thought he was going to start to hypervevel.

[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:44.620]
Yeah.

[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.020]
Yeah.

[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:47.740]
It was almost like, it was like something that a teacher

[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.320]
would ask you to do in school, you know,

[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.400]
go up before the class and I don't like that kind of stuff.

[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.420]
You know, go do your act.

[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.480]
I mean, that's just a lot of crap, you know.

[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.520]
How can you do your radio show in a television audience?

[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.100]
He made it virtually impossible from the do-a-thing.

[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.820]
You know, Joe, I used to listen to Joey every now and then.

[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.180]
And I thought he was pretty funny,

[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.140]
but last night, you know, more gives nobody a chance to say anything.

[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.620]
Yeah. Well, that's the thing of the whole show.

[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.400]
That's the concept is that everybody talks at the same time.

[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.440]
Everybody's in a verbal brawl.

[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.160]
And the thing that really got me now,

[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.460]
they had the news woman on.

[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.060]
This is what really killed me.

[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.660]
They had this very intellectual news lady

[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.440]
from some station in Houston.

[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:27.060]
She was way out of water glasses.

[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.780]
And she's going on about how reporting the news and so on.

[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.000]
And she's ripping her all though who deserves to be ripped to shreds.

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.300]
And she's talking about the brawl he had on

[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.180]
with the skinheads and the Nazis and the young people

[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.900]
and her all those nose getting broken.

[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:40.940]
And I'm thinking of myself,

[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.300]
here she's on more Downey show talking about this kind of stuff.

[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.100]
And he's the one who started it.

[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.680]
He didn't want to start it all at fist fight with what's the guy's name?

[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.480]
Who was sharp to him?

[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.020]
Al Sharpton.

[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.320]
And the twice it's happened on that show.

[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.280]
And of course, now the new thing is the confrontation

[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.880]
where they get in each other's faces

[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.940]
and they're threatening to have a violent fist fight.

[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.360]
I mean, here she's sitting there on that show

[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.360]
and she's criticizing Haralo for something

[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.580]
that morta's all the time.

[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.760]
You know, somebody should have punched her in a mouth for it.

[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:08.400]
When I saw her at first and she first started to speak,

[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.100]
she sounded rather intelligent.

[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.040]
And I said to myself,

[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.740]
don't get sucked into this.

[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.360]
This is he's going to turn this into a confrontation.

[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.480]
It didn't happen,

[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.040]
but I thought that's what was going to happen.

[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:18.560]
It could have.

[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.180]
If the guy from San Diego had been so nervous, it could have happened.

[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:21.440]
Exactly.

[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.320]
He knew where his floor is, by the way.

[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.180]
It's on 79th Street just a few blocks east of this game.

[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:28.180]
Yeah.

[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.060]
By the way, I tried the Armageddon, man.

[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:30.740]
That was correct.

[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.540]
Oh, yeah, God.

[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:31.780]
Exactly.

[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:35.880]
You know, we walked in there my wife and I had a 630 on a Friday night.

[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.980]
We wanted to go out early because we didn't have a babysitter

[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:38.620]
if it stayed late.

[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.060]
And we walked in.

[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.000]
There was nobody in the place.

[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:41.640]
The guy says,

[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:42.820]
I can't see you.

[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.140]
I looked at him like he was nuts.

[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.320]
But of course, they finally found a place for us.

[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.520]
And it was just fantastic.

[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.320]
Why did he say couldn't see you?

[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.820]
I said he had reservations for the night.

[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.220]
And he was basically all booked up.

[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:53.480]
Yeah.

[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.020]
Oh, yeah.

[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:54.080]
And he said,

[01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:59.260]
it's a good idea to make reservations there because since we've made him popular, man, they're just always booked up here.

[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.760]
I got to tell you, we told everybody about the place with fantastic.

[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.540]
I'm going to try that test street road.

[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.640]
Test street takeout tonight.

[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:05.220]
Be back.

[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.340]
Just suggestions are great.

[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.260]
Okay. Thanks a lot.

[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:07.620]
See you.

[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:07.880]
Bye.

[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.380]
1147 at WIOD, there's an opening in Broward, 524-9463.

[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.580]
The Palm Beach Line is still dormant, but I'm not listening.

[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.660]
I mean, you know, if you don't learn after a while, right?

[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.380]
How long does it take anybody to learn?

[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.580]
Speaking of good food and some of our sponsors, here's a great Valentine's Day idea.

[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.080]
And that is to get over to Shells.

[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.640]
Okay, there are five soft Florida locates, but that makes too much sense.

[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.040]
Anyway, it's 1151, nine minutes till noon at WIOD.

[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.440]
I think we're going to start doing that all the time.

[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.840]
We'll come back in the middle of a cent.

[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.540]
Kind of like Mortoni last night where I'm telling you, man, I have never in my life seen a show where they bleeped out so much.

[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.220]
There was a period of time there where they were like every third or fourth word.

[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:47.980]
They were getting really hot and heavy.

[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:52.240]
And these two characters from Houston, yeah, their skit was really good.

[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.860]
And the skit never got on.

[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.000]
Not one second of it.

[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.520]
And I wondered what the heck just happened, you know, and then I realized, and we forgot to mention this,

[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.660]
the PD from the Chicago television station that carries more down.

[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:06.700]
He was in the audience and he got up and he says, we're not going to carry this episode of your show.

[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.440]
We can't put this on the air because of what these two guys just did.

[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.860]
And they were doing on his show what they do on the radio.

[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.420]
Okay, that's why I keep repeating this so that you understand what contemporary broadcast standards are.

[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:25.800]
They are so far and above anything you'll ever hear in this market, and especially ever hear on this show.

[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.320]
And that's why these self-appointed sensors would think they got some idea of what broadcast standards are in FCC law.

[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.540]
They don't know their armpit from their elbow, okay?

[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.000]
They haven't got a clue.

[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.020]
Miami, hello.

[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:37.780]
Neil?

[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:38.120]
Yeah.

[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:38.880]
Good morning.

[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:39.460]
Good day.

[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:45.540]
Let me start by saying that I've advertised with you in the past and you have an excellent station and program.

[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:56.440]
Reason I'm calling is to comment both on the pros and cons of the Loach Act system which was just tested on your vehicle.

[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.700]
Well, listen, if your sponsor passed a present, you know, we don't discuss sponsors on the air.

[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:05.660]
So when you say the pros and cons, I really, I just can't discuss it on the air.

[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.460]
I just can't do that.

[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:10.560]
I mean, you know, each person is entitled their opinion, but I just can't get into that kind of a discussion.

[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:15.000]
Well, can we offer a challenge then for the con part?

[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.920]
No, I don't want to get into any con part because just like you were, if you were advertising, they're paying good money to advertise and, you know, they're not deceiving anybody.

[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.940]
They're going to give people all the information they want to write to their defense and answer their questions.

[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.040]
So I don't really want to get into a discussion of it.

[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.200]
It's 11.53 at WIOD.

[01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:33.380]
We have an open line in the data.

[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.320]
You know, I'm a little eerie of that call because anybody who's ever been a sponsor knows that we don't allow people to discuss.

[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.360]
I mean, if somebody wants to say, hey, we went to such and such restaurant.

[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:42.980]
It was a great meal.

[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:43.680]
That's fine.

[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:47.680]
But we don't allow cons about our sponsors on the year and he should know that.

[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.160]
Let's go to Hollywood.

[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:49.560]
Hello.

[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.540]
Long gone.

[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:51.940]
Okay.

[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:52.580]
Coral Springs.

[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.000]
Hello.

[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.100]
Okay.

[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.540]
Now, why are we on a run all of a sudden?

[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:57.840]
Nobody on these stinking lines.

[01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.120]
We have an open line in Broward.

[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.980]
524-946-3.

[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.320]
North Miami on the seven.

[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:04.960]
Hello.

[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.240]
Hello.

[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:08.620]

[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.200]
Now, all of a sudden we were doing a radio show just fine.

[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:13.900]
There were no problem.

[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.740]
Now it's like everybody has disappeared.

[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.680]
We're hearing strange sounds on the phone.

[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:18.960]
Am I losing my mind?

[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.020]
Or is it not me?

[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.340]
That sounds weird when you put it.

[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.260]
Yeah, there was a hollow sound.

[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:22.640]

[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:23.160]
Uh-huh.

[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:24.300]
Miami. Hello.

[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:24.600]
Hello.

[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.100]
Yeah.

[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:25.520]
Hello.

[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:26.180]

[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:26.180]

[01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:27.640]
Are you really there, sir?

[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:27.900]
Yeah.

[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.440]
Is it real call?

[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:29.340]
Okay.

[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.280]
I've just been out hold for a long time.

[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.520]
I really didn't know the difference.

[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:38.980]
I'm calling about an ad, actually a little section in the Miami hurricane

[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.160]
that I picked up about Thompson.

[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.280]
What about it, sir?

[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.900]
Well, he's, I don't know, he's coming over the hurricane,

[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.360]
putting your show down and putting on TV.

[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.960]
You're talking about the letter to the editor?

[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.700]
No, it's on the front page of the hurricane.

[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.080]
On the front page?

[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:56.560]
Yeah.

[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:57.460]
I haven't seen that.

[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.540]
It's lawyer wants UM to pull ads.

[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.740]
First of all, I spoke now, who's the person that wrote the article?

[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.040]
Um, Mark there.

[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.020]
Yeah, I spoke to that person the other day.

[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.220]
I tried to explain to him.

[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.740]
He was referring to so called ads for hurricane baseball that appear in the show.

[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.580]
There are no ads.

[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.120]
There are promos, which are free of charge because this station carries hurricane baseball.

[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.580]
And I explained that to this individual, but I don't think he understands anything about this business.

[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:29.020]
In addition to which, Ron Fraser call us on opening day of baseball season last Friday.

[01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.860]
Had a great conversation with me.

[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.280]
Ron's a big fan of mine in the show.

[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.640]
He's just like I'm a big fan of his.

[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.960]
And I guarantee you that if there were paid commercials for hurricane baseball,

[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.560]
Ron would be the first one to want him on this show.

[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.000]
Right.

[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.980]
Well, there he's, I don't know, he's putting Thomas.

[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:50.800]
Where does he Thomas, Thomas and get the right to, um, to, you know,

[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.500]
dispute Miami's position?

[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.200]
The, um, University of Miami.

[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.180]
He's the right to say anything he wants as long as it's not slanderous or untruthful or twisted or manipulated.

[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.700]
But the bottom line is why it's being made a big song and a dance over there.

[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:03.980]
Right.

[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:04.540]
I don't know.

[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:08.800]
They must have nothing else of importance at the university to talk about because, you know,

[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.000]
again, they're making it into something much bigger than it is.

[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.560]
He's, this individual has been attempting, uh, I have letters, copies of letters.

[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.240]
He's written the same, Jacobich to Tim Robbie with the dolphins to, um,

[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:23.600]
uh, Tadfoot, the president of the university again, uh, sticking his nose into things that are absolutely none of his business.

[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:30.800]
The university, the university just like anybody else that spends money or has business relationships has a right to do that based on their own decisions

[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.660]
without any help from our friend.

[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:38.560]
Wait, he's, he's trying to make it that the students, um, your show and his new show.

[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.160]
Are you kidding?

[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.060]
Everybody, everybody who listens to your show loves you and our fans.

[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:44.340]
That's not relevant.

[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.200]
If everybody at the university hated the show, we still, they have a right to, you know,

[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.280]
we carry all the UM sports on the station and we'll continue to do so.

[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.840]
Sonny and Joe do a great job with the games and, uh, you know, in life goes on and the university has tickled the death of it, huh?

[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:04.620]
Thompson's trying to, uh, well, I'm aware of that, sir, but I'm trying to explain to you that one man doesn't dictate what everybody else is going to do.

[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.960]
You know, he made that comment and the article I was in yesterday's, how in the L. Die just about, he keeps contacting the sponsors and he just doesn't understand,

[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.560]
they keep advertising on the station.

[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.580]
Well, here we've got an individual who doesn't understand that every time he tells somebody something,

[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:24.860]
they're not going to the world doesn't operate based on what he says, including this program and this radio station and our sponsors and the university of Miami or anybody else.

[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:30.860]
And the only time anybody does respond to it is when they've already got an axe to grind like Sonny Rosenberg and Halendale.

[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.540]
So I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep over it.

[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:33.960]
Good.

[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.280]
Okay. Thanks for having me.

[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.720]
I mean, the university line, I'm not going to retract anything I've said about the U of M. It's like an island.

[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:45.880]
I've said that for ever, ever since I've been in this market, the university of Miami is one of the most peculiar places I've ever encountered.

[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.680]
As far as the university, it's like not even a part.

[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.600]
It's like it's not connected to any other part of this community in any way, shape or form.

[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.680]
And that's unfortunate.

[01:19:55.780 --> 01:20:01.520]
That isn't that isn't to say that there aren't any good people over there or that I don't like the university, but it just happens to be a fact.

[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.940]
And if I say that I don't care for the football program or coach Johnson, I'm entitled to say that.

[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:12.140]
You see, because I said that also letters were sent over there and now he can't say these things and blah, blah, blah.

[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.020]
I hate to break the news to you.

[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:25.000]
You see, it doesn't have anything to do with the content of the programming being sexual or this or that it has to do with the fact that I can't say anything that this individual doesn't approve of in his own mind.

[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:35.060]
And if I want to criticize the university football program, if I want to criticize Don Shula, if I want to criticize Joe Robbie, I have just as much right to do that as anybody else does.

[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:48.680]
So, you know, when you see this pattern of things that go on and makes it clear, it isn't just a question of whether some material we play on here is tasteless or whatever the allegations about senior citizens, it's anything.

[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:56.780]
I mean, you name it whether we're talking about dog food, about U of M football, about anything I can think of.

[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.880]
I don't like talking about the lottery.

[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.760]
Yeah, I, yeah, a lot of me Rebecca Paul.

[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:18.500]
I mean, you know, anybody who can't see through this transparent window of what this really is, a malicious, hateful, outrageous campaign to deprive me of a right to earn a living and to get me off the air on now three consecutive radio stage, you can't see it, then you're blind.

[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:30.920]
Okay, I mean, it goes from even listeners like that poor lady in the church who had the audacity to call in in the air say she and her pastor enjoy the show and when she identified the church as soon as I hung up with her bingo, there goes her phone.

[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:41.500]
And it was only when she threatened to call a state attorney's office and press charges for harassment on the phone that all of a sudden these phone call stop and I have letters from her to back it up.

[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:51.160]
But anyway, be that as it may, we're out of time for this hour and April standing by with the 12 o'clock WIOD news. We'll come back for our number three of 12.

[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:57.880]
5. Steve from to the six sports talk at 605 and I think it's Hurricane baseball tonight, right, 7.30 from our client stadium.

[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.220]
WIOD. What are you doing this afternoon? You got a guest?

[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:19.480]
You believe him? He is. I talked to a most open phones on what's the death of. Okay, we're trying to promote him and he's sitting here just glued to us some nonsense.

[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:28.560]
Anyway, speaking of nonsense, here is a great note again from our friend Adam in Hollywood who writes, dear broadcaster, nearly.

[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:34.640]
I've noticed that both you and your show have been not been using the word grotesque as often as you used to.

[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:43.320]
Would you please start using grotesque or an alternative such as repulsive or slimy? Neil, I'm surprised at you starting to slack off.

[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:50.800]
Here's hoping you have a grotesque day with the slimy bird. Grotesquely yours, Adam Stein and family.

[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:58.960]
P.S., do you know how to say grotesque in Hebrew? I have an acclue. Last sentence there is probably a kick off on Adam. He has an acclue.

[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:07.660]
I think it's probably says it better than anything. Okay, it's 12.07 at WIOD. The Palm Beach line continues to be the one dormant line in the board and we love it, man.

[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:19.600]
We're really ecstatic about it. 655-9463. 655-WIOD, we got a great stack of mail today and the Mr. Disney we understand is drowning in a sea of mail and we thank everybody for it.

[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.140]
But don't become smug and complacent, okay, because that would be really grotesque if you did that.

[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:30.160]
Yeah, we want to. We need your support letters. Yeah, we want the letters to support.

[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:37.220]
Oh, look at this. It just keeps on coming. If there was money in every one of these, then we would be happy to get off the air.

[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:44.220]
Okay, there was enough. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello. How you doing, Neil? Okay. I think Shivurus is grotesque in Hebrew.

[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:49.400]
Yes, Shivurus can be grotesque. Yeah. Although Tisha Bove is grotesque in there.

[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.320]
I used to be Sonny Rosenberg's old next door neighbor when he lived in the back of Golden Island.

[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:01.560]
Wait a minute. Let's rephrase the way you said that because I don't think Sonny could have an old next door neighbor.

[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:05.160]
Yeah, actually my family lived next door. I was in about the eighth grade at the time.

[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:12.940]
And I just wanted to tell Sonny that he was listening. That it was me and my punk friends who always used to steal his fun tapet before he could get at it.

[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:18.600]
You know, he used to come out and yell at us because he was the only one on the whole street to hire other people to come and rake his leaves.

[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:23.420]
So they'd be nice packages and everything like that. We'd ride up by to do it because he was such a mean old man.

[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:33.240]
But I thought it was one of my favorites. I'll tell you that. Yeah. And all those times my parents would tell me and my friends to stop making noise because in the Therosenbergs getting mad, I'm glad we never listened to him.

[01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.460]
Congratulations, sir, for a great pubic service. Thank you.

[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:47.360]
Okay. 1208 at WIOD. We have an open line indeed. 751.9. What am I opening this mail for? I'm never going to get two all of it during the show.

[01:24:47.760 --> 01:25:00.380]
It doesn't make a lot of good noise. I like that. We got a mobile. What is that on the Palm Beach line? Yeah, that's nobody on there. Right. There ain't nobody on there. They disappear. Well, I go to show you what kind of a line that is.

[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:15.760]
Let's be something really like hot about that line. Like when you call in. It makes your phone fry or something. It's kind of like the Ted Bundy line. I guess Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. Well, I just wanted to. I got a good point in the bad point. I want to say.

[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:24.860]
First of all, I like your show and I do think you're getting harassed and you know, especially that howl and Dale thing. But you know, you think everyone is homophobic.

[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:36.740]
Perhaps you're just being a little homo paranoid. Oh, really? I mean, you know, you're seeing people attacking you and you think that it's just, you know, well, maybe one of the main reasons is because.

[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:49.240]
Well, sir, when I've been involved in it for 19 months and when almost every letter that this individual sends out contains lines about my trolling for sex from teenage boys on the air, I think I have a pretty good idea of where this individual is coming from.

[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:59.420]
Although, evidently, you're an expert on the whole situation, right? No, no, no, not an expert at all. I'm just saying, you know, maybe he's just using this. Maybe he really doesn't even care that you're almost saying.

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:08.840]
You know, I disagree with you wholeheartedly, okay? Because if it weren't for that, there wouldn't be any campaign and none of this would have ever happened to sure you would go to the bank on it.

[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:19.080]
I don't know because I personally, I don't really care very much for homosexuals. Really? Yeah, you know, it's just you're some people just don't. I mean, you know, why are you listening to the show?

[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.960]
Because I think you're a funny man. Oh, I see. You know, what difference does it make to you? What other people are doing in their bedroom? Why is that of any interest to you?

[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:39.340]
It is, and actually, but, okay, well, that's a good way to end the call. I think 10 minutes past 12 at WIOD, we have an open line indeed, 751-9463-751-WIOD.

[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:49.580]
The call so far, this hour have been un-believe in credit. It really something. Look at this. Here's a article by Jeff Lemleck. Jeff, Jeffrey?

[01:26:51.380 --> 01:27:00.920]
Do you know who that is? Oh, yeah, he used to be a board ob, but WS News. Through the past, smartly, it's an article about South Florida radio days.

[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:11.680]
And it goes down about the old days of South Florida rock radio, including WCPR, which this station used to be many years ago, Rikjab, Biggie Nevin's, Buddy Holiday.

[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:20.800]
And it says, that cleared the way for the brand new WFU-N today, view at 790 on the dial, Pete Connors, Frank Ward, Jim Tucker, Gary Stevens, Building, Johnny Gilbert, and Danny Dark.

[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:27.920]
Danny Dark? I'm not Danny. I think he means Johnny Dark. He wasn't an FU-N.

[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:39.160]
Oh, he wasn't. The writer of the letter thought he might have made it dark. Danny Dark. Probably same thing. Danny is probably in the dark. Okay, it's 12 minutes past noon. We have an opening on Palm Beach, which continues. Can we just check that line one time?

[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:54.000]
Yeah, I'm sure it's a dial tone, but you never know. Yeah, it is. I feel a lot more comfortable about Palm Beach. Do you even give that out, Steve? And if you even give out Palm Beach number, can I do, um, yeah, can I do my spot for Toyota, Hollywood? Oh, yeah.

[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:05.500]
And I want to refer again to that brilliant call that Steve had yesterday from the young guy who is driving his pickup truck. I hope he has a real good time with this pickup truck out there today. And he was talking about how the Toyota is a woman's car and as smooth lines.

[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:35.480]
I mean, this kid really, you know, I understand how it is to be jealous. Okay, you can't afford a super. You can't even probably afford a Corolla kid. So continue driving your pickup truck. And when you grow up and get to be a real human being, you can go over there and afford one of those hot new beautiful 89 Toyota's like that great silicon convertible at Steve bought Lori or that super turbo, which I'm driving, which is a beautiful automobile with all the extras. I mean, it's so luxurious that it. I mean, it's incredible. Okay, I don't want to start laying it on pal, but that's the way it goes. And I park it right next to my Corvette kid.

[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:52.840]
So it's really tremendous. But anyway, if you want a sensational deal, great selection and super people. I mean, people who are so nice, you're going to just freak out. You'll say, this can't be an auto dealership. I got to be dreaming. They really are tremendous folks to do business with that Toyota of Hollywood 441 between tap and Sheridan streets in Hollywood.

[01:28:52.840 --> 01:29:02.120]
Yeah, I'm really what you're getting. Man, I bet it's Steve. It's just that you see this light when he gets into business, man, he's really going to be dangerous on the air that last, but that was good.

[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.040]
Now, see, we, in fact, that fits in with our new format. We're going to come back after each break and be in the middle of a sentence.

[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:16.080]
And it freaks the audience out because then they wonder what they missed. Okay. It's kind of like last night wore downy show where everything will bleep down. I'm serious. I've never in my life seen a show.

[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:22.920]
It got to the point where like for about a five minute period every third or fourth word was bleep bleep. You know, there were just silence here.

[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:26.820]
And you knew and you could see some of the words that were saying formed with the lips. You know, sure.

[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:38.640]
As in prick your finger things. Exactly. It was shocking to me. But then again, I don't live in a major metropolitan market like Houston or Dallas because they're so sophisticated over there.

[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:45.280]
Okay, let's move right along here to another sophisticated community sunrise. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you?

[01:29:45.280 --> 01:30:00.440]
Okay. Neil, I'm a former Rochesterian. I'll be darned. And I had my daughter here last three weeks. And she saw your picture either on television or on a paper. Yeah. And she says, I know that guy. Really? Yeah.

[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:11.660]
She says, I went to school with him at Brighton High. No, well, I didn't go to Brighton High went to Brighton Elementary. Well, that's what she said, Brighton. And she's a see around the arena drive.

[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:30.420]
Did you live drive? I lived on a arena drive. Are you serious? Yeah. Oh my God. What's her name? Marsha, Marsha Cone. I can't believe this boy. That is incredible. That's a long time ago, boy. It's like from another lifetime. Yeah. She's such a used to see it down a barbed in the crossroad. Yeah.

[01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:59.940]
And the other day you were talking about baseball. Yes, I used to broadcast baseball from Miami University. Right for six years. Well, Mel, what's a great Mel Allen? Mel Allen said the best radio broadcaster for baseball was a fellow, but named a gunner wig. You ever heard gunner wig? No, that's I've heard the name, but that's before I was born. He was in Rochester. Really? W. H. M. Yeah.

[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:29.920]
He was the best of every word. You remember Tom Decker? Yes. And you know, Jack Buck used to work in Rochester too. Did the Red Wing games? Yeah. Tom Decker, he's, while he was through with TV about 10, 12 years ago. Yeah, he's been working somewhere else now, I think. There's a really good looking guy. He's a nice guy. That's a lot of it. And have you been to birth, cottage? Sure. And I'm what have you? Yes, I have. And we used to be members there. I was the bar mitzvah, the temple Beth Sholum, which I'm sure everybody's excited about. That is correct. That is correct.

[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:39.040]
Yeah. And I've been to temples around here, but there isn't any temple around here that compares to birth, cottage.

[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:44.920]
Let me say this, it would be a big help if they'd stop letting the goyam in the temple here. It's just too many goyam. That's the whole thing.

[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:53.120]
If they let a few Jews in the temple, it might be a little more uplifting. I suppose so. I mean, when they bring out the holy water in the cross, that's when I just can't deal with that.

[01:31:53.120 --> 01:32:02.540]
Listen, it's great hearing from you and give my regards to Marsha. That's tremendous. Yes. Yes. And I had more to say, but I'll call you later.

[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:14.160]
Okay, drop me a note sometime. I'd love to get in touch with you. Drop me a card or a letter. Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye bye. That's incredible. Just the other day I had a long hour chatted home with my friend Bob Pearlman from Michigan State.

[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:23.060]
I think I would go home on a see here we go again. Okay. Now some Schmerrill, some redneck from Lakeland called it. Oh, hey, buddy. Let's talk about ABC. Look, or never.

[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:32.940]
But if I get somebody from Rochester or Michigan State who calls in right away, so let me just listen to this. Let me say this. Balance. Let me say this to you in all sincerity.

[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:42.020]
The last time I checked the name of the show was the near Rogers show. Okay. Now I was born and raised in upstate New York. It's one of my great interests.

[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:53.100]
I went to school in Michigan State. Why didn't really go to school because I never went to class. But I attended briefly Michigan State for a couple of years. And I worked in Michigan for 12 years. Those are two important parts of my life.

[01:32:53.660 --> 01:33:04.860]
Now when it becomes the Glen Hill show at that point, we can talk about Lakeland at great length. We can even invite Captain Dave over to talk about Milton, which I think we could probably do what four or five minutes on that.

[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:19.300]
I don't do it. Don't you think I would be in the face of it? Don't you think I would be in the face of it? You have to see you have all that material in front of you. Have all these papers. Those are good times for you to catch up on your homework.

[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:34.200]
Rather than getting surly and bad out of your pushing the microwave, making banging, you know, that was accident. Yeah. I noticed that. Well, my problem was he kept saying and that's what kind of correct. Correct. In fact, you notice he had a lot more to talk about.

[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:47.520]
I kind of sure I didn't want to make it ponderous. Although I would be delighted to have him call back and we can do the rest of the show on it. You can get a head start on the weekend. Don't you. Don't you think I would love to talk about child to childhood friends of mine?

[01:33:47.520 --> 01:34:03.740]
Now, here's a, but that's incredible. I went to school with Marsha. How would you recognize me? That's got to be, let's see, elementary school is through what seventh grade? A sixth grade. I went to sixth grade in Brighton. So that's like about 11 or 12 years old. And here she recognized me.

[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:13.940]
I can't believe it. That's incredible. I think it's great. But it frighten me because after every sentence, there came a big long A and D. That is correct.

[01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:25.060]
Every time these letters and cards, by the way, are sensational. And we appreciate them very much. I'm just opening my mouth. Here's one even addressed to you, which I'm sorry I couldn't have handed during that call.

[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:40.640]
I know you're keeping you keep you very busy and you wouldn't have gotten so serally. Okay. He gets very upset. Oh, yeah, we would love some fruit. Wouldn't you like some fruit? Sure. You know what I like are those seedless grapes, man. I love that because I'm really going to have a big week on nutrition system. I don't want to let

[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:50.600]
us blend in Susan down again. Well, look at this here from actually from Palm Beach County. We're getting some letters to how do you like that? That's it. Open it up and bang the mic around a little bit.

[01:34:50.940 --> 01:35:09.380]
It's difficult to open. I like making all this noise. Okay. Let's go to a mobile on 95. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. What's your prediction on the immerse first of being a conductor tonight? Oh, great. I think the immerse by two goals. Probably. Okay. I wanted to bet that one. I just wanted to make sure. Hey, listen, I'm driving on 95 and I'm passing by magic here.

[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:23.120]
And I don't know if the rumors true on Larry Camp, but I see a six foot chair being delivered right now coming out of the van. Oh, my gosh. I just got a copy of a letter. Oh, boy.

[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:33.160]
I just got a copy of a letter in regard to the Helen Dale thing that is just going to frost. It's going to drive people up the wall. Well, hang up and let you read it. Thanks a lot. Bye.

[01:35:33.620 --> 01:36:03.140]
Now, I'm not going to read the letter per se, but when you see this during the break, this is like you remember when Nixon was in all a hot water and watergate was going on. And then they finally got that one tape and they called the smoking gun. Sure. And as attorney threatened to resign if he didn't release the tape. Well, here's the smoking gun letter that somebody sent me a copy of the city of Halondale Council. Right. Oh, boy. And guess who sent the letter? Uh huh. And you know, the interesting part of it is I want to make this very clear. The young man who called for the

[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:32.920]
University of Miami was all upset about the letter or the article on the front page again because it's an article in a publication like the hurricane. Again, it's a legitimate news story. Okay. Sure. So and there will be more news stories because I have some appointments to interview with some other people and the news stories are going to continue. And as the news stories do continue. We'll be able more and more to discuss, according to that, even assuming that agreement with his valid, which most of us don't think it is. But even if it were, we'll be able to discuss these things because it does make the exception where there is a legitimate news story. We can.

[01:36:32.920 --> 01:37:02.860]
We can always discuss it. And certainly the city of Halondale thing is a very legitimate news story. It's been in the major newspapers, et cetera, in Dayton, Broward counties. And here is a copy of the letter, which was sent to the Halondale City Council. I thought it was commission myself. But, um, and it's interesting. Here's a long list of sponsors of this program. Oh, this is going to be very, very interesting. And I thank the senior citizen in Halondale who passed this along. I appreciate it very much. It's 10, 12 23.

[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:32.840]
I'm going to tell you something. I'm reading these six allegations made in this letter by this attorney to the city of Halondale. They are so outrageous and so ridiculous and everything that's in here is twisted by the intent. Everything that was said was in humor. And each of these things has been written in the book.

[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:45.940]
It has been taken and suggesting that it was said seriously by me on this program very seriously. It is incredible. Okay. There is also here a list of sponsors of this program.

[01:37:48.360 --> 01:38:00.400]
Local businesses that know the content of Roger show, which includes trolling for teenage boys playing filthy songs and other recordings illegally and criminally targeting citizens for death threats,

[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:29.700]
bomb threats and other harassment have supported the show financially. And here is a list. Oh boy. This is the smoking gun, even Richard Nixon himself would be doing a tap dance over this. Okay. And again, thank the gentleman in Halondale who sent that along to me. Okay. We have an open line in Bokka at 278 9463 278 W I O D in one in Palm Beach 655 9463 655 W I O D.

[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:58.220]
Shocking. What is this incredible Miami. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good. Hi. Do you have a request? Request? Yeah. I just can't wait. What's the crank request, sir? The air told 95. Is that it, sir? Is that the best? Is that the best you can do? That's all. What? That's not all. It's okay. Go have your metamusal power. Will you please get lost?

[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:25.100]
This is the same guy who called on Steve show a couple of days ago with the gutterall sound. We have an open line in date County 7519463 751 W I O D. Meanwhile, let's move to Halondale. Hello. Yes. Dale. Yeah. I just saw the commission meeting on Channel 25. They played to take back. They played it again. Oh, today do a number on your buddy.

[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:55.020]
On. Unbelievable. How do you think it was today? I think it was. No, I just I just turned it off. One person. Well, I don't know what it was. Why don't you tell us what it what it was? What the tape? What you saw. Basically what they said in that letter. That you just received from a guy about the bomb threats. How the turning I will not mention his name. He has been over at Gulf Stream. Trying to pull the sponsorship off.

[01:39:55.100 --> 01:40:15.120]
W I O D with with obvious great success. Right. I mean it goes on and nine and nine and nine. But one commissioner Cohen. He's playing the Halondale song. And he's like leading the orchestra. It was a hand. That one. It's all over towards the end of the meeting. He says this is terrible. You know, we've got to do something about this. I mean, just on.

[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:24.760]
They're really trying to do a number up here on you. Okay. Well, don't don't lose any sleep over. I'm not going to. I'm behind you 100% I'm not losing any either. Good man.

[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:41.040]
Okay. Thank you. 12 30 at W I O D. We have an open line in Broward. 524 9463 524 W I O D. Yeah. This stuff is really terrible. Man that Halondale vice. Oh God. And Halondale vice to now, which is even adds more frosting to the old cake. So to speak.

[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:52.840]
But like I said, we've got the smoking gun right here. And boy, it is just phenomenal. I think the gentleman who sent me this letter. I have no idea where he got it. I can't imagine.

[01:40:52.840 --> 01:41:04.260]
But again, you know, it's a letter to the city council. So it's certainly ought to be a matter of public record. I just can't imagine where he got it. But I'm just. I don't think he realizes what a tremendous help he has provided to us.

[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:21.340]
Just trying to create as much problem for this radio station in this company as he possibly can. And just trying to find any sympathetic ear that he can for this malicious witch hunt of his. Okay. That's that's the bottom line.

[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:29.640]
Miami. Hello. Couple things. Yeah. How does this guy earn a living? I haven't got any ideas. It's a very excellent question.

[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:37.360]
Is your competitors paying or what? I haven't got any idea how you're in the living. No idea. Apparently just tapes the show and then edits the show at night. Yeah.

[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:44.860]
And then just goes responses during the well now that Steve is on the list. He's got to when it was on. I. N. Z.

[01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:54.640]
He was taping Steve Stan show. I have an only has to tape Steve show as well. Now what that was that we were just hearing there. I have no idea.

[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:00.620]
But I'm considered the story really does make you think about someone's life with a life.

[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:09.480]
Call 31 to W. I. D. And opening in day 7519463 Palm Beach continues to be dormant. This is this is probably the worst day on a Palm Beach line since we've been on a station.

[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:17.360]
I mean I think we've had like two calls on there in the whole show which is okay. But I just don't know like you said it could be dropping a metamusual bombs on Palm Beach.

[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:31.240]
You know people up there for just a lost cause. Yeah. Oh look at this. Here's equal time for Glenn. Here's somebody in Tamarack. Hello. Hi. Hi. This is the first time I'm calling. But I think this is a very important issue here.

[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:44.180]
I went to school with Glenn. We attended PCC and FAU together and I think and I think a lot of people don't realize that Glenn has a degree in. He's you know been in boycasing for many years.

[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:56.680]
I'm just sitting around as your side. Yeah. Well it is hard to relate to that. I'm so Glenn doesn't remember me. My name is Rita Rita. I do remember you. I'm in public relations now.

[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:13.700]
I guess you had Steve Craig also and we yeah. Dr. really hopped in Dr. Craig. Right. You know and in fact I did a paper on it and paid paper. And we realize how important it is that we protect these rights. Yeah that's true.

[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:43.200]
And I don't want to leave nail out. I lived in Buffalo and I lived in Rochester. You're just an all around. Yeah. Great with us. Yeah. My ex husband went to Eastman dental Center in Rochester. We lived at the University Rochester in Whipple Park. But we don't want to talk about. We really turned this. We want to make everyone equal here. We're talking about FAU. Okay. You have a great day. Okay. Bye. Now that was nice. It was nice and equal. We have an open line in Broward now. 5249463.

[01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:52.380]
524WYOD. And if you're looking for a different and exciting night of entertainment tonight for the whole family come out to pop it. The number you have reached.

[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.780]
Has been changed. Can you number? Yes.

[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:12.540]
Please make a note of it. I show will 1237 23 till one Steve has opened phones. And in sports talk at 605. I don't know if we got baseball tonight or not.

[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:42.220]
I don't know. Dorothy was in here and she said I'm not sure who we're doing a game and she was going to check on it and she never came back. What happened to Dorothy? Did somebody did she steal my car and took off with it? Boy. I think we planted some ideas. Any will find out. I know the hurricanes are planted at 730. But we will find out. Right. Yeah. I think somebody. Oh, I guess I shouldn't mention that because you know. Yeah. I know. That's what I was a university of Miami and hurricanes. Exactly. Anyway, we'll take a. Mobile in Palm Beach. Hello. Hello. He has my horn.

[01:44:42.780 --> 01:45:12.160]
Great. I want to let you know I've been listening to you. I'm an occasional spy. The name is now and I call and went to the oil. A lot of listeners up here as a matter of fact. I own a small company. I employ nine people. Six of which are over 65 years of age. And all those blue hero. All parts love your show. I anticipate the radio station be a bunch during the day when they work and they wouldn't come to work. I think at this point that they were listening to you. You have more support than you could possibly realize. Thank you. I appreciate it. Tinkle, tinkle. Bye. Bye. Bye. Now we don't have Keynes baseball tonight.

[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:42.140]
And I think the reason being that Keynes basketball tomorrow night is in Chicago. They're playing at DePaul. And as a result, sunny in the share and Joe will be there, right. Yes, sir. I did more play. I would be. It's not what I just said. So we're not carrying again. I mean, I'll be happy to go over and do the game. I think I probably could because I did it for six years, but I could probably go over and do it. But we will just we just won't do it. Okay.

[01:45:42.140 --> 01:46:11.520]
Because that would get somebody in the gables upset. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. How long has he been here? Just like this. We're sure time I bring him back in here. Anyway, it's 12 39. I don't want to scare him. You know, right off the first week. Please. 21 till. Don't please. Don't. Don't want. Oh, I see. Now, do we have a double set of standards here or what? Yeah. Yeah. Now, April, you're getting to sound like our friend. Okay. And the game. I think that's a little.

[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:41.440]
No, you're getting to sound just a little. You know how it starts? It starts like like a serious disease with a little cough. Yeah. Starting to sound just like some other folks. We know it's okay. If April comes in here or. Gail or anybody else and you you're just absolutely falling all over them. But if I just make a comment that we have this intern here, it happens to be a fine young man. But I legal age, but we don't want to get anybody upset. Right. To be fair, it gets mentioned when I do that too. I'm the less. Oh, it's wrong with that.

[01:46:41.440 --> 01:47:11.180]
We make a joke out of it. We don't say stop. Now you would agree that our young friend there in the newsroom. Our intern is a very charming young man. Wouldn't you? Yeah. See, sharing agrees. She knows I have impeccable. Take nice. Just a nice guy. I don't want to scare him. But people will never guarantee he'll never come back and have to do. Did you give this to the appropriate authorities? Great. Boy, you're just on top of it. You know, and it's amazing. She's still got the handcuffs on. That's an incredible part.

[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:40.800]
Okay. It's 1240 20.01 at W I O D. See, I've tried to explain this to you folks before. I evolve people not to understand. I understand. When somebody expresses the fact, I mean this thing, I mean, the fact that most of us would like to be really good looking. Okay. I don't know anybody who wants to be ugly like most of us are. In fact, when you go into a shopping mall, you'll see most of the people are either they're like average to ugly. You know, if you had a Richter scale, right? Wouldn't you agree with that? And that's why the people are exceptionally good looking. They stand out.

[01:47:41.180 --> 01:48:11.160]
I know. If everybody looked the same, if everybody looked great, then relatively speaking, nobody would look great. Follow me. Or am I making you confusing? I'm not. So when you see somebody who's really pleasant looking, I don't want to get into a whole thing. Somebody looks good. And you say it. That's not a big song. And a dance. It's a compliment. You said people will become insecure because somebody that doesn't mean necessarily that they want to jump on your bones and make wild passion. It love and do things all of they might. Yeah. And all you say is I don't want to scare him.

[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:19.100]
And I said, please don't. That's all I said. Please don't. Look, he's been around. He understands. It's just a radio show. Okay. It's just a radio show.

[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:29.360]
Can I go running out of the chair and run up there and put my arm around his waist and kiss him passionately on the on the cheek? No. No. Not yet.

[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:46.740]
Anyway, it's how 41 he is going to get upset. It's just a radio show. No, get nervous. It's just one of those things. It's just that we work with so many ugly people that on those rare occasions, when we see anybody who looks even human, we get nervous. Okay. That's why when April comes in here, she generally winds up trying to rearrange your clothing on the way.

[01:48:46.740 --> 01:49:06.920]
And that gets mentioned anyway. Let's move along to Miami. Hello. Hey, howdy. Howdy. How you doing? But what's happening? Dude, how's going? Hey, pal? When is the show going to get back to what it was before this stuff came up? Well, what do you mean by that? Yeah, because all this last couple of days has been about. Hey, let me, let me tell you something. Okay.

[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:18.440]
In the beginning of the show, I went on a great, I went on a great length about the more downy junior show last night, which does have some relationship to this other thing because they were talking about so called schlock radio and TV and about community standards.

[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:32.040]
But I mean, we've had like two calls of people who saw the show and that's it. And Joey was here yesterday and we talked him about being on there. We promoted it. And this audience is into this thing. I mean, this is, you've got to understand this is not a minor drop in the bucket. This thing.

[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:45.100]
I know it's been going on for 19 months. We haven't been able to talk about it at all in the past. And now that it's a legitimate new story all over the place. Now we, you know, we've got a different situation and people want to discuss it. This is exciting, sir. You can't get into it.

[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:56.720]
Oh, no, I'm getting into it. But I'm getting to the point where I want to get back to what we used to be doing. Yeah, let it happen. I'll tell you the sooner it'll happen is when these people, including this one individual and the city commissioner in

[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:05.320]
Hall and they'll understand that they can't act as little dictators and coerce us in the saying and doing only what they approve of. Okay. That's not how the medium works.

[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:14.380]
Oh, he never thought how to do that. Right. Does he? No, he does it. Oh, okay. I just wanted to check with you. I'm not real intelligent. But what does here? So what does almost for me?

[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:25.040]
Somebody who is hateful or fearful or both of homosexuals. Okay. Now I got to clear it up. Okay. Now I need to call somebody. Do you think please let me? Yes, sir.

[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:36.640]
Spiro you go ahead and narrow mind it back. What did monster? You are a superior. Okay, but other than that is okay. Yeah, if you get it, yeah, okay. Have a nice day.

[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:47.100]
You did so well. I wouldn't want you to score. Okay. You really did a beautiful job. You got all the good ones in there and you just didn't step over the line. 1244 at WIOD. We have an open line in day.

[01:50:48.680 --> 01:51:03.220]
751 9463 751 WIOD. It's a very exciting day because we now have the smoking gun letter, which is incredibly inflammatory and outrageous. And again, as usual, taking things that I've said and twisting them and distorting them. And you could do this to any comic.

[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:32.160]
You could do it to any Murphy to Don Rickles to Richard prior to anybody who does humor, certainly to Howard Stern to those guys in Houston to Tanner to almost any controversial radio or TV person out of your comic that I can think of that talks about actual issues and things. Sure. And who does satire. Yeah. And oh, here's what they said. And they met it. You know, and always is though it's intended seriously and not in humor. The perfect example is David Letterman. I mean, oh, yeah.

[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:58.400]
What you could do with incredible, incredible, absolutely moving right along. Helen Dale. Hello. Hello. My name is Jaime. Catch and present of a group called concerns citizens of Helen Dale. Oh, what a phony voice. I mean, yeah, what a phony. Can't you do a better phony voice? This is my voice. I'm sorry. No, it's not your voice. I'm not. Now do a real voice. Do it. Do a different. Do a different voice. I mean, come on. This is my boy Chinese voice. Okay. I'm rooting everyone. Okay.

[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:58.520]
Yeah.

[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:21.660]
Call 45 at WIOD. We have an open lie in Palm Beach, which is very unusual. 655 9463. I'm going to give this Palm Beach line one more time. And then I'm no seriously. It doesn't really make a big difference because all the other lines have been lit all day. But it's almost like it's intentional. You know, I mean, it's almost like they're organized up there. Like they're going to ignore us. Come hell or high water.

[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:30.480]
655 WIOD. I realized Lee Fawhrers got the collectibles guy on again today. And we can't compete with that. But it got to be a few stragglers up there somewhere.

[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:49.260]
There are those plantation. Hello. Come here. A line checker. Yes. Hi, Neil. Yes. I listen last night, but I didn't understand half the things that were said. Well, it was a horrible show. Yes. Definitely. I heard from Lord of Dale, mentioned in California and text.

[01:52:49.260 --> 01:53:05.780]
Yeah, with a banjo on their knee, but nothing made sense to me. Well, that's more down. You don't understand that's his show. Well, I've seen the show, but last night it was impossible. And then I wanted to get back to non-slanting and find out what they picked up that.

[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:17.460]
That yeah, yeah. Yeah. I switched back and it's still when they put the two fingers up. I don't know what that means.

[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:47.300]
Which two fingers were there. That's what I'm trying to do. Yeah, look down. The fourth or the second and third better watch yourself not govern yourself accordingly. Well, that was I was worried about. Yeah, I didn't see it. I forgot all about not slanting last night. Well, nothing happened. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah. See, not planning is one of those shows. You can miss four or five weeks and then come back and get right in the swing of it again. Right. And then I got involved with Dynastie. Oh, boy. And then I went back to the Democrat. Oh, God.

[01:53:47.300 --> 01:54:00.220]
But they're getting to agree. I don't know what's going to happen with that. The new one. Well, it gets down to those school. Yeah, it's a hell of a life. Everything so much stuff.

[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:09.420]
I know. That's why more down he show was it was. It may not have made sense, but it was timely because it was so confusing and I stepped in it fit right in with everything else. Yeah, well, what happened with

[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:25.400]
the first turn? Is he finished now? Is he finished? I don't think so. He's probably got another 20 30 million to make before he's finished. Well, I didn't need that. I mean, he's a deal with New York. No, he's not always I thought you told you that. No, I

[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:35.440]
thought I heard that. No, he's not off the day. He wasn't on a show last night because he doesn't do those group encounters like that. In addition to which he comes off very badly on TV. You know,

[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:38.880]

[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:29.460]

[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:35.460]
to the director's office yeah the calls breaking up we're gonna bad so

[01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:40.940]
yeah I'll try to prove it there you go that's better now yes better okay I pulled

[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:44.000]
over to we're just out of the road I was called to the director's office this

[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000]
morning and I was presented with a reprimand for insubordination towards

[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.360]
mr. intendo land towards our public works director because we supported you

[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:56.140]
really I'm trying to get to want to get out of the office I'm gonna go to one of

[01:56:56.140 --> 01:57:00.120]
these places where they have a fact and I'm gonna back to it to you and basically

[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.700]
what they're doing is they're asking for my resignation or I'll be facing

[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:08.880]
the small charges just let you know what kind of a dictatorship we have going

[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:11.980]
here well isn't that interesting I think when we get that on the fax machine we'll

[01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:15.180]
send a copy along to our attorney norm canton perhaps he would like to a

[01:57:15.180 --> 01:57:19.080]
contact the city of Halendale on your behalf and suggest that that kind of

[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:22.920]
fascism is inappropriate that you're even no matter what your position is you're

[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:26.520]
still entitled to your own free opinion I really would appreciate now this is

[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.100]
because you called in and said that this was the call about the emergency

[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:38.020]
telephone's being tied up in Halendale is that the call no I'm I'm a supervisor

[01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:43.360]
with a department of public works and even though I called with total and I

[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:46.500]
didn't want to be known and somebody recognized me and they even played a

[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:50.400]
recording back to the director and he confronted me and I go yes I did call

[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:53.600]
and that's I like to voice my opinion I think it's my right because that's what

[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:57.420]
I believe in and he goes that you know you can have serious charges but

[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.660]
against you because that's the support nation to our county manager and to

[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:07.740]
our our city manager rather and our mayor and your director in general go well

[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:11.820]
that's the way I feel so this morning like I said I walked in I had a memo to go

[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:15.020]

[01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:19.740]
reprimand incredible well nice to know the kind of folks that we're dealing

[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:22.960]
with over there just to let you know that we still back you up a hundred percent

[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.120]
and I got a meeting this afternoon at five o'clock what a rep from the ACLU on

[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.880]
this case excellent great go get them okay thank you very much good luck great

[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.980]
show and keep going thanks a lot isn't that something sure is it's really

[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:40.040]
seriously it sounds like we're dealing with the Joseph Gerberal School of

[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:44.980]
Broadcasting here the really getting more and more dictatorial yes and the

[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:47.260]
you know those people say well why don't we get back to the regular show and

[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:51.080]
while we keep talking about these things you know it's this mentality you know

[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:54.560]
the seeds that are planted with this kind of mentality are what leads to the

[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:58.220]
kind of thing that this world has been through over and over again and you just

[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:01.480]
don't sit back and let people start picking and choosing what you can say and

[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:07.400]
who can say what and when they can say it it's unacceptable yes man you need

[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:11.060]
that oh great that's another class ago yeah we could write a we could write a

[01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:15.100]
book with all the community Cays that are going back and forth all over the

[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:20.120]
place all of the smoking gun this is sensational this is incredible Miami

[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:26.400]
hello well Neil yes yeah I'm calling me University of Miami student and I mean

[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:31.200]
this whole situation scares me to death what this one guy can do I know yeah it

[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:35.560]
is amazing how one person can create through just a ceaseless never-ending

[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:41.320]
malicious campaign can create so much havoc and nuisance that it just almost

[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:46.200]
you know if you weren't involved in it you would never believe it yeah I have

[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:49.720]
been new on work for the Miami hurricane although I wasn't involved in the

[01:59:49.720 --> 01:59:52.420]
article they came in but I saw the letter this guy wrote which I guess you're

[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:57.460]
aware of yeah what yeah this guy what this guy wants to do this guy who's not a

[01:59:57.460 --> 02:00:00.740]
man hold one second the gentleman had just called us from Hallendale Norm

[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:05.240]
Kent would like to speak to him and he can call Norm it's in Broward 763

[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:11.200]
1900 763 1900 normal would be very happy to University of Miami to totally

[02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:16.660]
disassociate with your show and I guess I was in general most guys not a student

[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:20.580]
of you of him he's not a faculty member well again keep in mind that he wrote

[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:24.320]
his letter to the city of Hallendale he lives in Coral Gables okay now what in

[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:27.480]
the world has city of Hallendale government got to do with someone who live in

[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:30.860]
the Gables other than the fact that we play a couple of pieces of musical

[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:35.520]
pieces on a year that are satirical spooch of Hallendale yeah another thing is

[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.300]
I don't know if you read the hurricane article no I haven't seen it written as a

[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:43.560]
news article and it wasn't opinion injected into the article however it was very

[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:47.660]
biased towards the side well no question about it because as I said this kid who

[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:51.840]
wrote it that I talked to the other day he said to me well you know I heard you

[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:56.100]
last week take a couple of shots at the university I said so what about it I

[02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:59.280]
said isn't a free country I've been taking shots at the university for years

[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:02.840]
and I just said it again today the university is like an island and it's

[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:07.380]
unfortunate but it is a true and everybody I talked to when the conversation

[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:11.740]
comes up they agree I've never had anybody disagree with that statement yeah

[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:17.520]
and an even scarier thing is if they come out with this the opinion right the

[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:21.600]
um editorial opinion policy of the hurricane I don't know if they're gonna write

[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:26.600]
this but it's essentially signing with him I mean I just feel it's unbelievable

[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:30.960]
well especially you know you usually think of of campus news people as being

[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:35.100]
liberal or progressive or open-minded and you know I think the fact that what

[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:38.860]
you're telling me is true indicates that what I've said about the university is

[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:43.100]
yeah well I tend to be stuffed shirts and right wing and you know not what you

[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:46.460]
usually expect in the college campus quite the opposite yeah why I'm gonna say

[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:49.720]
one other thing is I said the other day if Ron Fraser and the other

[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:52.860]
people in the sports department they're headed to pen on support from the

[02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:56.920]
student body for the success of their programs they would equit play in baseball

[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:00.360]
20 years ago at the U of M okay well along with the that's the kind of

[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:03.700]
support they have that's right and that's another reason that the football team

[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:07.220]
has such poor attendance because you know while the rest of the community is

[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:10.740]
wishy-washy to begin with if the student body would support it the way they do

[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:14.080]
on other college campuses they'd have that stadium filled every ballgame or

[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:17.100]
close to why I have what I would say before is I happen to be an opinion writer

[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:20.920]
for the hurricane although I'm not involved in the overall papers editorial

[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:26.240]
policy and also a liberal writer and it's you know in the hate mail I get the

[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:30.480]
the havoc just my normal liberal articles call yeah well you have to remember a

[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:33.360]
lot of the kids of U of M a tremendous percentage of them come from a very

[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.720]
well-to-do families who tend to be very politically conservative and you know

[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:41.340]
they're into this yuppie thing and all of that kind of stuff and it's not the

[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:44.420]
kind of political activism that you still see on a lot of other college

[02:02:44.420 --> 02:02:48.040]
campuses you just won't find it there yeah no you know one thing I like to say is

[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:51.880]
I'm not I generally don't listen to your program not just I like or just like

[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.160]
it just because I don't have the time so yeah losing your program wouldn't

[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.780]
leave a void in my life but just the thought that one person could do this you

[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:03.280]
know really scares me yeah and it's some you know another point I'd like to make

[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:07.740]
is I don't think anyone could deny that your brand of humor is a sense of

[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:11.160]
the some people well I think that I think that everybody who does this kind of

[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:14.520]
humor in somebody but I think the big difference is even though you're offensive

[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.760]
and even some of your things could even be deemed racist I don't think you

[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:23.260]
perpetrate hate I think there's a big difference okay I appreciate it hang

[02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:26.640]
in there I will you tune me out thanks a lot okay we're at the end of the

[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.720]

[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:57.280]
Steve colors early here and keep it accusing us you notice that when Steve gets cranked calls

[02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:01.480]
he keeps accusing our people of you know holding over later but I notice is it gets closer to two

[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:06.520]
o'clock every day we start getting some of the mouth breathers for lottery hello

[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:11.560]
our goal meal yes sir how are you okay I hope I can rate as high as that last call yeah he was

[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:19.200]
really good wanting first I like to voice my support for you I've been listening you for a few

[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:25.360]
years now and I can't believe that this is continuing I can't either so join a club it's it's

[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:31.040]
shocking and you know what's even scarier is that this this individual was almost a

[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:36.200]
elected public official of ours well let's not say almost you got you got a significant number of

[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:41.680]
votes but you know 70 to 30 percent is not what you called your close election that's that's too

[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.840]
close for my comfort yeah that's true that's a way too close for my comfort I mean if this

[02:08:46.840 --> 02:08:54.360]
individual can wreck havoc like he's been doing on as a private citizen you can imagine as a

[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:57.820]
public official what kind of leverage he would have well that's a good point you know the thing

[02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:01.480]
that's fascinating is that the public got very little information I think the median is

[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:08.420]
time today horrendous job and they often do a horrendous job when people you know come forward and

[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:13.200]
they run for public office especially people are relatively obscure I think the public's got a

[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:18.420]
hell of a lot right right to know a lot more about these people in just a little blurb somewhere

[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:23.340]
and then an editorial which is basically what happened in that case I mean being the state attorney

[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:28.140]
and any county in this state is a powerful position and I think that the public had so little

[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:32.960]
information and background in this person I think is is deplorable in the newspapers especially

[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:38.080]
I should be chastised for they did a horrendous job you're right they should have done to him what

[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:42.620]
they did to Gary Hart well I'm not saying they should and you know I'm not putting it in that

[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:46.280]
perspective but they certainly should have given us some background and information you're absolutely

[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:51.220]
right and that's that's the whole point to that whole thing well like Don Tower yeah and in any case

[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:56.780]
I hope you stick it to this guy like he deserves to be stuck okay but did you catch the president

[02:09:56.780 --> 02:10:02.040]
speech last night no I don't you know I don't need no dose you don't need no it does it was

[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:08.720]
funny he got to one funny guy yeah he got to one part in his speech he was talking about taking

[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:14.440]
care of those that are in the shadow of life and immediately the cameras pan the clock pepper oh

[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:19.020]
boy it was I mean I thought for sure you were programming that I'm surprised that didn't play the

[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:23.680]
four seasons standing in the shadows of love right okay great wait wait great yeah moving along

[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:29.000]
grand four tops but yeah go ahead what did I say the four tops and well I'm trying to read into

[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.660]
what I need grapes and walk in shoe gum and we're talking about the president it's fine here to help

[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:38.980]
my jury Ford syndrome yes sir grand after watching the presidential speech I realize that that

[02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:45.640]
maniac mercenary that's on Zeta in the morning yeah is absolutely wrong Dan Quail is the luckiest man

[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:52.020]
on the sea okay have a great day good day you're out of time well that was key to the WOD let me tell

[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:23.660]
calling you from a long distance of San Francisco and Hawaii next week really oh yeah I'm going

[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:28.500]
on a little vacation have you been to Hawaii before I was there two years ago great we're visiting

[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:33.400]
two other islands this time though mm-hmm I got a little report to you last night I thought it was

[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:39.520]
the funniest show I ever saw on TV during dinner hour 7 30 my family usually likes to watch wheel

[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:45.540]
of fortune with the the Lada Turner there and we decided to do a little bit more of an educational

[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:50.580]
program and watch one of those news stories they had a story they had two stories that I'm just

[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:54.740]
going to tell you real quickly about right now is this was this inside story or outside story uh

[02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:58.820]
gee if it was outside it must have been in the outhouse I'll tell you where they picked this one up

[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:03.700]
from they had a story about a woman a man and a woman that were married and the husband became a

[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:09.720]
woman and now it's her ex-husband but that that friend yeah and then the way of it can we can we

[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.880]
follow the I'm gonna draw a diagram while you're talking all right let me let me go back over

[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.940]
this now I know you guys it's a Friday it's a little beautiful outside but the man and woman were

[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:25.100]
married and now the man is her best friend as a female yeah or anyway and now they're lesbian lovers

[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:29.840]
exactly now you know what she didn't say that she did say that she had sex with a male to test to

[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:34.440]
make sure that everything worked I think but anyway the second story was even better they had a

[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:39.520]
story about the city fathers in Jacksonville which kind of reminded me of this little town in

[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:46.140]
South Brown it called howin Dale the city fathers there in their infinite wisdom decided to ban

[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:52.640]
topless dancing and sewing alcohol in the same establishment so they got around that the

[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:57.880]
carbon is for a little while by having totally new dancing then the city fathers acted real quick

[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:04.700]
on that and then the bar stopped serving alcohol and just soft drinks well they didn't stop it that

[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:10.660]
the city fathers they banned all beverages and all bars from serving where there's topless

[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:17.740]
dancing so the bar on is when I opened up topless car washing places and they they put like these

[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:22.180]
tarpulins around the property and the funny thing is you know how the cameras were showing the

[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:27.720]
girls dancing and they have like this disguising effect where they have like a prism in front of

[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:32.240]
the woman's breath and you can see right through it to where everything was and then they're

[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:36.820]
showing these girls washing the car and what it's both right in front of the windshield of our

[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:42.160]
Volvo you can see everything on the girl and then it blotted out it was so funny well this

[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:46.740]
sure beats wheel of fortune yeah I'm telling you Van is getting Van is getting pretty ponderous you

[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:51.240]
know while my son is seven years old I figured I'd upgrade him from looking at Van every night

[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:57.580]
with our costumes into some real nudity on TV and now he's totally confused the kid asked me this

[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:02.120]
morning again now dad let me get this straight the man and woman were married but now she's a woman

[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:25.000]
and live in boca well so there's a little silver lining inside every dark thing

[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.940]
and when I first came to Fort Lauderdale a couple years ago I lived in boca and I couldn't stand it

[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:33.080]

[02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:32.600]
that first call to come through to the Navy recruiting office right so govern yourselves accordingly

[02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:40.080]

[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:46.500]
hi hey done okay I think so isn't really good now how you done I'm allowing them to say it again okay

[02:16:46.500 --> 02:16:53.500]
well good listen bug is not so bad it can um don't tell you something I saw on TV on this

[02:16:53.500 --> 02:17:00.000]
tape I was watching last night um I was watching the David Letterman anniversary special which

[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.040]
was really funny and anyway in one of the local breaks they had the uh instead of the top 10

[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:11.060]
list channel four had the top five reasons you should stay tuned and watch and watch the news at 11

[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:17.020]
number I remember number three was because you live in Broward and there's snow on that other station

[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:22.920]
so you may as well keep it on four are you serious number two was because Anna as squeak had an

[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:28.520]
interview with Dave and Dave was gonna tell Anna all his intermosed thoughts and the number one

[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:34.840]
reason that you should stay tuned to news four to 11 was if you don't the news four team will

[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:39.880]
sing don't worry be happy you know that there's a promo that they're running on channel four

[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:44.720]
and I think it's in black and white or parts of it are in black and white I'm almost sure

[02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:52.960]
and they show like that the heads of some of the anchors you know what I mean like head in different

[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:58.400]
strange position yeah and Anna squeak in there it looks like she's just crawling out of the sack

[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:02.500]
if you she's turning her head I swear to you it looks like she's in bed or something

[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:09.280]
so there's just no end to what they are doing man and you mark my words the day is coming in this country

[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:15.860]
I was the one predicted years ago that all this schlock stuff that's on now that that would be

[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:21.360]
the mainstream of what people were watching and lo and behold that's what it's become and my next

[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:27.440]
prediction is that sometime it may take a while but you are going to see topless news somewhere could

[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:35.340]
be on cable first yeah but you will see topless news women on TV why not yeah make it'll make

[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:44.280]
you watch they'll do 90 share they'll get great ratings and speaking of Anna as quick Anna to

[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:52.200]
use just kids and on of the speaker isn't it anyway it's 123 at W.I.O.D. and if they if they choose

[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.620]
Terry Miriam and to fill that role we just talk about at least right in your hair out first okay

[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:01.080]
because otherwise you look like River Phoenix and I would be embarrassed I want to tell you about a

[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:07.220]

[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:51.220]
butterflies in my stomach I was upset I it practically brought me to tears really the one you

[02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:55.560]
were yelling at me you know this is a Neil Roger show and maybe I'll start really nice

[02:25:57.540 --> 02:26:02.680]

[02:26:22.260 --> 02:26:28.600]
warm up to whatever is going on don't you understand they're a little bit slow like in Lake Worth

[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:34.280]

now I can't think of no one who would make me mean her then that little old lady from higher lea

[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:06.320]
she crawled and she saw she's a real old boy she's a teller of how there'll be full of art

[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:09.580]
she's a little old lady from higher lea

[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:15.940]
it's a little old lady from higher lea

[02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:21.820]

[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:07.260]

[02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:11.740]
by the way i'm calling from a unicycle with the mobile phone does that count yeah that's that's our

[02:32:11.740 --> 02:32:16.820]
favorite okay you don't know Patrick McGuin do you no i don't you remember you you don't

[02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:21.420]
remember the prisoner the prisoner no that was a series that they've dicks and used to run on

[02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:25.720]
a 51 all the time was a great old there was a head of cult following yeah it was a really bizarre

[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:30.700]
series about this the spy this British spy who was kidnapped and put on this island and given a

[02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:34.880]
number and everything number three number three and anyway the the beginning of the show they

[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:39.500]
always the the symbol was a guy on a unicycle right which has nothing to do with anything but he

[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:43.480]
mentioned i was always into the big bubble but you know that's the big bubble on the beach used to

[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:47.400]
it was like big brother and it would chase you around and you try to escape this it looked like a

[02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:52.160]
giant rubber ball and it would chase you around and envelop you cool cool real cool but anyway

[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:56.620]
i know that's not what you called about well you know i i've listened to anything all right

[02:32:57.820 --> 02:33:02.540]
so anyway so have other than that idiot in the truck that you race with your super have you

[02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:08.420]
race anyone else the idiot in the truck yeah you said you raised someone in the truck who kept

[02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:13.140]
oh no the Cadillac no no they've kid in the Cadillac and by the way there was also a letter from

[02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:18.020]
our favorite friend about that about my going on here and talking about drag racing a young man

[02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:24.940]
in a Cadillac and about how i was out trolling for boys again oh well i mean i'll tell you one

[02:33:24.940 --> 02:33:30.300]
thing of my life was five percent as exciting as this person evidently thinks it is i would just be

[02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:35.080]
i would have time to do the show well i guess they failed to mention the good things about you know

[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:39.000]
the station like you know raising the money for the car now there there are no such good thing don't

[02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.480]
you understand we don't do anything that's right or anything that's good well that's one of the

[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:46.240]
reasons i'm laid back because everyone looks at the bad and not the good that is correct especially

[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:51.480]
when you live here sure okay listen cheer up a little bit have a great weekend see you five

[02:33:51.480 --> 02:34:00.400]
144 W I O D we have an open line indeed 751 9463 751 W I O D and we've really we said a lot of

[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:04.380]
records today we had our first call from a pickup truck on a mobile phone we had our first call

[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:10.780]
from a unicycle on a mobile phone well close and what we had several call i think the most calls

[02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:16.820]
ever from university amymie students that no question what was it three yeah and that is absolutely

[02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:22.320]
i got news for him and when we get three calls from the uofm and that's that is so monumental

[02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:27.560]
i mean it's just incredible i'm shocking i can't get over it i don't know because like i said i

[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:32.360]
mean there are a lot of nice kids over there don't get me wrong but it's just um not what you

[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:37.440]
call your real activist place it's not a hotbed of real student activity you know what i'm saying

[02:34:38.900 --> 02:34:44.360]
it's like cruising and snoozing i think basically what it's all about over there just just

[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:51.240]
not a real active progressive exciting bunch you know never has been very um snooty um

[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:56.220]
but again i'm i'm generalizing and we shouldn't do that should we sure we should okay here's a

[02:34:56.220 --> 02:35:01.600]
mobile in bokeh hello okay good call i like those mobile calls that hang on all that time and then

[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:06.160]
as soon as you punch them up they hang up now that's really worth it isn't it to spend well maybe

[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:11.320]
they couldn't hear it on their car radio uh for waterdale hello how you doing i just want to come

[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:20.520]
to the defense of all the Toyota Supra turbo cars that are out there i bought mine down at

[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:27.340]
Hollywood Toyota and i bought it also from dead and i've had about three months and there's

[02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:33.380]
nothing on the road that has been able to catch me or anything and i think the most fantastic

[02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:38.800]
opiment driving machine oh yeah they're so smooth riding that see that's the thing that i love

[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:41.920]
about it is you know the corvette is faster i'll be honest with you i could i could be

[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:50.060]
in the corvette but as far as i know you're serious now oh yeah because i'm run two vets and what years

[02:35:50.940 --> 02:35:57.640]
one was i would say it was the 88 or it was the flush back one i thought it was a new one and i

[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:01.540]
don't know what engine he had i know the new one it's supposed to have a load is would blow off the

[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:11.860]
turbo with no problem but the uh there's uh four and mustang five o gt's the guys will start to run

[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:17.440]
me and i just walk away from them and they can't believe it's i just gave up on them and uh

[02:36:17.440 --> 02:36:23.260]
Nick says that's an 86 bet that's an 86 yeah okay but but i got an 88 and i'm i'm

[02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:28.600]
be honest with you seriously it's it's faster than the tour the super but but the super is not only

[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:34.120]
extraordinarily fast but it is so smooth riding i've had a lot of cars and i've written in a lot

[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:39.780]
of sports cars and i've had the other you know japanese cars before this is the smoothest riding

[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:44.860]
sports car that's got the speed to go along with it it's tremendous have you seen you know it's

[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:50.600]
when you buy a car like you can buy a corvette all of a sudden you see 20,000 corvets to be very

[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:56.840]
honest with you i've only seen three Toyota super turbos on the road i see a lot of Toyota super

[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:02.080]
roads yeah but i haven't seen that many turbos on the road i agree with you i see very few i want to

[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:07.260]
tell you something i'm 47 i just got into my midlife crisis i got to rid of the river air is the

[02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:14.540]
Cadillac and i think it's the ultimate driving machine excuse me when these people call up and

[02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:21.040]
they're trucks and everything else and i look at it as they're jealous because they can't afford a

[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:26.940]
twenty nine thousand dollar car yeah and but i went to buy a vent and when i got in it i told a guy

[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:34.420]
said i'm buying it i couldn't get out of the car and i think that the Toyota super is made for the

[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:38.860]
driver with all the controls you got to make your see i had three guys in the last night the guy

[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:43.580]
in the back seat was complaining there was no rag room but then i went to pass the truck and i saw

[02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:50.640]
like 15 cars in a row i just floored it got around them the guy in the back said the other guy in

[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:56.300]
the front i should say said he wanted to go in the back with him but i've never i've never in my

[02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:04.300]
life and i've owned that too i've never enjoyed a car more than i have the super with the turbo and

[02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:09.560]
and i've got the target top that comes off just like the yeah exactly that's what i got in look

[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:15.380]
and i think that you'll find out that these people that keep talking about it or think the little

[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:20.460]
bus things that uh... he's 18 year old pick up with all the engine and bird on the rubber

[02:38:21.060 --> 02:38:25.700]
the super doesn't burn anything it just goes out and eats them up you got it they thanks a lot

[02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:30.960]
how do you like net net's a super guy all the people over there great it's the first time i mean

[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:36.060]
you go out and you buy a Cadillac or whatever kind of car you buy and then you go in there and after

[02:38:36.060 --> 02:38:40.320]
the first year everything falls apart and the thing that i like because you can make an appointment

[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:45.320]
to go down with your Toyota and then go in there when they say they do everything that they say

[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:52.120]
they're gonna do yeah i'll find a way do you know side that calls you yeah oh yeah

[02:38:52.120 --> 02:38:57.740]
yeah he's a good friend and also a bottom-witten from ucc aided those commercials with you

[02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:04.720]

side of money uses name but i was just over at bob's place i do printing for bob wait a

[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:17.980]
wait you're talking about the side who hates us with a passion he's an accountant he calls you

[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:22.800]
up before a lot of them no the one i know is in the insurance business but you know i take it

[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:28.240]
back you're right insurance yeah i know i'm well good luck to him i hope he loses a lot more have

[02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:32.460]
a great weekend a night talking to you wow well i was a great commercial for a Toyota's

[02:39:32.460 --> 02:39:36.100]
intuitive Hollywood which is sensational and unsolicited and he's absolutely right

[02:39:36.100 --> 02:39:43.620]
and as far as size concerned oh hey oh god talk about hysterical anyway valentine

[02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:46.880]
all right 153 we're almost at the end of the week but and it would be

[02:39:48.260 --> 02:39:51.360]
well i was gonna say it would be unfair but it wouldn't be unfair it would probably be

[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:55.480]
appropriate to take a couple of moments out here toward the end of the show to because this

[02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:01.280]
is old business again about the business cards yeah and you were joking to me about the fact

[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:07.360]
that they're not ready yet we're not getting him because because mr. disney said that it's

[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:13.160]
inappropriate to make business cards for talent see the salespeople have got business cards

[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:17.880]
and the people in management at all levels i'm sure have business cards including some people

[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:22.580]
we're not really quite sure what they do here right um but the talent doesn't get business cards

[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:30.200]
i can't seem to get across that every station i've worked at in this market me too and every

[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:36.380]
major market that i know the major talent even the producers have business cards okay yeah

[02:40:36.940 --> 02:40:41.900]
and i used them believe it or not absolutely there are a lot of places you go in for example when

[02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:45.220]
you go out on appearance like when steven i worked toy at a hollywood at that time there were no

[02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:49.980]
bumpers to get rid of nothing at all to give out and you know you're looking for something to

[02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:53.880]
sign a business card is a convenient thing if you got a stack of them that you take along with you

[02:40:53.880 --> 02:41:03.480]
one example no one of many hmm i never well he's never heard of talent having a business card mr

[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:07.680]
disney i've never heard of talent not i know i and i'm saying it and they just don't seem to

[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:14.460]
understand that well i guess this is a major is it a major expense i because i you know i'll

[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:19.180]
haven't printed myself if it's you know going to put it tremendous imposition well me too well

[02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:22.520]
probably see because nobody's around and i asked you all before about my check and i get paid every

[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:28.140]
friday and nobody seems to know anything about it so perhaps they're out like taking up a collection

[02:41:34.380 --> 02:41:40.260]
now if they deliver it if by some miracle by the end of the day my check does materialize

[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:45.000]
maybe that i could afford to take a few bucks out of there and get some business cards on my own

[02:41:46.180 --> 02:41:51.060]
i might even get some for you how to with kindness of my heart you are a kind man

[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:55.980]
because i know it's a well it's a major expense now the fact i mean i realize the fact that we got

[02:41:55.980 --> 02:42:00.360]
about four hundred people here in the hallway walking up and down who we have no concept of what it is

[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:07.440]
that they do and they don't either that should you know come as no all right well i obviously i brought

[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:13.320]
up the rough area there yeah i think it's about time you stop making trouble i guess so i guess i

[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:16.680]
would business cards who the hell are you kidding what do you think is somebody important

[02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:22.220]
well what what is wrong with me well maybe now listen maybe with a pencil

[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:34.840]
oh my okay all right okay i guess i they have an apology coming from me

[02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:41.160]
yeah who the hell do you think you are anyway i'll take care of that today yeah please

[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:46.200]
i want you to profusely not just a regular apology i want a profuse

[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:51.100]
oh okay they'll get one they'll remember and about those vanitian blinds in there too

[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:57.160]
same level vertical blinds it's the same kind of thing oh i keep them open okay keep your hands

[02:42:57.160 --> 02:43:02.180]
off the vertical yeah i got into that too yes sir yeah well i think now you're beginning to

[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:07.860]
understand the kinds of things that upper level management has to cope and deal with on a daily

[02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:14.380]
basis okay i sure am your vertical blinds and business cards what we were wondering you know some

[02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:20.680]
of the things they do and we're lining out slowly what do you want to say to you and i mean this

[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:25.540]
from the bottom of my heart that all management people and you know and they're very nice folks

[02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:29.560]
here and all of that and they pretend they got some clues to what they're doing but all management

[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:35.380]
people have got a thing about talent even if it's not a conscious thing in their subconscious

[02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:39.600]
there's this thing and of course with all the stuff that's going on now even though they don't

[02:43:39.980 --> 02:43:44.540]
verbalize it i'm sure somewhere in a back of their mind is oh yeah we can just just get some big

[02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:48.280]
automation machines you know if you get a find a way to do it that way and just because i'm telling

[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:52.200]
that the day will come it'll be automated talk you know how you get these computerized messages

[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:56.360]
when you answer the phone which i always hang up right away i think most people are selling the day

[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:00.440]
will come folks that you'll be diving the phone and you'll hear a computer run the other end of the

[02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:04.720]
thank you very much for your call have a nice day

[02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:12.840]
Gary Lawrence used to uh call what i did and i assume what you did what you did too but he used

[02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:19.280]
to say to me he used to call what i did cutting out paper dolls he had the important stuff to do

[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:23.400]
i was just paper dolls you're going to yeah you're just going to go cut out paper it's amazing

[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:26.380]
he said it because you know Gary a lot of people wonder what happened to him since he left

[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:32.660]
w i z he is no seriously for a living now he cuts out paper doll what go the round come to round

[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:37.900]
yeah that's true that's a true story and now he's all right he and i always got along well

[02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:42.760]
except the contract renewal time and go she had he was tough man he was a real tough cookie

[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:47.860]
you're not kidding that's an understatement but anyway see around here they pay they pay a lot of

[02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:53.600]
money but you just don't get your check so it looks good on paper but then when you start looking

[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:56.960]
in your checkbook and you say what the hell's going on here you know i'm making a fortune but i

[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:01.220]
don't have any money you're so picky well that's you notice i make a big timmies about this every

[02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:06.800]

[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:11.300]

[02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:15.820]
you know the special color special color checks yeah that come like from a Swiss bank or something

[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:21.360]

[02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:27.040]
anyway we're just about on time for the week and we thank again everybody who sent in letters and

[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.940]
the facts things and all the other voices support and we can you know sit here and joke and everything

[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:36.700]
but it is it's a real ponderous thing and it's going on for too long and it's going to stop okay

[02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:41.280]
and you'll notice you notice you can trace all of it back whether it's halendale whether it's
