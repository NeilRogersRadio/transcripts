[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.440]
here

[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.200]
and he's looking around in shock he just can't believe these police will

[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000]
trapping so i remember when you were here

[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.300]
i do you have a well vaguely like uh... history lesson way back when i mean the

[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.020]
building is always been great but this is uh... really magnificent what a change

[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.700]
they really modernized it from what it was there are people monitoring us so

[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.320]
govern yourself accordingly right now

[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.300]
anyway craig uh... i bet you there are a lot of people listening to show i'm

[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.220]
got any idea who you are please their people my own family who wish they did

[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.580]
not what i was i you're right

[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.320]
great to see it but seven yeah we get together once everyone craig is fired

[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.360]
once every seven years we get to get the fire more often that's just like

[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.380]
i can't get my way you're firing so anyway what happened over there i want

[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.420]
to i want you to really well i want you to do anything you don't want to do

[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.140]
but you've got a big smile on your face who i usually like to rip somebody

[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.760]
in the west

[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.420]
well i have some day i may but not necessarily from w i w s i a

[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.040]
basically uh... from what i can do it last October you know it last October

[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.440]
everybody else knew it that they wanted to do something

[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.000]
in regards to the all-might program and the re-boiled down to the bottom line i

[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.980]
i don't have any animosity towards anybody there

[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.640]
i may have a jettison pilot that's how it's a charlatte you know

[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.000]
but not for Dennis Collins no no because Dennis is a dear friend of mine well i

[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.020]
don't you know when you work on night you don't get to know anybody very well

[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.820]
and uh... i think is good yeah it is excellent i think i know that most of those

[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.000]
people in management you don't want to ever get near them

[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.720]
well that's true that won't argue that but i'm at Dennis probably about ten

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.440]
times in the two and a half years i was there and nice guy to me i have no

[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.620]
knock with him it's just that i know that there was pressure to bottom line it

[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.720]
they did it with jeff Charles when they let him go not to replace him and tom

[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.720]
shaper and uh... and me obviously i don't know after this anything to that

[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.540]
package of paul harvie and uh... sally jessie thing i think they were looking

[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.880]
they wanted paul harvie but i think they were looking for a way to

[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.860]
like i've been a big money cut the budget yeah well i'm sure they were cleaning

[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.220]
people make more than you gigantic bucks to do one to five in the morning

[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.420]
but i uh... it was a shock i mean it shouldn't have been a shock i because i knew

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.880]
it might in my gut they were gonna do it it's just that when you are in this

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.840]
business and i like being on the year i really do

[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.320]
aside from getting paid i like being on the year and i'll keep you going

[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.640]
well wait a minute now i'm sure that the people here would be delighted to have

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.120]
you come in if you do work for nothing the way i have been doing that for many

[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.780]
years i mean i know you when you made 275 dollars

[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.220]
twenty five twenty five let's not get carried away

[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.340]
it's not a big raise it looked at me with that smile

[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.660]
oh we've got some money for you yeah and i remember that uh... you call ahead

[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.740]
to go to the bank and make a huge withdrawal just to cover those pages

[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.080]
remember the day i told i was in remember this story see crag and i can just do

[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.360]
the next four hours we don't we don't care about the audience because we work

[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.040]
together when i came to this market at wk t in seventy six and seventy seven

[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.300]
and crag used to do noon to three and i did three to six

[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.580]
for big bucks i mean i was making two hundred and twenty five a week in all

[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.340]
the uh... crap that i could take from the sales department that was the

[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.680]
jewish station stopping so jewish it's a jewish station that was the last time i

[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.060]
made a money that was named it what was the guy who the tall

[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.180]
thin guy who used to pop all the pills all the time the salesman with the glasses

[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.340]
oh he passed away yeah i did he really yeah well when you pop that many pills

[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.680]
you know it's been related it's not good but anyway uh... and of course bob

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.340]
alan was the sales manager who's been bounced around here and there he used to

[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.580]
throw that little basket ball all day in the hoop you know and that was his but he's

[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.660]
happy note the day took it all this yeah well good luck to you but

[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.520]
but anyway we had his one salesman his name was mark something let's leave it at

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.780]
that mark and uh... he always used to come in we got this bad reputation the jewish

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.300]
station the south beach station south of july he got these rabbis coming out of

[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.780]
the and then he would bring in spots for like the famous remember we had nothing but

[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.360]
jewish spots anyway because k a t was basically the old yinthas south beach station

[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.120]
but anyway so craig was doing the three i did three to six and then

[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.520]
said gave us a break of a lifetime it came to us one day and he said yeah this is a great story

[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.280]
said i want to put craig on ten to two and neal two to six he expanded our shows no more money

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.060]
no money but it was like you know he was not see we never got a nickel no we did live spots for free

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.180]
now we did want get free meals now now now do you remember when we went to the famous

[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.420]

[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.860]
bell i brought up at that time was john harper which i think is rather ironic i mentioned this

[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.460]
yesterday that somebody who used to be your board up you know fired you that has got to be i mean

[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.400]

[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.160]
you know you're talking about the old kt we did have a great phone system yes clear good was

[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.780]
real good especially when the board ops used to put the calls through it wasn't to do when they

[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:45.120]
didn't put the calls through you do remember that one great day when my i you you're ever see the

[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:51.000]
skit on Saturday night live with buck Henry or he's doing the talk show and no calls he can't yeah

[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.700]
pumping the number of talking about let's kill puppies let's boil babies no calls and he finally

[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.740]
gets a call to wrong number or something well i'm basically i'm sitting there doing my show and

[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:05.600]
i go through that boring monologue and uh... you know screaming and carrying on nothing is happening

[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.060]
on the phone and i'm getting hysterical and so i figure well i'll really go nuts you know and i'm

[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.700]
i don't remember what the topics were but nothing is happening on the phone well to make a long

[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.960]
story short this has been going on for a while on off i was starting to get suspicious so remember

[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.960]
sand that used to work in production oh sure sam became a spy of mine and he kind of soldered

[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.400]
upstairs see the control room and the studio were way in two separate parts of the building so we

[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.760]
couldn't see when calls were coming in they would come into control room they bought up would

[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.220]
screen them and put them through you'd have to do a thing where you put them through one of the

[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.940]
phone and then they would light up in the studio well to make a long story short every line we

[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.200]
had five lines at that time four day and one brown at that every line was lit but he wasn't

[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.100]
putting them through so i went nuts on the air and we had a little intercom little light that used

[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.060]
to flash we pick up the phone to communicate with the board up and he said to me is that better

[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.840]
yeah as if as if hey i'm eating my sandwich up here don't bother me got you right after you left

[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.060]
they put in two way monitors so we could see them and they could see yeah really yeah and i was

[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.980]
doing that same type of thing you're talking about and no phones and there was nobody on the monitor

[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.180]
it was gone it was empty and you know you couldn't break for anything you couldn't break you

[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.560]
couldn't do anything you had no control in that studio and for 40 minutes i'm talking and i

[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.140]
can't get phones i can't take a break i can't do anything and i'm thinking what the hell is going

[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.280]
on and nobody on that monitor enjoy what it come in if you've got no they had a bomb scare and they

[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.200]
cleared the building but left you left the talk that happened to me one time too and they left me

[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.600]
in there and everybody else was out in the parking lot go to show you what value a talk host is we

[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.420]
got what do you make your money or any of these news comes on i go outside i look around

[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.040]
there's nobody there i go and i look in the open the door and there's everybody in the parking lot

[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.040]
oh we have a little bomb threat well i'll tell you they really are all hard that's a true story

[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.700]
they're all hard over there anyway it's really a criminal what happened to that radio station even

[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.340]
even though we didn't make a lot of money and even though the audience was pretty geriatric we

[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.640]
had a lot of fun it was like hey i'm considering the marginal signal at that station had it that

[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.400]
very well we did pretty well not only that but what about the equipment it always autographed by

[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.500]
my colony yeah no promotion it was amazing the equipment was so ancient they had they had those

[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.520]
old microphones that you see in those pictures with Edison you know those in those documentaries

[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:22.860]
you know those real ancient big microphones the size of the mind ever i got a couple of them

[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.840]
for all time say and then of course i told was telling just the other day somebody the Howard

[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.140]
premier story about how Howard was sitting this is one of the great stories in the history of broadcast

[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.880]
and here's this guy who when i went there he was like a news flunky he just was an unpaid news

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.720]
flunky then he became Joe Freed's assistant who also by the way passed away Joe Freed was an

[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.480]
interesting guy but anyway uh huh how's Jean T-bloom doing that's another great story do you

[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.560]
remember the day that he beat up the board off he took him out on the street and beat up the board

[00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:00.620]
off Craig and i got stories that just there will dazzle you so anyway Howard managed to eventually

[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.900]
become something i don't know news director whatever and when the herndstats owned the radio

[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.420]
station the senator from Las Vegas and his wife who just absolutely butchered up that radio station

[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.900]
they were gonna fire Howard and he's sitting out there and on that sofa outside her office and

[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.860]
she's in there with the door closed with the new program director who just came from where

[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.680]
Washington or somewhere program director of the month of the year and the program director was

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.620]
there for a week or whatever and he was and he quit while he was in there on but oats to her

[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.900]
so now he walks out she doesn't know whether the scream orita banana and Howard premier sitting

[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.660]
out there she's gonna fire him while she brings him in and makes him program director well she did

[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.780]
one better than that uh... this is the folks again now he owns a radio station this yes this this

[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.680]
this uh... guy was fired at the talk show host i can't think of his name and a week later he was

[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.720]
hired back as program director i was the only one who never made program director on that station

[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.660]
no me too well you know what i was that oh yeah but i was gonna be program director

[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.680]
but you know the last minute change Lynn Russell who you now see on cnn on edline news

[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.080]
was doing a good job by the way he looks great by the way he's doing a nice one shop

[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.360]
but uh... Lynn became program director for a variety of reasons which we probably won't pursue

[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:14.220]
on the air anyway it was the first girl i ever used rough language on the f word really had a big

[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.740]
fight right in the lobby after she was named program director are you serious i remember some

[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:25.120]
interesting conversations out in the lobby uh... oh yeah he would he craig probably he's better

[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.880]
than leaf out when it comes to doing a show with no microphone i mean he could do a show in Miami

[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.740]
be heard in richman virginia with no problem at all and the he also used to have this thing

[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.580]
slapping the table to and i remember one day he and i were having an argument about

[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.880]
marty cohn is he still around by the way or the uh... not they just celebrated his 90th

[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.920]
are you serious don't for what we're having some kind of an argument and craig was there and and

[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.660]
things were bouncing off the tables in the uh... in the hallway it was incredible anyway we got

[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:56.280]
to do a little thing here is Henry alive is Henry uh... it's not Henry it's gale not so bright is

[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.100]
ready for the update it's ten thirty five craig warning is here if you don't know who he is

[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.040]
that's your tough life for a while he's desperate for a job he's another unemployed radio person

[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.020]
if you want to talk to craig calling it time because he's here to hang out eat some lunch get

[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.580]
whatever the hell he can out of this and it will come out

[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.720]
ten thirty nine craig was just telling me about leaf founder and how he copies everything that we

[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.800]
do on the show but i get them all the time i don't think he's got this yet but he could

[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.200]
i understand he's working on it all inside addition on channel seven seven to seven thirty

[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.160]
tomorrow night on channel seven are going to do a little slice job on me so i'll be looking forward to

[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.420]
the really i don't know supposedly it's going to be a positive piece but it never winds up being

[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.780]
positive you remember the great thing in traffic magazine they did on me i know and i wrote the

[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.800]
letter and you figured that i was out to get me a but my only point was that i said that i wrote

[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.860]
them a personal letter that's right you wrote a letter i always knew there was a reason i didn't like

[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.780]
craig yeah but uh... you wrote me a letter saying what a great piece mark fisher did in the

[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.240]
but i wrote that i wrote to this guy a personal letter because everybody was talking about it in

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.440]
town obviously and i said anytime you want to take kneels name out of it and leave the same column

[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.200]
put me in i don't mind because i'm from the old school that good spell my name spell my name

[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.120]
writing give me the p r that's all and then he took excerpts out and put the damn letter in the

[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.580]
thing oh no listen in the long run it did help there's no question it was a lot of good free

[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.260]
publicity i mean when you get the front page of traffic in a herald uh... five full pages of

[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.720]
and pictures there were least six people who spoke english who read a big big bonus turning

[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.360]
point my career no doubt anyway uh...

[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.760]
i don't know how much we want to talk about wol d but the bottom line is you were doing uh

[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.700]
overnight tonight i remember when steve left there to come here i mentioned this the other day

[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.280]
you did the afternoon if a nine weeks that was my biggest disappointment of course i wanted that

[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.680]
shift and uh... you know i that was not your thing though it just that i'm i said that the other

[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.400]
and i said it at the time it just you were like a fish out of water

[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.640]
if uh... the format would have been different it could have been your thing but you're like you're

[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.440]
a midday you know the three ten to two like nine to one at night over night but there's no money

[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.900]
there but i mean for example and i don't want to create a problem but if you were doing nine to one

[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.760]
at night over there i don't want to mention any other names that would be perfect didn't you do nine

[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.160]
to one here at one time i did nine to one at i and see the first year and a half against what i

[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:16.100]
came down to tonight at all nights here after alan and uh... i worked every hour and still in the

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.220]

[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.260]
breaks you know the double doors here and i wasn't allowed to come in and nothing left in the studio

[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.200]

[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.200]

[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:23.160]
she knows who you are that's a long story going on so he's leaving and on the way and i'm

[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.380]
introducing alan courtney this is ambitious and bishop this is alan courtney and he says to and

[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.640]
you're not bad for a woman the whole night he was in another world he didn't want to talk to me

[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:40.980]
he just alienated he was he was a warm friendly guy wasn't he was beautiful roomy and orange

[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.120]
one and it came across on the air to what do you want get off you know it was just uh

[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.820]
he made burks seem like mr. warm but he was the king to you came along but he had horrendous

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.700]
demographics i mean oh well yeah well back dead and dead in the near-dead graph oh that's true

[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.960]
that is true there's been a little revolution that's been going on and of course our friends at

[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.780]
wold haven't discovered it yet but that's another story anyway you filled in and they jerked

[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.060]
you around there and then i'm the only guy in the world who can burn bridges and end up at that

[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.160]
station whatever it is hey listen i ripped him but i ripped this place so unmercifully when disney came

[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.240]
here i know you did and and deservedly so they admit it they say you know everything you said was

[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.060]
true right because they put berk on they put all his crap on on the weekend which they haven't

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.860]
improved much by the way you might want to think about doing weekends for some serious money

[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.960]
no i see that saving money with the best of nail the best of day oh yeah still everybody yeah

[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:36.220]
the story on the best of kneel by the way they came to me on a friday and um bill wise said to me

[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.160]
who shows up only like alternate friday he plays a lot of golf he said to me well now mike

[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:47.140]
disney tells me he's spoken to you about this best of nia rass said what i said no it's not

[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.220]
a my contract i don't know anything about that but so the next day it went on the air

[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.280]
but what was i gonna say i mean i don't really care it's certainly been working six days which i

[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:01.520]
did at i and z that was brutal that was gary loren should forever be punished for making me do that

[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.140]
six days of this is too much six days of time even at k a day we didn't do six days i did

[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.520]
i had to you did yeah oh yeah but that was for but you got paid extra for that yes i did some real

[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:16.720]
heavy heavy who you dollars for those days no i really think in those days we had more money

[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.480]
than we do now well in your case that's that could be true of almost anything well i did i

[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.740]
did for the most i haven't made in this business kneeled the height my last year at i and z

[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.760]
and my for i mean my last year kt and my first year that overnight at i and z until how frank

[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.480]
had me fired through david rada who i never met i made thirty nine thousand dollars that was the

[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.000]
most ever made in the business since then it's been a downhill slide but i wasn't bad at the time

[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.840]
though that was i wasn't not that money i'm complaining i managed to get by because i'm a little

[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.800]
tight as you and larry always say you know yeah just i wouldn't know what to do with the money you're

[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.180]
making i mean i really wouldn't know what to do with it by the way i remember i like to try to

[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.800]
layer it out what a larry's favorite diets remember a place called marries in north maimmy where we

[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.780]
used to get pizza over time when you lived up there okay marry case okay no no marries no marries

[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:07.080]
all marries on seven thousand seven yeah and larry camp was on these alternate diets like all

[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.760]
the rest of us it used to get these enormous extra large pizzas and he would eat the topping off

[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.300]
the pizza and throw the crust away good the topping only had forty seven thousand calories but

[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:23.380]
uh marries was good now that area has changed dramatic oh god yes for the worst i mean that whole uh

[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.080]
those those were pretty interesting days i lived at twin lakes racquet club by the golden glades

[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.720]
and you lived on there by um just down on the road at five hundred and thirty fifths

[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.440]
remember when you used to sneak up to a poppin out a drink those magnificent strawberry diaries at

[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.440]
the strawberry diaries yeah well that's what they were called wasn't it you mean at the track

[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:45.000]
no no no no we went to the track with you but no one potato to potato or three potato four

[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.980]
oh yeah boy that's really good to have great strawberry diaries yeah why does he keep saying

[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:55.380]
diaries that's what the word is dacarees no no no i hate that's in botany diaries is that

[00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:01.100]
is that of a scene where it was it was it was so crazy dikaree why it sounds like a place where

[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:06.360]
Sally Jessie doing her shoulder break got all her guests out from that dikaree that place

[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.660]
was so crowded you had to wait at the bar for your table for so long yeah i got blank that was

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.320]
there very good place it was great it's not very well right one out of business all the good places

[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.980]
went out i've got some good places now but that other place you had a sponsor the the health food

[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.060]
place the unicorn they made a great drink you know that that's what barricorn is doing great

[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.960]
oh i was over the other day allegedly and the terry's been promising me this for a long time

[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.720]
there's supposed to be opening one up in plantation or really which would do so well yeah because

[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.180]
plantations got a dearth of restaurant we don't have anything how do you live i don't understand

[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:44.480]
this how did you come to live in boca well yeah boca is so far from anywhere you had to be

[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.940]
burning up all your gas money just going to work every night i i had a very short television

[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:54.540]
career on channel 39 and uh... so i was looking for a midway point to to everybody in the family

[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.420]
could get to their jobs somebody working in west prime and i was working in hollywood and boca

[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.500]
happened to be the middle point and i said i can't afford boca but i found a little uh...

[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.440]
groveling area you know where they have a squad as rights and i get into what they call a townhouse

[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.220]
or i call it duplex and uh... that's where i am it's cheap it was cheap at the time to get it

[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.020]
cheaper there to live than to live in date county of brow it and it was middle then i got fired

[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.960]
two weeks later a channel that i look at him these different stories keep coming back to mind

[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.340]
because we really had a lot of fun during especially the k t days and we had a sponsor called the

[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:30.620]
cock and bull restaurant uh... she members yeah one with a big cock on the roof and a little girl i remember that

[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:38.240]
yeah i serve him i got a problem that one yeah i fell anyway now what was the guy's name is

[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:44.040]
all taster and what was his son i had the one highly i don't remember that i mean there were really

[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.560]
nice people and it was very good it wasn't a pretty good

[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:53.820]
that that that that's pretty good no i mean for what it was it wasn't a fancy gourmet restaurant

[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:58.240]
but it was a working man's restaurant exactly we ate for free and i always thought those

[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.760]
friends that guy in fact now it just comes back to mind build the shara who's on which

[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.700]
new all the time playing music and playing his guitar and chubby would call chair that

[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:13.240]
haha and i'll never forget he was telling us this story about how he was doing his elvis

[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:20.280]
imitation build a shara and how the whole crowd would look at him and say elvis it's elvis

[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.480]
i'm just struck man this guy sounded like elvis about as much as remember the guy that sat in for

[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.000]
reneary those clowns on that friday and they were all doing voice and they were doing imitations

[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.240]
and they were all using their own voice okay it would be like my saying okay here's line of turner

[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.940]
hi everybody how you doing and that that was how much he sounded like elvis

[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.660]
the other greatest story when you were probably the worst crying fit in the history of mankind you

[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:55.720]
were doing a spot some live spot you were on and i was in the studio a kt kt and they had these huge

[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:02.200]
drapes okay these big red velvet plush drapes and there was a bird bath outside and you're standing

[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.280]
in the window and watch the bird bath that'd be one of the most exciting things that would happen

[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:11.140]
and you were doing a spot one of these real geriatric things for some some geriatric equipment

[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:17.660]
supply place and the line was something about what you said arched heels or something

[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:21.920]
yeah i don't remember what i was i don't know the word that started it but you started laughing

[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.440]
and i started laughing to the point where i was shaking and i was holding onto the drapes to keep

[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:30.980]
from falling on the floor i was laughing so hard and he's sitting there trying to do a serious

[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:36.540]
but because this was a geriatric this was not a laughy up it out that's not a pull around spot and i

[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.300]
tell you i look back at him and his face was so red and he was in one of those laughing fits to

[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.700]
the point where i thought he was going to choke to death on the air was incredible right after you

[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.320]
left i got to tell a quick story remember the big red carpet in that studio yeah i had glen rinker

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.640]
and and bishop on his guess and i had about four spots backed up to do live back on one

[00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.480]
of top of another and so and i shouldn't tell it and bishop laid spreading a lot on the floor out

[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:08.820]
there and then rinker got on top of her and was you know what is the truth and she leaned out

[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.680]
from under which he said could you picture Ralph renek doing this and i just broke all over

[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.900]
are you serious that's a story that is an incredible story to that and doesn't know who i am

[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:25.680]
it's five past eleven at w i o d lea fallers as he would love to call but is prohibited by w j n o

[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:31.400]
management and we know that jiff charles is leaving for w p r o and providence roe dylan and we

[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.840]
wish him well he uh don't buy a house Jeff that's all i can tell you he changes jobs more often

[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.420]
and some people change underwear doesn't he him and it till well at least he doesn't mind moving

[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.600]
all over the country say i won't do that i don't want to i don't really know what to say because i

[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.200]
know that this guy's leaving and there's a job opening up there so i don't want to create anything

[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.060]
that would create a problem for you so anything that i say please keep in mind it's that nasty rotten

[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.060]
meal at say play but i'm not ready to play but i'm on day off i'd be more than happy to take the blame

[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.160]
but this management up there w j n o you saw jickas column the other day where they don't want any

[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.600]
of their people going on i read that he shows with people from other states which is so petty and so

[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.460]
trial deal now lee is prohibited to call by the management up there now i must say this and this

[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:20.400]
is this is an honest statement lee foulard on the year is mediocre at best lee foulard calling my

[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:26.200]
show is sensational his greatest performances were calls to my show and i used to we used to kid him

[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.140]
about it lee you ought to you ought to be a professional caller and get paid by the call they call

[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.260]
all the different talk shows because on the phone he's funny he's great he's a funny guy really

[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:39.300]
here he does all that over the authors and stealing my material and stealing steves guests and all

[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.060]
of that crap but on the phone he's great so now they've taken away the one area of his career that he

[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.820]
really had growing that was really going for calling the show and they've cut it out like tearing

[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.600]
his guts out okay let's take some calls for Craig because i could go on here and it would just

[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:59.860]
mean nothing to anybody including Craig sunrise hello hi hi uh neal first of all i have to tell you

[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:06.940]
that yours is the first voice i heard in 78 uh i i really missed talk shows you mean like when

[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.700]
you woke up in the morning one day or no as a matter of fact and i mean i've already remember

[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:20.020]
no it wasn't in the morning it was dry for us a 78 we're becoming home fermenting and i switched

[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:26.740]
through radio and i heard your wife and i listened forever wow i must have a rich full life to remember

[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.520]
that day and everything well no no don't put my life down i knew you would do that because i know

[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.820]
you so well just a little joke okay i'll tell you i'll tell you why i remember it so well because i

[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:42.080]
was a fan of Bob Grant when i came down here i went without uh talk radio for three years and i

[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.420]
just happened to enjoy talk radio and uh as well it was just a little bit of information that yours

[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:55.700]
was the first voice at any rate Craig well one of my favorite people i think you're tremendously

[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:02.140]
talented and i've had it with that other station and so i helped me god i stayed with them for 11

[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:08.560]
years and last night was the first time i refused to turn it on and i won't well i appreciate that man

[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.120]
but let's face it we're all fickle including myself and we all get disappointed to be a radio station

[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.660]
the television stations but uh you don't give up stations because you know oh yes i know oh yes i

[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.680]
know see you maybe you do but you're rare exception because generally what happens all those loyal

[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.880]
people that love you and they would just go crazy if you left the new voice comes on on Monday after

[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.780]
you've been canned on friday and the new voice comes on and does 20 minutes and goes the first call

[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:37.160]
and the caller says oh you're a breath of fresh air that's the favorite line this time no matter

[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.100]
who it really it could be it could be a giraffe okay making guttural sounds that it all out of breath

[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:47.300]
of fresh air well i'm afraid i'm not like that and and let me explain why i feel as i do first of

[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:52.020]
all i'd say you're one of my favorite people i enjoyed you in the afternoon when you took over those

[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.780]
and i enjoyed you thoroughly at one in the morning because that's my time my family is all taken care

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.640]
and that's my time that's one of the advantages really of overnight people a little more

[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:09.000]
intimate and relaxed absolutely we're not all geriatric out there i'm you know that's true that's

[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.380]
another myth that people have now again i you know i'm sure if you could break down and see it

[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.900]
on paper it probably would show heavily but as far as call as i found younger call as on an

[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.760]
online show then i did it many other hours down here yeah for a nice i have been staleo typed as

[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:32.220]
the old ladies favorite you know when witchner had your when witchner had your spot it was older when

[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:37.660]
you came on the scene it was lively it was fun well jerry's most jerry's listeners died 20 years

[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:43.360]
ago but nobody told him that's a problem they died about the time his wig passed out listen have a

[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:50.020]
great day i want to tell you one thing in closing yeah what in closing why i say i turned off to

[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:57.180]
the station it's not simply because they fired Craig or that you left or cane left or leaf

[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.860]
all right wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute hold it i never work for this outfit thank god i

[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:06.880]
never worked for Jefferson no you didn't i got i got out two owners ago and i can assure you i

[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.260]
never will work for jerry because they don't want to pay anybody anything you happen to be right

[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:15.600]
because they really don't know what they're doing and they should sell but at any rate the reason

[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:22.120]
i am never going to listen again is because they have made it very plain and clear that they don't

[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.720]
give a damn about the listeners we didn't want Craig to leave we didn't want cane to leave

[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.080]
i prefer to wait a minute ma'am i've got to interrupt here and i appreciate your loyalty but at

[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.820]
the same time i don't believe management of local radio stations down here any of them really

[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:42.560]
really give a damn about the listener they care about the bottom line and that's what the

[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.160]
corporation cares about and they're no different than this station or any other station well maybe

[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.460]
something i mean i'm not thrilled with that either but let me say this too though if they didn't

[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.620]
have the fm if they didn't have life with those humongous numbers of people listening in elevators

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.720]
and dentist offices if they didn't have that they might as well shut the a m off at this point

[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.600]
based on what i understand now that could be wrong but i don't think so that is fine that i'm old

[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.340]
because i listened to that once in a while yes listen have a wonderful life

[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:13.860]
well i wish you that too okay thank you okay you never turn on a listen to life really never

[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.400]
never i don't even know where it is on the dial okay i don't know everything about radio who you know

[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.200]
i don't i have no idea where it is i swear to you i wouldn't if you would want to give me a million

[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.740]
dollars and said tune the radio punch it up immediately i couldn't do it i have no i think

[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.380]
forgetting you came out of a music background see i but not live that is no no no i am the watch

[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.700]
no what i'm saying you came out of you were a rock jock and those kind of things and i forget that

[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:42.040]
so is i well keep it in mind okay we have an open line with that i wouldn't show on life that's

[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.080]
that's my favorite man especially when Bob Lasseter used to do the voiceovers i'd be so depressed

[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.520]
i want to blow my brains up okay we have an open line in brown or five two four w i d craig

[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.100]
worthing you see if you want to get your car painted i remember used to drive that checker cab

[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:59.620]
yeah no matter what spot i got here there's something with craig all these colorful stories that

[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:05.760]
i used to drive this old checker cab and boy did it need a paint job bad and if arcoe would have

[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.380]
been around then you could have taken it over there anyway it's eleven sixteen that's true there's

[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.560]
a trend coming out on friday unfortunately overnight don't show in there nobody gets a down

[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.580]
bottle the nights you're getting yeah what is for me yeah except for those who would like to have

[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.040]
a job yeah anyway sharing was right you've been much too nice to wol d and it's about

[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.080]
but i know it's around you think i'm a wimp and a was but i really have no axe to grind with it

[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.780]
one of the one of the art you went out of your position the old that we can burn bridges you can

[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.580]
you're able to do it that's why we all envy you and and admire you for that i love it when

[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.140]
you give hell to management you know i've had my fair share but at that i'm doing is telling the

[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:47.760]
truth that most of them are morons most of them are subhuman douchebags who treat us like garbage

[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.940]
like chattelty you know just use you like a cattle exactly and most of them don't have any

[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.740]
talents you that's the thing i recently come out of sales most of the margins glorified sales people

[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.180]
who can't do anything else in a business and then they become in management you know i've never

[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.960]
forget Stanley coen at wion z i used to have some of the most frustrating conversations with

[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.640]
Stanley jay coen who again was a sales manager who all of a sudden when how frank left he just

[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:16.340]
inherited becoming general manager right and i would go in there and he would say no don't talk

[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.740]
to me about engineering i don't know anything about it don't talk to me about programming i don't

[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.620]
know anything about programming don't talk and i would say to him Stanley what do you know about

[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.660]
and he would sit there with his jaw down it was puppet he wouldn't have an answer because he didn't

[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:33.760]
know i think about anything it was a nice guy but he knew nothing about nothing and he was my boss

[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.000]
yeah now the people here i will say this i mean i rip him a lot and i kill him with them but

[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.580]
seriously the people here other than being brain defective they are they're tremendous they're

[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.720]
really incredible i don't think they know anything but they're very nice people which is amazing

[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.040]
the only other now you and i used to argue about sydlovan because you had i love it sit wait a minute

[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:57.420]
wait a minute you like him too i like him personally it pains me deeply i don't know why

[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:03.780]
well not deeply like about this thing but it bugs me that this man has never ever

[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.940]
made a phone call never dropped me a line i mean he was like he was my first general manager in

[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.220]
this market now i had him on my show couple times when he was shilling for the governor remember

[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.340]
a couple of those yeah posh political jobs that he's so famous for and i had him on a show

[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.900]
couple of times but he never said them in fact he always would make comments to other people around

[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.280]
like well you know we're trying to explain wait a minute on this try to reform me you know get him

[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:32.140]
to be in other words syd would give the impression that he was depressed because i didn't go back to

[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:37.480]
that old bill smith monotone terminally boring talk that he used to love i mean i but he loved

[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.920]
you on the i've got to tell you a quick story and i really shouldn't because i i'm no

[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.760]
closer to said than you are except i would oh you love sit i would work for sit i like

[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.740]
sit a bit you love sit a bit the nicest person ever worked well i love it i never in the

[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.380]
way i could do it so no i did it i'm deli and there's one thing where his brother says he says

[00:37:54.380 --> 00:38:00.740]
i like bread you love bread i like bread yeah you love sit a bit i like i really do love it a lot

[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:05.400]
he's a nice guy but he really out of his room and he really used to love you on the air the only time

[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.580]
he got upset with you was after you left you went on w one to n w s and uh for about two or three

[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:17.700]
nights you really did a job on n w s and on sit at one afternoon i was i was till a k t obviously one

[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:23.120]
afternoon i was going into the uh studio and he was steaming in his office right off the studio

[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.780]
there and i said what's the matter and he said i can't understand him i let him do what he wanted

[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:34.260]
i liked him he knows i liked him and why is he crapping on me like that he really was upset that

[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.480]
you'd scrapped on him because he really liked you only i talked about was the fact remember with the

[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.820]
um was it metoreal yeah that he was when he was on a metro and he was a guy and he used to try to

[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:49.180]
bring wash us and but he never stopped is he just said sometimes he's not going overboard he just um

[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.700]
believe me that that was unfortunate but he always liked on the air there's no two ways about he used

[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:59.020]
to tell me that one i want one of the great things i was on from two to six and Sid would be in his

[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.880]
office after five when most of the people had left so it would be basically him and me and the

[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.000]
board op was ten miles away down the hall and i would often in that five o'clock hour see i didn't

[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.020]
realize in those days member in the book from two to four i had these you had great numbers and i

[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.600]
had great numbers two to four four to six like the audience would disappear from me and the reason

[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.260]
being that two to four was still screaming in yelling time i'm trying to convince Steve of this four

[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:29.120]
to six and Jerry Williams proved it when he came to nws that year four to six is drive time they don't

[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.820]
want grief they don't want screaming in yelling they want fun and games they want life they want

[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.740]
that's what they want to hear they've just had a rough day they're in that awful traffic they want

[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:41.220]
fun and games so anyway you know and i'd be seeing they're trying to get the audience motivated and

[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.400]
getting the phones to ring and here i'm talking basically to a bunch of people over the age of a

[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.720]
hundred anyway and i'm going on i'm pounding on the table you people just don't care about these

[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.140]
things you can't do yeah i said i don't care if you call i don't give a damn if you even listen and

[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:56.640]
there was a little voice would come he'd be in his office which was right next door to the studio

[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:02.020]
and there'd be an adjacent door and i think i do yeah i know i'm gonna hit could hear i'd be trying

[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:07.320]
to be serious and i would just about crack up on the air because i'd hear it said i do i know

[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:13.600]
i'm around you know and it was uh those were pretty interesting days and then we had some real

[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.760]
great towns there Jim Alton who's the only talk uh host do ever had a street named after him

[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.600]
as true i know i know what i have to but you know you prove something in radio the last many years

[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.740]
and i felt it long time ago even though i got that rid that wonderful tag of the king of pap and

[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:31.920]
dribble that yes when something exciting is happening like the riots or something like that talk

[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.620]
about it but i think talk shows all over the country overdue on this serious and the news

[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.640]
all that all the ground and when gbs was on a year doing talk here i mentioned this the other day

[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.740]
here you had four stations doing all the same guys to all the same topics and man that was that

[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.760]
was such bad burnout and nobody larry kentus said this many times nobody ever calls it and says hey

[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.020]
would you do another one of those great shows on aids or one of those great education shows now we

[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.360]
say remember the time that you you yelled at so and so they remember and enjoyed the fun stuff

[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:06.100]

This is fantastic.

[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.460]
Pete's a lot strikes again.

[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.540]
And what the hell am I going to do?

[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.360]
You know, wasn't I just saying at the beginning of the show

[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.440]
that I'm going to have a really, really good day today?

[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.300]
You weren't going to do anything?

[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.820]
Well, I didn't say anything.

[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.440]
Well, and that was what you said.

[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.880]
And little Andy Pasta, I'm just going to have a little of this.

[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:12.780]
You're going to love the shells.

[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.680]
OK, trust me.

[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.220]
These are great.

[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.060]
Well, you go ahead and eat.

[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.420]
I have one or two things I want to ask Craig.

[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.060]
And you're going to have to bear with me

[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.420]
because it's going to take him a minute to answer my questions.

[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.020]
Am I that wrong?

[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:23.400]
I went in?

[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.320]
No, no, no.

[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.880]
It's just going to take you a minute to explain this.

[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880]
By the way, Dennis, good morning.

[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:27.380]
How are you doing?

[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:28.580]
I'm good.

[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.100]
I just, I try to be friendly with him.

[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.020]
I know he's listening.

[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.420]
He's just monitoring right now.

[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.140]
You know, yeah.

[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.620]
Now it's not true that he used to have somebody

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.740]
taping my show every day.

[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.780]
Is it not that I am aware of?

[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:39.680]
That was a room.

[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.780]
I really am not aware of it.

[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.240]
I went honestly.

[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.260]
When I ran into you at that softball game that night,

[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.920]
now it's talking to you about a guest

[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.500]
that you had on your show over there, the alien.

[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.120]
Right.

[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.300]
Can you tell us a little bit about the aliens?

[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:51.660]
Strange.

[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.820]
I had the alien finally rescheduled to do a show next Monday night.

[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.880]
Did you really?

[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.360]
I know this whole thing sounds ridiculous,

[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.520]
but I was working up in West Palm and a guy called me

[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.620]
one afternoon in the office.

[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:05.120]
And I've done shows with supposed extra terrestrial before.

[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.100]
And it's always stupid.

[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.740]
I've seen some of the guests in I believe.

[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.640]
But this guy kept me on the pump for like two or three hours.

[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.500]
Said he was over.

[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.980]
He was here from another out of space.

[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.720]
But but but but.

[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.760]
And he really didn't sound like a jerk.

[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.920]
So as after two hours, I said, would you do a show?

[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.360]
And he didn't tell me his name or where he was from or anything else.

[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.480]
I said, would you do a show with me?

[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.680]
He said sure.

[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.900]
And I he said, how about such and such a night?

[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.760]
We did a show for labs.

[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.780]
And I figured, well, people are going to call it and say,

[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.600]
this is ridiculous.

[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.160]
And believe it or not, 90% of the calls bought it.

[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:34.560]
Yeah.

[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:35.240]
Bought it.

[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.160]
And I'm saying, friends, this has to be a put on.

[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:41.140]
I'm sure it's some guy with a couple guys with buds out there drinking

[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:41.940]
and have a nice show.

[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.080]
Well, over the since then, we've done maybe a half a dozen shows

[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.040]
in the last four years.

[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.220]
And whenever he calls me and it's been about nine months since I've heard

[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.500]
from him, and I'm sure it's a big put on.

[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.120]
I don't believe in people from out of space, whether they live here

[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:55.300]
or any place else with that matter.

[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.840]
But the amazing thing is that the majority of people who ever call in

[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.020]
are talking to him like he's really it, you know?

[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.460]
And when I told you that night that I just couldn't give you the name

[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.640]
because I didn't have the name or number the next time I talked to him,

[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.740]
I'd see if he wanted to do it.

[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.020]
And that was the extent of it.

[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.140]
He was always on the phone.

[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.880]
He would like, you couldn't call him.

[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:15.680]
Couldn't call him.

[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.100]
He called you.

[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.780]
Never came.

[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.040]
I couldn't get him in the station.

[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.400]
Never came in the station.

[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.880]
And he's never, you know, you figure out the four years he's looking for something.

[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.700]
He's something behind all this.

[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.160]
And his whole message behind everything is basically don't use,

[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.300]
I mean, don't use colored toilet paper.

[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:30.740]
Don't you?

[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:31.160]

[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.800]
You know, what about colored toilet paper cosies?

[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.120]
Well, don't get me down.

[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:36.500]
Come on.

[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:38.720]
I know you never forgot the cosy thing.

[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.340]
I did anything to I want to tell you a few people who are listening

[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.680]
could have gone on a tour.

[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.660]
They should have turned that into a museum.

[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.220]
Shouldn't they?

[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.820]
What is that building now?

[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.820]
Is it still a cruise line bought it?

[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:50.200]
Really?

[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.200]
They should have turned that into a museum.

[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.640]
Art Smith could have been the curator of the museum, the old, enjoyable building.

[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.140]
He's still around.

[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.160]
Art Smith is a curator with the Planetarium.

[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.040]
He was always tight with Jack Orkheimer.

[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.420]
Anyway, what was I starting to say?

[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.700]
They should have turned into a museum.

[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.040]
Because when you walked in, especially the talk studio,

[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.260]
had this huge old piano band ball,

[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.620]
Craig started this thing about,

[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.080]
leave it to Craig to come up with his little old ladies,

[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.900]
toilet tissue cosies, which were...

[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.820]
Now that is in how it started.

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.400]
Which were knitted little things

[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.880]
that you put around a roll of toilet paper in the Budwa.

[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.660]
I mean, I've never heard of many of them.

[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.880]
Well, even penis cosies.

[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.500]
They sent in a whole bunch of those.

[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.280]
Don't you remember those?

[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.700]
We get cosies to come every thing.

[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.020]
We get cosies.

[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.340]
Don't you remember the folks used to knit those penis cosies

[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.520]
with the little gonads on them?

[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.420]
Don't you remember all those?

[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.000]
Because these are auctioned with these languages,

[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.040]
man, is using on here.

[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.280]
I'm using very clinical language.

[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.340]
Yeah, that's what I mean.

[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.560]
Compared to you, I do.

[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:48.140]
I remember that.

[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.320]
I'm a real novice for me to forget something like that.

[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.260]
It's shocking, okay?

[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.800]
It all started over a teapot

[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.760]
because my mother used to have a cozy on a teapot.

[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.600]
That's how it started.

[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.600]
And then I got into the toilet paper ones

[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.900]
and the penis cosies and all the other things that they sent.

[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.500]
And we auction them off for charity.

[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.100]
I know it was stupid, but what the hell?

[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.920]
I'll do anything to get a little attention.

[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.160]
Love that bird bath.

[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.160]
It's 11.32 at W.I.O.D. Homestead.

[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:14.440]
Hello.

[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.040]
Hi.

[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:15.780]
How you doing?

[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.160]
I'm doing good. I, Craig.

[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:17.780]
Hi there.

[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:18.640]
Champagne, lady.

[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.060]
How are you?

[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.540]
Doing great.

[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.260]
What should I know?

[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.940]
It's called yesterday to the station.

[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.660]
And oh, I waited and waited and waited.

[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.540]
And I was on one visit.

[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.340]
I want you to know.

[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:30.600]
And I just made up my mind.

[00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.380]
I was going to find out.

[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.840]
I just do what they were going to say.

[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.920]
I knew they were going to say, well, we had all of the animal

[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.580]
lovers braiding up and down this morning

[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.960]
because of what he said about that little chihuahua.

[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.340]
We had one of the funniest calls I ever got the other night.

[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.240]
A lady called in and talked about her son-in-law.

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.040]
She didn't like.

[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.860]
But when her daughter was away, was having...

[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.420]
I didn't even let her go.

[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.180]
I dumped her.

[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.260]
No, no, no.

[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.300]
Well, it was funny.

[00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.960]
We haven't dumped this guy.

[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:00.800]
I can't believe it.

[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.700]
I guess this is the kind of stuff they do overnight.

[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.460]
I guess.

[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.140]
Well, you can do stuff between midnight and midnight.

[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.120]
But this is not midnight.

[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:06.940]
It was clinical.

[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:07.640]
It was clinical.

[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.200]
We have people monitoring this show now as we speak.

[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.280]
We would just love to hear those kinds of things.

[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.440]
Well, they can play me for that.

[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:14.880]
That was a joke.

[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:15.620]
That happened.

[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.340]
You're not working.

[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.460]
They can't get you fired.

[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.980]
I have no money until they can't serve me.

[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.880]
That's what I figured I was going to hear.

[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.820]
You know, that that was the reason that they let you go.

[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.880]
No, no, that had nothing to do with it.

[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.880]
But it was so funny because it just made me realize

[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.920]
you were the only one who had many things to do.

[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.200]
It's so funny.

[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.280]
God, all right.

[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.120]
I'm not going to let any of you go.

[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.560]
We didn't leave on bad terms.

[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.960]
I know everybody liked to see me sit here and rank them.

[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.200]
But I, you know, I'm hurt.

[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.200]
Well, we already did.

[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.240]
But I, you know, what he's used to it.

[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.500]
I've been in a business a long time.

[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.680]
He's getting used to getting juked.

[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.920]
Well, I've been following a very long time.

[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.260]
I took my glasses on last night to listen to Sally.

[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:54.080]
She still looks down.

[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.020]
He better straight down to Ross.

[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:55.500]
Yeah.

[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.260]
Well, she'd sound better if she were live.

[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.940]
That's what a problem is.

[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.240]
She's got, she's got an on Courtney disease.

[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:02.960]
And let me tell you.

[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.200]
She died 20 years ago.

[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.300]
Did you look in, looking at crates pockets?

[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.460]
No, I haven't looked in crates pockets.

[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:08.740]
That's a pretty much a job.

[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:09.640]
And he travels late.

[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.400]
And he used to be a DJ.

[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.600]
And he's got two tapes.

[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.620]
One's prudence, candy, singing Massachusetts.

[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.040]
And the other one is the onion frog.

[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.020]
Good talking to you.

[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.480]
Thank you.

[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.600]
I can have a great life.

[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.000]
It's 11.35 a.w.I.o.D.

[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.620]
We have an open line, Dave Kray-Bowler.

[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:34.720]
OK, Lee.

[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:35.740]
I'm a wonderful show.

[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.900]
It's 21 till noon.

[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.460]
I beg your pardon.

[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.280]
You play your own stuff?

[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:40.280]
Yeah.

[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:40.960]
Oh, that's great.

[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.740]
I've been doing it for years.

[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.900]
Anyway, you control everything.

[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.200]
Yeah.

[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:46.720]
That's great.

[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.580]
Not the spots that spots are in there,

[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.240]
but like all this other nonsense we have over here.

[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.000]
That's nice.

[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.120]
Yes, it is.

[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.320]
Anyway, here's Port Lauderdale.

[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:55.600]
Hello.

[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:56.380]
Hi.

[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:57.060]
Hi.

[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:57.620]
Hi, Craig.

[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:58.020]
Hi.

[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.640]
I call the station too.

[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.220]
I found that you weren't there.

[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:02.380]
Yes.

[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.380]
And if you asked, I asked about.

[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.480]
What did he clean out that shelves or what?

[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.060]
Well, you know, I just find it's eating like it's the last

[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:11.620]
supper, man.

[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.360]
Free take.

[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.840]
And they put me on hold.

[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.800]
And then I call back and ask for someone about introduction.

[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.480]
And I told them, this is how I tell you, we've got 40 people

[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.300]
at work that listen to you for the whole four hours.

[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:27.580]
And we've also had a meeting.

[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.680]
Where the hell were you when I was dying for a phone call

[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.740]
at 4.30 in the morning?

[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.720]
Well, we can't get away from work.

[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.200]
I understand.

[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.780]
You know, to call, but we do listen.

[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.960]
And we have all switched to WIOD and that's how I knew you're

[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:41.140]
going to be asking for that.

[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.120]
Well, thank God for that.

[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.000]
Are you listening, Dennis?

[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:43.600]
Did you hear that?

[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.040]
I'll show you all this thing, hopefully here before.

[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.180]
You know, I appreciate it.

[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.580]
But you know, what can they say when you call it?

[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:53.000]
Because again, it was it was a decision that I don't believe

[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.060]
that they really wanted to make, but they were forced to make.

[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.460]
I'm just waiting for you to pop up somewhere again.

[00:51:58.940 --> 00:51:59.480]
You'll wait.

[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.280]
Don't pop up.

[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:00.780]
Trust me.

[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.860]
My children are waiting.

[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.000]
They're up at Kmart waiting.

[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.720]
You know, I waited to hear Neil do my invitation because they say

[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.520]
he does it does me better than I do me.

[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.480]
Oh, I just, which obviously he's working.

[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.540]
Well, you're a breath of fresh air.

[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.180]
Get out of here.

[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:19.860]
I've told I've heard my station and it's not going back on WNW.

[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.560]
Well, congratulations.

[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:21.480]
I'm going to talk to you.

[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.120]
Don't do that.

[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:22.780]
Have a good day.

[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:23.580]
Thank you.

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:24.140]
Thank you.

[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:25.560]
I can't tell you.

[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.620]
You know, I finally did hear you.

[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.820]
You know how I finally heard you?

[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.560]
Somebody called the show one night about, I don't know,

[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.100]
you're in a half two years ago and the played you,

[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.300]
imitating me.

[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.620]
My daughter used to say, oh, daddy, you got to hear him.

[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.740]
When he does it, he sounds better than you and Larry's

[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.260]
and tell me and everybody's been telling me, and I never heard

[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:44.760]
you do it.

[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.340]
I've heard a request for it.

[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.880]
I heard I used to hear Greg Budella and the other fella.

[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.120]
I came, sorry, I forgot his name.

[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:51.220]
Donald.

[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.360]
Yeah, do it.

[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.420]
But I, well, everybody heard Donald's not on there anymore.

[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.020]
Oh, really?

[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.760]
They used to do imitations of you.

[00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.080]
Don Agganese, I just, I'm sorry.

[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.060]
That's his name, all right.

[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.200]
He's not there anymore.

[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:02.720]
Not on the air.

[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.420]
Not on the air.

[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.000]
They had like a falling out, I guess.

[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.240]
I tell you, those no,

[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:08.000]
Greg, you look like Mary, it's a Donald.

[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.280]
Oh, daddy.

[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.280]
No, getting again.

[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.200]
I wish him well.

[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.720]
My soda, it's 19 till noon at WIOD.

[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.460]
Craig wording is here.

[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.420]
You don't see me as telling.

[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:15.920]
What?

[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:17.720]
Let me say this.

[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.900]
Greg Budella is one of those enigmas.

[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.640]
In other words, you can't figure him out.

[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.700]
In other words, you can't stay mad at him.

[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.060]
I can't stay mad at him.

[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.400]
He's had a lot of problems and he still keeps bouncing back.

[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.800]
You know, but at the same time, he's like Peck's bad boy.

[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.820]
You know, and every now and then he'll turn on you on the air.

[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.840]
Like when I was at him in the morning,

[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.580]
see, if you remember when I was doing mid days on wins,

[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.280]
it was the most incredible thing ever.

[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.880]
I had all these FM people not already calling in,

[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.020]
but they were doing bits for us, setting this material.

[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:47.920]
It was great.

[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.520]
Like your legendary, man, but you're on AM.

[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.800]
See, so you're not a threat.

[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:52.120]
Yeah.

[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.060]
Soon as we went on Zeta,

[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.000]
all of a sudden, they're ripping me, man.

[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.420]
Of course, I rip him right back like Joey and Greg and even

[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.340]
Tanner was a little hysterical there for a while.

[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.900]
And now that I'm back on AM, it's just the opposite again.

[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:05.980]
So not a threat, right?

[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.160]
Because I was beating the crap out of all of them in the morning

[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.420]
and they were too happy about it.

[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:09.980]
You sure did?

[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:10.980]
And that's short time.

[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.840]
I mean, what if it stayed on FM a little longer?

[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.480]
Oh, by the way, I forgot.

[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.680]
To mention, we had Joey on here a week or two ago.

[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.640]
So we've had Stan.

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.900]
See, that's my, we have Tom Jicco, who reviews radio and TV.

[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.800]
And our only other guests are unemployed radio people.

[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.640]
That's those are the ground rules for the guest on the show.

[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.780]
Johnny Darky.

[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.320]
Johnny Darky.

[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.540]
We have to end now and I'm plenty.

[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.420]
You love Johnny Dark.

[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.780]
I remember Johnny Dark as I read it.

[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.360]
I like it.

[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.880]
Okay, I liked Johnny Dark.

[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.040]
He loves Johnny Darky.

[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:36.940]
I hear him talking about it.

[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.460]
Come on, Johnny.

[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:41.700]
And I we used to go away together back in the 60s, Craig and

[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.380]
Sarah Soda.

[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.820]
I've known Johnny longer than I was.

[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:45.820]
40.

[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:46.340]
Are you?

[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:46.740]
Yeah.

[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.880]
I've known Johnny for like what, 22 years or something.

[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.460]
You know, so yeah, he's one of my best friends.

[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.500]
By the way, how were phone calls overnight?

[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.800]
What was the story of those?

[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.060]
Really, they weren't bad.

[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.180]
Oh, I would say we had to go all eight lines lit up there.

[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.340]
We never had all eight lines, but they were like mine.

[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.400]
But, you know, they were some mornings for 30 could be a little tough.

[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.920]
But I'm not whole, they weren't bad.

[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:09.820]
We got a mobile and proud.

[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:10.200]
Hello.

[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:10.840]
Hello.

[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:11.400]
Hi.

[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.820]
Hi, it's Craig there.

[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:13.880]
Hi, I'm Craig.

[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:15.500]
How are you doing?

[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.040]
I had an opportunity to meet you about about a year ago on your traffic accident.

[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.520]
On my traffic accident?

[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:22.880]
Yeah.

[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:25.080]
Were you a police officer?

[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:25.800]
Yes, I was.

[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.200]
Oh, the new or the guy was nice to me because I was scared, crapless.

[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.560]
Yes, I remember you were hurt, you had some problems with your shoulder.

[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:33.960]
Yeah.

[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.080]
I wanted to, you know, give me a call in the past on your show.

[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.840]
Well, you were terrific to me.

[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.540]
You were very good to me and I appreciate that.

[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.360]
Even though you gave me a ticket and I deserved it.

[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.080]
Well, yeah, I had no choice.

[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:45.620]
I had to.

[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.040]
I agree.

[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:51.120]
Of course, my insurance shot right up through the sky on it, but that's my own damn fault.

[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.900]
I wasn't paying attention and zipped, you know.

[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:57.340]
I didn't, somebody pointed out to me who you were after the fact.

[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.480]
I didn't know at the time.

[00:55:58.940 --> 00:55:59.100]
Right.

[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.520]
I didn't recognize an aim.

[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:06.600]
I just didn't put it together and it was kind of amusing afterwards because I heard you talking about it on the station.

[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.860]
Oh, I talk about everything.

[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:08.760]
Well, most everything.

[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:09.540]
We didn't live us.

[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:10.840]
Don't look at me like that, Neil.

[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.420]
I see that little liver.

[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.180]
Don't push me, Craig.

[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:15.900]
Don't push me.

[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.220]
No, no, I love you, Neil.

[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:17.840]
What do you want?

[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:18.360]
Eat.

[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:18.700]
Eat.

[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.260]
Are you paying the fine?

[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.800]
No, I'm sorry, sir.

[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.000]
I was sitting here a little in stuff.

[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:23.500]
Go ahead.

[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.060]
Did you get out of this?

[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:25.900]
Did you pay the fine?

[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.220]
Or did you just never just get out of this?

[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:28.620]
Of course I paid the fine.

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.100]
Oh, did you?

[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:29.980]
50 dollar fine.

[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:30.380]
I paid it.

[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.780]
No, we were to play out a warrant for your arrest.

[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.440]
Well, well, I'm ready now.

[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.040]
Oh, OK.

[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.960]
You know, you're going to arrest me now because I have no place particularly to go.

[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.740]
But I thank you because you were good to me that day.

[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.000]
OK, then I just wanted to give you a call.

[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:43.440]
OK, great hearing from you.

[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.080]
Good luck to you.

[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:44.620]
Thank you.

[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.340]
Thank you, Daddy.

[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.320]
He's the first kid on the block and he wakes up right in the morning.

[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.700]
And he knows he's a little nutty.

[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.280]
He knows he's a little squirly.

[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.760]
Where do we see that?

[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.200]
You're going to go in the record just to say hello.

[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.120]
Hi, I just see what you're all doing out there.

[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.600]
And I'm going to get out of the data for you.

[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.020]
But just so, come on, Neil.

[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.540]
OK, now that wasn't the one you wanted, but that was Heather.

[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.860]
That was one of our list of your daughters who recorded that.

[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:15.880]
It was about four days old.

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:15.880]

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:15.880]

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:15.880]

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:15.880]

[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:15.880]

[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.380]
A celebrity caller on the Palm Beach Line.

[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:19.800]
Hello.

[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.000]
Hi, Neil.

[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:21.420]
It's Sunny.

[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:23.240]
It's Sunny.

[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:24.080]
How's your share?

[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.340]
Is that in Fox?

[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:26.480]
Is that in Fox?

[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.020]

[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.100]
Good doing that routine.

[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.320]
Well, yeah, I was getting over the flu.

[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.980]
Oh, you don't sound too good, Sunny.

[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.420]
No, I don't feel very good either.

[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.820]
In fact, I'm trying to get out to do some agency work.

[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.100]
All my voice sounds like this.

[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.320]
Yeah, I'm a real good.

[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:42.740]
Maybe you can do some stuff for WOLV because you can't understand their signal anyway.

[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:43.640]
So to make much difference.

[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.040]
Really, it was sort of blend right here.

[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:45.380]
Yeah.

[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.800]
So how you doing, Sunny?

[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.580]
Well, I'm not supposed to call, but to hell with it.

[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.180]
Yeah, his management won't let him call.

[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:52.840]
Right.

[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.040]
He's not working for like that.

[00:57:54.040 --> 00:58:04.200]
I was dealing with a stand that I spoke to a couple days ago, but I had to call you because you've been telling you stories about how they always fire you when you're not after you get off the air, right after you get off.

[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.100]
Right.

[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.280]
So you will go on stage.

[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:07.000]

[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:07.340]
Right.

[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.720]
Say something negative, right?

[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:08.880]
Yeah.

[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.840]
So I want to tell you this quick story.

[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.120]
I was working at Chum and Toronto in Canada.

[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.240]
I know it well.

[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:14.960]
1010.

[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.720]
The worst two years of my career.

[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.140]
And they have engineers up there.

[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.940]
So you don't run the records or anything, just talk.

[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.980]
And they turn your microphone on and off.

[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.500]
Well, I had resigned.

[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.240]
It was about to go to San Diego at that time in 1972.

[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:35.240]
And I even thought to myself at the time of the year, if you don't be hokey, don't be soopey, I just say thanks for listening.

[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:35.580]
Goodbye.

[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.400]
The last break, the last show, I opened my mouth to say goodbye.

[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.420]
They turned the microphone off.

[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:45.620]
Are you serious?

[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.260]
I did.

[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:46.780]

[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:52.420]
What says a lot of that company, you know, very corporate, but they were just scared to death.

[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.900]
I was going to come on for some reason.

[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.720]
I don't think you have to say that if you're a professional, you're a professional.

[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.080]
Why would you risk your career?

[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:58.400]
Sure.

[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.560]
Why would you want to jeopardize a whole rest of your career just for the sake of, you know.

[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.000]
Really?

[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:08.040]
That's why I found it rather fascinating, you guys, you and the Blaine doing the last few days of today.

[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.340]
I was waiting for them, like, brushed into the room, you know.

[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:16.760]
Well, you know, the thing of it was, we were on for a couple of weeks and we already knew, you know, that we were a parting company.

[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:21.000]
And we were trying to do it in a real, you know, quiet way and not let it out of the bag.

[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:26.700]
And then Tim Williams, the GM over there, who's, you know, a real brain surgeon, he tells the herald that we're leaving.

[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.860]
And that we're having this, you know, all of a sudden, a crap.

[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:30.660]
And now it's in the paper the next morning.

[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:33.740]
I just thought I couldn't believe it on the front page of the local section.

[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.080]
And what are we supposed to do?

[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.720]
The front page of the front section?

[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.000]
Yes.

[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:38.340]
Wow.

[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.020]
Remember above the mast head?

[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:46.500]
A lot of things in management can do to you while you're employed and you pretty much expressed all of them over the years.

[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.680]
But that's the one thing that blows me away.

[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.760]
Don't turn their mic on, they might, you know.

[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:51.300]
Yeah.

[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:52.680]
What kind of credibility do they have?

[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.400]
Well, it goes to sure.

[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.640]
They think they think they were as devious as they are.

[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:56.380]
That's a problem.

[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.980]
Oh, good point.

[00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.220]
And I'm going to go back to bed.

[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.540]
Okay, I hope you feel better.

[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.980]
How is everything going, Sonny?

[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.740]
You're going to see some great headlines very shortly.

[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.100]
Good.

[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:05.700]
Okay.

[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.260]
Can I ask Sonny a question?

[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.080]
You don't remember me?

[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.900]
We met a few times at Easter's Seal telephones when you were at Channel 6.

[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:12.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.360]
I say that you once worked at QAM and I'm told you never did.

[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.020]
Did you or not?

[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:17.740]
No, no.

[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.260]
You never worked at QAM?

[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.180]
No, I'm sorry.

[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:20.800]
I didn't know.

[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:24.320]
Frank wants to know that for his next trivia show that he's going to be doing.

[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.560]
I could have sworn I heard him on QAM once many years ago.

[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.320]
No, and I also, like I said, didn't host a kid show in New York.

[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.280]
I know that.

[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:34.080]
I'd love to.

[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:34.560]
Okay.

[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.780]
I hope you'll be having a great day.

[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:36.840]
Bye.

[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.880]
I met him the other day for the first time.

[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.840]
I love the nice styles.

[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:40.700]
Oh, soupy.

[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.320]
I think that's sunny.

[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.320]
No, I've met sunny.

[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.720]
But you guys were here in town.

[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.800]
I used to be.

[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:45.860]
I used to just die.

[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.820]
You remember that old man, the kid showed in New York.

[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:49.140]

[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.440]
And there was not really a kid show in the Delk College crowd.

[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.460]
The kid show for adults.

[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:53.780]
Yeah.

[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.540]
And he always used to have here that, remember the day he did the show where the one

[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.760]
was the postman and was a woman on the other side.

[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.460]
There was Stark naked, which you didn't see.

[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:02.800]
Yeah.

[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.560]
But he did.

[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.580]
And it was a live show and he fell on the floor and was just rolling around

[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.420]
and holding his sides.

[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.020]
It was incredible.

[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.340]
We used to gather at my apartment across Memphis in college just to...

[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.420]
It was a cult show for college.

[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:12.660]
Yeah.

[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.180]
Really was.

[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.460]
Now, when the time he told all the kids to go to Mommy and Daddy's wallets and

[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.400]
purses and get that funny green paper out.

[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.780]
And he got fired for that.

[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.420]
Because they did.

[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.680]
They sent it all kinds of money.

[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.880]
You know, the Uncle Soupy, no matter what he told him to do.

[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.660]
Oh, Margate, hello.

[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.080]
Margate, hi.

[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:30.760]
Yes.

[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.300]
Finally, it's like all kinds.

[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.840]
Neil, you've been seeing some pompano.

[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:36.860]
How are you doing?

[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.300]
The goodness sake, Brian.

[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.100]
I'm calm and I'm feeling good.

[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:41.960]
Listen, Neil.

[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:42.360]
Yeah.

[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.140]
You want some pompano, but to Quake, I'm seeing the poodle lady.

[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.040]
Whatever.

[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.740]
Yeah, hi, Craig.

[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.540]
Hi, how are you?

[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.280]
Thank you for calling.

[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:51.560]
What's that?

[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.780]
Hi, how are you doing?

[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.140]
How about a good time?

[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:54.720]
I know.

[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.020]
I'm enjoying it.

[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.360]
You know, going back to the time when you were both on WQ 18.

[01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:02.260]
Oh, yes.

[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:02.980]
How could we forget?

[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.500]
I'm going to move everything.

[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.160]
Because I've listened since that time.

[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.800]
I thank you for your loyalty.

[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.160]
You have yourself a good day, Craig.

[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.200]
Thank you, Jim.

[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.480]
Craig just said goodbye to you.

[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.620]
Anyway, I never finished that story since we got 20 seconds before the news.

[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.440]
I'm in the flagship bank on Alton Road.

[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.220]
You're ready to catch my paycheck.

[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:22.540]
I'm going to check in here.

[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.040]
It's the late Eucola Catsentine who owned the radio station.

[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.080]
It was about 100 years old.

[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.300]
Stand with more money than God.

[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.600]
Standing in line about three people in front of me.

[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:30.700]
She turns around and sees me.

[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.760]
Oh, Neil, do you feel rich today?

[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.800]
And I said not quite yet, but I'm sure that when I cash this, I really will.

[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.300]
My $225 minus deductions, OK?

[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.500]
But do you remember the great Christmas basket with the turkey?

[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.160]
Oh, yeah.

[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.680]
When we come back, we'll talk about that.

[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.200]
April Worms got the new NWIOD news, I think, right?

[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.820]
And we'll come back with Craig Worthinger 1205.
