[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920]
Grabber. I've got pipes there. Hey 75 degrees and a magic city. Hey, we're broadcasting live. Hold on a second. Let me let me stuff that over

[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:19.920]
75 degrees and a magic city hills and other great songs all over your radio dial. Come on down with it. We're gonna get down tonight

[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.380]
We're gonna get groovy. It's the right time. Well, what they hell about talking about? I'm only with a well, I tell you what

[00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:37.480]
Here's another great song on your great radio station. Hey, it's rock and roll, baby. Yeah, 1016 and W I O D. What was I doing here? Oh, I

[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.680]
Want to take there's somebody on your heaths of cubs, but they'll have to wait. Coral Springs. Hello

[00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:54.400]
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on. All right, let me try this. Okay, let's try it now. Hi, Neil. That's better. Wow. Okay, it's a lot better. I caught

[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.460]
The teller and yesterday of the part of your show where you were talking about I and D's rating. Yeah, let's I got them all

[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.540]
Here again, let's go back in. Yeah, I heard you comparing them to the motivation station, which is pretty bad. What were the ratings?

[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.420]
I and Z. Yeah, pretty bad. Well, no, the thing I was talking about. If you'll listen, if you'll open yours and listen,

[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.460]
then midday 25 to 54 demographics, that's the age group, but W I N Z didn't make the list. And on the bottom of the

[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.460]
List was the motivation station with a 0.6. So that means that I and Z was under a 0.6.

[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.880]
That's pretty bad. The motivation station I listened to them the other night. If you I know that you like neutral system, but have they got a diet for you?

[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.780]
They say that they call it a balancing your food or something. If you like a lot of butter on your toast in the morning, then try a little

[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.880]
S salad dressing on your salad at once. Yeah, that'll do it. That's the kind of stuff that the motivation station. Yeah, that's what they got. Well, they actually did show this

[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:02.160]
Time for the first time in three months. And I and Z didn't not in midday. Okay, that's all I want to thank a lot. Okay, I'm sure that

[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:11.900]
Everybody feel a lot better knowing that W I N Z, which maybe kicking ass into Bahamas is dead. In fact, they should share the billboard with Zeta.

[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.180]
They should have both of them on the tombstone together. What a great idea.

[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.420]
I mean, when the motivation station and K T Beach, who else did I want to mention again? Probably we should go over

[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:34.080]
Love 94's numbers one more time. Those are beauties. Yeah. And there were a couple of others in here like a morning show on Zeta with a 1.5.

[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.380]
They're doing it now. They are doing it. We can't say what? Well, listen, we got a couple open lines on this board here.

[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.960]
And I realize we haven't given the numbers out yet, but that's getting pretty disgusting. One in brown, one in Palm Beach.

[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.780]
And the rumbling starts again next door. We're not going to have another one of those days. Are we? I should fight wise.

[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.600]
The comment was if this starts again, come see me. The only problem is he's never here. Well, I will tell you I went in and I blew up.

[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.820]
I screamed at Gary Bruce. I did. I did. I just started again. Just as I was in the middle of the head in there, just started again.

[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:22.620]
And now it now the amazing part of it is he's been working in their Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We haven't heard of people. Everything's been great. He's been doing his work.

[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.680]
All of a sudden here it is Thursday and it's like he's got some kind of a mental lapse like his Alzheimer's is kicking in again.

[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.940]
Okay. Maybe it's hanging around with vermin in McQueen too much or something over there, but there's some. That child's got some kind of a problem.

[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.900]
Well, I'm afraid to go over there because I don't want to see blood shed in the building today, especially yours.

[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.640]
Here's a cheap mobile phone. Hello. Well, that's what Roger said. Roger said you got a cheap mobile phone. It sounds like hell. Maybe it's the carrier.

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:01.860]
I get a New York City report for it. Just got back in my truck. They try to call you. I don't know everybody talked about how it's done and how great he is.

[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:10.820]
I mean, he really nothing. I mean, don't I am. Make Howard Stern look like he's not. Well, I agree with that. Although Howard beats him, but I agree that I'm just going to.

[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:20.580]
Yeah, but the show is much more creative. The I'm is the show is really funny. Yeah, I agree with him. As a matter of fact, I'm sorry that you can't do the same type of show.

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:30.920]
That he's done. Why is that? Well, you get a little more warranty than you do. Well, yeah, but this is Miami and it's a very parochial backwater.

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.140]
I mean, I don't know what I do. I mean, I don't know what I do. What I do is I'm sorry, you can't do it. I'm just saying you won't do it.

[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.200]
But I mean, I always really just there. I really cracked up. He was really funny and the thing that he has on his show is really good. Yeah.

[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:53.580]
And it's a shame that you couldn't. Well, we don't want to. We're doing whatever. I mean, there's some other stuff that we used to play that would be fun to play once in a while.

[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.200]
It's not a big deal. I mean, we're kicking ass. Being in hell out of everybody. That's all I count.

[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.140]
I don't have a problem with that. Well, I'm saying to you. No, I understand. It's funny. It's too bad. We're here. Well, I agree with that too.

[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.420]
If we could take the weather and I'll go to New York, then we'll be great. I'll see you at the mental land. Right.

[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:21.220]
20 after 10 at W I O D. We have an opening in Palm Beach. 655 W I O D. So anyway, Gary Reedus is on third base in the bottom of the 10th inning.

[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.440]
With one out the score, a scoreless ball game. There's no way that the Cubs aren't going to lose, right?

[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.540]
And Don Zimmer intentionally walks two men in a row. RJ Reynolds and Barry bonds to fill the bases. And here's Jose Lee.

[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:48.700]
The Maddox goes three and one on Jose Lee. One more wide one forces in the winning run, the losing run for the Cubs. Now it's three and two.

[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.680]
And here's a ground ball to third and Vance lost steps on the bag for the force to end the inning. Just incredible. I can't get over it.

[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.340]
And someone we know is turn his mic in the opposite direction, which is fine with me. It's a 21 past 10 at W I O D.

[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.060]
We do have it opening in date. If you move real quickly, let's get the Cubs. Hey, Ron. This will make him feel better. Hello.

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:15.920]
All I know is that the sun's better keep with because the metzer right. All those metzer are doing it, man. What do you get three hits yesterday? That's the right. Yeah, that's all right.

[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:26.020]
We get the hits that count the hits that count. Got it. You better keep Howard Johnson healthy. I'll tell you that isn't isn't he the guy they wanted to trade all during the preseason. They were desperate to get rid of them.

[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:36.700]
That's right. You're right. They know their players, man. But that one Samuel. He's going to have at least two or three hits for them this year. You want that? Well, that was a worse trade. I have a terrible trade. Man, Dykes is a good ball player.

[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:48.820]
Great. Well, good luck to you guys. You too, guy. Okay. Bye. Bye. You don't hate the Cubs. He's all right. He was a decent guy. Roger's getting like Nick. Now he puts inflammatory comments on the calls just to, you know, stir it up a little bit.

[00:06:49.220 --> 00:07:01.680]
Kind of a Steve Kane syndrome. By the way, Steve today, thank God has open phones. He originally was going to do baby selling part two. Believe it or not, which had many of the people in the building impaling themselves on any sharp object they could find.

[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:09.680]
And you know those spindles that you put your messages on, you know those that stick straight up. What do they call those spindles? Mike spindle.

[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:22.520]
And there were people grabbing those all over the building and trying to impale themselves when they saw the schedule here. But the good news is you don't have to wait till another day. No baby selling part two on the cane show today. We have open phones today.

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:29.100]
And there are a lot of people who are going to church praying right now thanking the Lord 23 past 10 at W. I. D. We'll be right back.

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:43.480]
1027 at W. I. D. One open line. If you want to get in on this, so going to be quite a show today have the feeling already just the ambiance of the building is starting to create a feeling in my bones.

[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:57.620]
524 W. I. D. We have an Alice Spirey port on the Palm Beach line. Hello. Hello guys. How you doing? Great. Well yesterday at two o'clock, you know, when I found out what Steve show was going to be, which Steve Steve with open phones is great. I agree with you. Yeah.

[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:07.500]
Yeah. If you were guest, get those guests off. Steve, get rid of them. Steve, you're great. But the guest suck. He gets hung up on those topics, you know, like this baby selling or whatever the whole.

[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:17.840]
I'm not upset. But it all kind of ties in together. He's in this baby thing. You know, yeah. Well, you know, so anyway, I'm punching around a little bit and all of a sudden I punch up Alice.

[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:28.520]
And which, you know, I guess I'm one of the few people. But so anyway, Alice is talking about the two Neanderthals that are laughing and making fun everybody on the other station. Really?

[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:38.360]
And then he takes a little cheap shot about the adult cinema. Really? He says, yeah, probably hanging around the adult cinema. You know what I'm saying? Like that.

[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:53.400]
So, you know, I mean, during our spare time, we all go over, we drive down to Hollywood and we hang out just outside. Don't go in anymore. Not too dangerous. Well, you know, I can't wait out in the parking lot and just check out who might be going in. You know, I got to say one thing. I've been to a lot of tall movies. And you know, I do.

[00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:06.140]
There's a lot. So is Alice. Well, listen, I'm sure he has. And you know, I'm going to start telling you which kind of well listen. I already know because I happen to know what the deal is.

[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:23.380]
Thanks quite an imagination to read out that thing that got me was, you know, last week I punched him up one time and he's foaming at the mouth over Lynn Russell. How gorgeous she is and everything. Yeah, she really does it for him. Yeah. Well, I got to say Lynn Russell. I think she's hot looking too, you know, but, you know, that's. But I just.

[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:31.920]
She's a little anorexic looking because I used to work with Lynn at the cat, but she's an attractively. I think she's attractive. And then Debbie comes on and says, well, I'm jealous of you.

[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.740]
And you know, the straight. Oh, straight.

[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.740]
Demick over there. Yeah, they're trying to ride the cranks of a straight. And it was good for a two eight in this trend.

[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:47.600]
Man, Steve had a four six. Alice had a two eight. I mean, you know, no wonder he wants to talk about anything, but the number is because he doesn't have any.

[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:57.960]
Right. And one more little shot. I got to take care of the only thing he doesn't have. But that's another story. What was the W I and the 25 to 54 numbers on afternoon drive?

[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.200]
Oh, and after one one one one. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. When Stan was there, they did five.

[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:14.080]
There were five. Yeah. That's what I just said. Well, you know, I try to control yourself. I know you're emotionally charged now, but try to.

[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.740]
I am, you know, but the, the, the excuse was they couldn't sell the show. Well, they can't sell any show over there. I'm trying to think.

[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:26.600]
Not the excuses. They can't sell it because they don't have any numbers. So they've always got seven. Well, you know, what comes around goes around.

[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:33.740]
Yeah. And the amazing part of it is much of our sales department came from over there. So that should give you a real good insight. Well, tell you, you guys got your work cut out for you.

[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:43.120]
Yeah. Let me just make sure. Let me verify what I just said because I don't want to give any bogus numbers. Now, let's see. W snooze had a one five in the afternoon, 25. That's Alice.

[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:53.120]
And I know I take it back. I and he went from a one eight to a one two. So I cheated him out of a tenth of a point. What are really doing it? They're doing it. Have a great day. Thanks a lot.

[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:10.620]
So Alice is really getting pretty raunchy, huh? I heard that what preceded him yesterday was about as raunchies you can get. But of course, Alice doesn't make too much out of it. They try to like skip on by, you know. Look at that. It's old Henry Barrow in there standing up, stooping over in the control room. Yeah.

[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:24.680]
I guess he must have left some of his stash behind. I came back into get it. 10 30 at W I O D. We do have it opening in Palm Beach, which is pretty damn depressing. 655 W I O D. Those two. What was the word neanderthal?

[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:36.760]
Neanderthal on that other station who spend their time ripping everybody. G with that. So mean. He's so mean. You know what he's so mean to me. Miami. Hello.

[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:59.120]
The mean is me. Yeah. And old meanie. Right with. Right. We okay. No, I was thinking Queenie, but that's okay. Same difference. I guess. I'm a met's fan from Miami. All right, Steve. I want to congratulate you on your coves. I did a great job yesterday. Thank you. There it is. It's the 22nd of June and we're still in first place. So it would be very interesting if you guys were in there September. You know, because I hate going up against Montreal.

[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:10.580]
You're going to be four teams all the way down to the wire. All the four teams that are up there right now. Believe me. Look out for Montreal. Oh boy, they're tough. Yeah, I hope the best team win. That would be kind of neat. Yeah. And I want to tell you the truth of the Cubs would be too upsetting.

[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:21.900]
Because Harry's a pretty good guy. He needs to get a world surgery for. He leaves us exactly which could be soon away. These games are going. I'm telling you, but the one nothing that you know what I do is I watch CNN sports headline news.

[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:29.900]
I catch the scores and I get the herald and they don't have the scores. And one nothing in 11 innings. Not too bad. Yeah.

[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:49.620]
Glenn, did you play baseball when you were younger? Leave me alone. Seriously, did you play baseball when you were younger? I mean, because my opinion is that people didn't play baseball when they were younger. Don't like baseball games. No. I did play baseball. There's a big difference in my brain of playing and watching. Oh, you good?

[00:12:51.440 --> 00:13:04.720]
I was wondering, maybe that's my problem is going. I don't know where it's going. He asked you where you're good. Nothing to do with any what is it? An unreasonable. No, he was pretty bad. Sir, probably he was bad. Okay. I can't understand my place. Well, you played tennis. A lot when you were young.

[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:18.120]
Yeah. So so we could add it. I don't know. Now this caller is right because you know something I never I played baseball, but I never played tennis. I never played tennis either. See, there you go. Although I could be honest with you. I love hockey and I never played hockey.

[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:34.160]
So I guess it doesn't work. This is so you're nuts, man. I know, but that's the size of the point. I think you hit a raw nerve here. Yeah, he's getting upsetting. Well, I apologize. Look, I mean, I don't meet up set you, but like when you know does go on vacation, I think the radio do drop a lot.

[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:49.560]
And well, I tell you what, when you get your show, you know, and you go on vacation, I won't listen to your fill in. I don't want to be a radio DJ though. That's not my style. Well, I thought you were an expert on analyzing the ratings. No, I'm nothing to do.

[00:13:49.560 --> 00:14:00.220]
Thought you knew all about the ratings. See, I don't think they do draw person. You know, think so. Well, they ever tested a rating like that. Well, they take ratings all year. And I don't think they do take a lap.

[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:10.500]
But it isn't a true. That there's an increase in the carts that are played when we just had a call from Dennis Collins over W. S. News is very upset about our revealing their terrible numbers. And he had a comment for it.

[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.360]
Yeah, by the way, that cart or dyno over here, that's my brother-in-law.

[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:25.460]
Is it? Yeah, supposedly I wasn't listening to it. He the doctor. No, he's a what does he do? He's an advertising. He's an advertising. Yeah, figures.

[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:47.980]
But he's like he's bringing it to me that he's playing and playing it. I mean, it doesn't impress me, but I've decided to point. No, I don't think it's him anyway. Okay. Well, this guy was your doctor and Glenn, you know, hanging their glen. And hopefully by the end of the year, you know, when the pen are raising hang up on that guy, where you get really 1034 W. I. O. D. We have an open line in day 7519463. The days are getting longer. Not to mention.

[00:14:51.240 --> 00:15:04.060]
Okay, it's 1050 at W. I. D. Not much of a show today, but don't blame us. It's the calls. Okay. Nothing I can do about it. Let's go to coconut grove. Hello. How are you doing now? Great. Can you still have the butcher front of you there?

[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:12.800]
I have all the numbers. Anything you want. I brought them in just so we could be ponderous today and repeat them over and over again. Okay. Let's hear Alice's numbers one more time. Okay.

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:39.480]
Give me some of the numbers for W. W. E. D. R. Well, let's see. Let me just really didn't get any. No. Okay. Man 18 plus W. E. D. R. is on the. Well, it's not on the second page. It's not on the third page. It's on a fourth page. You went from a 25 to a 1 5. Wow. That's unusual. That's the lowest number they've had in a long time.

[00:15:40.420 --> 00:16:01.180]
I'm person's 12 plus Monday to Sunday, 6 a.m. the midnight. This is the most. Meaningful one. I guess they're not on the second page. They're not on the third. Boy, this is incredible. They went from a 22 to a 1 5. I guess how one of five was taking a lot of their audience away. I think. Yeah, because they're like in the desperate.

[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.060]
for the

[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.060]

[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:09.620]
25 to 54 as well let's take a look okay i don't think you like it but uh... because it

[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.480]
doesn't sound like they're sent the world on fire

[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.040]
25 to 54 here's the weekend you don't care about that

[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.000]
well let's see how about in this day part midday

[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.280]
they're not on the second page

[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.520]
they're not on the third page

[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.760]
they went from a two one to a one three

off-friend of mr. baseball

[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.940]
well this is a bit of a mr. baseball this is the big guy who stands here for four

[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.320]
hours and the leans over the table and keeps repeating the same things and brings

[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.420]
that gooney guy over and like nobody else was doing it

[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:10.020]
what i mean i really know nobody i know i don't want to don't be like a child okay

[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.800]
nobody else was doing that's not the point

[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.980]
you know about the words

[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.460]
that's mr. s is that that's your buddy i never said anything about you

[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.440]
about you first of all i'm not the one that's got the big problem with your steves

[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.640]
the one that's got the big problem with you i have a problem with mr.

[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.840]
rest and the guy with the dog okay but you threw me and i mean like i threw you in

[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.680]
because steve doesn't want you there okay and since we all have to be there

[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.960]
together and i've gotten my couple of people i don't want there and he's

[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.880]
certainly entitled to eliminate anybody who gets on his nerves okay

[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.040]
that bone doesn't like you that bone headed mutant they called in your

[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.760]
saying said mr. s mr. baseball is going to come and make trouble with

[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.820]
both of us that's that's not true well first of all

[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.740]
see how childish this is like a couple little kids in a sandbox like you're

[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.840]
being his spokesman or something okay

[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.220]
just his presence just his being there creates trouble as far as i'm concerned

[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.600]
because the guy's a moron okay and if he's your friend it probably says something

[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.540]
what he has a moron he doesn't have anything he doesn't have anything in

[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.780]
first of all he hangs around the whole time he looks like somebody poured about

[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.840]
forty five hundred pounds of lard into into a tube

[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.060]
and he just stands there in perspires and runs around yelling

[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.940]
and catches clear and well that's his opinion he's entitled to it but i don't

[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.020]
most of us care okay in fact that catches on lary king did i let him call in

[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.300]
that show tonight okay i want to mention one other thing okay i like i said i admit

[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.200]

[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.880]
a couple of times back when we do these remotes wherever it is the object is to get a good crowd

[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:06.280]
sell cars sell boats whatever it is you know that we happen to be doing and that always it's always

[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:12.640]
the case okay but the bottom line is I said it before and I'll say it again it's not that I don't

[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.180]
appreciate people who like the show but I I'm not particularly fond of obsessive groupies okay

[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.140]

[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.740]
i don't think it's gonna make any difference okay because they're writing the crest of that

[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.440]
obscure gimmick over there and that's what they've been doing so Alice is writing the crest

[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.740]
of the straight gimmick now is that it with his two eight all the way to the bottom one thing

growing up just a little bit just a little bit it doesn't offend me or anything like that but

[01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.690]

[01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:35.350]
yeah well that's because nobody's here all the time management is always the way

[01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:43.590]

[01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:56.630]
yeah he could just learn to say waxy FF he'd get on here on Sunday night

[01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:02.290]
I like it

[01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.710]
yeah

[01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:11.990]
excellent great record

[01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:17.090]
you know how come it is that we can sit here and just put it on and listen to it and know it's good

[01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:21.050]
we don't have any focus groups call a consultant

[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:26.030]
oh I don't like this business I really don't this I don't care what Rinerie says and I hope he

[01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:29.290]
has a great time on his vacation by the way but he's wrong this is not a good business the

[01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:33.710]
terrible business because nobody almost nobody knows what the hell are doing anyway it's called

[01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:41.250]
seal little light produced written and sung by Bob M O U L D mold is that a hit it's on virgin

[01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:45.590]
records by the way so how bad can it be I don't know that means we can play it in Miami it's on

[01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:52.470]
virgin records untouched by human parks anyway we'll find out from some of our music intensive

[01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:56.310]
pinheads if that's a big hit by the way done the best of Neil Saturday while we're out of Toyota

[01:11:56.310 --> 01:12:01.570]
they can be listening the entire birds birthday show good show when we had a whole cast of

[01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:06.530]
thousands in here we had Johnny dark and we had just tons of food and Hank Olberg and

[01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:15.890]
that rich fat rich of course it's a good day yeah pompano hello hello yes sir hi this is

[01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:22.590]
T.C. K. S. this week that a rear didn't top 40 my friend Glent Hill spread his butt

[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:29.410]
heat to the light okay let him 55 nice it was when we were not taking calls for all that time

[01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:34.870]
didn't you enjoy that period of time we had a really good time and there's no hostile idiots

[01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:39.730]
that was kind of funny though I thought it was just kind of cute you know it had its moments

[01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:44.310]
like we got a special dedication for that last caller which I think will be very appropriate

[01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:45.990]
and kind of fit right in

[01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.930]
figuratively speaking of course

[01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:55.670]
well I think the same thing to turn me out of the

[01:12:56.730 --> 01:13:00.510]
okay 1256 at the I didn't want to play that last line there because we have to go

[01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:06.470]
for ourselves accordingly Miami hello okay pretty good I didn't ask how you're doing but I'm

[01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:10.610]
glad you're doing pretty good it was an interesting response it was kind of like an automatic reflex

[01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.430]
oh about an hour I've been all that out of it because you thought I would say how you're doing

[01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:18.330]
but let me ask you a question yeah go ahead how are you doing okay time it's sleepy right now

[01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:26.230]
the last uh just about 10 minutes before I happen to get into car heard hour and tell talking about

[01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:31.690]
your Alice Alice not talking about you supposedly you figured out sooner or later you were talking

[01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:38.050]
about the self centered self serving person that always reads the trends on the radio and if it

[01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:43.250]
wasn't for your trends you'd be on the street well what the hell does that mean that's why saying

[01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:46.390]
that Howard Stern would I'd be on the street if he didn't have big number what does that mean

[01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:51.410]
I just got the last uh don't now let me ask you a question yeah go ahead don't we read everybody's

[01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:55.650]
numbers we just read our numbers we you know in fact um proud of the numbers and I'm happy we're

[01:13:55.650 --> 01:14:00.910]
doing well but we read everybody's numbers including allises that's what he's upset about how did he

[01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:05.910]
give did he give his numbers oh no no no I just last six seconds I need a break we'll see that

[01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:09.230]
wouldn't be self-serving because his numbers suck so bad that there would be embarrassing

[01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:13.230]
humiliating and degrading we I've been doing this on the air since way back when I was on that

[01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:16.870]
station and you know something when we were working together on that station he was always

[01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:20.650]
delighted I gave the numbers out because he had big numbers then so he was tickled to death

[01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:23.490]
because I gave his numbers to it wasn't self-serving

[01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:28.250]
fascinating in fact not only is it not self-serving it's a pubic service we do for the whole

[01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:35.010]
business because we let everybody know how they're doing I am one of your Cuban closet listeners

[01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:40.290]
great I do listen to your show completely through from one day through Friday every second of it

[01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:45.430]
excellent but don't don't let Alice find out because that's a self-serving thing to do

[01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:51.950]
service we're probably enjoying but let me ask questions to bird oh god you were doing so well

[01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:57.190]
it's a good guy this is a you know pretty decent guy here I like this I like to get

excited about that trade about yesterday our Henderson and Polonia well that's why to be

[01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:07.110]
honest with you sir he's pretty upset he liked Ricky Henderson he thought he's a hell of a ball

[01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:10.990]
player and he is so sick to his stomach that these New York themes are making all these bad

[01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:14.990]
trades that's why he's upset yeah I just don't know what I'm gonna do he didn't want to admit it but he

[01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:19.670]
can't you know Dijkstra and McDonnell that was bad enough but now Ricky Henderson he's he's

[01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:24.310]

the nice facts here's an idiotic facts with one of those look at this somebody has written

[01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:35.230]

yeah well knowing the principles involved one on six at W I D we have an open line and

[01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:19.270]

[01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:26.170]
talk shows in this market hello ma'am yes Alan what I think what you said is terrible

[01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:35.690]
you're always making fun of everybody where's my routine yeah he's getting frustrated I guess

[01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:40.390]
being a babysitter to a hundred year old plus old douchebag far it's that's their whole audience

[01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:45.250]
you know and he just he can't relate to that and Harvey from Kendall I will confess that I punched

[01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:50.730]
because I was not into Steve's topic at all yesterday and I punched over to Alice which I've done

[01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:55.330]
maybe four or five times in the last six months and I was on there for like one minute you know who

[01:18:55.330 --> 01:19:03.090]
the caller was no this is about twenty after two it was Harvey oh I just failed who even mentioned

[01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:07.310]
my name by the way what do you say that I said that what a travesty it was having Mike Thompson on

[01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:11.530]
opposite Neil and how Mike time and you know the thing with Harvey from Kendall what he says always

[01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:15.750]
makes a lot of sense but he's just so chronic that it doesn't make any it's not here Alice's response

[01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:20.730]
that's wonder what he said now she was whining whining oh why are you picking on my

[01:19:20.730 --> 01:19:29.970]
four-lotterdale hello yeah how you doing great hey the reason why I'm calling number one are you

[01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:33.310]

[01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:38.150]
all time to get off the damn phone now yeah get off the damn phone now exactly anyway I want to thank

[01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:43.590]
my boss for letting me wait all this time but a couple of things one magic why don't you call

[01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:48.750]
a tragic one oh two I've been doing that for three years okay well that's okay it's probably where

[01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:55.250]
you heard it oh probably yeah I had a your guy next door Steve I know he used to be a DJ over there

[01:19:55.250 --> 01:20:01.170]
who thank you yeah oh Steve stands for he's a big move over there that's when everyone started calling

[01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:09.870]
a tragic he was a magic I don't remember that he was with K 102 oh yeah and um

[01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:16.590]
nothing was just getting pretty heavy duty he was a KGR thanks so um no he was the key why too okay

[01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:24.330]
anyway number two you just a real stone magazine with Yo Franky's uh uh yeah we had it the other

[01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:28.230]
day they had a great review on it yeah well wasn't great it had three stars but then again

[01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:32.330]
everything in there hey listen for them to give Dion three stars I mean you know it was fantastic

[01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:39.530]
because his hair isn't done to his waist yet right yeah I agree I agree I I take them with the

[01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:43.750]
green assault anyway yeah fact when I get mine I subscribe to it so when I get it in the mail I

[01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:48.870]
always put a little salt on it before I open it up I get it also but I'm I'm thinking about

[01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:52.350]
and then the dogs then the dogs attack it and they rip it up because they like the salt on

[01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:57.490]
there and it gets ripped to shreds so it's a good excuse for why I never read it yeah I do have a

[01:20:57.490 --> 01:21:04.090]
oh yeah we bird can use it uh yeah anyway I just wanted to call and say having a great show we sure

[01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:15.330]
don't take it so personal exactly oh well I do listen and listen but I can only listen for so many

[01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:19.670]
hours by the way we gave up we're in hiatus on calder people are listening for our picks we're

[01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:25.350]
taking a little time off on that because I've been in a bad slum well I don't know with the

[01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:30.330]
parking going on yeah yeah that's true me out it right off kilter man at one day

[01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:35.350]

neo roger the rock and roll animal

[01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:21.270]
that look I just said heard that in that couple of decades Elvis I know I just caught my

[01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:28.990]
ears Elvis just caught my ear that's next door at GTR again yeah so it's either that he's alive or

[01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:46.110]
he's like all the rest of the motion sir why is that I was gonna take a lot of calls

[01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:50.750]
but we have like some great cut left on this 1958 even it gets him

[01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:10.170]
I think there would be if we took a survey which we won't but if we took a survey there would be

[01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:14.910]
some people say that's the greatest record of all time really I'm not saying I'm saying that

[01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:19.630]
but there would be some like Todd thinks so I think next to at the hop by Danny and the juniors

[01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:26.150]
have ever heard that record a little star you heard this before having oh he's into these oldies

[01:23:26.150 --> 01:23:31.970]
don't you understand it's in to be into oldies because he's haircut there and everything he's all

said to go okay yeah let's do another one now everybody's big into this this is a smash

oh right up your alley

[01:23:51.490 --> 01:24:00.170]
okay I bet you in the 50s in plant city the Everly Brothers were gigantic and Elvis was that

[01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:04.630]
could have been even bigger than in Vegas Elvis in plant city wouldn't you think that's right

[01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:07.950]
up their alley you know everybody driving their pickup trucks with the Everly Brothers

[01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:12.310]

[01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:21.290]
and this was a monster too oh yeah no question oh you don't get no baby can't

[01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:30.550]

[01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:42.630]
that's uh going a little too far yeah Nick see Nick likes to lay this crap on everybody else because

[01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:46.610]
he has bad taste he did this to share on the other day and he said that she loved the album and she

[01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:51.730]
came in putting her finger down her throat and gagging and puking and then it sucks so you're just

[01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:55.950]

[01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:52.650]
out though yeah well that child has just got a lot of problems the biggest one being that he's a

[01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:56.690]
gutless wonder but other than that he's terrific you know he also you know the thing he said about

[01:28:56.690 --> 01:29:00.410]
the trends he doesn't like I guess to remember back when he was on midday briefly

[01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:05.010]
on a Thursday went to midday's an I&C and I had a nine cheer and he had a two seven and he stuck

[01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:09.290]
his tail between his legs and went running off into afternoon drive and then Steve came over here

[01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:14.250]
and Steve regularly beats the crap out of him in fact when Steve and Stan were both on at the same

[01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:19.210]
time of with Alice Steve and Stan both beat the crap out of Alice who was a poor third virtually

[01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:22.990]
in every trend there may have been one or two flukes but basically that's it with those horrible

[01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:28.190]
demographics so he can keep talking all those elderly elderly elderly post senior post death

[01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:33.870]
senior citizens and to continue trying to fool us but you know he's just doing the same old tired

[01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:38.210]
crap that he's done a million times it's pathetic I mean if we didn't sit here and do anything but

[01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:42.550]
make guttural sounds it would be more entertaining and talking to those same old fetches and whining

[01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:48.830]
about Ali North and the same old tired crap give it a rest Alice okay even bring the urine lady

[01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:54.470]
