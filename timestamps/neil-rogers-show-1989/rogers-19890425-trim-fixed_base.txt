[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]
Hasn't had a chance to do it in a long time. I know. I mean call a race on here.

[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.560]
Burdy's melody with Benny Green.

[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.720]
You know his name is Benny Greenstein.

[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.720]
And he changed it to Benny Green for racing purposes.

[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.820]
And of course, rating port racing purposes kind of difficult because it's hard to see him under the water.

[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.200]
And in the ninth race, I'm picking.

[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.440]
How could you go wrong with this doing this show?

[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.900]
Yeah, ask me a question with Julio Pazua.

[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.420]
I just love that name boy. Ask me a question.

[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.240]
That would be a good name for this show. Yeah.

[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.640]
Ask me a question.

[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.660]
Look at that. Harry Trotzick trains that horse. So he's got a shot.

[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.420]
He's four to one in the morning line. And that's my that's it.

[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.600]
So anyway, what was I saying about horses?

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.200]
Boy, you asked him anything. You're supposed to be keeping track.

[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.720]
I got side railed there because I gave our picks.

[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.300]
But what led me into what I said, something about horses.

[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.760]
Well, let's see. We're talking about.

[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.360]
Management. And then I said horses and horses, asses and it all kind of.

[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.760]
Oh, I like to fit together in there.

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.620]
So I want to apologize to Dennis who called me from hot 105 this morning.

[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.100]
And I said Dennis, the menace, I guess. And I was Reese.

[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.100]
I told Sandy put it through to Gary Bruce's office.

[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.620]
I went back there and waited five minutes. Nothing happened.

[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.280]
I don't see a lot of calls on the board yet.

[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.640]
I'm sorry. Ratings day. Oh, sorry.

[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.640]
So if you have anything you want to get in here, you better do it now.

[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.060]
Because once we get into those numbers, you know that it's audio.

[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.400]
It's the only people that care are the ones in a business is why Johnny

[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.000]
Dark is here today too. Okay.

[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.760]
Like you say celebrity guest in the studio.

[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.700]
Johnny Dark.

[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.700]
And I want to make it clear not to Johnny dark from WMCA or WBL.

[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.600]
Johnny dark WNBC.

[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.260]
There's a new movie in town. Johnny darks in it.

[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.200]
And WRKO that Linda Blair movie.

[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.920]
I have to look at the paper. See the name of it in Johnny dark.

[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.620]
And I always said that Johnny dark just turns my head around.

[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.060]
Linda Blair movie. New Linda Blair movie.

[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.960]
No, no, I can't think of the name of it.

[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.400]
I don't know. You know, can you imagine a couple sitting at home and the guy

[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.580]
says to his wife, honey, let's go see the new Linda Blair movie.

[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.640]
Anyway, now depending on what transpires today, I just imagine this because once we

[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.580]
get into those ratings, the show goes to hell and a handbags.

[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.580]
But all depending on what transpires today, tomorrow, I may have a show that'll

[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.900]
make, remember last Thursday with the memo, it'll make that pale in the wind

[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.840]
significance because there are things going on that are so I told you some of

[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.460]
it coming to work before the phone crapped out.

[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.720]

[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.300]
Just mind boggling things, okay?

[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.420]
Shocking things.

[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.880]
Yeah.

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.240]
But I don't want to get into any of it today.

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.620]
But tomorrow, we may have a real barn burner for you on this show.

[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.880]
Now, speaking of barn burners, I want to go by, we have some memos from the past here.

[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.940]
By the way, topic on the Steve Cain show today, sex surrogates, therapist or prostitutes.

[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.860]
Or as I think would be more right down to earth wouldn't it?

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.120]
Marilyn Volker.

[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.520]
Now, Marilyn Volker, it seems to me as one of those feminist, you know what I'm saying?

[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.900]
Yeah.

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.580]
That name ring several bells.

[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.920]
No, Marilyn Volker is like from the, oh, what the hell is that group?

[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.080]
I ain't got it.

[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.600]
No, seriously, Marilyn Volker is like for, what's the age group in Broward County?

[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.620]
I can't think anything today.

[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.960]
Me.

[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.040]
That's Marilyn Volker.

[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.580]
She's with that.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.920]
What does that have to do with sex surrogate?

[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.300]
Oh, well, at all, I guess kind of time.

[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.760]
And the Reverend Rick Patterson, who of course is a vehemidly anti sex or anything that has to do.

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.160]
I'll be honest with you, they use a piano in his church.

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.520]
He's so anti organ that it just, not a not just that's just a little, little play on words there.

[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.860]
Okay.

[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.320]
And look at Henry Henry saying, gee, dad, it was a world, let's, sir.

[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.660]
I heard about that zipping and flipping and all that other stuff that was going on.

[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.360]
I'll tell you, hang around with Grandma Boone long enough and got only nose.

[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.500]
You'll show to the world.

[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.580]
Anyway, the Bill McQuade show, this is September 3rd, 1987.

[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.540]
These are guest listings from the past to WIOD.

[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.640]
All right, let me, let me do this.

[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.940]
Okay.

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.780]
Seriously, we got three people under.

[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.240]
Get them off.

[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.460]
I want to see from all of people in the audience that don't want to hear about the ratings

[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.900]
today. They're sick and tired of us wasting an entire show.

[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.360]
Get them off of there now.

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.120]
Nick cut it out.

[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.720]
I want to see from everybody.

[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.060]
Let's see show on the phone.

[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.440]
We don't usually do this because this audience is not like the wins and zeta audiences.

[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.000]
They used to be spotted within seconds.

[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.900]
Number.

[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.100]
There's a couple of points.

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.780]
It's what we're talking about here, kids.

[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.460]
Four, five, five, the Broward line, breath six, seven.

[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.140]
Look at the date.

[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.760]
Look at the time.

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.440]
I'm being blind.

[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.240]
Seven.

[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.200]
They're flanking.

[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.260]
There's still, oh, there you go.

[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.420]
Eight.

[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.840]
Now that took quite a while, didn't it?

[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.200]
Yeah.

[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.940]
All right.

[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.020]
Now all you pain in the ass people that want to eat.

[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.640]
All right.

[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.000]
Now all those people are wanting here.

[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.380]
The ratings immediately that are sitting on the edge of their seats.

[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.460]
Now is the time for you people to call in.

[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.160]
Let's let's.

[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.940]
They're two.

[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.280]
Yeah.

[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.700]
Whoa.

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.320]
They're good Palm Beach.

[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.060]
Three.

[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.740]
Oh, I wonder who that is in bokeh.

[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.600]
That must be SBR.

[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.940]
Hop.

[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.880]
There goes Palm Beach.

[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.380]
There goes one of Broward five.

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.440]
It's about even six, seven.

[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.300]
One more to go and brought eight.

[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.900]
There it is.

[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.740]
It was about a five.

[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.200]
One of them.

[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.900]
They both suck.

[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.940]
All right.

[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.380]
Now.

[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.020]
Okay.

[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.060]
Now those of you who really don't give a good fly and leave either way.

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.120]
I just want to wind your own business and let us do whatever we want to do.

[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.380]
Okay.

[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.620]
Let's see those.

[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.360]
There's five.

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.880]
Huh?

[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.300]
Six.

[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.160]
Yeah.

[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.420]
There to do whatever the hell you want.

[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.760]
Palm Beach didn't want us to do what we want to do because they, uh,

[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.180]
seven, they got a mind of their own up there.

[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.700]
Seven.

[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.480]
All but both.

[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.540]
All but no Palm Beach.

[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.000]
Oh, Bob.

[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.640]
I'm not lit.

[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.000]
Well, that's because everybody in JNO wants to eat.

[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.120]
That was a little quicker than the other.

[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.820]
Still not great.

[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.480]
No.

[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.220]
All right.

[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.420]
Let's one more category.

[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.940]
Not seriously.

[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.800]
One more category.

[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.220]
Now those of you out there who don't really care about any of it one way or the other.

[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.480]
Okay.

[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.020]
Who are totally indifferent and don't give a damn about anything.

[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.480]
All right.

[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.280]
Let's see those people.

[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.660]
Not seriously.

[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.000]
Let's see a little show on the phone.

[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.780]
Are those people who just don't give a damn?

[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.160]
All right.

[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.940]
About anything.

[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.280]
Oh, that's good.

[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.780]
There's three, five.

[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.120]
Six.

[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.600]
Florida.

[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.160]
Six.

[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.240]
It's not Florida.

[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.580]
All right.

[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.700]
We still got a date and a brow.

[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.580]
And to go there's six.

[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.120]
Uh, that'll be full in the second.

[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.700]
One a day.

[00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.680]
I'm waiting.

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.580]
I think there might be somebody on there.

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.720]
I think the light's not flashing.

[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.180]
Yeah.

[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.840]
There's somebody on there.

[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.340]
All right.

[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.680]
Okay.

[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.440]
Well, I've got to prove my point.

[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.780]
Okay.

[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.780]
It's 1013 and you people don't give a good god damn about anything.

[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.200]
Okay.

[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.300]
And that's the way we like it.

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.000]
Oh, God.

[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.500]
Okay.

[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.020]
The melting pot has got a new location.

[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.940]
In fact, Friday night, uh, going to be there again down in over on South Beach.

[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.500]
No less.

[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.820]
Well, at 1450 Collins Avenue at the Rhythm Club.

[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.240]
It might be.

[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.480]
Now the Rhythm Club is a Rhythm and Blues night club with live entertainment.

[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.000]
And you can enjoy that delicious or gas McFon do that you enjoyed at the other

[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.380]
South Florida Meldy pot locations right there on South Beach.

[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.860]
No less.

[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.560]
And we're going to be there.

[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.720]
I don't know what time yet, though.

[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.160]
It'd be nice if Lynn Friedass would, you know, get on top of this.

[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.600]
Let me I guess.

[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.880]
But that's the way it goes.

[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.660]
So anyway, it's 1016 W I O D and here's some old memos.

[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.720]
Well, the memos do it.

[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.180]
Box schedule.

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.600]
Yeah.

[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.820]
September 3rd, 1987.

[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.680]
The bill McQuill.

[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.880]
All right.

[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.160]
Wait a minute.

[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.000]
I got one more here.

[00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.920]
Don't answer them, Nick.

[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.620]
All right, everybody who'd like Bill McQuill to come back and do the show starting tomorrow

[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.540]
from 10 to 2.

[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.620]
Let's say you fakers on his phone lines right now.

[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.200]
Come on.

[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.700]
Get wet.

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.760]
Look at that.

[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.300]
Now come on.

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.980]
Now does that take one?

[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.420]
Wait a minute.

[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:22.640]
There's one, two, three, four, six, seven, seven Palm Beach doesn't Palm Beach is

[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.420]
I told on they don't know Bill McQuill from from.

[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.320]
George.

[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.300]
There's eight.

[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.640]
Now that was faster than the earlier response.

[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.100]

[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.320]
All right.

[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.320]
Well, let's let's give everybody a chance here.

[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.580]
Dave while we're stalling for the numbers.

[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.260]
Everybody now come on out.

[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.420]
Two more for Bill McQuill.

[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.260]
Boy, he knows that big family moving from Texas one more there.

[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.860]
Cut it out.

[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.680]
It's an off.

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.400]
Oh my God.

[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.000]
And just an incredible response.

[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.060]
That must be the old Bill Smith audience going nuts.

[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.100]
Yeah.

[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.640]
All right.

[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.840]
There's one more flashing in.

[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.440]
Look at that.

[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.760]
Two more.

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.580]
We can't stop him.

[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.420]
We can't turn him on.

[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.280]
Here's another one.

[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.500]
Yeah.

[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.980]
It's like killing answered a picnic.

[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.740]
And I got news for you working here is no picnic.

[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.160]
Okay.

[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:58.820]
All right.

[00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.980]
All right.

[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.100]
We got him finally cleared.

[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.380]
Are they clear now?

[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.180]
Wait, just a second.

[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.740]
Another hand.

[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.220]
Wash it.

[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:05.940]
Okay.

[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:06.920]
All right.

[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.480]
Now everybody.

[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.800]
Everybody who'd like to see Paul Lyle come back tomorrow and do

[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.100]
tend to do on a permanent basis at WIOD.

[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.380]
Three, four.

[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.220]
Well,

[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.300]
four following.

[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.400]
Wait till I read some of these guests.

[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.360]
They may change their mind.

[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.320]
Five, six, six.

[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.120]
So I guess the verdict is for Bill McQueen.

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.260]
Seven.

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.760]
They're not not too fast.

[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.860]
The Bill McQueen show tend to know and proposed budget cuts for

[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.400]
Nate County could mean no lifeguards and some of us out for the

[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.640]
beaches.

[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.660]
County commissioners are meeting today in this proposal.

[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.480]
Joining Bill this morning in the studio, lifeguards,

[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.480]
Lieutenant's Marshall Hale and Dave Batonfield, a good and timely booking.

[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.060]
It says.

[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.700]
So yeah.

[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.400]
That's what it says.

[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.000]
That's like radio at its best.

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.280]
Yeah.

[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:52.740]
All right.

[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.440]
Shining hour.

[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:53.780]
Yeah.

[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.560]
No question.

[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.940]
Somebody ought to shine his head.

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.880]
Oh, that's our program director.

[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.220]
Of course, from Louisville, our six year old program director, 1231,

[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.420]
Bill McQueen, Nate County manager Sergio Parrera talks about the

[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.520]
papal visit and the monumental effort underway to coordinate the events

[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.140]
around the year because they had such big crowds.

[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.700]
Members that they could get anybody to show up also feed back from

[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.020]
Sergio on the lifeguard.

[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.420]
Now isn't this interesting how they got into a bilingual thing here?

[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.860]
It was supposed to be dilemma, but they spelled it D-E-L-I-M-A-Delima.

[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.540]
Isn't kind of like a little Hispanic interpretation there, Delima.

[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.160]
We might use that word now.

[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.860]
I think I might replace like ponderous or something and then Leak and start

[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.300]
using it.

[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.740]
Do you have a little Delima today?

[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:36.880]
Delima.

[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.540]
I like that.

[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.700]
That's kind of like Spanish, you know?

[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.080]
And all our friends south of Miami, the city of Miami, I guess.

[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.340]
South of North Miami.

[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.920]
South of the Broward line.

[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.680]
Can use that Delima.

[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.720]
Sharon looks like she has a little Delima today herself.

[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.740]
You have a Delima?

[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.020]
And then from one to two, well, maybe we can get somebody to cut it off for

[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.360]
you, Sharon.

[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.960]
Here are the confessions of a nun this afternoon.

[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.480]
Now this don't forget a September 3rd is not a promo for today.

[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.820]
All it might be, you might have its moments.

[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.420]
Confessions of a nun on the Bill McQueen show no less from Elizabeth

[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.760]
Wopton.

[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.200]
Her stories of lesbianism within the event will shock you.

[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.940]
A nun no more Elizabeth comes clean.

[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.560]
That's what it says on the Bill McQueen show right here.

[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.500]
That WIOD News Talk Radio 610.

[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.120]
And that's nothing.

[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.140]
What a, you didn't write this.

[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.000]
You weren't here then, right?

[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.780]
What a pornographic thing this is.

[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.120]
And it says Elizabeth ain't getting on.

[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.820]
Steve Kane show now, ladies and gentlemen, I think this is the, oh,

[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.620]
this is the ultimate two to six PM September 3rd, 1987.

[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.160]
Michael DeSister, the sister of school joined Steve in the

[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.500]
studio to talk about positive discipline.

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.840]
Oh, unique learning institute.

[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.040]
Now we just happened in these just where my boss who don't play me talk show

[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.500]
schedule for Thursday, February 25th, 1988.

[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.080]
The Paul Lyle show, tendinoon.

[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.280]
Do we have the right to die?

[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.000]
And I couldn't think of a better show to be asking the question on right?

[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.840]
The use of euthanasia for mercy killings is always a hot topic.

[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.900]
It says who used to write these sheets man?

[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.920]
Somebody really just getting carried away.

[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.540]
And today on the Paul Lyle show, Dr. Reed Richter at attorney Bob break.

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.160]
Oh my God.

[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.600]
Join him in the studio to debate the concept.

[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:19.780]
Wow.

[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.900]
And then the Steve Kane show on this date, February 25th, 1988 to six,

[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.060]
want your child to become a super kid.

[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.000]
Listen this afternoon, the Steve Kane is parenting expert Michael DeSister.

[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.580]
Drops by, drops by.

[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.880]
I like that very informal to talk discipline and how you should

[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.340]
dole out how much you should dole out to your child.

[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.540]
Oh, Doug Young wrote this, huh?

[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:41.980]
Yeah.

[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:42.360]
Yeah.

[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.960]
You know, Doug Young called me the other day off the air and he was going on a

[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.140]
great length about how Lee is not stealing from me.

[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.760]
I said, boy, you're in a dream world, Doug.

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.280]
Get a life, you know, and he's a big kneeling.

[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.080]
Oh, absolutely.

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.480]
Right.

[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.020]
He was tinkling all over the phone.

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.040]
In fact, they had to put the phone in from the other hide.

[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.900]
No, seriously, that's not a joke.

[00:11:59.220 --> 00:11:59.560]
Wait a minute.

[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.420]
Hot 105, Jack Dennis Reese says, where is he?

[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.100]
Is he on a hotline?

[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:04.620]
Dennis.

[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.280]
Here I am.

[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:05.820]
Here I am.

[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.540]
Well, you can't wait for those numbers, can you?

[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600]
Well, I think what he was like pushed off the receptionist to the people he

[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:10.700]
have.

[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.280]
Yeah, you do have too many people working at your age.

[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.460]
Yeah.

[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.640]
Yeah, I can think of about a dozen right now.

[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.640]
Just me about six people to get to you guys.

[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.300]
Yeah, I told her where to put it when you're a pretty important guy.

[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.820]
It's not always easy to get through, Dennis.

[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.800]
Would you come over and just hit her in the mouth as hard as you can?

[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.480]
And then hit your wife in a month for me once.

[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.080]
I'll tell you what, both of those are okay.

[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.160]
Well, I'm listening.

[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.740]
I got a great not the rating, sir.

[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.800]
Obviously, you know, I think we're all ready for those.

[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.440]
But the hot rumor is about I 95 coming back.

[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.660]
I 95.

[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.620]
Well, I'll have to get you over there.

[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.040]
Wait a minute.

[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.820]
It's the truth.

[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.360]
They have a brand new program director.

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.780]
He's been hired from Chicago.

[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.620]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:48.880]
Wait a minute.

[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.400]
Wait a minute.

[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.040]
Just a second.

[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.520]
Wait a minute.

[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.200]
Wait a minute.

[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.800]
Wait a minute.

[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.300]
Okay, just a second.

[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.220]
Hold on, Dennis.

[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.400]
This is a dumb roll.

[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:56.880]
A shame.

[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:57.440]
Down then.

[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.680]
Didn't I tell you that the days were a day.

[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:00.900]
What a day.

[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.340]
They have a new.

[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.300]
All right, just a second.

[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.340]
Here we go.

[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.080]
This can't be.

[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:06.520]
Move.

[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.680]
Here we go.

[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.340]
Now it's going to be the all military disco morning show.

[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.320]
Oh.

[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.540]
I'm back in there.

[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.100]
I'm back in there stronger than ever.

[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.340]
Oh, my God.

[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.280]
I suppose we're going to be a dance urban format.

[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.560]
No disc jockey.

[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.080]
Kind of like just having bored off.

[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.780]
No disc jockey.

[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.540]
I'm going to stop mixing in the midday.

[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:30.980]
Yeah.

[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.680]
So you know all those mechanics are just going to be tuning

[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.500]
out of you now, Neil.

[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:34.940]
Yeah.

[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.760]
What happened to us, I guess?

[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.700]
That's the death now.

[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.780]
Dennis, what happened to Rose?

[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.460]
I think I don't.

[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.640]
I'm sure that they're going to probably like ease these people

[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:43.840]
out.

[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.200]
But if they haven't heard yet, they're like the stupidest.

[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.760]
Yeah, that's the old radio started winning

[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.100]
and doubt.

[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.720]
Ease them out.

[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.100]
Yeah.

[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.080]
No guns or no guns or how the heck in this community

[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.340]
go out about all those little ad libs, huh?

[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.640]
Well, I guess they're just going to go like full board

[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:57.980]
option.

[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.720]
Maybe they'll all be offered a chance to stay for $5 an hour.

[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.560]
Yeah, but are they going to bring you over to record?

[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.660]
I 95 because nobody said it like you did, boy.

[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.480]
Well, you know what?

[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.140]
Maybe Willie B.

[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.020]
And Willie B.

[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.380]
And Earl.

[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.140]
Earl.

[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:09.780]
Well, Earl.

[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.320]
Yeah.

[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:11.940]
Earl of Squirrel was my favorite.

[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.240]
Yeah.

[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.140]
But you know, it's funny because I'm

[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.740]
could you think of anybody to do I 95, but he dies.

[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.940]
Well, this is hysterical.

[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:19.220]
Yeah.

[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.740]
We call him the I man.

[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.920]
Maybe wait a minute.

[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.860]
The rumor has it that Kyle Isley is the one that's

[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.560]
hard to tell brother is still a format.

[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.620]
Yes, but as long as he gets to play all the old records and I

[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.460]
95, he's to play.

[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:30.940]
Exactly.

[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.740]
Well, you know, Kyle's a ball of fire.

[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.220]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:33.900]
I like Keith.

[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.220]
Yeah.

[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.240]
It's funny because we were sitting there thinking of like,

[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.900]
God, we got to get somebody to confirm this.

[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.320]
I want to keep your brother works at the station.

[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.400]
He forgot about his brother.

[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:42.840]
Yeah.

[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.840]
Well, that's easy to do.

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.840]
Well, listen, you guys are really doing.

[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.160]
It's me.

[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.040]
You guys are really doing it over there.

[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.480]
Tell Keith.

[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.340]
He's a genius in his own mind.

[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.700]
And you're really doing it.

[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.540]
Now he's a super guy.

[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.020]
He is.

[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.900]
Listen, he's a great guy.

[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.040]
He just works strange hours.

[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:56.520]
That's all.

[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.840]
No, he's really getting better.

[00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:58.300]
We're getting out.

[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.200]
He is buying heap season tickets.

[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:01.820]
Really?

[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.200]
Yeah.

[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.680]
Well, he ought to turn that team around.

[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.480]
Anybody can do it.

[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.020]
He can do it.

[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.640]
Anybody can do it.

[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.120]
Keith will definitely.

[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.960]
Well, listen, if you can turn that station around,

[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.000]
he can probably do that too.

[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.780]
Well, listen, we're waiting with Bated Breath.

[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.500]
We'll give you a, well, I guess he gives you the numbers,

[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:14.800]
right?

[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.220]
I'm head didn't write that up.

[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:16.940]
I'll bet.

[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:17.560]
OK.

[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.780]
But listen, I just want to tell you.

[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:19.480]
I'll see you later, guys.

[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.300]
Thanks for the info.

[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.780]
OK, man.

[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.020]
Bye.

[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:23.380]
Wow.

[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:23.740]
Good.

[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.860]
Look, can I do one?

[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:26.560]
One.

[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.240]
Ninety-five.

[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.780]
I, 95.

[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.000]
Come on, you just.

[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.960]
OK, there's all you kids out there

[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.780]
would like to be district.

[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.340]
You'd call up Rose Folger now.

[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.020]
Rose?

[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.000]
Because all you got to do, you can't

[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.940]
don't have to say anything else.

[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.940]
I, 95.

[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.040]
That's all they say.

[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.600]
In fact, if you want practice, go out on the highway.

[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.460]
Just read the signs.

[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.200]
Over and over.

[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:47.140]
And it's great.

[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.240]
And then they could get Ron St. John over there.

[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.140]
And they could change your color.

[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.240]
There's WA1A.

[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.220]
You're a music one.

[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.880]
That'll be next.

[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.200]
I, and thank you.

[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.400]
So Dennis Reese with some shocking news

[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.580]
on ratings they're here.

[00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.960]
Now, you notice nothing.

[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.600]
They're not interested in the least bit.

[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.900]
We got the most indifferent audience.

[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.140]
Anyway, that's because all the people who are listening

[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.700]
are in the business.

[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.240]
They don't want to hear if their voice is recognized.

[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.380]
OK, it's 1025 at WIO Day.

[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:09.700]
It will be great.

[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.020]
The way that will live in infamy

[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.040]
and the anals of South Florida broadcasting,

[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.980]
ladies and gentlemen, shocking.

[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920]
Can you believe that?

[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.940]
And you always hear these stories first.

[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.340]
Thank you.

[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:19.940]
Thank you.

[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.100]
I, 95.

[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.660]
Wow.

[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.320]
Wow, he's right.

[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:27.820]
Yeah.

[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:28.900]
Boy.

[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.260]
Now, as soon as we can get a station

[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.320]
that'll adopt the Palmetto format.

[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.940]
See, if you have a format that's named after a highway,

[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.920]
like A1A I95, the Dolphin format.

[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.720]
Yeah.

[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.460]
And you can have football and music.

[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.740]
Well, we're kind of doing that now.

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.360]
Kind of the same.

[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360]
No, we can have the football.

[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.100]
Dolphin.

[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.880]
We don't have the music.

[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.400]
Well, I 95.

[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.500]
This is probably the music you'll be hearing.

[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.240]
Now, what is that from New York?

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:56.900]
What is that?

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.080]
Palmetto.

[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:58.940]
Ah, hello.

[00:16:59.540 --> 00:16:59.700]
Hi.

[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.400]
Yeah.

[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.060]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:01.720]
Who's this?

[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.160]
This is Dave.

[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.200]
I'm down here from New York.

[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.360]
I work for your former network.

[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.400]
Really?

[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.240]
Yeah.

[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.340]
Good day.

[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.520]
You were at the other station still,

[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:13.660]
right?

[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.560]
And we got into some sort of argument on the air.

[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.260]
We did.

[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:16.920]
We did.

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.780]
About what?

[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.020]
About Paul Harvey being a douchebag?

[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.540]
About Joe, he's real name, I think.

[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.400]
Well, something really heavy duty.

[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:24.740]

[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.720]
We get uptight about that stuff out here.

[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.120]
For sure.

[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.040]
So I'm calling to find out what the hell are you

[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.200]
going to start reading the ratings already?

[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.940]
Well, they aren't in yet.

[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.380]
OK?

[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.600]
Here's another one of these pushy New Yorkers.

[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.780]
Would they come in?

[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.640]
Would they come in like any?

[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.340]
Yeah, that's those for news.

[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:40.840]
Any minute.

[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.420]
We made the ratings already.

[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.820]
At least I came to the right place.

[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.420]
I was told.

[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.600]
You guys should hire Barbara Sprysion

[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.680]
to be on with Tom with the what's his name.

[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.600]
Peter Jenning, so she's got a nose for news too.

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.640]
Is it OK if we wait till they come over the machine?

[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.560]
No, he wants them now.

[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.600]
I told you you were the very first to get them.

[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.080]
We are.

[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.220]
We put them on the air immediately.

[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.880]
What's your vested interest in this?

[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.520]
You want to hear those Paul Harvey numbers on WOLD?

[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:06.660]
WOLD.

[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.580]
But WNWS used to be the colors.

[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.140]
We call them WOLD because their audience is all over 100.

[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.940]
The only station in America where when you turn it on

[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.700]
and it comes fizzing through the radio.

[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.580]
Not listening to a word that I'm good.

[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.340]
I'm listening.

[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.280]
I like it.

[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.360]
I wonder I hung up on you last year.

[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:22.680]
OK.

[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.060]
You're another one of those pushy New York douchebags.

[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.540]
So you don't work for ABC anymore, huh?

[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.280]
No, I still do.

[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.640]
Oh, you still work for them.

[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.200]
That figures.

[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.580]
Well, listen, it's too bad we don't have Paul Harvey anymore.

[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.640]
But we don't have any more listeners over the age of 100

[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.660]
so we can't use him here.

[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.580]
I see.

[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.740]
OK, Neil, I'm waiting with beta bread.

[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.820]
As soon as we get him out, you'll

[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.120]
be the first one to know OK.

[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.920]
But you didn't answer my question.

[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.960]
What's your scam and all of this?

[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.780]
What are you looking for?

[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.260]
Because then we get a radio junkie.

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:50.800]
Oh, are you?

[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.080]
Yeah, you sounded like you had a little problem.

[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.120]
OK, listen, it's great here.

[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.680]
It's great here for me again.

[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.120]
Give my best all those fakers up there at ABC, OK?

[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.040]
Tell them we love their shows, OK.

[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.220]
Pushing New Yorkers.

[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:03.540]
Wow.

[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.220]
Unbelievable.

[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.140]
And he interrupted this?

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.640]
Yeah.

[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.620]
You can say that I'm a guy.

[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.260]
I can't.

[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.600]
I can't believe it.

[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.620]
And he didn't give it damn.

[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.860]
So we got the Dolphin's and music ladies and gentlemen

[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.420]
on your Dolphin Expressway station for the ABWIO duty.

[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.780]
In fact, we got a big billboard.

[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.940]
It says pick up Mike, what's his name?

[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:23.660]
Reniri.

[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.920]
Yeah, I was getting so shocked from that guy from ABC.

[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.620]
Pick up Mike Reniri on the Dolphin Expressway

[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.500]
with his thumb out, you know?

[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.420]
We ripped it off from Dick Burton.

[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.640]
Anyway, it's 1031, a WIWD to phones are sizzling.

[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.220]
We got at least three calls on there already.

[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.180]
They don't care about any of this.

[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.200]
They've all tuned Sandy in already

[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.600]
because they know we're going to do ratings

[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.780]
in their board crapless with that they want to hear.

[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.740]
He's got the bilingual proctologist.

[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.960]
Oh, yeah.

[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.940]
Our audience can relate to that.

[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.300]
Yeah.

[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.040]
You know what he does, right?

[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.360]
Yes.

[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.280]
We got a lot of people in our audience who

[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.640]
can be an asshole in either language.

[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.600]
He kind of fits right in.

[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.000]
Anyway, it's 1031 at WIWD.

[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.200]
And let's give those numbers out.

[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.760]
Let's see some life on his phone for Cry Now loud.

[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.700]
It's ratings day.

[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.860]
Geez, these are the things that we strive for in this business.

[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.660]
They keep calling and I keep hanging up on them.

[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.760]
I don't know why you're putting them on hold,

[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.900]
but it gives you something to do, Nick.

[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.240]
OK, he's got this extra hour.

[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.940]
Oh, Miami, mayoral candidate.

[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.620]
Well, we just hung up on him and we hung up on the one

[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.140]
in Hollywood.

[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.380]
Meryl candidate.

[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:23.880]
Yeah.

[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.980]
What is that all about?

[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.800]
God, you hung up on him.

[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.860]
I'm the call of Sandy.

[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.920]
We don't talk to mayoral candidates on this show.

[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.560]
OK, we're not Steve Clark, is it?

[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.820]
No, this is Miami.

[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.580]
Oh, Metro.

[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:33.380]
Oh, Metro.

[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.120]
How long have you lived here that you know nothing

[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.700]
about any of this family, isn't he?

[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.540]
He's not the mayor.

[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.820]
Miami is the mayor of date counting.

[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.640]
Metro day.

[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.920]
I get so confused.

[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.960]
Although in his case, does it make it exactly?

[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.360]
Because what does that say?

[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.140]
There's no feeling.

[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:46.560]
Right.

[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.460]
Anyway, our topic today on the Paul Isle show,

[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.680]
do we have the right to die?

[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.240]
That's what Dennis Collins is going to be asking

[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.120]
after the book comes out over at WOLD.

[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.520]
How you doing, Dennis?

[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.160]
I hate to break the news for it, but I'm not going

[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.240]
to LaRato, Texas, Dennis.

[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.240]
Not this week, OK?

[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]
Boy, it's shocking.

[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.360]
And what goes on in this market, all these subterfuge

[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.520]
and all these wild stories.

[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.760]
So I guess Tanner over there in Cox,

[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.340]
I bet you we don't hear from Cox today.

[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.360]
I got my fingers crossed in my toes, evil, and I said that.

[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.640]
But they're going to be really nervous,

[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.360]
Nellies over there.

[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.760]
I think it's not only is not 105 kicking a crap out of them,

[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.660]
but now they're going to have I, 95,

[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.280]
got only knows until even get out of bed tomorrow.

[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:24.840]
Well, I think Tanner or together.

[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.520]
I think Tanner can relate to this.

[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:27.380]
Yeah.

[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.920]
As a matter of fact, I haven't feeling that there's probably,

[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.320]
no, seriously, there's probably one of the local radio

[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.500]
pundits in the market now who's been analyzing the whole thing

[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.380]
before the first number comes off the computer.

[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.820]
Like I said, really?

[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.660]
Oh, you can do this.

[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.660]
He's meditating right at the moment.

[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.860]
Or something very close.

[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.180]
Who if we had a psychic doing the weather on his station

[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.180]
and she gave the weather before the information came out,

[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.500]
would that be a premature evacuation?

[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.680]
Anyway, it's 1033 at WIOD.

[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.520]
Let's give the numbers out because I see we're, you know,

[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.000]
we've got a stall for a little while.

[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.000]
I have we have nothing yet.

[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.160]
I thought Sharon would already be running up and down the hall,

[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.200]
but probably our computer is on the blink again.

[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.680]
Or one of our rocket scientists in programming

[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.840]
doesn't know how to get it running.

[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.620]
It's something like the last time.

[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.960]
I remember when the last trend came out.

[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.600]
Now, see, today for those of you novices out there,

[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.460]
both of you and the audience who are not in the business,

[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.360]
the trends that are like month to month, those are,

[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.040]
those are okay, but this is like the big deal.

[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:24.340]

[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.360]
Because three, four times a year, we have a book.

[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.160]
In fact, you hear these pseudo intellectuals

[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.980]
who call in these people like to sound like they're part of the,

[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.160]
oh, is the book coming in?

[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.080]
You know that kind of, the book.

[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.320]
Anyway, the rating book is like for January, February and March.

[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.320]
This is the winter book, which wants upon a time

[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.760]
there wasn't any winter book in this market.

[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.900]
Those were the good old days, okay?

[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.840]
Well, we had two books a year.

[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.160]
We'd have to go through this crap,

[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.120]
but now they've decided for some reason that it's a major market.

[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.160]
They didn't really decide that,

[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.820]
but they decided to get the money for four books a year at Arbitron.

[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:53.280]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.360]
So they soaked the crap out of these poor bastards

[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.040]
in a four times a year, we have to go through this, okay?

[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.980]
Which means 48 out of the 52 weeks, we're in ratings.

[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.680]
Yeah.

[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.380]
So we don't really give a fly and leap about them anyway, right?

[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.960]
Just like over at Zeta, they didn't care.

[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.460]
If you have good ratings, they didn't care.

[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.680]
If you had bad ratings, they didn't care,

[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.160]
which is why I know.

[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.560]
Ah, it's coming back.

[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.860]
Boy, remember Zeta?

[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.620]
Boy, which time, the first time or the last time?

[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.520]
Yeah, either time.

[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.120]
Those were the days.

[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.380]
Ah, 95.

[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.980]
Oh, I can't, I'm going to be excited.

[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.240]
Now, they're going to change your call letters back to INZFM.

[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:26.740]
Good question.

[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.940]
Let's take up an office pull.

[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.760]
Are they going to change your call letters from Zeta back to INZFM

[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.640]
when they go back to high?

[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.900]
95, you'd think so.

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.460]
You know, they never changed them on the building.

[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.160]
Remember, they always let us.

[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.360]
They had a little premonition.

[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.980]
They left them on the building, yeah.

[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.560]
Yeah, no dummies.

[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.740]
Oh, boy.

[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.120]
What's that word that we came up with?

[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:43.700]
Oh, Delima.

[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.540]
Let's find out how they solve these Zeta, Delima,

[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.300]
a little later on in the show.

[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.540]
Well, you'll hear it first here.

[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.480]
You can go to the bank on that.

[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.300]
Anyway, this, Saturday, in fact, maybe you,

[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.120]
I don't know, I don't know.

[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:54.820]
Okay.

[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.820]
I told you.

[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.540]
10.55.

[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.420]
Well, he's carried away.

[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:57.720]
Okay.

[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.840]
How did Waxi do, by the way?

[00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.420]
Did we give their number?

[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.480]
I think they went up a little bit.

[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:00.780]

[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.760]
See, I'm going to try to keep these separate

[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.520]
so we don't get all bald up like the last time.

[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.160]
This is our, for in the business show,

[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.520]
we do this like once a month.

[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:08.880]
Yeah.

[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.540]
It's got like having a period, you know.

[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.360]
Waxi, three, one, two, a three, nine.

[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.780]
What are a lot of people who are right now?

[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:14.600]
You bet.

[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.800]
Okay, here's our number, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.700]
12 plus 10 to three.

[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.360]
Well, see, we inherit the first hour of Steve.

[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.040]
I shouldn't say that Steve had his best book ever, I think.

[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:29.740]
Great book.

[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.680]
We went, let's see, life was number one as they always are.

[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.360]
That's like elevator music with an eight four,

[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.120]
but they don't count.

[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.140]
W-I-O-D from a four six to a seven three.

[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.380]
When we came here, it was a three.

[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.140]
Wow.

[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.600]
It's a seven three.

[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.960]
More than double.

[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.340]
Well, you know how to be in the sevens.

[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.980]
That's boom boom was here that one.

[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.760]
And a quam has risen like 35,000 people or 25,000 people,

[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.840]
185,000, which is about what it was at the INZ one.

[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.300]
We were doing those 85 numbers.

[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.820]
And the time spent listening is up to seven hours a week.

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.200]
Good.

[00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.840]
Lauren.

[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.940]
We came here, it was like three, seven hours a week.

[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.060]
That's like an hour and a half a day.

[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:05.380]
It's Monday through Friday.

[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.220]
More than seven.

[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.020]
Hot midday.

[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.580]
We even beat hot, would you shock it?

[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.460]
It was six three.

[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.620]
We beat Earl the Pearl.

[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.520]
Magic had a four nine in midday.

[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.360]
Waxie had a four four GTR 304.

[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:15.860]
One.

[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.280]
Here are those vaunted 25 to 54 numbers, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.900]
Here we go with another.

[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.180]
We already have it.

[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.360]
But it's shocking.

[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.740]
Number one 10 AM to 3 PM W IOD with an 8.6 in 25 to 54.

[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.240]
A unprecedented number in the ANALs of AM radio.

[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:35.880]
Yeah.

[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.620]
Since they had more than one station.

[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:39.560]
I know.

[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.720]
We came here in the summer was a two seven and a fall,

[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.580]
which we were a little bit of just a tiny bit of that.

[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.040]
A four five and out on 8.6.

[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.140]
25 to 54, okay?

[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.000]
But I don't know about your show,

[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.060]
because you're eating on the air.

[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.820]
Tom Deneber can't sell your show.

[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.400]
And we don't know.

[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.000]
Yeah, get out of here, Henry.

[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.560]
Flatten him up against one.

[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.420]
He's got to do the news.

[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.320]
God air him out for a couple of minutes, will you?

[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.700]
25 to 54 and 8.6.

[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.340]
Magic had an eight, hot had a six eight midday.

[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.700]
Waxie a five two.

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.280]
We took that seat.

[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.880]
Go try to get people to talk about your radio station

[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.400]
after 10 o'clock in the morning.

[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.740]
Okay, well, we're trying right now.

[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.640]
GTR, if you shut up GTR of three six up to a four eight

[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.220]
midday is 25 to 54.

[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.500]
Gloves five eight to a four eight.

[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.820]
Wall and 100, two four to a three.

[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.400]
Oh, we never gave the wall and 100 morning number.

[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.640]
Did we or I guess we did?

[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.560]
They went down from a four something to a four something

[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.860]
about a half a point.

[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:29.560]
Mm hmm.

[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.960]
What about midday for Gonser 25 to 54?

[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.380]
All right.

[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.280]
I had a giant book.

[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.240]
Ah, well, he went to the, he went to the roof on the trend.

[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.320]
Yeah, he went nuts that Gonser.

[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.380]
Anyway, let's give Steve's number

[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.600]
because he did tremendous.

[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.400]
If I can find a damn thing here it is.

[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.180]
This is 12 plus three to seven PM.

[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.560]
Hot had a nine one in the afternoon.

[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.420]
Can you believe that Dennis Reese 12 plus nine one.

[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.620]
They even beat life who had a seven power had a four seven.

[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.520]
I would do a four seven that Steve up

[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.920]
from a three nine to a four seven.

[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.120]
Right.

[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.400]
How do you like that?

[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:00.880]
Great.

[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.040]
And he continues doing those Eastern Airlines shows.

[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.860]
If he continues ignoring boy Gary,

[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.880]
he can get over a five.

[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:07.260]
Okay.

[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.060]
I'm serious.

[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.480]
Magic of 46 GTR or 45.

[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.460]
Boy, gee, and I wonder they're just there going nuts here.

[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.640]
Man, they're salivating in a hall

[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.880]
to have a little orgy out there

[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.920]
because both stations went through the roof here.

[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.200]
Okay.

[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.460]
Jumping up and down.

[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.780]
I mean, you know, GTR got a fluke and we went nuts.

[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.840]
A wacky, a wacky at a, a wacky at a four two.

[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.100]
And remember the last trend and spike wise

[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.320]
was acting like a jackass.

[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.500]
And I said, if you look at the pattern,

[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.860]
the first two months of every book they go down

[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.560]
and then the third they go through the roof

[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.500]
and sure enough they came right,

[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.840]
it's like a pattern every book.

[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:40.820]

[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.560]
But he just gets so emotional

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.740]
and starts throwing those telephones through the wall

[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.060]
and making holes in the wall.

[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:47.940]
Now look at this.

[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.120]
Three to seven afternoon drive 12 plus Zeta.

[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.100]
Consistency is the mark of quality.

[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.140]
They stayed at a one eight.

[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.780]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.880]
Now you guys are denying the rumors over there.

[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:58.880]
But I just want to say,

[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.360]
they never changed the call letters on the building.

[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.640]
Just remember that.

[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.040]
I'm 95.

[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.800]
We've turned the corner on I 90 time.

[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.100]
And now we're on the turnpike.

[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.740]
Headed out of town like to a e-ha junction.

[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.300]
They'd be big.

[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.260]
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.880]
Listen, they can have a station seriously

[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.140]
at e-ha junction for all the people on the turnpike.

[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:19.540]
Sure.

[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.140]
You know how like when you go through the tunnel,

[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.640]
they got that station in Fort Lauderdale

[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640]
and Disney's got his own set.

[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.400]
They could have the e-ha junction turnpike station, okay?

[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.140]
And sell the motorists, you know?

[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.040]
Like stop and get your gas and eat it,

[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.100]
or I rod your stuff like that.

[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.680]
Okay, that's going to do it.

[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.840]
If you're bored by these numbers,

[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.500]
but we got thousands more coming up.

[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.260]
So just stick around, stay glued to your seats

[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.600]
in the have a nice day, Dennis,

[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.700]
and all you other folks out there.

[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.120]
We got Harry, who just barely gonna get you

[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.120]
this new guest, I think,

[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.460]
and we'll come back at 11.05.

[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.780]
Rock, call 751 WIOD and date.

[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.080]
524 WIOD in broad,

[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.260]
or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beaches.

[00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.700]
Other areas make all collect.

[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.700]
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers

[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.820]
are not necessarily those of the station.

[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.700]
Now, here's Neil Rogers,

[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:09.840]
our New Start Radio 610 WIOD.

[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.320]
And you know what they say about that guy?

[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.200]
He's an Ojoan Provacatouin.

[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.080]
Okay, 11.05 at 7.00 L.A.

[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.020]
And it's ratings day.

[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.760]
This is the winner book ladies and gentlemen.

[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.320]
All these numbers, they just keep coming out.

[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.060]
It's like, it's like a never-ending nightmare, you know?

[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.280]
It's like you just are lying there,

[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.280]
hoping to wake up someday,

[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.560]
and hoping all this stuff goes away.

[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.980]
Although, you know, we continue doing well.

[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.060]
We go up in every trend on every station.

[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.160]
Then we go up in every, virtually every trend on the day.

[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.040]
No, every one month there was like a little glitch.

[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.580]
But in here, we go up in every trend.

[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.740]
When we came here in 25 to 54s,

[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.840]
they had in midday, and I know the audience doesn't care.

[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.400]
But you know something, we don't care about you.

[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.660]
You know what I mean?

[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.740]
No, we don't.

[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.160]
We don't care if they all drop dead.

[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.220]
As long as somebody else comes along to replace him,

[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:54.860]
it was a little younger,

[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.080]
because we want to have like 18 to 34s.

[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.100]
Yeah, in summer of 88, 25 to 54, they had a 2-7.

[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:02.880]
2-7.

[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.420]
Then in the fall, when we came over,

[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.080]
it was a 4-5, a little bit, it was a 4-5.

[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.760]
Now it's an 8-6 in a winter vibe.

[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.560]
See, this is like a little ego trip,

[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.500]
because it doesn't mean anything.

[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.480]
And the salespeople are still going to be dodo birds,

[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.380]
and they'll still find new excuses like they always do.

[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.320]
Wow, those numbers are a little bit too high.

[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:19.580]
They got everybody scared now.

[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.180]
Everybody scared away, and they just said,

[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.480]
they don't know if they can handle it.

[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.580]
Oh, boy.

[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.340]
So we're still waiting for the rest of the 25 to 54,

[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.580]
so we can see what Steve did.

[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.260]
Oh, let's see.

[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.040]
Steve had a 4-7, but we didn't find out what Alice did.

[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.560]
We didn't find out what Sandy did.

[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.220]
We got so carried away basking in our own glory.

[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.960]
Let's get to it now.

[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.200]
Okay, we did a 7-3 in midday, now we're Sandy.

[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.280]
Sandy.

[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.700]
Here's Sandy, not on page two.

[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:47.960]
Sandy.

[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.680]
Not on page two.

[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.020]
Remember when she used to get 5s?

[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:55.080]
Sandy down from a 3-9 to a 3-2, tied for 14.

[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.860]
What odious station are they tied for, oh, Y100?

[00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:58.660]
Yeah.

[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.660]
In midday when all the kids are in school, that figure.

[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.500]
And Steve had a 4-7, an Alice in the afternoon,

[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:11.320]
a W-L-D in 12-plus, from a 3-7 to a 3.

[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.640]
So Steve is like, I mean, Alice is hanging right on the edge

[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.300]
of her falling into the twos.

[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.660]
A 3.

[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:20.740]
Waited.

[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.720]
Wait on everybody over there.

[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.880]
Remember morning drive?

[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.300]
Morning drive is way down.

[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:25.740]
Midday.

[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.000]
Look at Alice's trending here.

[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.160]
Summer of 4-4, fall of 3-7, and now down to a 3.

[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.760]
And the frightening part of that,

[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.800]
at 2.9% of those people our brain did.

[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.060]
They're over the age of 150, other 8K.

[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.720]
How old, how old?

[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.660]
I met you at the palace, how you doing?

[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:49.340]
Oh my God, things are not good as she all mine

[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:54.220]
and used to say, okay, 7-8-9-12-plus, hot with a 12-3 at night.

[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:54.940]
Look at that.

[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.660]
That keeps eyes, man.

[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.040]
He's turned those creoles into weapons now.

[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.900]
A tower with a 6-2,

[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.000]
why 100 with a 4-8 at night?

[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.760]
Life with a 4-7, by most of their people are asleep by that.

[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.600]
Winds with a 4-3 down from a 5-1,

[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.180]
of course, that's when Bruce Williams had a vacation, I guess.

[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.180]
W-S-News, witchner and company from a 5-0,

[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.960]
I think that's their lowest nighttime number in ages.

[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.340]
Well, most of the jails people are 6 feet under now

[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.680]
on a Ho Chi Minh trip.

[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.600]
Love's 94, 2-9 at night.

[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.240]
If Joe's listening over at Magic 25 to a 3-2,

[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.020]
nice going, Joe.

[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.640]
Why are these days, you'll get over a 3-5.

[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.360]
I-O-D at night, 3-2 to a 2-4.

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.940]
See, that was the nighttime in the weekends.

[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.140]
We do have that bumper sticker.

[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.020]
It says the weekends are deadly on W-I-D.

[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.740]
And the nighttime's are just a little less deadly, okay?

[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.160]
But now that we got boy Gary,

[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.040]
we might get some of the big-name talent,

[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.820]
like boom, boom at night or something like that,

[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.360]
a live living and breathing person, huh?

[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.460]
Well, almost.

[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.600]
From a shabbat of midnight.

[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.180]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.440]
Hey, very real good.

[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.020]
Okay, let's do a little break here, because it's early,

[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.980]
but let's get it out of the way,

[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.420]
because I'm just so emotional,

[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.020]
I'm just overwrought with emotion,

[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.660]
of course, there's almost no calls, there's 5-sinking calls,

[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.520]
because the audience doesn't care about this.

[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.520]
But the one good thing we found at the beginning of the show,

[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.480]
a little mini survey, they don't care about anything else.

[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.700]
So we don't take it personally,

[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.160]
because we just have it in different audience.

[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.040]
It doesn't really basically give a damn about anything.

[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.120]
Who's still at We1?

[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:16.600]
Right?

[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.440]
Yeah, we're still at We1.

[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:18.720]
Whatever the hell we want to do.

[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.500]
Any of you people down in South-Dade and Kendall

[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.380]
and down in that area,

[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.960]
remember when we were talking about that one place,

[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.940]
that great restaurant, which I don't want to,

[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:25.080]

[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.940]
You know, tremendous restaurant,

[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.260]
and they did not get a little response,

[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.520]
which is unusual for us,

[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.480]
because we do phenomenal for almost all our restaurants.

[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:31.780]
Yeah.

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.660]
And I was asking you, if anybody in South-Dade

[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.380]
still speaks English, because it's just really,

[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.420]
do we have any audience down there in South-Dade?

[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.540]
Well, I told you, I'm a...

[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.860]
I know we got a big audience at U of M.

[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:42.140]
Yeah, we agree.

[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.240]
Now, I'm very, very upset about a trend in South-Dade.

[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:45.980]
I can just say for a second.

[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:46.620]
Oh, on your eight seconds.

[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.180]
They're running movies dubbed in Spanish,

[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.540]
occasionally on HBO,

[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.620]
and I'm gonna call store like today,

[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.520]
and if this is gonna continue, I'm dropping...

[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.220]
Now, how much do you handle those cable companies

[00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.120]
along and on?

[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.000]
No, I'm gonna pick up Cinemax or something,

[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.420]
but this is, it crossed my ass a little bit, you know?

[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.140]
To...

[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.440]
They were running live in daylight,

[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.040]
just to say the James Bond movie.

[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.840]
In the Spanish.

[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.160]
I mean, is this...

[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.260]
What's going on here?

[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.280]
Shit, what was...

[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.080]
This is the...

[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.200]
The Manana's Soul,

[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:21.420]
with you, Robert.

[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.300]
This is the...

[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.300]
Yeah.

[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.680]
He has a pretty good taste.

[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.300]
He's an Ojón provocateur.

[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.040]
Alright, it's 11 past 11 at W.I.

[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.880]
I want Fatherly to do that in Esponio.

[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.100]
We'll be right back.

[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.180]
What's the Haca trying to come out of Stinking VCR again

[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:40.860]
and about the...

[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.740]
Oh, come on.

[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.380]
Well, he just said one car...

[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.040]
Cotto call.

[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.240]
Yeah, I don't think that's...

[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:47.860]
We don't care.

[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.020]
I don't either.

[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.340]
That's your problem, okay?

[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.040]
Do I come in on the air and bitch about my satellite

[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:53.820]
and all that stuff?

[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.040]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.760]
I got it, seriously.

[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.760]
I may have some shocking...

[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.600]
I already got the information,

[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.920]
but I may discuss it on the air

[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.160]
tomorrow, depending what goes on with our D'Alyma today.

[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:06.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.100]
We may have a story tomorrow that will make new hair grow,

[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.140]
and you place it in your body and you have it in bed.

[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.940]
Anyway, it's 1114 at W.I.

[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.140]
It's our little rating celebration party here today,

[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.900]
and I noticed that Boy Gary even brought all kinds of stuff

[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.120]
into the studio here, messed it up pretty bad, too.

[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.880]
We believe in a clean studio, Gary.

[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.520]
Cleanliness comes first, okay?

[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.440]
A clean body, a clean mind, lead to clean numbers, okay?

[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:29.620]
Like zeros.

[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.560]
Now, if we missed some Zaden numbers here somewhere

[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.560]
along the way, can we get to this?

[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.400]
Now, Gonser went from a 1-6 to a 1-7 and 12-plus.

[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.540]
We want to give them all the credit in the world,

[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.220]
because they're always said,

[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.660]
he may not be good, but he's consistent.

[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.460]
Through the room.

[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.380]
The room.

[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.280]
What do they do at night?

[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.800]
Because nighttime, they've been struggling.

[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.480]
That lady calls there once and a half.

[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.760]
They turn the corner at night, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.180]
from a 1-0 to a 1-3.

[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.460]
So they've done it, but overall,

[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.380]
all we have a news bulletin, now that's exciting,

[00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:59.340]
probably about Zada.

[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.840]
1115 at W.I.O.D.

[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.300]
Good morning, I'm Henry Beto.

[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.640]
I couldn't have said it better.

[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.080]
Anybody who's a wine connoisseur

[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.000]
always says an O'Shaun provocateur to it.

[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.280]
Anyway, it's 1116 at W.I.O.D.,

[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.500]
we got an open line in Broward.

[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.200]
How can we have a couple open lines here, man?

[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.660]
We're having like a little party, okay?

[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.240]
And we don't want you to call in and tinkle all over us.

[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.540]
Oh, congratulations, great number.

[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.200]
But if you're like in a business and you're desperate,

[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.460]
you wonder if you still got a job.

[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.100]
We'll be happy to answer it.

[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.040]
Now, where are the 18 to 34 numbers?

[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.940]
Are we gonna have to go through that same crap again?

[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.420]
We're the rest of the 25 to 54s,

[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.360]
because I know Steve is just like hanging on the edge

[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.920]
of his sofa by a baseball cart.

[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.780]
And I'm sure he wants to hear how he did 25 to 54,

[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.480]
because that's where the big bucks are, okay?

[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.840]
And all they gave us, now I didn't mention this yet.

[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.560]
W.I.O.D., tied for third overall, the whole week,

[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.200]
25 to 54 up from a 470 to a 540.

[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.380]
Did I mention it?

[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.520]
I did.

[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.620]
Oh, I'll mention it again.

[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:52.940]
Good.

[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.360]
3-3 in the summer, 470 to fall, 540 overall.

[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.580]
Tied for third, an AM station behind Hot and Magic.

[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.380]
God.

[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.480]
Tied with CMQ, it doesn't even count.

[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.280]
Nice, come up.

[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.120]
And a head of gloves.

[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.060]
Nice company.

[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.360]
And a head of GTR, who had a 5.

[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.080]
And a head, oh, you're gonna go nuts.

[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:10.300]
Ah.

[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.380]
No.

[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.580]
W.I.O.D., in 25 to 54s, beating out Waxi.

[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.660]
Morning, Shirley, I hate man, you hear what Tanner did this morning.

[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.820]
Are you here with Rick and Fred's dinner?

[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.660]
I'm all evidently nuts.

[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.020]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.900]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.220]
Wow.

[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.920]
And where's the morning 25 to 54?

[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.040]
See, we still got a lot of holes.

[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.740]
I mean, it's nice they brought us in all these number,

[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.980]
where's the rest of them?

[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.120]
It's just like last time.

[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.240]
I remember when the trend came out.

[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.020]
Same thing.

[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.340]
Now, there's no excuses this time,

[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.960]
because everybody's excited and they're

[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.740]
probably smashed on the floor and passed out

[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.860]
in that computer room, okay, from the celebration.

[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.420]
Eight, six.

[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:45.160]
God.

[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:46.660]
It's great.

[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.040]
Shocking.

[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:50.960]
I don't know whether the screen read a banana, you know?

[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.520]
I think we just got a rest on our laurels now.

[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.780]
See, that's what those starts saying.

[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.420]
Well, you know, Neil's gotten lazy now.

[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.000]
They don't do any homework anymore.

[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.380]
They don't come in and do anything creative.

[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.600]
We haven't done anything creative in two years, okay?

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.260]
We were told don't do anything creative.

[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.660]
Hey, time we try to just create if we get in trouble, okay?

[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.020]
So we just show up and act ignorant

[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.640]
and the audience relates to what kind of kind of this is.

[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.540]
God, it goes to prove the dumber you are

[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.360]
and the dumber you behave, the bigger the audience.

[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.420]
That's America, right?

[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.560]
Now, our show on Transvestite Pigmees begins in noon.

[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.780]
Wow, look at that.

[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.400]
A five one for WI of DC.

[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.080]
I told you, did I say to you this morning,

[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.220]
Johnny Dark was sitting here.

[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.580]
I said, we got a break of five.

[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.320]
There's no excuse.

[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.040]
This station, even with the horrendous nighttime

[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.860]
and weekends, which we don't want to talk about.

[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.580]
Once we get some of this stuff on the weekend

[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.800]
out of the way we get Meg back on,

[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.840]
that'll sure up the weekend.

[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.540]
Oh, yeah, like a dead weight.

[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.720]
It's a, no, it's a magazine.

[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:43.760]
It's so upset.

[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.200]
It's just a little joke.

[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.400]
I mean, there's some truth in it,

[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.220]
but it's just a little joke.

[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.740]
It's 11, 11, 11, 18 at WI of DC.

[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.480]
Don't you think somebody ought to send some food over

[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:54.800]
something because I'm not going to my mother's.

[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.320]
I need to get my glasses, my lenses,

[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.740]
my not lenses frames, because I sat on them.

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.600]
We have to feed Johnny.

[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.160]
Johnny.

[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.360]
We got to feed Johnny Dark,

[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.060]
because he hasn't worked in years now.

[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.280]
Yeah.

[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:04.720]

[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.140]
As an even like I said, at least 20 minutes.

[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.520]
And we got to feed Johnny Dark

[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.620]
when we have a radio celebrity past or present.

[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.160]
And usually it's past.

[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.680]
We like to feed him.

[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.420]
I didn't feed boom boom, though, you know what?

[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.540]
That probably was the reason that show

[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.620]
was a little flat, man.

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.140]
I'm sure boy.

[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.080]
I'm sure boy Garry will run out.

[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.240]
He ripped him so bad that they,

[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.040]
you know, never be forgiven.

[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:26.980]
God will punish you.

[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:28.080]
You'll be at the party gates.

[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.860]
And he'll say, I'm sorry, but we're closing the gate

[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.920]
for one phone call.

[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.060]
You were a pretty decent guy.

[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.300]
The rest of time you stole some albums.

[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.280]
We can forgive you for that.

[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.040]
But that called about that was unforgivable.

[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:39.480]

[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:42.660]
Bit was.

[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.440]
Yeah.

[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:44.940]
Hmm.

[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.800]
I just, yeah.

[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.100]
You seem like you have a little dalyma.

[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:48.980]
Yeah, something dalyma.

[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.200]
Something just popped in my brain.

[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:51.980]
The dalyma on his TV receiver.

[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:52.880]
Okay.

[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.200]
Something popped in my brain.

[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.700]
What was that?

[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.920]
Well, there's this I-95.

[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.040]
Yeah, that was it.

[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.180]
Maybe it can be over in I-95, recording I-D.

[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.040]
Now, there's that old Lynn Frydas just came in the studio

[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.080]
ladies and gentlemen, we haven't seen her in a long time.

[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.740]
What was I going to ask her about?

[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.540]
Something about all of you.

[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.500]
They got those pictures.

[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.320]
You better go in there and beat him up, okay?

[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:11.540]
No.

[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.340]
And here it's Tuesday.

[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.360]
I'm just, don't say I didn't tell you.

[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.140]
They took the pictures like 10 stinking weeks ago.

[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.620]
We got these gigantic numbers,

[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.900]
which you people better start selling by the way now.

[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.480]
And we don't have those pictures, okay?

[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.240]
Now, if I go on a year and tell all these fakers out there,

[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:26.980]
we're going to have the pictures.

[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.820]
You better see to it that the douchebag in there gets them, okay?

[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.340]
That boy Gary, that's it.

[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.040]
Step on it.

[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:32.880]
Called Don.

[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:33.780]
Kick him in the head.

[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.520]
Although there's no sense out on the farm.

[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.320]
Yeah, get down on the farm.

[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.120]
The two are our pictures.

[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.460]
Here at WIOD, where we lie a lot, but not about the numbers, man.

[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.160]
And I remember the old days on IOD,

[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.520]
there were certain people used to kind of fudge about the numbers

[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.020]
a little bit or they would ignore them.

[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.180]
I don't want to match a day named.

[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.580]
But now that they're real good, we talk about them a lot.

[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:52.980]
I mean, to the point of being nauseated.

[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.040]
I guess Steve won't spend too much time on them today, right?

[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:56.380]
No.

[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.860]
Although we didn't have a 4-7 analysis out of three.

[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.260]
And that's in 12 plus.

[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.460]
And if they would ever get busy and bring us the rest of the 25 to 54s,

[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.760]
then you'd really see something, okay?

[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.320]
Because I guarantee you Steve beat him more than double,

[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.120]
probably triple in 25 to 54, at least.

[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.320]
And what do we do to...

[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.980]
Now, how did Sandy do 25 to 50?

[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.380]
Poor Sandy, we've ignored her.

[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.060]
I apologize.

[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.280]
Sandy.

[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.420]
Well, we had an 8-6 in 25 to 54.

[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.360]
Let me say it again, Lynn.

[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.000]
Then we had an 8-6 in 25 to 54, not one.

[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:24.940]
Sandy.

[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.340]
He's on the third page.

[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.500]
A 1-4.

[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:29.700]
Whoa.

[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:30.860]
Down from a 1-8.

[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.260]
On the road to nonexistent.

[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.380]
1-4.

[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.060]
Well, if you do one more show a month with that TV repairman,

[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.960]
she could turn the corner.

[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.720]
She could be on that same highway with Zeta.

[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.340]
I-95.

[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.380]
Pretty soon, you're going to see a lot of radio people in this market on I-95.

[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.440]
Headed North, okay?

[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.260]
All packed up.

[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.400]
Headed North, never to be seen again.

[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.180]
Like Steve Perrin.

[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.900]
On the radio bus, Steve Perrin from Y 100.

[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:54.700]
Gone.

[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.000]
Gone.

[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:56.560]

[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.120]
Oh, God.

[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.180]
This is terrible because we sound like we're happy.

[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.640]
Well, I am happy because they should only rot over at Y 100.

[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.980]
That's my first, not everybody over there.

[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.860]
There must be some nice people.

[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.440]
I don't know any.

[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.480]
Are there?

[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:07.760]
Um...

[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.940]
Certainly not the raw.

[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:09.620]
The David Ross.

[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:10.440]
One.

[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.060]
Maybe one.

[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.600]
There's one.

[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:12.780]
Oh, yes.

[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.860]
Simone used to work there.

[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.300]
Remember Simone?

[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.300]
Oh, jeez.

[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.160]
Gone.

[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:17.760]
All right.

[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.700]
And the radio shows are tough sometimes.

[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.580]
Yeah, they really are.

[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.380]
Oh, here come those numbers.

[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.000]
I wonder what the hell Sharon's been doing and there she's been the girlfriend.

[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.980]
She probably had Steve on the phone.

[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.280]
All is 25 to 54s except hours.

[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.060]
I mean ours are great, but we want to, you know, talk about what is this?

[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.040]
We already got that.

[00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.400]
Morning drive like Raniri who's got a 5-3.

[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.800]
He stayed the same.

[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.480]
He's tied for 3rd and 25 to 54.

[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.660]
That's a big number in the morning for 25 to 54s.

[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.200]
Steve with a 5-5.

[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.860]
I think that's his biggest number ever in 25 to 54, okay?

[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.380]
And you know what they say about Steve.

[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.960]
He's an Ojoan provocateur.

[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:54.880]
He's number three.

[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.820]
And the only people to beat him hot who's just like going crazy and magic, 8177 and Steve with a 5-5.

[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.840]
What did Alice do in 25 to 54?

[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.860]
What is not on page two?

[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.080]
That's obviously not a page two.

[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.120]
He is on...

[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:08.540]
I like that.

[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:08.900]
Well wait a minute.

[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:09.820]
I just came to Zeta.

[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.300]
Afternoon drive 25 to 54 or 25 up from a 2-4.

[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.240]
I still have to come to.

[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.300]
Here's wins.

[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.660]
1-9 to a 2-1.

[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:18.560]
Here's she.

[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.280]
2-3 to a 1-8.

[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.980]
Oh here's Alice.

[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.120]
Way down here.

[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.540]
From a 1-8 to a 1-6.

[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.020]
Now did I say Steve would you triple or more?

[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.600]
Three times 1-6 is a 4-8.

[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.040]
So he did like 3 and a half times.

[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:31.520]
God.

[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.620]
In 25 to 54, okay, Alice.

[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:34.580]
Oh God.

[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.220]
You know, I really hate to do this.

[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.440]
I don't believe in rubbing salt on the water.

[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.480]
I really don't.

[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.360]
The level is a little low on that particular machine.

[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.160]
Oh no, I wonder if anybody would hear the word.

[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.120]
Nice one.

[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.880]
Okay 24 pounds 11.

[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.480]
Just a little sampling there for Alice.

[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.680]
Phil Beckman is on the phone who wants some more numbers here.

[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.320]
I don't think he's going to want to hear him when we get through.

[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.100]
What do you want Phil?

[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.620]
I just want to see what the winner book you wanted to see what?

[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.300]
The winner book for the phone book on She's Morning Show.

[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.140]
Okay, here's another one of these guys who wants to see what.

[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.180]
I wasn't on the winner at 12.

[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:30.600]
I want to know.

[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.960]
Oh, well let's see.

[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.660]
6 to 10 am 12 plus.

[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:35.260]
Yeah.

[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.860]
Just relax now Phil.

[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:37.860]
Don't get the hype problem.

[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.740]
I'm going to turn a lot of pages to get to your numbers.

[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:41.620]
I'm sure.

[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.020]
Okay, she, well, I ran the top of the fourth page.

[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:44.620]
That's not bad.

[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.980]
A one, two, and a winner book.

[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:46.780]
12 plus.

[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.840]
Boy, that's pretty weak.

[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.820]
And, um, oh, you want to see the fall book.

[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.080]
Yeah.

[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.140]
Oh, well that's good.

[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:52.740]
1, 7.

[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.920]
Oh, good, all right, please.

[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.340]
So that's a half a point drop.

[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.940]
Now 25 to 54, you want those?

[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:57.860]
Oh, why not?

[00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.640]
Of course.

[00:44:58.840 --> 00:44:59.300]
What the hell?

[00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.760]
Pointy-five to 54.

[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.860]
She, I have to turn several pages to get to that.

[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.300]
Yeah, like maybe one more I think.

[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.560]
Wow, where is it?

[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.380]
Here it is.

[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.320]
A two one in the fall.

[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:09.980]
That's not too bad.

[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.240]
A point nine in a winner.

[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.500]
So you want to feel really good.

[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.660]
They must have missed me.

[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:13.960]
Yeah.

[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.320]
Now I'm left after the fall book.

[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.500]
They're dying over there.

[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:18.940]
Congratulations.

[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.280]
It goes without saying.

[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:20.900]
Thank you Phil.

[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.220]
See ya.

[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:21.580]
Bye.

[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.840]
Well, it's 11.25 with a big shite.

[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.660]
Let's tell you about shells right now.

[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:30.360]
Yeah.

[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:35.080]
I can be arrogant now, but when the day comes that we have that flip book and we got like a one or something then.

[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.860]
Then it'll be a different story.

[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:43.600]
And I'll be dancing on our graves out there in a hallway and Disney will be looking in with an ugly look and spike wise.

[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.740]
They'll be frowning and throwing telephones through the wall.

[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.540]
You know, the evil stuff that goes on every day.

[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.240]
And the salespeople will have it.

[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.100]
They had another excuse.

[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.480]
Anyway, it's just a joke, Linda.

[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.400]
I'll get hyper, okay?

[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.540]
It's, well, it's partly a joke.

[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.520]
We want to get you out to shells for a great dinner because I don't have time for this.

[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.120]
Okay, we're busy talking here.

[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.240]
And then we have to keep coming back, you know.

[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.180]
Well, maybe if we played some interesting stuff, we, you know, the people that don't care about the ratings, they want to be entertained too, right?

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:09.960]
He's back.

[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.800]
And he's stalking a psycho who wants to make the Chicago Cubs pennant contenders.

[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.700]
Clint Eastwood is dirty Harry Carey.

[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.640]
Oh, everybody.

[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.540]
This is Harry Carey with Steve Stone and the culture goodness speed out of them today.

[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.620]
Clint Eastwood gives a Hall of Fame performance as the legendary Cubs broadcaster.

[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.620]
There's action.

[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.580]
The pitch.

[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.280]
Strike it to the, he's through that bull right past park.

[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.100]
Suspense.

[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.820]
It's sniping.

[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:35.960]
It could be.

[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.120]
It is a foward.

[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.080]
The romance.

[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.620]
Oh, look at the t*** on that broadsteep.

[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.440]
Holy cow.

[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.740]
Clint Eastwood is dirty Harry Carey.

[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.320]
Coming to a theater near you.

[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.380]
Are we back?

[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.560]
See what I mean?

[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.020]
We're busy doing stuff and hearing this stuff keeps ending.

[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.040]
We've got to play like something long.

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.240]
Well, not that.

[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.020]
Okay, it's 130 at WIOD.

[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.800]
I see the reason I'm not taking any calls is because like they're only forced to.

[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.400]
It can cause you audiences obviously are rebelling against this.

[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.200]
They can't deal with it.

[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:11.820]
They're revolting.

[00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.480]
Even more revolting than that.

[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.200]
Yesterday for a Monday we did very well.

[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:15.440]
Yeah.

[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.860]
Not a great show, but for a Monday it was pretty them solid.

[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.400]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.760]
We had actually a lot of calls.

[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.620]
No, no, most of them we didn't even have to do that.

[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.320]
So I guess everybody in the business has got all the information they went on.

[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.360]
Now where are the 18 to 34 numbers?

[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.380]
If Sharon can hear us, if she's within the sound of my voice, where are those stinking 80?

[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.640]
Why do they do this every time?

[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:39.460]
Every time.

[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.400]
I don't know.

[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:44.100]
I realize, see they don't, when I first came here they kept giving me this 35 plus.

[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.640]
I said, this, I said forget that.

[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.840]
It's 25 to 54.

[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.500]
See they still didn't believe that on AM you can really do it.

[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.220]
Now here we are with only an 8.6 and 25 to 54 in the day.

[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:59.100]
And Steve's got a 5.5 and Renewer's got a 5.3 so we're like kicking ass all across the board.

[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.680]
Like I said, they'll 6.00 PM in 25 to 54.

[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.340]
But 18 to 34, now we went from a 0.6 when we came here.

[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:11.160]
Last trend we had a 5.5 and 18 to 34, which for AM is like an a twilight zone.

[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.940]
It's meaningless except it's an ego trip for us.

[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.660]
And since in this business they're usually deflating your ego all they can do,

[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.540]
at least on ratings day when they're good, the least you can do is you know, go on the air and curl about it.

[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.700]
Yeah, because it's the one thing they can't stop.

[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.260]
You know, here they are.

[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.160]
Well, the only way they stop it is not by you.

[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.420]
And I think that what's in there right there?

[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.420]
I think I'm going to speak to it now because I just saw old watch's name there in the hallway.

[00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.540]
He doesn't speak to it.

[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.180]
How about if we got a 10?

[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.520]
What would it take?

[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:38.500]
Now seriously, this is going to be our poll question.

[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.100]
What number and we need to get to for Phil to speak to you.

[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.500]
I don't know.

[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.500]
About a 15 share.

[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.860]
Now here's a bike wise.

[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.580]
I bet you think you got 18 to 34 stores.

[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.160]
Here he is.

[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.460]
He's going to sit down.

[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.100]
Don't get comfortable.

[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.820]
Oh, he's coming out of my mind too.

[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.640]
This is my mind.

[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:56.200]
What a maniac.

[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.660]
18 to 34.

[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.260]
Wait, let me give you the phone to throw through the wall here just like that.

[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.300]
Hold on, I can even Disney smoking now.

[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:02.640]
Look at that.

[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.980]
Look where he's got this cigar too.

[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:04.880]
Shocking.

[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.800]
What does that say for GTR?

[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:07.200]
Wow.

[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.040]
What is that?

[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.420]
What do you make these up?

[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.420]
10, 7 and what?

[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.320]
Do I take these under 12?

[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:13.700]
Take these under 12.

[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.620]
Pull away, right?

[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.700]
You hot beat.

[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.520]
But your number two, 10 so hot beat them.

[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.660]
That a 14 9.

[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.040]
Well, sure.

[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.320]
Once in a while I'll get a fluke.

[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.800]
Now next is POW.

[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.180]
What is this?

[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:24.620]
This is the week?

[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:25.320]
Yeah.

[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.880]
Oh, power had a 75.

[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:29.780]
Love had a 5.

[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.180]
Six.

[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.860]
Thank you so much.

[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.340]
Now what are these?

[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.320]
Oh, here's midday.

[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:34.780]
Hot had a 13.

[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:35.640]
Oh, I'm telling you.

[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.480]
That key guy's me has got electric crayons.

[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.220]
That guy's nuts.

[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.740]
Seriously, if you'd start eating fish eggs, I'm telling you.

[00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:42.720]
The work for you every time.

[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.500]
The guy is incredible.

[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.480]
13 for hot and midday.

[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.240]
18 to 34.

[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.440]
GTR had a 10 8 up from what?

[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.460]
I'm going to need a four.

[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:50.960]
Yeah.

[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.300]
Power had a 6 5 down a tenth of a point.

[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.600]
Gloves had a 6 2.

[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.900]
And IOD was number 5.

[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.420]
In 18 to 34 with a 6 1.

[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.380]
I think this means we got you, Neil.

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.780]
Oh, yeah, but our people can spell.

[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.720]
Waxy had a fine-form at day.

[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.360]
Oh, geez.

[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.200]
You know, he's going to be real unhappy over there.

[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]
You know how emotionally he gets.

[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.400]
I think it's pretty emotional.

[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.940]
That's the kind of stuff that we strive for.

[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.380]
Well, maybe one day you'll achieve it.

[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.000]
Joy with a 4 5.

[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.200]
Why 100 midday?

[00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.660]
18 to 34 down to a 4 4.

[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.100]
And what about morning drive?

[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.980]
I did that a lot of 100 because, yeah.

[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:28.700]
How did it turn out?

[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:29.180]
Let's get there.

[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.340]
18 to 34 morning drive.

[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.260]
GTR 9 1 to a 12 0.

[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:33.740]
Ooh.

[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:34.860]
That was number 2.

[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.320]
I was like 14 6.

[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.000]
Nothing I hate more than a guy crowing a lot.

[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.400]
You asked for the adult 18 to 34.

[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.500]
I just said Joe, can I stop getting emotional now?

[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.520]
Oh, the kernel was up.

[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.260]
Ah!

[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.560]
He's done to the roof.

[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.960]
3 3 to a 3 8.

[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:47.660]
Wow.

[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.380]
He has.

[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:49.780]
Hold those I-95.

[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.020]
Yeah, we have a 10 5.

[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:52.980]
Look at this.

[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.920]
Sandy, 18 to 34 was down from a 1 to 4 to a 0.3.

[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.860]
A 0.3.

[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.620]
That's like you could put them in auditorium and, okay.

[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:01.360]
Ah!

[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.380]
And have room left over.

[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.320]
Where the hell is Zeta?

[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.080]
18 to 31.

[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.600]
Where is that Gonser now?

[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.340]
Come on, Gons.

[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.040]
Look at that.

[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:08.320]
Look at that.

[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:08.980]
4 2.

[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.460]
There's the story.

[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.920]
Gonser had a 4 2 in midday.

[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:12.960]
I'm going to do that other stuff.

[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.180]
I know you're not going to give it to us.

[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:14.820]
You won't relinquish it.

[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:14.960]
No.

[00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:15.920]
Ha ha ha.

[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.980]
Ha ha ha.

[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.300]
Okay, let's see.

[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.300]
6 to 10 a.m.

[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.200]
Who are we looking for?

[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.660]
Look like she had a good book, huh?

[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.280]
Yeah.

[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:22.660]
Yeah.

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.060]
They turned the corner.

[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.740]
They turned the same quarter that Zeta turned.

[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.940]
Did you hear any rumor about Zeta?

[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.320]
No.

[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.440]
They're going dance music.

[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.820]
Oh, I want to see Alice.

[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:31.600]
18 to 31.

[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.440]
They're going to be I-95.

[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.300]
I-95?

[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:33.920]
Come on, back.

[00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:35.340]
He's gone.

[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.100]
I-O-D.

[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:36.440]
Let's see.

[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.020]
He's gone.

[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:38.640]
He's going.

[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.000]
Still in the building.

[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:40.440]
Going.

[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.100]
I-O-D-3-3.

[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.700]
18 to 30.

[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.440]
He's going to be 40 afternoon.

[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.620]
And Alice, I bet you Alice had a number that will live in the Anals of broadcast history.

[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.240]
0.5.

[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.340]
Down from a 1-4.

[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.060]
So he lost.

[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:53.060]

[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.140]
Two-thirds he lost two of those three people that he had.

[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.660]
Well, you talk about jury entry.

[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.000]
Okay, thank you so much.

[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.620]
Well, you're welcome.

[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:01.420]
Anytime.

[00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.300]
What was that on GTR again for?

[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.140]
7-6 to 10-7.

[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.900]
See, if you would, if you'd open your eyes, which I know for you isn't easy, you'd notice

[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:13.620]
that the first two trends of every book for GTR, you get screwed.

[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:14.040]
Okay.

[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.200]
There's a pattern there.

[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.920]
If you go back over the last two years, it's the same pattern every time.

[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.400]
And the third month, they finally get the sampling right and it goes way up.

[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.180]
And then you get the number.

[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.920]
So instead of getting hysterical and counting and giving us a bunch of crap,

[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.940]
grow up a little bit.

[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.260]
Well, yeah.

[00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.020]
Have a cigar.

[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:29.740]
Exactly.

[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.560]
If you want one right spot, we'll even light it for you.

[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:32.840]
Okay.

[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.400]
Okay, there he goes.

[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.760]
I'm going to spit on the jar of WGTR, state and scream.

[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.360]
Scream.

[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.760]
It's 11.35 in WIOD and don't forget this Saturday now.

[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.540]
This could be kind of like our rating celebration.

[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.700]
We're going to have free bagels and hot dogs and all kinds of goodies there.

[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.800]
And lots of bumper stickers.

[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.200]
Steve's got those new bumper stickers and I got the old ones.

[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.600]
And we might even have the pictures.

[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.400]
And of course, they've got loads and loads of...

[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:56.520]
All right, wait a minute.

[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.540]
We've had all these rumors today.

[00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.520]
We do like to be fair.

[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.260]
We just had a report from Rose over in Carroll City.

[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.380]
It might not be as bad as everyone say.

[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:05.840]
Yeah.

[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.580]
Sonny wants...

[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.160]
Well, in a hundred mornings, 18 to 34, well, it's too late.

[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.820]
He already spiked to come back.

[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.880]
Oh, yeah, those are...

[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.780]
Sonny, you got to be a little quicker on the draw.

[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.420]
He's giving you every other pain in the ass while 100 number.

[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.340]
Now, just bug off.

[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:21.100]
They're...

[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.240]
The program director is gone.

[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.460]
You got to be dancing a jiff.

[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:24.140]
Absolutely.

[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.880]
And a three-year-old program director, right?

[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.120]
He's gone, Sonny.

[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:27.820]
You're not great.

[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:28.480]
Gone.

[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.460]
Wait a second, Jose.

[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:29.960]
Yeah.

[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.840]
With bells on his nose and rings on his feet.

[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.040]
He really blew this market up.

[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.600]
Remember what I always say about when we have a good trend or something?

[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.420]
Oh, you're gonna look at the phone.

[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:36.780]
True.

[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:37.600]
Yeah, three lines.

[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.340]
I'm not saying we take any.

[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:40.860]
Yeah.

[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.680]
But it's sure...

[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:44.180]
See, it's the way of evening things out in this market.

[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.340]
You can never have a big ego.

[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.140]
The numbers come in.

[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:46.760]
You can have this...

[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:48.740]
You normally can have an 80-year-old.

[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:49.160]
And they would...

[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.540]
Wow, we're not gonna talk to him today.

[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.780]
We don't want to get him to get a big head, you know?

[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:55.080]
Well, screw you folks, too.

[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.700]
Okay, that's the way we feel about it.

[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.660]
We sure appreciate your loyalty.

[00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.920]
Have a nice day and go to hell.

[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.640]
Like someone that mail we get, you know?

[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.380]
Remember that one thing where they sent me that information

[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.260]
and about you'd really enjoy this.

[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.160]
And then the letter went on and just ripped it off.

[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:10.560]
Oh, sure.

[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:11.620]
About the car phones.

[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.040]
Yeah.

[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:12.960]
And said, these are good.

[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:13.800]
These are great models.

[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:14.620]
I have two of them.

[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.240]
They really work really well.

[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:15.980]
They do align.

[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.360]
You were lying on the rest of the letter.

[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.700]
I've seen it rip, I've seen it rip.

[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.100]
Yeah, okay.

[00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.020]
It's incredible.

[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.840]
All right, we're gonna give the numbers out one time.

[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.940]
And then we'll assume that we've totally bored our regular list.

[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:25.320]
Look at that.

[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.540]
That they're all three lines in data.

[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.800]
Let the whole rest of the board is as blank as the management's brain.

[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.040]
Wow.

[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:31.540]
Thank you.

[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.600]
It's like a giant vacuum.

[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.200]
We don't particularly appreciate your attitude, okay folks?

[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.660]
Oh, but we can always count on this call, right?

[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.980]
Yeah, you know, I don't think that-

[00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.720]
But things are really dead.

[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:43.800]
Oh, now they're going nuts.

[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.580]
As soon as they heard your voice, they called it a process.

[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.520]
I don't think there was ever any question that you guys would have achieved greatness.

[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.180]
Yeah, I'll say it.

[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.320]
Probably because of your calls, right?

[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.280]
I didn't say that.

[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.660]
Or is it in spite of your calls?

[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:57.580]
In spite of my calls.

[00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.260]
Are you gonna be there Saturday, Paul?

[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:00.180]
Where's that?

[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.120]
At Toyota Hommie.

[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:01.360]
How many?

[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:02.380]
You want?

[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.520]
Are you gonna be there, Gordon?

[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.200]
No.

[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.400]
No, he's coming to the next window.

[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.300]
He finally embarrassed the sales department into getting him in on these things.

[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.240]
I said from now on after this one, yeah.

[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.340]
Okay, are we ever gonna have one of these non-radio type get-togethers?

[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.280]
Or that's not gonna happen?

[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.400]
I don't see why not.

[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.860]
Yeah, because those are fun.

[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.580]
We could have like an old E-Mac and Bollio's reunion now that the restaurant's out of business.

[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.240]
There you go.

[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.100]
Well, they're on fault.

[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.000]
Now that they govern themselves accordingly.

[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:25.200]
They're on fault.

[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:25.860]
Right out of business.

[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.080]
But anyway, you know, with all these poor ratings,

[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.980]
there are so many talented people out of work out there.

[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:32.220]

[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.920]
Really, Johnny just raised his hand.

[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.060]
Johnny, dark, for example.

[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.740]
And all during the breaks, he's been going,

[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:37.920]
I, ninety-huh.

[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.480]
He does you pretty well, too.

[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.380]
Well, thirty-five to sixty-four just came in.

[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.000]
This ought to be a really heavy duty for Alice.

[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.980]
First of all, when we get to the sixty-plus party.

[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.400]
I, not ninety-five.

[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.520]
That was kind of like a twinkie type station, wasn't it?

[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.560]
Yeah, it was kind of like, why?

[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:51.120]
I went a hundred.

[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.920]
Now I could just picture a man.

[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.180]
A man.

[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:54.460]

[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.320]
Yeah, I could see a man on a high, high, ninety-five.

[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.200]
I could picture it.

[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.860]
I could picture it.

[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:01.380]
Let's see, thirty-five to sixty-four.

[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.600]
I wonder how we did in that category.

[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.500]
Probably not too great.

[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:04.180]
Ten to three.

[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:04.960]
Look at that.

[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:05.620]
We were second.

[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:07.020]
Life had an eight-nine.

[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:07.860]
We had a seven-eight.

[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.520]
How the hell is that?

[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.800]
Well, we must have, like mostly thirty-five to fifty-four.

[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:12.360]
Right?

[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.160]
Mm-hmm.

[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:14.640]
Must have.

[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.680]
That is John on this.

[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.220]
Seven-eight.

[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.620]
Well, we just kicked ass everywhere, didn't we?

[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:20.980]
Well, that'll show those brain dead sales people

[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.540]
a thing or two.

[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.440]
Steve and the afternoon had a five-seven, up from a five-six, five-seven.

[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.840]
And Alice still don't show too good, because until they get to sixty-five plus,

[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.340]
don't you snooze, don't show too much.

[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.900]
Yeah, two-nine to a two-two in the afternoon, thirty-five to sixty-four.

[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.820]
So their audience is almost all sixty-five plus.

[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.320]
I'd be embarrassed.

[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.080]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.100]
Sounds like a lot of preparation.

[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:42.560]
Wow.

[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.000]
Now what are they giving away fiber one?

[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.120]
They're trying to keep their few listeners alive over there.

[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.780]
All right, well, again, congratulations and you guys are by far the bus.

[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.120]
Oh, is he gone?

[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:55.780]
He's gone.

[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.180]
Huh?

[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.560]
Well, I do want to talk some more to him.

[00:56:58.580 --> 00:56:58.920]
Oh, no.

[00:56:59.060 --> 00:56:59.640]
Because I didn't.

[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.040]
No, no.

[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.500]
He's okay, but boy, it's very small dose is like about ten words at a time.

[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.740]
Okay, it's eleven forty-one at WID.

[00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:09.460]
We're going to give these numbers out, and then we expect to see some incredible action in this studio, okay?

[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:09.980]
Action?

[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.400]
Well, it's food action.

[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:12.780]
That's right.

[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.500]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:14.820]
Mentally and physically.

[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:16.680]
We have to see work in years, okay?

[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.040]
Yeah.

[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.340]
751 WIOG and Dave.

[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:21.780]
We want you to call it and tinkle all over everybody here.

[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.200]
Now, come on, call it and say how great it was, even though you don't mean it, even though you couldn't care less, okay?

[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.920]
Now, do we have a separate column like for douchebags?

[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.960]
Because I know we're number one in douchebags.

[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:32.980]
You know, question about it.

[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.040]
No contest.

[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.720]
Let's see, an open line in Dave, one in brown, five, two, four WID.

[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.260]
And then if we can get vocal it, we get those other three lines lit.

[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:40.620]
Wow.

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:41.580]
We'll have the full board of calls.

[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.840]
So we've been waiting for all more.

[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.440]
See, I don't really care about the numbers.

[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:50.500]
I like to see a full board of calls because you know what stands is I have the busy signal thing complex, whatever he calls it.

[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:50.920]
Syndrome.

[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:55.580]
And then he gets down to two calls and starts, starts hyperventilating on the air with a cigar.

[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:57.420]
Wow.

[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:58.500]
Okay, there's bokeh now.

[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.720]
We get that other brown line going there, even if it's, you know who?

[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:07.500]
Now, while you're waiting on that, I want to give you this little tidbit.

[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.120]
That was the terrain point for us, by the way.

[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.080]
You know, I'm dying over there.

[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.920]
That was a, you have a delima?

[00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:12.280]
Yeah.

[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:14.140]
Well, it's in the new inquire.

[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:18.000]
I just want to, I just want to, I just noticed this in the new inquire.

[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.420]
I just want to read this to you.

[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:25.500]
Michael Jackson got all the time in the world for Powell, Marlon Brando.

[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:35.320]
He gave his buddy a one million dollar antique pocket watch for his 65th birthday.

[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.300]
Just wanted sort of the, put that out.

[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.100]
So you could, which pocket did he put it in?

[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:43.300]
Yeah.

[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:48.380]
And once he was wearing his glove, those are the things that America's firing mind want to know.

[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:52.260]
Okay, and that's the kind of information that we strive for, underlined in red.

[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.200]
It is underlined in red.

[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:53.580]
Look at that.

[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:54.660]
Yeah, we have a witness.

[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:55.680]
It's underlined in red.

[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.160]
Well, pink.

[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.660]
Without Ricky Tiki-Man, he, he kind of gave us the guidance.

[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:02.740]
He was like the, inspiring, the guiding light for this show.

[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.880]
And without him and without those talk up.

[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.460]
Not seriously.

[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.040]
So matter of fact, I think in honor.

[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:08.480]
Yeah.

[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:09.580]
Good.

[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.620]
I don't know why you're laughing.

[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.000]
I'm dead serious about this.

[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.020]
This is not, this is not laughing kind of stuff.

[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.680]
This is a heavy duty serious stuff now, okay?

[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.180]
To try to control yourself.

[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.680]
Well, we went a long time without these.

[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.080]
Yeah, to hear him again.

[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.720]
He spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to tell you that happened.

[00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:29.520]
And one of the ways, one of the very easy and inexpensive, underlined in red, ways of

[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:31.960]
doing that is doing what you enjoy.

[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.200]
Thanks, those things.

[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.200]
How you doing?

[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.340]
Oh, Ricky.

[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:37.840]
Oh.

[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.100]
See, even he's excited.

[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.340]
That was shocking, wasn't it?

[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.960]
I think we ought to add another point out of waxing numbers.

[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:43.440]
That's so lovely.

[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.460]
Just an honor of that talk up.

[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.740]
Okay, that was shocking.

[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.560]
That was beautiful.

[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:49.140]
Ricky, we take back everything we've ever said about you.

[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.940]
You're a genius in your own mind, okay?

[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.020]
And if you ever took that cap off, your brains would spill all over the radio dial.

[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:55.040]
Shocking.

[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.080]
Wow.

[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.820]
Line six is down.

[00:59:59.120 --> 00:59:59.880]
Oh, it's down.

[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.180]
That's why I didn't lie.

[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.100]
Line six is dead.

[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.720]
I think it's probably from the pressure from these calls here today.

[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:06.560]
It's, hello.

[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.060]
Oh, yeah, Dennis.

[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.700]
Yeah, say me, you pal.

[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.420]
I wasn't Dennis Rees again, either, I'll tell you.

[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.560]
Okay, 1144, WI.

[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.640]
See, now I don't feel so bad.

[01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.260]
If we could say that about three or four of the lines were out, then I'd feel better.

[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.660]
Even if they're not, say that they're out.

[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:23.420]
It's just wonderful.

[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.660]
And then I'll feel better.

[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.860]
Oh, here's a Pembroke Pines GT R listener.

[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.560]
I bet you spike will go nuts on this call.

[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.140]
Yeah.

[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.580]
Didn't know how many of these things you guys went.

[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:32.880]
What?

[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.580]
I don't know.

[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.700]
Spike was mentioning it.

[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.000]
And they're not on at the same time, pal.

[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.060]
Wait a minute.

[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.860]
What was Spike bragging about?

[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.060]
Because in 18 to 34 GT R had a, what do they have?

[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.380]
Like a tension for it.

[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.420]
In midday, we had a 6-1.

[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:46.820]
Yeah.

[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.800]
Also, the whole station B W R D.

[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:49.420]
No.

[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.300]
No, I would be at a 5-1.

[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.040]
They had a 4.

[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.780]
What was the guy who had a GT R D, you guys?

[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.980]
I just got through telling you 18 to 34.

[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:57.720]
That's their audience.

[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.780]
I got a bunch of, how old are you?

[01:00:59.360 --> 01:00:59.900]
I'm 30.

[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:00.720]
Well, there you go.

[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.400]
18 to 34, a bunch of young pinheads.

[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.140]
Space cadets.

[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.480]
You just don't want to give someone in being credit.

[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.300]
We're credit to do.

[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.000]
They're great, man.

[01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:10.460]
I think we just have some fun with them.

[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:10.980]
Don't you understand?

[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:12.820]
And if they ever got an act, they'd really be good.

[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:13.280]
Yeah.

[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.840]
Well, McBean was out Monday, so the ratings in the next book will drop a little.

[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.620]
Yeah, just a hair.

[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.000]
Yeah.

[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.300]
If we can say that.

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.260]
He probably got more than one.

[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:21.600]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.240]
And he'll probably tell you where it is to know when that filthy show they got.

[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.320]
Okay, listen, have a great life.

[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:25.880]
Okay, right.

[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:26.880]

[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.840]
Yeah, those thermodynamic beam listeners, well, they're very uptight, you know what I'm saying?

[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.180]
Yeah.

[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:34.060]
See, part of the reason that they finally have gone up though is because we're not on FM in the morning anymore.

[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:34.240]
Oh, sure.

[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.400]
If you just got probably listened to us on Zeta, he doesn't want to admit it because he doesn't want to hurt their feelings.

[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.480]
They're so sensitive.

[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.180]
Oh, yeah.

[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.740]
And you notice they sent us overall their bad material now that they won't use on either.

[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.340]
What do you think they're trying to tell us something?

[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:45.800]
Well, yeah.

[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.780]
They're hoping they can get our numbers down a little bit.

[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.140]
Okay, we do have an open line in Dave County.

[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.780]
I just mentioned that and one in Broward now.

[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.700]
Oh, man, I'll tell you this is so deflating.

[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.700]
I feel like we got a one.

[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.840]
Wouldn't it be nice to have...

[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.380]
See, I'm one of those people I expect too much.

[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.020]
I really do expect too much.

[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.820]
I expect people to care and they don't care.

[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.320]
They don't give a fly and leap one more time.

[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.760]
And that's my problem, especially in this town.

[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.060]
We saw that at the beginning of the show.

[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:11.380]
We proved it with that scientific poll we took on the phone.

[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.600]
They don't care.

[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.280]
And at least they're honest about it.

[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:14.540]
Okay.

[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.160]
They're not going to tinkle all over.

[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:16.960]
Oh, yeah, we care.

[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:17.660]
They don't care.

[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.160]
Don't bother us.

[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300]
We want to be left alone.

[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.980]
And I can relate to that.

[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.080]
The receptionist from WQAM would like the morning ratings.

[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.040]
Oh, man.

[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.100]
You know that receptionist.

[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.440]
He's an Ojohn provocateur.

[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.320]
Okay. WQAM in the morning ladies and gentlemen,

[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.000]
6 to 10 AM, which is kind of moot because they got the...

[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.060]
Motherly over there now.

[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:39.920]
Now they do.

[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.820]
WQAM, I'm on the last page and I'm still searching.

[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.100]
Here they are second from the bottom.

[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.580]
Tied for last with WRHC, you know, speaking of English.

[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:47.860]
0.7.

[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:48.640]
God.

[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.640]
Which is up from a 0.6.

[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.440]
And it was up from a 0.4 before that in the summer.

[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.520]
Motherly, it's a take care of them.

[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.140]
Motherly will get them up to at least a 0.8.

[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.160]
And in 20...

[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.820]
25 to 54 is in the morning.

[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.600]
I know that he's an Ojohn provocateur.

[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.640]
In the morning...

[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:07.960]
Where in the hell are they?

[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:08.840]
I can see how they...

[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.360]
Oh, here we go.

[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:10.660]
I got all these sheets.

[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.120]
I got real sheet problems here.

[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.240]
6 to 10 in the morning, 25 to 54.

[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.320]
I bet you they're on the last sheet of this bat.

[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.660]
Start at the back and go away down.

[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.380]
EAT, well that's not in the market.

[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.200]
Rockin' Big Daddy.

[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.680]
Radio Suave.

[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.660]
She with a 0.9 is right down there and QAM tied them.

[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.380]
There's a three-way tie for next to last.

[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.140]
QAM, QAM Radio Suave.

[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.760]
When you're tied with Radio Suave.

[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.080]
Yeah.

[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.440]
You know, you're out of the business, okay?

[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:38.960]
Yeah.

[01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.540]
And we want to congratulate John Tanagami over there at Chief

[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.580]
or consistently, month in, month out, book it and book out.

[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.480]
Just suck in the big one at Chief, okay?

[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.360]
I mean, just absolutely with that gigantic 100,000 watch

[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.300]
and let you can hear from coast to coast all over the world practically

[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.800]
with no audience.

[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.280]
Nothing.

[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.660]
You think Rose Folger's something.

[01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:59.080]
At least he's got 10 or 12 listeners.

[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.100]
At she...

[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.140]
No, that's anyhow bad it is.

[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:03.380]
They don't even use arbitrarity anymore.

[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.320]
They sent out a search product.

[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.960]
They can't find anybody.

[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.600]
And you know, all those people are going to have those old sheet bumper stickers.

[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.900]
They haven't listened to it in two years.

[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:11.240]
No.

[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.920]
So don't go by that stuff.

[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.200]
Anyway, it's 12 minutes till noon.

[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.080]
And if you're ready now to satisfy that hunger,

[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:20.520]
I know a lot of people in this audience have a physical and a mental hunger, okay?

[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.680]
Now we try to satisfy the mental hunger by giving you a little food for thought.

[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.380]
Not too much.

[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.040]
Just a little tiny bit once in a while.

[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:27.280]
Yeah.

[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:28.760]
Like, I'm dying over here.

[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.840]
That should do it for this audience.

[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.260]
But if you want to satisfy that physical hunger...

[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.120]
Yeah, she did.

[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.080]
Okay, it's 11.52 in the middle of the night.

[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.860]
We have another rumor.

[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.840]
And I'm not going to mention Ames.

[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.160]
Go on a rumor today, buddy.

[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.900]
But somebody from the morning show on Zeta,

[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:44.560]
this is in line with that rumor that we heard earlier, which they're vigorously denying.

[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.260]
Oh, yeah.

[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.120]
Someone is called somebody else in the business that he used to work for for a reference,

[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.360]
which means he's looking for a job.

[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:52.260]
Huh.

[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.320]
Huh.

[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.580]
He's an Ojoan Provacator.

[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:57.240]
Huh.

[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:00.040]
Hi, 95.

[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.040]
Well, when they said they turned the corner, man,

[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.800]
what do they know that they'd be peeking out from behind that fence?

[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.120]
At that big sprawling expressway.

[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.660]
I want to congratulate the DOT, by the way, on their ingenious job.

[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:18.060]
Because when I go like up to Poppano Park, and you go up 95 from where I am to Atlantic Boulevard,

[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:22.380]
they've to get rid of the old white lines in the road, what they've done.

[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.840]
And a lot of places, they'll paint them over in black, so it blends in with the highway, with the tar.

[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:27.880]
Not here.

[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.980]
They scrape them off, and what they do is they dig these two big ridges in the road.

[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:37.120]
So now you've got two huge ridges in the road, and the last two miles before you get to the Atlantic Boulevard exit,

[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.500]
they've tarred over in the right-hand lane, two-thirds of the lane.

[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.300]
So the rest of the lane is of like an inter-too-lower, and here are all these cars in every lane,

[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.960]
more so than usual, swarving and puking and all of a sudden.

[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.900]
Please give the top twenty-twelf plus numbers after the news.

[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.400]
Thanks from Arab.

[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.900]
We got an Arab that owns this to, I don't know, I can't read this.

[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:56.340]
Arab?

[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.360]
Whoever it is.

[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.620]
Okay, we'll give anything you want.

[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.300]
Okay, anything that'll kill some time and bore the rest of our audience.

[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.320]
Because this is our way of punishing them, of getting back.

[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.100]
What's the month we get a chance to get into the audience by punishing them with the money?

[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:12.360]
So these tedious, boring, terminal numbers that are enough to make you puke your guts out, and speaking of that, where's lunch?

[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.780]
Well, seriously, Johnny Dark is in here a one-time incredibly famous radio celebrity.

[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:23.840]
Well, and he hasn't worked in a long time, and he's like a chipmunk.

[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.280]
He's gearing up like a squirrel.

[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.300]
That's why he's got all this weight on, because he's afraid that one of these days.

[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.880]
And we need some food in here.

[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.260]
And I think Carmine would send food over today on our great celebratory of Tuesday.

[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.600]
Celebrating the entire IODTR, sure.

[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.440]
Or someone.

[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:38.900]
Shucks.

[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:40.260]
Shucks.

[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.700]
Well, let's see, that's a big preparation when they have to go through.

[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.400]
That will someone will.

[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.540]
And maybe Arnold over at the hamburger thing.

[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.120]
Oh.

[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.900]
See, I love char-hut, but char-hut is the nearest one is so far away, I don't think it's going to happen in the United.

[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.420]
But Arnold over there with those real castles, they were incredible.

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.040]
Oh, they were incredible.

[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:55.400]
Great.

[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.880]
We had those the other last week.

[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:57.520]
Wow.

[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.120]
Shocking.

[01:06:59.080 --> 01:06:59.620]
They were.

[01:06:59.800 --> 01:06:59.940]
They were.

[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.540]
1154 at IODT.

[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:08.320]
After the new news for those of you planning on tuning out, we'll be reading the top 20 in order.

[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.100]
12 plush.

[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:10.320]
Okay.

[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.060]
We're going to bring in boom boom to read.

[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.880]
We have an open line and brown right.

[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.060]
Right.

[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.600]
24 WID and here comes Sharon with more ponderous numbers.

[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.580]
Okay, I was just about to take a call and thank God you came in with this.

[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.720]
These are 18 to 34.

[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.420]
Oh, so I can't.

[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.220]
It's not a fosh sign.

[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.020]
You still listening to that?

[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.140]
Yeah, of course.

[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:26.740]
Of course.

[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:27.600]
Okay, we're getting.

[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.500]
No, let's attend to three.

[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.240]
We had a 6-1.

[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.500]
Now, look at what it was when we came here.

[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.280]
It was a .6.

[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:33.920]
What?

[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.920]
Alice had a point something.

[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.500]
We already looked at a .3.

[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.180]
How to go.

[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.160]
That a girl, Alice.

[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.400]
Almost off the air.

[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.400]
What was I looking for now?

[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.980]
Sonny Fox and Amori is desperate for his 18 to 34.

[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.420]
And that's the one Sharon didn't bring in here.

[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.600]
So blame Sharon for it.

[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:50.920]
Not me.

[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:51.920]
Oh, here it is.

[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:52.640]
6 to 10 am.

[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.080]
I got it.

[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:53.960]
Okay.

[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.160]
6 to 10, hot with a 14, 6 and a morning, 18 to 34.

[01:07:58.420 --> 01:07:59.280]
GTR with a 12.

[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.800]
I said it again, Bill, 12.

[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.140]
Okay, you're happy now, you idiot.

[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.600]
Well, I 100 with a 7, down from an 8, 8.

[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.160]
Wow.

[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.300]
7, 1 from an 8, 8, down.

[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.520]
1.7, I'd say about a fourth, fifth.

[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.480]
Down 20%.

[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:12.800]
Great.

[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:13.640]
18 to 34.

[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:16.160]
And of course, that's the meat and potatoes of those rocky,

[01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.780]
socky, jockey music intensive pinhead stations for those young pre-pubescent idiots.

[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:21.780]
Right?

[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:22.920]
A rendish.

[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.260]
Yeah.

[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.540]
They got that Donnie Osborne show.

[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:27.340]
I think I'll put them over the top.

[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.660]
He's out of town on the bus with Steve Watson and Quintet.

[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:31.440]
Zeta.

[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.960]
6 to 10 am, 18 to 34 from a 3, 3 to a 3, 8.

[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.600]
But like we said, the two books ago, and we were there at 10 to 5.

[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.120]
So they've only lost two thirds of that audience.

[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.540]
So no wonder the kernel is a desperately seeking references, huh?

[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.060]
No, we wish them luck.

[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:45.740]
We wish them luck.

[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.120]
And the guy only knows how to lead it.

[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.280]
Miami, hello.

[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.960]
And die in over here.

[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:50.540]
Hold on.

[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.340]
Come on, Rose.

[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.100]
It's not that bad.

[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:56.660]
Or was that Tim Williams?

[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:00.000]
Now, when guys work together long enough, they start sounding alike.

[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.120]
I mean, one more time now.

[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.380]
I'm dying, I'm opening up.

[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.440]
Oh, that was Tim Williams, right?

[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.000]
And we don't want to speak ill of Tim because he does have young children.

[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.320]
And you know how you motion-legate.

[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.140]
What is that?

[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.660]
Did you hear somebody cackling and laying a big on it?

[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.060]
Is that a hallway?

[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.260]
Yeah, I thought that was on the phone.

[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.520]
Is that on the phone?

[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.540]
What was that?

[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:18.380]
That was incredible.

[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.220]
Somebody's goosing April in the hallway, I think.

[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.160]
You better check it out.

[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.380]
West Palm Beach, hello.

[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.160]
I just called to tank on your tanko-tanko.

[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.760]
I can't talk long so I'll call you later.

[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:29.700]
Okay.

[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.800]
Now let's not start that now, okay?

[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.500]
With the last ten minutes of the show every day, we reserve for that.

[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.320]
But I can't deal with a lot of them.

[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.080]
Too old to deal with four hours of that, all right?

[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:38.440]
Yeah.

[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.600]
Should we try Boka?

[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.800]
Because we actually got like a couple of calls on it.

[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.560]
We're not overwhelming, but we got a few.

[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:44.560]
Boka, hello.

[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.900]
Yeah, like I said.

[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.180]
Yeah.

[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.540]
It's pretty grim.

[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.260]
Well, they don't even know anything about radio and Boka.

[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.960]
And if you've ever heard of WSBR at all, like living proof of it.

[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.100]
Okay, we have a Boka line open, 278WIOD.

[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:56.520]
There it goes.

[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.180]
And the Palm Beach line, come on, Lee.

[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:02.060]
Now I know just before you go on the air, you'd love to hear if J&O showed up the answers no.

[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.380]
So I guess you don't have to call.

[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.860]
J&O just didn't, WR-MF showed a little bit like they always do.

[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.980]
Like a little fraction, you know?

[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.260]
WR-MF.

[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:13.900]
Let's try a pinhead and broward.

[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:14.140]
Hello.

[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:16.240]
Hey, how you doing, pal?

[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.380]
Hi, congratulations on your numbers.

[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.260]
Well, thanks so much.

[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.280]
They don't mean much, do they?

[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.720]
But it's nice to see him in print.

[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.800]
But I was wondering if you give me so much travel tips.

[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.620]
I'm getting next week I'm going on vacation.

[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:27.420]
Yeah.

[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.420]
First I'm flying to Chicago for a day.

[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.060]
Oh, you're going to go see the Cubs?

[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.440]
I'm like, I'm only going to be there like three hours.

[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.740]
Well, that's good because you get really depressed if you went to WR-MF.

[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.220]
And then from there I'm going to California.

[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.660]
So I was wondering if you could give me something no good places.

[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.320]
Like I think I'm going to go ahead and report for like three hours, is it?

[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.700]
Yeah, well, that'll give you just enough time to change planes at O'Hare.

[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:48.420]
Really?

[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.680]
Yeah, that's a mess.

[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:53.180]
That's the worst airport you just, you're probably tearing your hair out at O'Hare.

[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.360]
That's why they call it O'Hare.

[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.260]
Some people call it no-here.

[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.080]
And then where are you going to California?

[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:00.720]
Los Angeles.

[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:01.680]
Los Angeles.

[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.260]
Well, take a gas mask with you.

[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.240]
I don't want to get you depressed before this trip.

[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.020]
But take a gas mask.

[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.700]
You can't read the air the smog is so thick you could cut it with a butter knife, okay?

[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.160]
But I got to that's why I'm only staying like four days ago.

[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.980]
Yeah, well by the end of that time when you come back I know at Mount Sinai they got a good unit where they give you like oxygen, you know, pure oxygen for a day or two.

[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:21.540]
Other than that have a great time, okay?

[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.740]
Are you going to call us from out there?

[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:26.660]
I'm going to call you from Chicago because I think it's going to be at the same time day in the show.

[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.220]
Excellent.

[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.900]
And then I'll call you from LA.

[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.520]
And no problem you'll be able to get right through.

[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.080]
Trust me.

[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.340]
I'll be 267.

[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:33.200]
Any line.

[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.160]
No, 655.

[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:35.300]
655.

[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:35.920]
655.

[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.100]
Write it on your sleeve, okay?

[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:37.520]
Okay.

[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.800]
I have a great trip.

[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:39.080]
Bye.

[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:39.480]
Bye.

[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:40.720]
Wow.

[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.760]
Okay, we have an open line in Broward at 524WID considering one of the Broward lines is out.

[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:51.440]
That's not saying an awful lot for you stiffs up there and we do have an open line in Palm Beach at 655WID.

[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.020]
655, ooh look at that, a Palm Beach call. Are you there?

[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:56.000]
Brow.

[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.860]
Are you ready to speak to us?

[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:58.240]
Yeah.

[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.000]
Well we got to do the news. Are you going to hold on?

[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:00.440]
Okay.

[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.200]
You sure?

[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:01.700]
Yeah.

[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.020]
We're not imposing on you are we?

[01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:03.360]
No.

[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.180]
Okay, hold on.

[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.100]
Not that we care about it, you know, it sounds polite.

[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:08.240]
What about Mike?

[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.480]
Can we give Mike these numbers?

[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.100]
But we'll do it all again after the news.

[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.160]
In fact, we'll do it like every 50 minutes kind of like the NFL draft, okay?

[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.220]
Every number.

[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.900]
We'll get even with those sports people, man.

[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.180]
Every number you want to know and something.

[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.580]
I never hope you never hear again.

[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.660]
5-1-W-I-O-D-N-D-A-D.

[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.040]
524WID in Broward.

[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.760]
Or 655 and 278WID in the Palm Beach.

[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.460]
Other areas make all collect.

[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.520]
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.

[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.560]
Now, here's Neil Rogers, our new stock radio 610W-I-O-D.

[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.840]
Okay, we've got to count down those tough 20 and 12 plus, but Johnny Dark says he won't

[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.420]
relinquish the power.

[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:52.820]
Now I have.

[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.020]
Oh, you got it.

[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:54.840]
I was looking at it.

[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.560]
Where is the food?

[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.240]
This is supposed to be our big ratings part, huh?

[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.100]
What a party, huh?

[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.760]
And even boy Gary won't complain if we get food in here today.

[01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:02.600]
He would go nuts.

[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.360]
He'd probably eat some of it.

[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.060]
He'd be so excited.

[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.700]
He was yanking on those suspenders.

[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:09.760]
I thought he was going to have an accident, a radio accident.

[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.220]
Okay, here we go.

[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.120]
This is 12 plus.

[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.780]
This is the entire week for those of you who have no idea what this is about.

[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.540]
I got news for it.

[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.380]
We don't care, okay?

[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.800]
This show is basically for those poor shoulders in this business.

[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:28.520]
Those downtrodden, those abused, those overused and whipped and beaten and destroyed poor souls

[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.480]
who have put their entire lives into this business and gotten as a reward of slapping the face.

[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.100]
A kick into pants.

[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.420]
A patch in Tuchas, okay?

[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.140]
Yeah.

[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.920]
Yeah, we can relate to that.

[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:42.720]
Because that's what we all strive for.

[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:45.120]
It's to be like boom, boom.

[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.720]
And if Johnny Dark doesn't get a job pretty soon, he's going to wipe up like that.

[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.220]
Or at least get fed today anyway.

[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:52.980]
This is embarrassing.

[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.380]
Okay, top 20, 12 plus.

[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.020]
Hot.

[01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:01.520]
And 8-3, and we congratulate Keith Eisley and all those other douchebags over there for this miracle

[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.020]
that he's done with crayons mirrors and fish eggs.

[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.300]
Life with a 7-1, they don't count.

[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.500]
They just do not count.

[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.560]
What are you doing now?

[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.380]
You don't really like a little stub of a cigar like that?

[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:16.700]
Stub rhymes with slub.

[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.860]
Bub, leave me alone.

[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.520]
Number 3, W-I-O-D with a 5-1.

[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:23.520]

[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.360]
I wasn't at the first time they broke into 5 like since Mathusela's grandmother died.

[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.300]
Something like that.

[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.620]
W-Q-B-A, a 5.

[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.880]
Power from a 4-4 to a 4-3.

[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.740]
Magic, a 4-2 bouncing back up from a 3-9.

[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.600]
Well, if they keep playing in purple people either though, they're going to have some problems.

[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:50.920]
W-G-T-R, this is the one we really want to emphasize because spikewise is dancing the twist in the hallway.

[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.480]
And if he keeps playing those chubby checker records, man, he's ever really out of drop like a rock.

[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.340]
From a 2-8 up to a 4, they're number 7.

[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.420]
Number 8, he's an Ozone provocateur.

[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.060]
With a 3-9, we had a tie for a 3-9, W-A-Q-Y that's Radio Mumbi.

[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:07.760]
And Waxi.

[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.860]
Waxi was tied with Radio Mumbi.

[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.580]
Wow, that is shocking, isn't it?

[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.240]
You can listen, I have for a half hour for this.

[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:22.280]
And there is absolutely nothing on the air except this guy is a jerk.

[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.940]
That lady is a whatever ass on it, on it, on it, on it, on it.

[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:33.720]
Okay, number 10, I pertest between Y-100 with a 3-8 and W-C-M-Q with a 3-8.

[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:34.440]
Kiss.

[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.980]
As in kiss this was 12th with a 3-4.

[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.300]
Love 94 gloves, you're one of your favorite radio stations.

[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:42.780]
Oh yeah, they all love you and you're the one.

[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.360]
Especially the afternoon lady you love with a passion.

[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.180]
And I hope she never calls me again or leaves me a message.

[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.600]
13th with a 3-3, down from a 3-4, but about a flip.

[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.440]
They had pretty good demos.

[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.680]
They had a few people under 100.

[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.780]
W-S-News ladies and gentlemen, this deserves its own special little something.

[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.900]
Number 14, and dropping like a dime, dropped from the top story of the Empire State Building,

[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.520]
dropping like a pebble in the Grand Canyon.

[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.260]
W-S-News from a, listen to this, summer 4-8, fall 3-6.

[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.580]
And now in the winter time, a 3-2.

[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:19.980]
Ooh.

[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.200]
Ooh.

[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.300]
Mmm.

[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:26.520]
That's not things are not good at W-S-News.

[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.240]
Ooh.

[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.060]
Yeah.

[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.100]
W-I-N-Z at 3-1, 15th.

[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:35.440]
So those two are like kind of like neck and neck, right together there with the tidy bullman.

[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:39.300]
Number 16, W-T-M-I for our pseudo intellectuals of 3.

[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.380]
I'm not interested in the summer they had a 3 and the fall 2-9 in our 3-1.

[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.680]
It's like there's a straight line.

[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.740]
It's basically that same group of 15,000 average quarter hour pseudo intellectuals

[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:54.180]
who claimed to listen to that classical gas or get gas while they listen to the Mason Williams would say.

[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.340]
Joy FM.

[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.320]
Oh, joy forever is a thing of beauty.

[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:58.000]
This is a story.

[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.520]
Type 417 from a 4 to a 2-7 big story.

[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.040]
I would super-acquew.

[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.180]
Yeah, that's WQB AFM of 2-7.

[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:05.720]
Jumped out.

[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.440]
They really fell.

[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.320]
We can leap off the page.

[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:08.880]
They fell.

[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:09.440]
And leapyly.

[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:09.800]
Yeah.

[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.760]
And the Leros, which is coming up next time around W-I-N-Z.

[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.580]
W-E-D-R 19th with a 2-5 with that whopping signal theirs.

[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.300]
Look at their trend from a 4-5 in a summer than a 3-9 at 2-5.

[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.300]
It looks like Heath Isleys putting E-D-R to sleep.

[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.280]
And they're pretty p-o-d about it too, by the way.

[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:24.980]
They're not too happy.

[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:29.000]
And then of course rounding out the top 20 not to be left out.

[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:33.540]
W-X-D-J as an X-flax.

[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.500]
From that 2-4 from those heavy days of that fluke month that gave them that fall book of a 2-4 down to a 1-8.

[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:46.700]
Holding up following those briefly, she with a 1-7, Zeta with a 1-6, W-E-A-T-F-M with a 1-2,

[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.560]
followed by CMQ-R-H-C-F-D-L-K-A-T with a point A.

[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.160]
We shouldn't leave them out because they did show up.

[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.160]
M-B-M, Q-A-M with a point A, then radio swave with a point 7.

[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.220]
The motivation station about whom we've seen two articles this month didn't show on any page,

[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.480]
any category, any demographic.

[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.820]
They didn't make it.

[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:05.480]
It's true.

[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.820]
A non-measured val audience.

[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.820]
And they got two pages in South Florida magazine.

[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:09.540]
How do you like that?

[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:14.060]
To show you that those speakers in South Florida magazine really know the pulse of the radio market.

[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.580]
They give them two pages and they don't have one listener, okay?

[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.060]
Except for Captain Dave.

[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:18.840]
Well, they're one.

[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:19.980]
They give them one listener.

[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.740]
Maybe he'll continue to be motivated by that for the time being.

[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:24.180]
So there?

[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.020]
Where's J-A-N-O?

[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:25.800]
Where's...

[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.660]
J-A-N-O doesn't show.

[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.040]
Oh, right.

[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.720]
Super-surf didn't show up.

[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.540]
That's because most people still can't fight it on their radio dials, okay?

[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.000]
A van Patrick were still alive.

[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.660]
They'd be doing a least a one, two, okay?

[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.920]
Trust me when I say it.

[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:38.580]
All right.

[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.480]
We'll do a little break and then we'll get to your inane calls,

[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.080]
which probably have nothing to do with any of this.

[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.540]
It's 11 past noon at WIOD.

[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:44.840]
Indeed.

[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.100]
And it says you should send one of your sales people out.

[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.180]
Yeah, that'll take care of it, Rich.

[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.240]
You got a little thing here from Rich Pacti, which we appreciate,

[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.120]
but sending one of our sales people out, you know, follow up a lead,

[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:57.000]
is like sending out the Sherlock Holmes to follow a detective story.

[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.320]
And he's been dead for like...

[01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.640]
Well, he was never even born, okay?

[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.340]
Like most of our sales people.

[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.160]
Okay, it's 1214 at WIOD.

[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.120]
We deeply apologize.

[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.200]
We're so sorry that we're boring you with this stuff.

[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:06.920]
And if you believe that.

[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.280]
Okay, Steve, today, sex surrogates, are they really therapist

[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.320]
or are they just a bunch of cheap horrors, okay?

[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.840]
Are they prostitutes?

[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.240]
God forbid.

[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.700]
And his guest will be Merlin Volker and Reverend Rick Patterson.

[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.460]
And as I said before, Reverend Rick gets really nervous

[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.980]
when he hears about any new erections in some of the things

[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.600]
we have a little building, a moratorium.

[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:28.580]
A Palm Beach is holding, right?

[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:33.980]
What is he holding, though? That's the question.

[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.000]
Well, see, it's my fault. I forgot about you, right?

[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:37.300]
I guess.

[01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:39.540]
Yeah, see, I said we're going to get you after the news,

[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:41.080]
and now it's like 10 minutes later, right?

[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:41.820]
True.

[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.340]
And you're getting pretty tired of it, right?

[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:43.740]
No.

[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:44.260]
Okay.

[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.380]
Not near. Just come and say it.

[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:47.320]
You got to do a great job.

[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.260]
That's correct.

[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.780]
You're kicking butt some data.

[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:50.320]
Yeah.

[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.380]
And you're doing better on IAD.

[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:51.960]
Yeah.

[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.860]
And we don't have to get up at 4.30 in the stinkin' morning

[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.300]
and come in and look at Ugly Rose folder

[01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.420]
with a sour look on his face.

[01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:57.760]
True.

[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:00.480]
And that alone is where the price of emission.

[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:02.320]
Well, listen, is that it?

[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:02.900]
Yeah.

[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.800]
You mean you held on all that time to say something nice?

[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:05.540]
Why not?

[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:07.320]
Well, we'll send you a prize in the mail, okay?

[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.940]
Don't hold your breath. Have a great day.

[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:09.420]
Thank you, Mark.

[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:09.880]
Thanks a lot.

[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:10.880]
What a nice guy.

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.400]
In Palm Beach, no less.

[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:12.840]
Wow.

[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.280]
Shocking, and he sounded like he was under 100.

[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.580]
Let's send him over to Alice Boy.

[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:17.400]
He needs they are.

[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.100]
They are like, yeah.

[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.680]
Oh, my God.

[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.620]
In fact, I wonder if we got something in here

[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.540]
that would kind of be fitting for them today, you know?

[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.260]
In the rack, we've only got, like,

[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.940]
listen to that hollow sound there.

[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:30.560]
What is that?

[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:31.960]
Is Rick Sqar in the book?

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.040]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:34.880]
Is Don on the phone?

[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.000]
Or is Rick Sqar in the building?

[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.320]
Boy, I have never heard that.

[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.360]
A hollow kind of sound.

[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:40.960]
Oh.

[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.000]
Okay, now this really frosted my ass.

[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.460]
Okay, look at this question on the screen.

[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.560]
What is Steve's rating?

[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.180]
He's interested.

[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.640]
Didn't you hear how we just went nuts?

[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:54.820]
Is he on the phone?

[01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:56.940]
Steve, we gave him out.

[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.580]
You did great.

[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:59.080]
We were like tinkling all over you.

[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.320]
And I was rushing through these to get to your numbers

[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.080]
and compare to Alice who you just buried.

[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.800]
All right, we shouldn't say that after that last thing there.

[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:11.420]
Steve had a 4-7 in 12 plus and a 5-5 in 25 to 54.

[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.620]
I think those are as highest numbers ever in this market.

[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.300]
I could be wrong.

[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.680]
But I don't think so.

[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.160]
I think those are huge numbers.

[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.860]
Way up, 39 to a 4-7 in 12 plus and a 5-5 in 25 to 54.

[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:26.140]
Alice had a 3 in 12 plus just hovering going into the twos,

[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.180]
diving into the bowl with the tidy bowl man.

[01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.220]
And what was it in 25 to 54?

[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:32.880]
A 1-6 to Steve's 5-5.

[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.160]
So I guess we won't be getting any happy Purim cards

[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.680]
from Dennis Collins next year, huh?

[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:39.800]
Thanks for the experience.

[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.680]
We're supposed to be going to Oklahoma City.

[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:42.940]
Oh, is that where we're going now?

[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.280]
Yeah, Oklahoma City.

[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.360]
We'll be big over there, right?

[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.360]
I have to pass this along to you.

[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.920]
This was a little bit of a mail.

[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:50.680]
Let's hear about that.

[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.060]
Wait a minute.

[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:52.320]
Oh, the headline.

[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.220]
I have to get up now.

[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.240]
I'm getting too old for this.

[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.080]
Headline says Radio Host hits listener at festival.

[01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.800]
This is from the St.P. Times.

[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.020]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.700]
Date line Largo.

[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.320]
Largo.

[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.280]
Contaversial Radio Torture Host.

[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:10.720]
Bob Lasseter.

[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:15.740]
Hit a 19-year-old listener with the back of his hand

[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.600]
after the man screamed close to the microphone

[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:22.240]
during a live broadcast at the Largo Renaissance Festival

[01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:24.490]
on Saturday, police say.

[01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:25.150]
On Saturday?

[01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:28.510]
The man told police that he received free tickets

[01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:31.410]
to the festival from the Lasseter Show on WFLA

[01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:34.710]
and that he screamed because I've been a regular caller

[01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:36.190]
on the show for the last two years.

[01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:38.650]
I've been asked by the producers to scream.

[01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:42.130]
He told police that Lasseter seemed to recognize the scream

[01:22:42.130 --> 01:22:45.310]
and that after the scream Lasseter turned to his side

[01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:47.730]
and punched the man in the mouth.

[01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:50.370]
Wow.

[01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:57.470]
Ah, you got it.

[01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:00.070]
You got it.

[01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:00.810]
Wow.

[01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.690]
This is it.

[01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:02.110]
This is it.

[01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.230]
This is it.

[01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:03.210]
Well, there goes on.

[01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:05.150]
It goes on and on and on and on.

[01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:07.230]
But that's the crux of it.

[01:23:08.010 --> 01:23:12.010]
He says, Lasseter says, this is a quote I was closing my radio show

[01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:14.350]
when I heard a loud scream that appeared to be coming

[01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:15.370]
from my left rear.

[01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.110]
His left rear.

[01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:18.930]
Directly in my ear.

[01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:19.430]
Montana.

[01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:23.810]
As I am the frequent target of threats of physical violence

[01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:26.710]
I react first, ask questions later.

[01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.410]
Oh, yeah.

[01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:30.470]
I swung with my left arm back handing a young man

[01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:31.990]
before I ever made eye contact.

[01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:34.610]
He was stunned and left the area.

[01:23:35.150 --> 01:23:36.230]
This is a Lasseter quote.

[01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:38.570]
I followed a approach that I failed to find it funny,

[01:23:38.770 --> 01:23:42.950]
advised him what he did was actually in violation of federal law

[01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:48.070]
and told him that I never wanted to see him again.

[01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.910]
Yeah.

[01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:53.710]
Now, the man gave kind of a different story.

[01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:55.110]
This is the man's story.

[01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:56.370]
Yeah, let's hear the other stories.

[01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:57.450]
Yeah, this is the rest of the story.

[01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:59.430]
The rest of his story.

[01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.550]

[01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:01.030]
He was still on stiffing this station.

[01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:03.550]
Now, the guy told police somewhat different version.

[01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:06.090]
I don't know if the guy from ABC didn't call in to congratulate us,

[01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:06.490]
by the way.

[01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:07.230]
What a douchebag.

[01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:11.750]
He put down his microphone and ran ahead of where I was walking.

[01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:14.870]
He began poking his index finger in my chest saying,

[01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:16.630]
don't ever let me see you again.

[01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:19.350]
If I ever see you under any different circumstances,

[01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:21.010]
I will beat the hell out of you.

[01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:25.330]
I happened to be in my car at the time

[01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:27.150]
Lasseter was ending his live broadcast,

[01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:29.290]
said the festival manager heard a loud scream.

[01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:31.310]
So all I could say is I heard the loud screen

[01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:36.970]
over the air police are still investigating this incredible shocking.

[01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:38.330]
Well, there's nothing to do with it.

[01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:39.650]
You know the real reason he hit him?

[01:24:39.710 --> 01:24:40.850]
He's an all-john provocateur.

[01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:42.510]
That's the real story.

[01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:43.490]
Okay.

[01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:44.590]
20 minutes passed.

[01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:46.090]
No, the W.O.D. is the stuff.

[01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:48.530]
Now don't throw that thing out there with that picture.

[01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:51.210]
That guy wants to be your sidekick when I go on vacation.

[01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:52.510]
Let me read his letter.

[01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:53.650]
He's got a long letter.

[01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:55.510]
Of course the only problem is he doesn't sign it.

[01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:56.210]
I don't think so.

[01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:56.610]
Yes he does.

[01:24:56.690 --> 01:24:58.590]
Oh, here is name in all his vitality.

[01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:59.170]
Would be celebrity.

[01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.890]
It's signed.

[01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.790]
Would be celebrity.

[01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:02.910]
Now is there nothing in there with a name?

[01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.550]
So how do we ever get in touch with him?

[01:25:05.690 --> 01:25:06.870]
I don't think it's all I have.

[01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:08.310]
You have his thing?

[01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:09.230]
I have his thing.

[01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:10.690]
I want you to resume.

[01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:12.310]
I want you to relinquish his thing.

[01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:13.490]
I have his resume.

[01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:15.530]
Now that's shocking.

[01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:15.950]
Okay.

[01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:17.010]
Shocking.

[01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:19.050]
What is this guy's name?

[01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:23.050]
He looks a little bit on the Latin side of me.

[01:25:23.150 --> 01:25:23.830]
I don't know who this is.

[01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:25.770]
But he wants you to like to come in while I'm on vacation.

[01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:29.110]
Or better yet so it's not to pose any threat to the bird.

[01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:33.690]
And since he's already gainfully employed, you might consider me to keep you company

[01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:35.970]
if that Saturday gig comes through.

[01:25:36.410 --> 01:25:37.690]
You got it baby.

[01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:39.070]
You got it.

[01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:42.590]
Wait a minute.

[01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:44.550]
Here's a motivation radio listener.

[01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:46.150]
Can we get the bulletin-southered instrument?

[01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:46.550]
Hello.

[01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.590]
Hello Neil.

[01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:48.270]
How are you doing?

[01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.730]
Okay.

[01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.910]
Hey bird, how are you?

[01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:50.950]
You're the one.

[01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:53.190]
I actually do listen to it.

[01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.530]
I actually do listen to it.

[01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:56.850]
Maybe your sales staff could also listen to it.

[01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:58.890]
It might help them be a little bit better in terms of a sales staff.

[01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:00.150]
Hey listen, it couldn't hurt.

[01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:00.830]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:26:01.130 --> 01:26:01.550]
Couldn't hurt.

[01:26:01.710 --> 01:26:02.550]
Well I'm a salesman.

[01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:03.430]
I'm on the road a lot.

[01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:04.670]
Actually I'm in chemical sales.

[01:26:04.770 --> 01:26:06.670]
And if I listen to it sometimes it helps.

[01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:07.810]
I have a lot of garbage photos.

[01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:08.710]
Other stations.

[01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:11.130]
But they can't hear me going every now and then.

[01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.610]
Yeah.

[01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:13.930]
It works for me like a charm boy.

[01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:18.570]
Well I'm the only listener so another good thing about it is that you don't have a whole lot of commercials.

[01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:19.070]
Yeah.

[01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:20.250]
I like that too.

[01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:23.050]
In fact Zeta was right on the break of the commercial free radio.

[01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:27.370]
Now after seeing his book I think there are going to be several stations who are going to be delving into that.

[01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:29.390]
You know, dabbling with commercial free pretty soon.

[01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:30.310]
I can understand.

[01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.070]
I can relate to it.

[01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:35.370]
Try to get your sales force to listen to it over there and maybe they might help you guys out.

[01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:37.290]
Okay or maybe they might even get hired over there.

[01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:39.110]
I think they'd fit right in if they got no spots.

[01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:43.410]
Actually I'd like to get the job over at she with the big signal over there.

[01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:44.370]
We get some good people.

[01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.890]
You know.

[01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:46.110]
Yeah.

[01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:47.390]
And they might help them out some.

[01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:49.810]
Okay just take a lot of defensive equipment over there.

[01:26:49.890 --> 01:26:50.750]
It's an ugly likes to chase.

[01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.210]
Haha.

[01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:54.070]
Occasionally like with a ball peen hammer.

[01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:55.050]
You know that kind of stuff.

[01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:56.350]
Alright Neil.

[01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:57.690]
Okay good luck to found you.

[01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:58.330]
Thank you.

[01:26:58.370 --> 01:26:58.610]
Bye bye.

[01:26:58.730 --> 01:26:59.730]
Okay what a call.

[01:26:59.930 --> 01:27:01.570]
22 past noon at WIOD.

[01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:02.710]
An open line is in Palm Beach.

[01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:06.070]
Hey we've actually had a few living and breathing people in Palm Beach.

[01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:08.050]
And where the hell is that food by the way?

[01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:08.610]
Uh oh.

[01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:10.670]
We are getting pretty thoroughly about this.

[01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:14.250]
Our line up with a 7-3 with an 8-6 and 25-54.

[01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:17.550]
And we're all these people that love us and tinkle all over us.

[01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:18.610]
And I'm not joking today.

[01:27:18.690 --> 01:27:21.330]
We got a celebrity here who's starving that has eaten in two weeks.

[01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:24.590]
And we can't even drum up a couple of burgers or something.

[01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.910]
Wow.

[01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.650]
A little pizza?

[01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:26.330]
Nothing.

[01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:26.710]
Nothing?

[01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:28.310]
Come on now.

[01:27:28.450 --> 01:27:29.050]
Don't let us down.

[01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:31.190]
It's going to be humiliating, degrading and embarrassing.

[01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:33.150]
Doesn't look good.

[01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:34.210]
Wow.

[01:27:34.890 --> 01:27:35.490]
Sorry John.

[01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:36.590]
They just don't care.

[01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:37.750]
Like I said, they don't give it in.

[01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:41.030]
23 afternoons at WIOD.

[01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:42.950]
And speaking of that, let's tell you about Nutri-System.

[01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:45.250]
Well, this could be a blessing in disguise for Johnny Dark.

[01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:48.450]
This could be kind of unwittingly the beginning of his Nutri-System career.

[01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:50.210]
And...

[01:27:50.710 --> 01:27:51.810]
Oh, is that what he's doing tomorrow?

[01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:52.610]
He's looking for a job.

[01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:55.150]
27 past noon at WIOD.

[01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:58.450]
And we got a couple of, we got three lines open up again.

[01:27:58.530 --> 01:27:59.710]
They're just not really into it today.

[01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:02.890]
And on I admitted the beginning, I told them all to get lost and they did.

[01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:05.430]
One thing about this audience, man, they're obedient.

[01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:12.530]
But life goes on, we just keep going along with the build up to the Steve Cain Show today.

[01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:17.230]
Marilyn Volker, River, Rick Patterson, the topic will be sex surrogates, therapist or prostitutes.

[01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:19.930]
And then Amar is going to be doing professional guests.

[01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.890]
Are they prostitutes?

[01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:24.950]
I love those professional guests.

[01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:27.770]
I still can't get over those two guest lists that we need more.

[01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:28.810]
Boy, those were the days.

[01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:31.070]
You want your child to become a super kid.

[01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:34.190]
Listen to this afternoon to the Steve Cain Show's parenting expert, Michael Desisto.

[01:28:34.670 --> 01:28:37.690]
We haven't met him as long as we've been here.

[01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:38.870]
That's a nice guy.

[01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:41.750]
I'm sure he's a good guy, but enough is enough.

[01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:46.110]
And then Sharon gave me this thing, a brave new world of love potions.

[01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:52.030]
It says daily use for two weeks brings firmer, longer lasting erections,

[01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:54.070]
and an increased ability to achieve orgasm.

[01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:55.090]
Really?

[01:28:55.090 --> 01:28:58.990]
Bollimics will be more not to use the drug because of dangerous side effects.

[01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:08.650]
Green oats, nettle extract and vitamin C are the ingredients of X-stavia, a non-prescription drug, from Switzerland.

[01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:14.210]
X-men taking a powder in juicer water in a study reported a significantly higher increase in sexual desire,

[01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:17.650]
as well as firmer and longer lasting erections.

[01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:21.370]
Women reported no benefits, although Bill, what was his name?

[01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.770]
Bill.

[01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:24.310]
The guy who was a girl.

[01:29:24.610 --> 01:29:26.070]
Oh, get tipped in.

[01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:27.830]
Said that it was okay by him.

[01:29:28.690 --> 01:29:28.890]
Her.

[01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:31.610]
129, a WI-V.

[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.830]
Here's a call from Atlanta. Hello.

[01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:34.950]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:29:35.190 --> 01:29:35.530]
Okay.

[01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:39.770]
I tried calling the brown line. I held off for 20 minutes. Nobody answered the phone.

[01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.890]
What are you doing up there?

[01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.650]
Roofing.

[01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:43.290]
I called you last week.

[01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:45.130]
Oh, yeah, this is Roofing's up in Atlanta.

[01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:46.150]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:46.810]
Roofing.

[01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:49.670]
He must be related to Muffin up there in Palm Beach.

[01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.310]
Well, I'm dead.

[01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:52.070]
Middle Muffin.

[01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:54.850]
When all you got up here is Lead Low Ports to listen to.

[01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:55.990]
Is he still on the air?

[01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.590]
Huh?

[01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:57.510]
He's still on the air.

[01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:59.690]
He used to be on the old WRNG up there in Atlanta.

[01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:01.830]
He's on WSB now.

[01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.190]
Yeah.

[01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:03.310]
He's on WSB?

[01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.590]
Yeah.

[01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:05.490]
That's our station.

[01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.830]

[01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.870]
Yeah.

[01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:06.050]
Yeah.

[01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:06.150]

[01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:06.170]
Yeah.

[01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:06.190]
Yeah.

[01:30:06.190 --> 01:30:06.290]
Yeah.

[01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.590]

[01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.590]

[01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.890]
Yeah.

[01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.890]

[01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.950]
Yeah.

[01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.950]

[01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.950]

[01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:08.210]
Yeah.

[01:30:08.210 --> 01:30:08.230]
But must already argue with Colborn,

[01:30:08.230 --> 01:30:10.190]
oh, I mean put your eye to sleep.

[01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:10.450]

[01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:11.750]
Aah, oh!

[01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:12.290]
Come on up.

[01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.670]
Be nice.

[01:30:13.290 --> 01:30:13.970]
Be nice.

[01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:16.410]
Or, Nick Trigoni will come over there and head with a

[01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.590]
Kalbasa, be nice.

[01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:19.070]
Why is the exact opposite of you?

[01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:19.630]
I know.

[01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.570]
And yes.

[01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:22.490]
It's eggs in progress.

[01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.930]
Yes.

[01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:24.990]
Well, I'll tell a corporate people you said so.

[01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.850]
Oh please.

[01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:28.550]
Just, ah, when you're going to get on that fanright, Neil?

[01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:31.510]
Yeah.

[01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:32.030]
What?

[01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:33.730]
I think we have a bad connection.

[01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:35.770]
I don't know if you're going to get on the fanright.

[01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:36.970]
You know what I think you are sir?

[01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:38.790]
He's an Ojoan provocateur.

[01:30:39.010 --> 01:30:42.610]
Now we have enough trouble just to keep him under arrest on here.

[01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:44.170]
We have enough problems here.

[01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:47.150]
So I guess you didn't hear about those great ratings that just came out.

[01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:48.090]
That's my cop story, yeah.

[01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:50.710]
Well I might just go down the whole list of that for it.

[01:30:50.770 --> 01:30:52.490]
Please do, probably I eat from last night.

[01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:53.330]
No, no, no.

[01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:55.190]
We've already done this to the point of nausea.

[01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:56.510]
We had a 7-3 sir.

[01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:59.750]
We were just a kick-dass and in 25 to 54s we had an 8-6.

[01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:01.370]
We were number one and the food just came in.

[01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.910]
I do you like that?

[01:31:02.370 --> 01:31:03.710]
Where are you getting from today?

[01:31:03.710 --> 01:31:05.630]
We got a little pizza here from Flores.

[01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:06.530]
Thank you Carmine.

[01:31:06.650 --> 01:31:07.850]
You're a wonderful human being.

[01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:10.370]
And here's a little note from Lynn.

[01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:11.310]
Isn't that great?

[01:31:11.490 --> 01:31:13.610]
Boy I'll tell you everything's just falling into place today.

[01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:14.430]
Sir, it's terrific.

[01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:15.710]
It's almost worth being alive.

[01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:17.370]
We did do something right up here.

[01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:19.390]
Okay, well listen, say hi to all our, uh,

[01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:21.690]
Yoko friends up there at WSB, okay?

[01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:22.970]
Just put me on hold for a few seconds.

[01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:24.010]
Okay, no problem.

[01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:24.630]
Thank you.

[01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:25.250]
Don't go away now.

[01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:26.610]
Oh, look at this, Andy.

[01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:29.310]
Poster was just, now don't put the Andy Poster on our,

[01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:31.390]
oh my god, on our friend here.

[01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:32.930]
Now look at what you did.

[01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:35.810]
Look where he's got like, um, no, that's disgusting.

[01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:37.790]
Sharon is really just going nuts.

[01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:39.490]
Mm-hmm.

[01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:41.490]
Look how he had a little accident there, don't I?

[01:31:44.730 --> 01:31:45.830]
1231, what is that?

[01:31:46.710 --> 01:31:50.130]
Oh, it's one of those ass hole certificates is in it.

[01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:51.270]
Thanks a lot, Joe.

[01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:54.550]
We just want to know that, uh, oh, I see it's just like a blank.

[01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:55.550]
He didn't even write our name in.

[01:31:56.710 --> 01:31:57.390]
Thanks a lot, Joe.

[01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:58.530]
Thanks for the food, Flores.

[01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:00.170]
This is, look at that pizza.

[01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:01.950]
Boy, that's just with the plain cheese.

[01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:02.770]
So we have none there.

[01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:04.730]
Well, we'll get some napkins.

[01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:06.550]
Don't start hyperventilating, okay?

[01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:07.530]
Don't go nuts.

[01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:09.950]
Is this guy still here by the way?

[01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:11.510]
I'm dying over here.

[01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:12.070]
Okay.

[01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:14.750]
We left him out, hold so long, I can't say that I blame him.

[01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.310]
It's 1231 at WIOD.

[01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:18.610]
I was at line six working again.

[01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:20.590]
I think I saw it, um, do a little, no.

[01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:24.130]
Well, I get nervous, you know, when we have lines at our blank.

[01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:25.470]
Let's take a call.

[01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:26.650]
Oh, here's Leroy and Miami.

[01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:27.430]
How you doing, Leroy?

[01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:28.270]
Hello, Neil.

[01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.930]
Yes, sir.

[01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.450]
Hello, baby.

[01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:30.470]
Okay, Poster, Leroy.

[01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:32.390]
You may not remember, Leroy B.

[01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:33.530]
You may not remember me.

[01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:35.050]
Leroy B, are you related, will you be?

[01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:36.430]
I'm one of the B brothers.

[01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:39.130]
Yeah, will the B both go B and B, Roy B?

[01:32:39.630 --> 01:32:41.790]
I used to do the bad lawn over there, Carol.

[01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:43.410]
I used to know you're cousin Bumble.

[01:32:43.890 --> 01:32:44.190]
Is anyone?

[01:32:44.770 --> 01:32:46.450]
I say, I hope you're having a good day out there.

[01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:47.870]
I'm having a very good day.

[01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.750]
Thank you very much.

[01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:49.130]
Great.

[01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.910]
Oh, you and tell you on techno, Tim.

[01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:52.550]
You're just just going already.

[01:32:52.670 --> 01:32:54.010]
I haven't even made a move for it yet.

[01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:55.350]
That's right.

[01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:57.830]
Wow, what a bunch of maniacs in here.

[01:32:57.930 --> 01:32:58.490]
It's great.

[01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:59.710]
Well, give me just one piece.

[01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:00.610]
I know it's great.

[01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:04.390]
It's that plain cheese from the Flores's orgasmic over.

[01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:05.490]
Look at the size of those pieces.

[01:33:05.650 --> 01:33:05.930]
Can I see?

[01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:06.990]
We didn't let you down, John.

[01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:08.870]
John was getting really distraught and upset.

[01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:11.590]
And a little apoplectic, too, I might add.

[01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:13.030]
Oh, that's great.

[01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:14.850]
Oh, I'm almost lost.

[01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:15.350]
I'm sorry.

[01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:16.970]
You can't be here to share it with us, pal.

[01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:19.090]
Oh, but they got shells up here now.

[01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.810]
Well, that's great.

[01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:21.050]
Go up there and just pick out.

[01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.390]
Okay.

[01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:22.730]
Hold on now.

[01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:25.250]
I know what he's really thinking up there.

[01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:26.930]
I'm dying over here.

[01:33:27.190 --> 01:33:27.510]
Okay.

[01:33:27.630 --> 01:33:28.410]
Yeah, 12.

[01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:32.330]
12.33 at WID.

[01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:33.270]
That's what there's all singing.

[01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:36.130]
They've got a little chorusing in over WOLD.

[01:33:36.330 --> 01:33:37.690]
They're all singing at some point.

[01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:40.350]
And it's there.

[01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:41.810]
Well, data is already passed.

[01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:44.030]
I'm 95.

[01:33:44.190 --> 01:33:44.870]
I'm 95.

[01:33:45.230 --> 01:33:45.810]
I can hear it now.

[01:33:46.230 --> 01:33:47.170]
I can already hear it.

[01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:47.350]
Okay.

[01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:49.490]
In case you missed the stories and if you tune in late,

[01:33:49.670 --> 01:33:51.930]
the big radio news that everybody's buzzing about.

[01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:56.190]
I said buzzing about is Steve.

[01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.830]
What was his name?

[01:33:57.970 --> 01:33:58.370]
Piccoloni.

[01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:59.190]
Poram.

[01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.830]
Poram.

[01:33:59.950 --> 01:34:00.450]
Steve Poram.

[01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:02.670]
The four-year-old program director,

[01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:03.310]
while 100 is,

[01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:04.990]
can he's out, he's audio-seeing.

[01:34:05.130 --> 01:34:06.910]
It took them to depths that are just frightening.

[01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:10.510]
And I'm sure Sonny Fox is really upset about that.

[01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:13.130]
How come Sonny hadn't called us on the air today?

[01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:14.190]
I mean, I don't want to beg,

[01:34:14.410 --> 01:34:15.870]
but I would think he'd probably be cloting.

[01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:17.530]
We'll use all the numbers he wanted.

[01:34:17.670 --> 01:34:18.230]
I want to trick a little while.

[01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:21.030]
Clem wants to speak.

[01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:22.470]
Oh, you want to speak to your buddy again?

[01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:22.950]
Yeah.

[01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:25.990]
Are you there, Rufus?

[01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:26.590]
I'm here.

[01:34:27.150 --> 01:34:27.590]
Hey, he.

[01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:29.190]
Are you doing, Clem?

[01:34:29.370 --> 01:34:31.110]
All right, man, hey, Granny Dice.

[01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:32.790]
Hey, Granny Dice.

[01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:33.730]
Oh, no.

[01:34:34.130 --> 01:34:35.510]
Yeah, I found Gordy.

[01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:37.330]
Another blue hair bright to good.

[01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:38.070]
That's right.

[01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:41.930]
If he was 95 or the half,

[01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:42.830]
he needs it to die.

[01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:43.350]
Really?

[01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:45.510]
Have a life time script for him.

[01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:47.930]
Hey, man, why don't you call me Corvette, man?

[01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:50.070]
All right, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

[01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:51.830]
All right, listen, I found Gordy.

[01:34:52.810 --> 01:34:54.050]
All right, I'll call you Corvette.

[01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:55.730]
All right, I'll do it, all right?

[01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:57.470]
Get off me, old fellow.

[01:34:57.690 --> 01:34:59.330]
I'm sorry, Nia, I have a booklet.

[01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:00.070]
What can I say?

[01:35:00.190 --> 01:35:01.530]
I know you have one, one, two.

[01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.710]
Wow.

[01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:06.870]
They're good together, aren't they?

[01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:07.210]
All right, thanks.

[01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:09.810]
In fact, pretty soon, they have that show on the weekend at WOLV.

[01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:12.230]
They can have a show on the weekend here.

[01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:12.770]
I don't know when I'm...

[01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:15.230]
Anybody could have a show on the weekend here.

[01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:17.030]
We don't want to get into that, do we?

[01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:19.070]
Because things are just too positive.

[01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:21.090]
You know, we don't want to throw any monkey wrenches into the works.

[01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:23.750]
But I'm personally kind of upset about Gary Noe.

[01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:24.450]
And don't forget,

[01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:28.290]
you know, their roomers were before the big draft show Sunday.

[01:35:28.450 --> 01:35:30.790]
So by now, we can be doing like a funny cheer now.

[01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:32.590]
Oh, I didn't think about that.

[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:33.010]
Oh, yeah.

[01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:35.330]
To me, that kind of like, put us over the top.

[01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:38.190]
We're apologizing for eating on the air here,

[01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:39.270]
because we know it's bad radio,

[01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:41.450]
but we don't give a good flying up about it.

[01:35:42.930 --> 01:35:45.730]
Because I told Boy Gary yesterday, you know, the bus to Louisville

[01:35:45.730 --> 01:35:47.130]
leaves in about a half an hour.

[01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:49.110]
And he knows it, too.

[01:35:49.150 --> 01:35:50.430]
He got the schedule on his head.

[01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:54.370]
All right, listen, this Saturday, we're going to be doing something

[01:35:54.370 --> 01:35:56.670]
really speaking of that thing, you old D, you know what I mean?

[01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:59.950]
Okay, 1239 at WID, aren't you going to take this pizza?

[01:36:00.090 --> 01:36:01.670]
We desperately want you to have it.

[01:36:02.010 --> 01:36:03.170]
Oh, Nick's going to get it for you.

[01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.710]
Boy.

[01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:04.510]
Wow.

[01:36:04.690 --> 01:36:05.130]
He's shy.

[01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:06.210]
I don't understand it.

[01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:07.230]
What, what did we do?

[01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.950]
I don't know.

[01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:10.730]
Okay, so Johnny's going out to give me a diet soda and run his way out.

[01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:11.510]
Are you really?

[01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:14.510]
That would be great, because my diet Pepsi here is just about out.

[01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:17.950]
Okay, 21 to 1 at WID, we're having our little ratings party.

[01:36:18.170 --> 01:36:19.930]
Anytime, and we've got two mouse to feed there,

[01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:20.990]
so we got to take care of him.

[01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:23.930]
And we just, everybody in the station did great.

[01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:26.190]
Well, we're nearly did great.

[01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.610]
Mm-hmm.

[01:36:26.690 --> 01:36:31.190]
We did incredible Steve Grimmongus sensational.

[01:36:33.730 --> 01:36:36.110]
Now, well, now, you know, and we're almost in building a day,

[01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:37.870]
isn't that what Boy Gary said?

[01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:39.790]
He's going to give us 20 or 30 years.

[01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:42.190]
You know what else Boy Gary said.

[01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:49.710]
Okay, let's take a call from Hollywood.

[01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:50.170]
Hello.

[01:36:50.710 --> 01:36:51.250]
Hey, Neil.

[01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.650]
Yeah.

[01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:52.250]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:36:52.370 --> 01:36:53.490]
I got a pick report for you.

[01:36:53.490 --> 01:36:53.970]
Okay.

[01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:55.730]
It's a four-letter up, please, in the morning.

[01:36:55.930 --> 01:36:58.690]
The speed trip set up from now, probably for the next couple of days.

[01:36:59.190 --> 01:37:00.730]
I got caught at the first one.

[01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.830]
And as I got out, there were two others on my way to work.

[01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:06.470]
I'd like to call the city of four-letter up, please,

[01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:09.270]
Department of Bunch and Subhuman, Moronic, Douchebag, Asshole.

[01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:10.090]
Where was this?

[01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:12.870]
This was on Broward, and they had one on Sixth Street.

[01:37:13.290 --> 01:37:15.990]
And I also heard of somebody told me there was one on 19th Street.

[01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.790]
Isn't that great?

[01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:18.350]
Well, it probably is toward the end of the month.

[01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:19.570]
They're down under quota, yeah.

[01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.790]
Exactly.

[01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:22.930]
The second one was already printed out with the judges.

[01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:25.910]
And the troopers name and his badge, right?

[01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:26.730]
And the speed, yeah.

[01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:27.110]
Yeah.

[01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:28.890]
Well, they must have been...

[01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:29.230]
They must have passed it on.

[01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:30.490]
People be careful coming into work.

[01:37:30.610 --> 01:37:31.530]
It must have been your lucky day.

[01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:32.470]
Okay, thanks a lot, pal.

[01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.830]
No problem.

[01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:33.150]
Bye.

[01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:36.430]
Okay, I don't know what just happened, but look at that.

[01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:38.250]
Every line was lit, and we took that one column,

[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:39.670]
three people dropped off immediately.

[01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.470]
Well, it's...

[01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.870]
We don't care.

[01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:41.230]
We're eating.

[01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:42.170]
We're not having a good time.

[01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:44.890]
We're basking in a glory of those numbers,

[01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:46.970]
which by tomorrow will be ancient history.

[01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:52.270]
Now, do we have, like, a little note or a memo that said the incredible job?

[01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:55.790]
You mean, like, they got after the draft show, something like that?

[01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:55.970]
Yeah.

[01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.950]
That said, this was a radio at its finest,

[01:37:58.130 --> 01:37:59.230]
its shining hour, et cetera.

[01:37:59.510 --> 01:38:00.270]
I haven't seen it yet.

[01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:04.930]
What an incredible humongous, phenomenal, unbelievable, et cetera.

[01:38:05.210 --> 01:38:05.690]
I don't think so.

[01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:06.970]
I mean, we might still.

[01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:08.110]
I doubt it.

[01:38:10.570 --> 01:38:10.930]
Wow.

[01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:12.370]
Well, that was really great.

[01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:13.470]
See, we didn't let you down, Johnny.

[01:38:14.530 --> 01:38:15.670]
We came through for you.

[01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:19.810]
So, the news is, Johnny, is alive and safe for at least one more day.

[01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:20.170]
Right?

[01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:21.490]
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach.

[01:38:21.490 --> 01:38:21.870]
Hello.

[01:38:22.290 --> 01:38:22.990]
Neil Bird.

[01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:23.730]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:25.590]
Let us a fight to say, Tinkled Tinkled.

[01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:26.250]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:27.070]
Great ratings.

[01:38:27.190 --> 01:38:28.470]
Unless I got one thing to ask you,

[01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:30.750]
is an O'shong from Bucket Torders like,

[01:38:30.930 --> 01:38:31.830]
Sipto's Jure or something?

[01:38:32.170 --> 01:38:33.970]
He's an O'shong from Bucket Tordes.

[01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.210]
Yeah.

[01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:35.690]
You don't have to ask old,

[01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:37.230]
Cunfian Western Dick fatherly.

[01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:38.310]
Well, let's talk.

[01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:40.530]
In between those Willie Nelson records on QAM.

[01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:42.370]
One more thing.

[01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:44.650]
I'm only concerned about one thing for you and birds.

[01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:45.210]
What is that?

[01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:46.650]
The higher your ratings get,

[01:38:47.050 --> 01:38:48.670]
and I'll tell you, get much higher.

[01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:49.830]
You've got to be 30 or 40.

[01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:51.590]
The closer you guys get to the door,

[01:38:51.670 --> 01:38:52.790]
you've got to be okay this time, right?

[01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:54.750]
I mean, the closer we get to the door,

[01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:56.370]
yeah, the no brain management

[01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:58.490]
usually gets nervous when you're reading too high.

[01:38:58.570 --> 01:38:59.910]
Now, one good thing about here,

[01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.710]
they're always nervous.

[01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:01.930]
They don't make any difference with the others.

[01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:02.650]
Good.

[01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.170]
Then you're safe and sound for a while.

[01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:04.510]
Wow, yeah.

[01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:05.290]
We're not going anywhere.

[01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:05.770]
Please don't let them.

[01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:07.050]
You can fight on what Dennis Collins says.

[01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:07.830]
What does he know?

[01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.850]
Not much.

[01:39:08.890 --> 01:39:09.930]
That's obvious by the numbers.

[01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:11.630]
You guys have a great day.

[01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:12.450]
And best of luck to you.

[01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:13.150]
All you don't need it.

[01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.810]
Thanks a lot.

[01:39:14.150 --> 01:39:14.430]
No, all.

[01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:16.070]
1242 at WIOD.

[01:39:16.090 --> 01:39:17.430]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:21.610]
At 655 WIOD and one in Broward now, 524 WIOD.

[01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:25.770]
524 9463 on a mindless,

[01:39:25.890 --> 01:39:27.970]
moronic idiotic douchebag show.

[01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:29.470]
So this is why we're at the top.

[01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:31.010]
That's right, but just the way we like it.

[01:39:31.130 --> 01:39:33.030]
What a perfect reflection of America, okay?

[01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:35.410]
By the way, now I'm still planning out my vacation.

[01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:36.250]
It's still in limbo.

[01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:37.910]
I got like three or four different,

[01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:40.030]
I mean, I got a basic tentative thing set up.

[01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:41.970]
But I was looking through some of these book now.

[01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:44.170]
Amsterdam, everybody tells me how great it is.

[01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:44.970]
You know, it had wonderful time.

[01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.410]

[01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:47.350]
But I was looking through this one burlitz book.

[01:39:47.490 --> 01:39:49.730]
And it looked like all the people like the 60s all over again.

[01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:51.530]
It looked like all these burnout washed out,

[01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:55.190]
hippie-ish grotesque, mung, non-bathing.

[01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:55.950]
Is that what it is?

[01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:56.850]
Where have you been there?

[01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.170]
Yeah.

[01:39:57.490 --> 01:39:58.850]
No, nobody hears me.

[01:39:58.930 --> 01:39:59.410]
Get on TV.

[01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:01.390]
Well, I don't care.

[01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.910]
You're seeing it.

[01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:03.450]
I've seen a lot on TV too,

[01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:05.810]
but actually being there and getting the feel of it

[01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:06.850]
is another stirring.

[01:40:07.170 --> 01:40:07.530]
You know what I mean?

[01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:10.310]
That's what Phoebe Kate said.

[01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:11.850]
Yeah, see, I've seen Phoebe on TV.

[01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:13.850]
Well, wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen,

[01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:16.890]
we have another Ojampra Vaca tour online for...

[01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:19.590]
Well, what can I tell you?

[01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:21.610]
Another radio troublemaker,

[01:40:21.710 --> 01:40:22.550]
another unemployed radio.

[01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:23.510]
Too bad you weren't here today.

[01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:24.370]
You would have loved the pizza.

[01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:27.370]
Well, the ratings are just phenomenal.

[01:40:27.650 --> 01:40:27.970]
How's that?

[01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:29.010]
What can I tell you?

[01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:31.610]
And that in 40 cents will buy us a watery cup of coffee

[01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:33.170]
and look, it's okay on the beach.

[01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:34.510]
Congratulations, bird.

[01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:35.970]
Thank you, Stan.

[01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:37.810]
Congratulations, Uncle Neil.

[01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:40.010]
And it's just...

[01:40:41.050 --> 01:40:41.830]
It's incredible.

[01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:42.510]
I know.

[01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:43.410]
I mean, it's shocking.

[01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:43.990]
Incredible.

[01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:47.470]
Think of what it would be if you got that hot...

[01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:49.850]
You know, got rid of that hot two to three hours.

[01:40:50.290 --> 01:40:51.050]
Now, come on now.

[01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:53.450]
Don't start that.

[01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:54.490]
All I would have a point.

[01:40:55.410 --> 01:40:58.190]
Yeah, it was funny because Steve said yesterday that he's a little...

[01:40:58.190 --> 01:40:58.950]
You know, with the...

[01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:01.310]
Because he has to get in here at the six to seven hours sports stock.

[01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:02.310]
Oh, yeah, right.

[01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:03.250]
And I didn't want to say...

[01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:04.310]
Because Steve, you know, he's doing very well.

[01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:06.230]
I don't want to say, well, we inherit your two to three hours.

[01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:09.010]
Because he would have taken that to wrong way.

[01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:10.190]
You know, Steve is so fragile.

[01:41:10.190 --> 01:41:12.510]
But you can do this exact same thing, Stan.

[01:41:12.930 --> 01:41:15.010]
You have to take that six to seven news out.

[01:41:15.330 --> 01:41:18.230]
And we used to have to inherit your mediocre two to three hours, okay?

[01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:19.410]
So it goes around.

[01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:19.690]
See?

[01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.390]
Comes around.

[01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:22.010]
Congratulations.

[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:23.430]
Thank you, Stan.

[01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:24.950]
It's pretty phenomenal.

[01:41:25.190 --> 01:41:27.430]
What did Wins do in my old time slot?

[01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:28.750]
Oh, do you want?

[01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:30.070]
Wow, we're going to have good questions.

[01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:33.370]
Well, look at that paper with all that pizza on it.

[01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:35.050]
Oh, boy, just a second now.

[01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:38.370]
I think they went way up to a two-one, something like that.

[01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:39.250]
Just a minute now.

[01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:41.030]
Don't start hyperventilating on us.

[01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:41.610]
Three to seven.

[01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:45.470]
While we got 25 to 54, that was your strong use to have like a fours and five.

[01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:46.430]
Fours, you got five.

[01:41:46.730 --> 01:41:47.750]
Well, let's take a look here.

[01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:49.230]
W-I-N-Z, I'm on the second page.

[01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:50.010]
I don't see them.

[01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:53.370]
Here they got a two-one in 25 to 54.

[01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:54.490]
They went up from a one-nine.

[01:41:54.630 --> 01:41:55.670]
So they really turned the corner.

[01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:56.550]
Yeah, right.

[01:41:56.670 --> 01:41:57.730]
And 12 plus...

[01:41:57.730 --> 01:42:00.970]
12 plus in afternoons were used to have like fours and fives.

[01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:03.510]
They did...

[01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:05.430]
on the, not the second page.

[01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:07.930]
On the third page, two-five.

[01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:10.510]
So they've lost half the audience, I would say.

[01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:10.670]
Yep.

[01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:14.850]
Well, they're obviously very happy with what they've got.

[01:42:14.850 --> 01:42:16.410]
Now, did you hear the rumors about Zeta?

[01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:17.910]
Yeah, that's interesting.

[01:42:18.190 --> 01:42:21.590]
I mean, I mean all these i95 pins, I've got around the house here.

[01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:22.630]
It's gonna be worth something.

[01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:23.450]
I think so.

[01:42:23.850 --> 01:42:24.810]
I think so.

[01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:26.490]
Are you practicing Stan?

[01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.870]
I...

[01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:28.550]
The 95.

[01:42:29.050 --> 01:42:31.870]
Yeah, if you work on it, they might get you right in or do all the voices.

[01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:33.610]
But I'm not gonna have any live jocks.

[01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:35.010]
Of course, that's no different from what they got now.

[01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:38.530]
But can I get the crayon franchise for the new PD?

[01:42:38.850 --> 01:42:41.350]
Boy, I'm telling you, this isley is just going nuts, isn't he?

[01:42:41.530 --> 01:42:42.450]
And of course, he's another...

[01:42:42.450 --> 01:42:43.150]
You remember that article?

[01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:44.230]
Who was it? Jika wrote it?

[01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:48.050]
About all the talent that the guy Gannett has let's look at their fingers?

[01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:48.170]

[01:42:48.190 --> 01:42:48.350]
Yeah.

[01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:50.850]
And Keith Isley was a classic example there.

[01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:51.330]
Yep.

[01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:53.530]
Well, along with some of the rest of us.

[01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:54.250]
Yes, right.

[01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.910]
But...

[01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:56.870]
Well, it's great, Neil.

[01:42:57.230 --> 01:42:57.950]
Have a wonderful life.

[01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.530]
Fantastic.

[01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:59.390]
Talk to you later.

[01:42:59.710 --> 01:43:02.850]
Do you have any of the male demographics in your time slot yet?

[01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:04.450]
No.

[01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:05.490]
You don't?

[01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:07.170]
No, but the book will be in a couple of days.

[01:43:07.170 --> 01:43:09.130]
We don't want to shoot the thing all in one day.

[01:43:09.570 --> 01:43:09.910]
I better...

[01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:11.690]
I'm gonna imagine what your room...

[01:43:11.690 --> 01:43:14.270]
Men 25 to 54, we must have like a 15-shere.

[01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:15.190]
That's gotta be a career.

[01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.850]
That's gotta be a career.

[01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:16.530]
How about these women?

[01:43:16.710 --> 01:43:17.690]
How about these women, man?

[01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:19.910]
If we had women, like we got men,

[01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:21.630]
Gannett only knows what kind of number we have.

[01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:23.010]
Well, I have the other showbiz are often.

[01:43:23.150 --> 01:43:24.090]
I get the women for you.

[01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.930]
Like I said.

[01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.610]
See ya.

[01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.790]
Wow.

[01:43:31.170 --> 01:43:31.990]
Boy, what a day.

[01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:35.150]
Well, see, Stan doesn't terrorize the women as much as he used to.

[01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:37.010]
Because now that he's married and he's got his little baby

[01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.790]
and he's more like kind of domestic.

[01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.890]
Much more.

[01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:41.490]
Remember in the beginning of the high-end Zahee?

[01:43:41.670 --> 01:43:43.350]
He's had those women just terrified.

[01:43:43.770 --> 01:43:44.270]
Well, here.

[01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:45.530]
It was wild.

[01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:47.010]
And I guess with good reason.

[01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:49.210]
Okay, it's 1246 at WID.

[01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:50.410]
We have an open line in Palm Beach.

[01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:52.050]
655 WIOD.

[01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:53.570]
6559463.

[01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:57.090]
We're still waiting for our congratulatory call from Majod Picano at WJNO.

[01:43:58.770 --> 01:43:59.890]
We haven't got that yet.

[01:44:00.130 --> 01:44:00.750]
No, not yet.

[01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:03.270]
He's probably had a, you know, we've had a lot of action on headlines.

[01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:04.610]
Probably had trouble getting the hit.

[01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:08.470]
So we'll try to keep that line open for you so that John Picano can get through

[01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:12.350]
from JNO and congratulate us on these astonishingly shocking demographics

[01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:14.190]
and great numbers here at WIOD.

[01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:15.590]
Boca, hello.

[01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:17.090]
John.

[01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.710]
Congratulations.

[01:44:18.190 --> 01:44:18.790]
Thank you, John.

[01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:21.330]
We're expecting you on the Boca line.

[01:44:21.670 --> 01:44:22.150]
Oh, where are you?

[01:44:23.450 --> 01:44:25.130]
Your metamorphans are on the way, Neil.

[01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.930]
Yeah, okay.

[01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:28.550]
Well, that was nice of John to call us.

[01:44:28.590 --> 01:44:28.870]
Mm-hmm.

[01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.690]
That was real nice.

[01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:31.950]
Okay, we're kind of dwindling down on calls here today,

[01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:32.550]
but that's all right.

[01:44:32.690 --> 01:44:35.410]
We understand trying to even things out a little bit.

[01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:37.030]
Boy, this is this salad.

[01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:39.490]
You could eat this for hours, I know.

[01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.490]
And you use to leave it.

[01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:41.890]
But that would be wrong because it's bad radio.

[01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.470]
And I,

[01:44:44.230 --> 01:44:45.210]
I wish we could do it.

[01:44:45.230 --> 01:44:46.290]
I bet you would do a 20-year-old,

[01:44:46.290 --> 01:44:47.630]
we could do quality radio like Sunday.

[01:44:49.930 --> 01:44:50.830]
And it's best.

[01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:52.450]
And it's best.

[01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:55.610]
Two memos that will live in the anals of broadcast history.

[01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:57.210]
They will hang those side-by-side

[01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:59.370]
in the Smithsonian Institute,

[01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:01.190]
the broadcast museum,

[01:45:01.690 --> 01:45:03.550]
along with the program director who wrote them.

[01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:03.810]
Well,

[01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:05.350]
ought to be in an institute right now,

[01:45:05.490 --> 01:45:06.790]
so they're fucking a straight jacket.

[01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.310]
Wow.

[01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:10.930]
You know, see, had those suspenders back on again today,

[01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:12.850]
and he brought in the cigars and the champagne.

[01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:16.190]
Just acted like he knew what planet he was on.

[01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:20.050]
And he's got that little thing he wears on the back of his shirt.

[01:45:20.050 --> 01:45:21.250]
It says, which way to Louisville?

[01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:22.130]
A question mark.

[01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:25.330]
So some of us who are getting about ready to show him

[01:45:25.330 --> 01:45:26.270]
that they're right now, he's a good guy.

[01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:27.710]
He really, look at he got our CD player,

[01:45:28.110 --> 01:45:29.350]
which we ought to start using.

[01:45:29.850 --> 01:45:32.010]
See, I feel guilty because we wasted a lot of time.

[01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.990]
We've screwed around today.

[01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:34.030]
We've been selfish.

[01:45:34.050 --> 01:45:35.090]
We've had the show to ourselves.

[01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:37.430]
We're sensibly because nobody wants to call.

[01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:39.390]
But it's true.

[01:45:40.230 --> 01:45:42.370]
But I think we ought to play a lot more music here, don't you?

[01:45:42.570 --> 01:45:44.090]
Now, have you heard any of the music on the air?

[01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:44.950]
You certainly must have.

[01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.650]
Is it sound okay?

[01:45:45.810 --> 01:45:45.930]
Does?

[01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:48.330]
It's hard to tell in here because that one speaker is,

[01:45:48.370 --> 01:45:49.730]
it's purposely,

[01:45:50.730 --> 01:45:51.970]
bassy so we don't get the high,

[01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.770]
so it doesn't pee back.

[01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:54.290]
You understand that?

[01:45:55.330 --> 01:45:55.790]
There are?

[01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:57.430]
You know, there are a lot of highs in the building.

[01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:58.410]
Most of them in the newsroom went,

[01:46:00.610 --> 01:46:02.510]
let me just see if there's anything in here.

[01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:03.990]
By the way, I want to show you something.

[01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:04.790]
Don't ever get

[01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:06.750]
CD CDs.

[01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:07.850]
This is a set.

[01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:10.110]
These have got all, oh god, I almost,

[01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:11.390]
I want to blow my brain down.

[01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:14.710]
While you hold these collectors out there,

[01:46:14.730 --> 01:46:16.670]
don't go getting carried away and buy a whole bunch

[01:46:16.670 --> 01:46:18.350]
of a new series until you listen to one.

[01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:21.030]
And make sure that it sounds even remotely

[01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:22.350]
like the original ones, okay?

[01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:23.570]
Even just remotely.

[01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:25.830]
Like I'd say, there were, it sounds remotely

[01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:27.230]
like you've heard something like that before,

[01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:28.550]
but you don't know what the name of the song is.

[01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:30.410]
Yeah.

[01:46:30.850 --> 01:46:31.690]
Do you know what that means?

[01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:32.350]
What does that mean?

[01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:34.670]
The acid casualty t-shirts.

[01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:35.430]
What does that mean?

[01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:37.270]
I mean, I know they got one guy in the show

[01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:38.390]
who's an acid casualty.

[01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:41.450]
And he's a good guy.

[01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:42.010]
He's our buddy.

[01:46:42.330 --> 01:46:43.410]
Well, at least till today he was.

[01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:45.590]
And then tomorrow he's doing what?

[01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:46.910]
He's doing a part,

[01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:48.710]
oh yeah, in a video.

[01:46:49.230 --> 01:46:49.710]
Is he really?

[01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:50.970]
That's the rumor.

[01:46:51.110 --> 01:46:52.010]
This is rumor day.

[01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:54.730]
Oh, I think we look lazy as video.

[01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:56.810]
That found 12.

[01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:00.470]
10 minutes till one at WIOD.

[01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:03.510]
Something to read a sign.

[01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.950]
Oh yeah.

[01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:17.630]
Okay, good deal.

[01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:19.670]
What's the date today, 25th?

[01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:22.450]
Yeah.

[01:47:22.450 --> 01:47:22.490]
Yeah.

[01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:25.150]
Great.

[01:47:25.610 --> 01:47:27.150]
No, this makes my day next to the ratings.

[01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:28.790]
This is the best number I've seen all day.

[01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:29.190]
That's great.

[01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.750]
Okay, Sharon.

[01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:31.690]
Thank you so much.

[01:47:31.690 --> 01:47:32.410]
You have a wonderful life.

[01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:34.110]
1257 at WIOD.

[01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:36.590]
We want to congratulate Larry Kent,

[01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:39.970]
the winner of the Florida lottery.

[01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:41.990]
You guys can't, Larry Kent.

[01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:43.470]
Larry Kent is his name.

[01:47:43.730 --> 01:47:44.650]
But not our Larry Kent.

[01:47:44.650 --> 01:47:46.330]
Yeah, this guy is from Roswell, Georgia.

[01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:48.290]
Oh, but even in honor,

[01:47:48.710 --> 01:47:50.770]
we still want to congratulate him.

[01:47:50.770 --> 01:47:51.590]
Well, Larry Kent said,

[01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:53.390]
giant in the WIOD experience market.

[01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:55.770]
There's been around for at least six or seven years.

[01:47:56.590 --> 01:47:59.110]
I'd like to get the Larry and Boom Boom on the same show together.

[01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:01.410]
Oh my.

[01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:02.990]
We can get it like a phone number like seven,

[01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:03.770]
seven, seven.

[01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.370]
I think it's like alternate, you know, every other,

[01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:06.330]
every other seven.

[01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:07.950]
Super Saturday.

[01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.630]
Howard County.

[01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.990]
Hello.

[01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:09.630]
Howard County.

[01:48:09.730 --> 01:48:09.930]
Hello.

[01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:10.570]
Howard County.

[01:48:10.670 --> 01:48:10.890]
Hello.

[01:48:11.050 --> 01:48:11.450]
Howard County.

[01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.810]
Hello.

[01:48:14.610 --> 01:48:14.970]
Hello.

[01:48:15.230 --> 01:48:15.610]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:16.030]
Neil?

[01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.450]
Yeah.

[01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:18.890]
Yeah, I'd like to hear Ricky Tickley do a talk up

[01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:20.110]
to people who got to be free.

[01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:21.730]
Yeah.

[01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:23.230]
And then step on it.

[01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:25.250]
Had a couple of questions concerning the rating.

[01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:25.770]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:26.290]
Anything you want.

[01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:27.990]
I got numbers here that haven't been invented yet

[01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:29.450]
for stations that aren't on the air anymore.

[01:48:29.530 --> 01:48:29.670]
Yeah.

[01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:31.730]
I wonder what would happen if all those monitors

[01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:33.170]
that are out there got a diary?

[01:48:33.810 --> 01:48:35.350]
Would they be realistic?

[01:48:35.690 --> 01:48:36.710]
It could put you down or what?

[01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:38.010]
Well, for all we know they may have.

[01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:39.850]
So we might be doing a 20-year for all we know.

[01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:40.270]
Yeah, right.

[01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:40.870]
You never know.

[01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:41.250]
Yeah.

[01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:43.330]
I haven't heard about our favorite

[01:48:43.330 --> 01:48:44.890]
afternoon radio personality.

[01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.890]
Irene Richard.

[01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.790]
Oh, Irene.

[01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:48.490]
Well, Irene, let's see.

[01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:49.990]
You know, probably in tears that you left her out.

[01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:51.110]
Now, she didn't do too bad.

[01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:53.310]
She had a 3-8 and 12 in the 12-plus.

[01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:53.890]
Now, wait a minute.

[01:48:54.010 --> 01:48:55.090]
That was up from a 3-6.

[01:48:55.630 --> 01:48:56.410]
That's not so bad.

[01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:59.270]
Then in 25 to 54, what did I say?

[01:48:59.350 --> 01:49:00.730]
Because I don't want to have to look through all this again.

[01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:02.990]
We already, Johnny and I looked that up somewhere here.

[01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:05.870]
It was just a lot of problems.

[01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:07.130]
I'll look it up, OK?

[01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:09.630]
You guys being like pages and pages.

[01:49:09.950 --> 01:49:10.390]
General with pages.

[01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:11.810]
There's a lot of problems.

[01:49:12.050 --> 01:49:13.210]
That's really well.

[01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:15.190]
I think you created most of them, OK?

[01:49:15.190 --> 01:49:16.090]
I agree.

[01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:17.570]
All right, let's see.

[01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:19.450]
You are so brutal.

[01:49:19.450 --> 01:49:20.690]
Don't let sit at him, sir.

[01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:21.590]
It's just sour, great.

[01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:24.630]
All those former gloves, personalities, man.

[01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:26.790]
They just get all bent out of shape

[01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:29.010]
and then you tell us and show up on ratings day again.

[01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:30.490]
You notice he wasn't there this morning again?

[01:49:31.130 --> 01:49:32.410]
Well, the ratings went down.

[01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:34.090]
He's always been flat.

[01:49:34.090 --> 01:49:35.610]
That's what I think I really talked about the ratings.

[01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:36.590]
Oh, ratings.

[01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:38.330]
Oh, I'll look him up during the news

[01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:40.270]
and we'll have him for you right in the big one of two hours.

[01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.690]
OK.

[01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:41.430]
Have a good one.

[01:49:42.530 --> 01:49:42.890]
OK.

[01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:45.230]
Well, while we're searching frantically for Irene's listeners,

[01:49:45.230 --> 01:49:46.310]
it looks like they are at love.

[01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:47.830]
We're going to pause now.

[01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:50.550]
Of course, April War, them who hasn't got any idea what this is all about.

[01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:52.030]
But it's having a good time with anyway.

[01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:53.630]
She got the, oh, here it is.

[01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:54.350]
$25.54.

[01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:55.270]
We do a real quick down.

[01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:57.510]
$55.05.2.

[01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:57.910]
Not bad.

[01:49:58.050 --> 01:49:58.790]
Irene, good job.

[01:49:58.930 --> 01:49:59.690]
We'll be back at 105.

[01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:02.950]
So why don't you two hour?

[01:50:03.290 --> 01:50:04.570]
Well, that's easy for you to say.

[01:50:04.630 --> 01:50:06.110]
OK, 105 at WIOD.

[01:50:06.370 --> 01:50:08.090]
The winner book is, by the way,

[01:50:08.190 --> 01:50:10.130]
Andrew Reese from Jewels are by us.

[01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:12.690]
I did get that little thing and I appreciate it.

[01:50:12.710 --> 01:50:13.110]
It was great.

[01:50:13.230 --> 01:50:14.070]
Thank you very much.

[01:50:15.650 --> 01:50:16.530]
What a day, huh?

[01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:17.890]
That big one or two.

[01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:19.370]
Did they all applaud it in a hallway?

[01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:21.070]
They patch you on it back and say,

[01:50:21.110 --> 01:50:21.810]
incredible job.

[01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.790]
Unbelievable.

[01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:24.070]
We'll keep up the great work.

[01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:26.590]
Nobody talked to you.

[01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:27.630]
Well, even Phil.

[01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:30.090]
I see.

[01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:34.530]
Well, they're probably all out to their big executive lunches now.

[01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:37.250]
Planning all the gifts that they're going to give.

[01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:38.210]
Quiet out there.

[01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:40.190]
Here's a call from chronic productions.

[01:50:40.190 --> 01:50:42.310]
This must be one of our inside people here.

[01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.590]
Hello.

[01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.690]
Good morning.

[01:50:44.050 --> 01:50:44.850]
Good afternoon.

[01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:45.750]
Is this one of us?

[01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:48.650]
Congratulations, guys, for Miami-Rakes test and chronic production.

[01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:49.410]
Well, thank you.

[01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:50.630]
We couldn't have done it without your stuff.

[01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:52.850]
Wow, we're all happy.

[01:50:53.050 --> 01:50:55.270]
We're all happy to see you guys right to our thing.

[01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:57.190]
You don't have to wait a minute.

[01:50:57.730 --> 01:50:59.130]
Spike Wife just came in here.

[01:50:59.230 --> 01:51:00.410]
You don't have nothing to do with this thing.

[01:51:01.890 --> 01:51:03.510]
Here's a finger for you, Spike.

[01:51:04.990 --> 01:51:06.130]
Yeah, get out of here.

[01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:07.270]
Get out of here.

[01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:09.750]
By the way, GTR had a fluke book by the way.

[01:51:11.250 --> 01:51:13.330]
You believe this Spike Wife's coming in here?

[01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:15.170]
Yeah.

[01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:16.390]
Bring some more champagne.

[01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:18.050]
I think he already drank it off.

[01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:19.310]
So anyway.

[01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:23.870]
So anyway, we don't pay for a book and the only way we can get the numbers is through you.

[01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:27.770]
We're wondering if you can give us some of those 18 to 34 overall numbers.

[01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.610]
Overall?

[01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.650]
Yeah.

[01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:33.310]
Well, you mean like...

[01:51:33.310 --> 01:51:35.110]
You don't want to give us, was that news?

[01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:37.530]
You mean for like the week, right?

[01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:38.950]
No, for the winter but.

[01:51:39.970 --> 01:51:41.430]
But I mean like for the whole week,

[01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:45.750]
I don't start testing my patients as they say in my doctor's office.

[01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:50.790]
18 to 34, let's see, those are on these strange little light pages.

[01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:54.630]
Okay, you want 18 to 34, 6...

[01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:56.750]
In what morning?

[01:51:58.150 --> 01:52:00.450]
Overall, I'm going to start getting really upset.

[01:52:01.090 --> 01:52:01.890]
Okay, here we go.

[01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:04.050]
Seven of midnight, I can't find it.

[01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:04.430]
Here it is.

[01:52:04.670 --> 01:52:05.250]
I finally got it.

[01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:06.630]
Well, we got 400 things here.

[01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:09.110]
Hot, 14.9.

[01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:10.390]
I know.

[01:52:11.210 --> 01:52:12.330]
GTR, 10.7.

[01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:15.450]
No reaction.

[01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:17.490]
A power of 7.5.

[01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:20.070]
Gloves.

[01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:21.690]
I'm not reacting because I'm writing news down.

[01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:22.770]
Oh, gloves 90 feet.

[01:52:22.770 --> 01:52:23.890]
Are we reacting in the other room?

[01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:24.330]
Believe me.

[01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.910]
Are they really?

[01:52:25.050 --> 01:52:29.150]
I hear it and if they'd make about two, four feet in between each other,

[01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:30.170]
they'd probably be a lot better off.

[01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:31.870]
1194, 5.6.

[01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:34.130]
What 100?

[01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:35.890]
5.4.

[01:52:37.190 --> 01:52:38.470]
How about X, D, J?

[01:52:38.890 --> 01:52:40.370]
Wax, the FM at a 5.

[01:52:40.590 --> 01:52:41.250]
And that's the Zeta.

[01:52:41.250 --> 01:52:41.950]
That'll be a while.

[01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:43.930]
X, D, J, if I keep reading,

[01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.750]
we'll have the end of the show before we get to that.

[01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:46.410]
Here's magic.

[01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:48.070]
They're not on the second page.

[01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:50.450]
They're on the third page.

[01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:54.690]
They went from a 4.7 to a 2.5 in 18 to 34 is on WX.

[01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:56.590]
Oh, FF.

[01:52:57.810 --> 01:52:59.290]
I'm afraid of that.

[01:52:59.290 --> 01:52:59.970]
I just gave you that.

[01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:01.590]
You see, you got to be real quick, 3.8.

[01:53:02.650 --> 01:53:05.630]
But Zeta's like, Zeta's basically history, you know what I'm saying?

[01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:06.830]
What do you guys do?

[01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:09.630]
Overall?

[01:53:11.730 --> 01:53:12.970]
You mean the station?

[01:53:14.850 --> 01:53:16.730]
WIOD 18 to 34 probably didn't do much.

[01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:18.150]
We had a 6-1 10 to 3.

[01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:22.450]
But WIOD 18 to 34, I can't imagine it was much of any number.

[01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.930]
Let me see.

[01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:23.990]
Do I want to do this?

[01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.730]
Is it on here anywhere?

[01:53:25.090 --> 01:53:25.230]
Are we?

[01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:26.350]
Do we make the first four sheets?

[01:53:26.850 --> 01:53:27.370]
It's got to be.

[01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:27.950]
Yeah, 3-1.

[01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:30.630]
It's not so bad.

[01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:32.350]
Test your patience one more time.

[01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:33.330]
One more and that's it.

[01:53:33.610 --> 01:53:33.950]
Okay.

[01:53:34.170 --> 01:53:35.850]
Because I even am falling asleep now.

[01:53:35.850 --> 01:53:38.690]
Afternoon to night, 18 to 34 for GTR.

[01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:42.010]
For GTR, boy, this is a pretty intensive call here.

[01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:42.530]
Let's see.

[01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:44.570]
3 to 7 p.m.

[01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:46.410]
WGTR 18 to 34 at 11.

[01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:48.950]
Share up from a 7-6 and at night 7 to midnight,

[01:53:49.650 --> 01:53:51.890]
WGTR had a 7-3.

[01:53:52.570 --> 01:53:53.050]
All right.

[01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.690]
Okay.

[01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:55.010]
All right, I like that 11.

[01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.710]
See ya.

[01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:56.290]
Take care.

[01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.650]
Bye.

[01:53:57.450 --> 01:53:58.990]
Okay, here's some facts stuff now.

[01:53:59.210 --> 01:54:03.490]
And this is the Lexington Stakes at Keyland.

[01:54:04.050 --> 01:54:04.850]
Who do you like?

[01:54:04.850 --> 01:54:07.070]
It says this is going to be on 4 to 5 p.m.

[01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:09.650]
on ESPN on the Lexington Stakes.

[01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:11.170]
Got a chance to pick a horse here today.

[01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:12.530]
We already picked it high.

[01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:14.070]
Lea, this of course is at Keyland.

[01:54:14.370 --> 01:54:15.910]
You know, Keyland is the only track in America

[01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:17.090]
that does not have a track announcer.

[01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:18.650]
Track in that fee.

[01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:19.530]
They don't.

[01:54:19.530 --> 01:54:20.590]
They just to run the races.

[01:54:20.590 --> 01:54:21.930]
There's no track announcer at all.

[01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.950]
They just silent.

[01:54:23.250 --> 01:54:25.190]
And of course Dave Johnson does it on television.

[01:54:27.010 --> 01:54:27.930]
But let's see.

[01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:29.690]
Foxy reality with Randy Romero.

[01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:32.190]
Charlie Barley with Robin Plants.

[01:54:32.410 --> 01:54:33.630]
I'm picking Charlie Barley.

[01:54:33.690 --> 01:54:33.910]
Okay.

[01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:35.150]
I like the name and I like Robin Plants.

[01:54:35.150 --> 01:54:37.510]
You Canadian Jockey detonated.

[01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:40.590]
Which is kind of like what's that word again?

[01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:42.150]
What is it?

[01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:44.150]
detonated.

[01:54:44.370 --> 01:54:45.750]
No, that word we were using earlier.

[01:54:46.090 --> 01:54:47.110]
Oh, Delima.

[01:54:47.410 --> 01:54:47.690]
Delima.

[01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:48.790]
I better write that down.

[01:54:48.930 --> 01:54:49.230]
I can't remember.

[01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:52.730]
With Donald Brumfield, dispersal with Chris Antley.

[01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:53.150]
Oh gee.

[01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:55.110]
Now Chris Antley is the hottest Jockey in the country.

[01:54:55.290 --> 01:54:56.170]
He's burning him up in New York.

[01:54:56.170 --> 01:55:00.330]
He's had a winning race every day for 59 days in a row.

[01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:01.170]
He's won a lease for a race.

[01:55:01.290 --> 01:55:02.230]
The old record was 29.

[01:55:02.730 --> 01:55:04.010]
Even money in a morning line.

[01:55:04.150 --> 01:55:05.390]
Dispersal with that's your kind.

[01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:05.830]
Uh huh.

[01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:07.330]
Notation with Pat Dei.

[01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:08.630]
America's friend with early fires.

[01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:11.310]
Magistise Zimpo with Craig Perret and Bionic prospect

[01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:12.570]
with Jacinto Vazquez.

[01:55:13.450 --> 01:55:13.850]
Dispersal.

[01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.210]
Yeah.

[01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:14.690]
Okay.

[01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:16.250]
He's going with the even money chalk.

[01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:17.690]
He probably goes about two to five.

[01:55:17.690 --> 01:55:19.670]
It'll be another frosty to snowman for 240.

[01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:22.310]
So take about 40,000 and plunge your brain.

[01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:24.650]
All the bridge jumpers can bet on this one.

[01:55:24.710 --> 01:55:26.050]
Dispersal with Chris Antley and even money.

[01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:26.650]
He'll probably win.

[01:55:26.730 --> 01:55:28.810]
But I'm going with Charlie Barley with Robin Sinkton

[01:55:28.810 --> 01:55:31.510]
stakes at Sinkton stakes at Sinkton stakes at Keenland.

[01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:32.930]
This afternoon, Fidelin this afternoon,

[01:55:32.970 --> 01:55:34.110]
Forty-five PM on the ESPN.

[01:55:35.050 --> 01:55:35.370]
Wow.

[01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:37.130]
And it's even got the racing form here.

[01:55:37.210 --> 01:55:38.510]
Look at that, which you can't read.

[01:55:38.710 --> 01:55:39.350]
But it's exciting.

[01:55:39.490 --> 01:55:41.010]
Charlie Barley, what is last start?

[01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:43.930]
But you could go blind trying to read this on a facts machine.

[01:55:45.490 --> 01:55:45.810]
Detonated.

[01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:47.650]
Has been in the money.

[01:55:47.850 --> 01:55:49.930]
Five out of oh, dispersal is the one you put.

[01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:51.290]
Oh, yeah, he's won three out of four.

[01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:54.470]
And the last time he was second by half a length.

[01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:56.610]
Drifted out, it says.

[01:55:58.670 --> 01:55:58.990]
Okay.

[01:55:59.090 --> 01:56:00.110]
Well, anyway, we don't want to get here.

[01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:12.390]
I don't think those are that bad.

[01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:14.370]
They may have not used them, but they're not that bad.

[01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:14.770]
Yeah.

[01:56:15.190 --> 01:56:17.310]
The quality isn't that great, but they're not that bad.

[01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.510]
Huh?

[01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:18.370]
We like them.

[01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:20.490]
They're not like the W snoozingals.

[01:56:20.590 --> 01:56:22.930]
Those are probably great, but we don't have, uh,

[01:56:23.690 --> 01:56:25.390]
let's understand we don't have anywhere to plan.

[01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:27.310]
We got nothing to do anything here.

[01:56:27.370 --> 01:56:28.510]
We don't have any production here.

[01:56:29.210 --> 01:56:31.490]
Can you imagine what number we could have if this were a real race?

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.490]

[01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.910]
The real station.

[01:56:33.650 --> 01:56:34.750]
No real to real.

[01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:35.610]
Wow.

[01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:37.930]
Where?

[01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:39.190]
Are you going nuts now?

[01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:40.070]
Are you getting out of control?

[01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:41.770]
Are we able to reel the reel in here too?

[01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:43.350]
We got a CD player.

[01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:44.590]
We got overhead speakers.

[01:56:44.770 --> 01:56:47.210]
We got a triple deck, uh, uh, uh,

[01:56:47.210 --> 01:56:48.090]
cart machine down there.

[01:56:48.130 --> 01:56:51.470]
And you want to, uh, reel the reel in here and make it like a real radio station?

[01:56:52.210 --> 01:56:52.750]
Cut it out.

[01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:56.430]
We like to give the competition a little handy crap anyway.

[01:56:56.610 --> 01:56:56.830]
Okay?

[01:56:57.250 --> 01:56:57.690]
All right.

[01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:59.370]
We do have one open line in dead county.

[01:56:59.450 --> 01:57:00.690]
I don't know what the hell's going on in dead.

[01:57:00.690 --> 01:57:02.190]
Cause they're taking a little C.S. to none.

[01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:03.830]
I don't think anybody south of, uh,

[01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:05.730]
what's like the demarcation of it?

[01:57:05.850 --> 01:57:06.890]
South of 79th Street.

[01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:08.230]
Nobody speaks English in dead county.

[01:57:08.230 --> 01:57:09.430]
They do something going on there.

[01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:13.630]
They do take C.S. to south of 79th Street every day from noon to two.

[01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:15.030]
Did you know that in dead county?

[01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:19.750]
Well, I guess it starts here in this building.

[01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:20.990]
They started a trend.

[01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:22.130]
Hollywood. Hello.

[01:57:22.450 --> 01:57:22.850]
Hello.

[01:57:23.230 --> 01:57:23.490]
Yes.

[01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:24.730]
Hi, Nail.

[01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:25.690]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:57:25.770 --> 01:57:26.330]
Hi, Nail.

[01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:28.250]
I burned congrats on your rating.

[01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:29.010]
Thank you.

[01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:30.010]
You got a terrific show.

[01:57:30.230 --> 01:57:32.210]
I've been listening about a year and a half now.

[01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:35.030]
And I've enjoyed every second of it.

[01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:35.810]
I'm on the road.

[01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:37.250]
Well, I wish I could say the same.

[01:57:39.490 --> 01:57:40.750]
I've been traveling on the road.

[01:57:40.930 --> 01:57:41.890]
I'm a traveling nurse.

[01:57:42.710 --> 01:57:44.490]
And unfortunately for the past couple of months,

[01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:46.050]
I haven't been able to listen to your show.

[01:57:46.150 --> 01:57:47.570]
Cause I bought an MG and, uh,

[01:57:47.890 --> 01:57:49.170]
radio won't turn to AM.

[01:57:49.490 --> 01:57:50.310]
Oh my god.

[01:57:50.410 --> 01:57:52.490]
Well, you take it back where you bought it and tell them to get

[01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:53.490]
them straight and out of else.

[01:57:53.630 --> 01:57:54.450]
They're fixing it today.

[01:57:54.450 --> 01:57:55.910]
So I can get to listen to you tomorrow.

[01:57:56.130 --> 01:57:56.750]
Thank god.

[01:57:56.750 --> 01:57:59.230]
But, uh, continue to experience on a great show.

[01:57:59.230 --> 01:58:00.750]
And I really do enjoy it.

[01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:01.430]
Thanks a lot.

[01:58:01.630 --> 01:58:02.490]
Okay. Have a great day.

[01:58:02.590 --> 01:58:02.750]
Bye.

[01:58:02.970 --> 01:58:03.150]
Bye.

[01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:03.910]
Well, she was nice.

[01:58:04.050 --> 01:58:04.810]
One, she very nice.

[01:58:04.810 --> 01:58:05.290]
What happened?

[01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:06.630]
What a terrible problem.

[01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:07.810]
I never heard of such a thing.

[01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:08.410]
No, AM.

[01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:09.170]
God.

[01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:11.050]
FM is obsolete, isn't it?

[01:58:11.070 --> 01:58:12.170]
Kid with it.

[01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:13.530]
I love.

[01:58:13.890 --> 01:58:14.810]
Oh, we first came over here.

[01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:15.210]
I love that.

[01:58:15.230 --> 01:58:17.170]
The day that Alice, remember we having that little thing

[01:58:17.170 --> 01:58:17.790]
back and forth?

[01:58:18.010 --> 01:58:18.490]
Oh, sure.

[01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:19.590]
And I had to tune into Alice,

[01:58:19.590 --> 01:58:20.770]
which took years off my life.

[01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:23.910]
And he was whining like he always said.

[01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:26.150]
Oh, one day he says FM is dead.

[01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:27.470]
And then he's on AM and it's that.

[01:58:27.730 --> 01:58:32.690]
And I'm well, we, I mean, we go wobble as less Cooper would say on that particular.

[01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:36.530]
But one thing we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is that W.

[01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:37.270]
Snews is dead.

[01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.590]
Okay.

[01:58:37.930 --> 01:58:41.350]
I mean, he's number is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.

[01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:43.170]
Can there be any question at all?

[01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:44.590]
No, there is a lot of question.

[01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:48.070]
We have here today, uh, out of the new inquire,

[01:58:48.110 --> 01:58:50.270]
we have a little pole that was taken doing.

[01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:53.350]
And Oprah, a lot of people in this building have a little pole.

[01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:59.450]
Oprah is the runaway favorite of inquire readers when it comes to talk show host.

[01:58:59.750 --> 01:59:01.230]
She is number one.

[01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:06.030]
She got 44.4% of the votes more than double the second place,

[01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:09.010]
which of course is Rush Limbaugh.

[01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.790]
Haraldo.

[01:59:10.050 --> 01:59:11.270]
Oh my god.

[01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:12.990]
I'll go to America's not well tonight.

[01:59:13.110 --> 01:59:17.370]
Yeah, this is really a Sally Jesse was third with 15%

[01:59:17.370 --> 01:59:22.970]
Phil Donahue, long regard as the top, top duog of talk show host place in

[01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:23.590]
this and fourth.

[01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:26.330]
And you know what they say about Donahue?

[01:59:26.490 --> 01:59:27.930]
He's an Ozhaw for the tour.

[01:59:28.770 --> 01:59:31.450]
And TV motormouth Morton Downey Jr. was fifth.

[01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:34.870]
And in last place, ladies, can we have a drum roll?

[01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:37.830]
Well, I don't have a drum roll in there, but I think you're like this better.

[01:59:41.070 --> 01:59:41.430]
Perfect.

[01:59:43.610 --> 01:59:44.330]
Larry King.

[01:59:44.590 --> 01:59:45.030]
Oh, yeah.

[01:59:45.250 --> 01:59:48.450]
Larry was the wacker twist and Larry, of course, used to be on his station

[01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:50.110]
when it was a WC.

[01:59:50.250 --> 01:59:51.910]
He's the old wacker on the radio.

[01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:53.390]
See how it all pies together?

[01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:55.130]
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

[01:59:55.490 --> 01:59:56.490]
The wacker twist.

[01:59:56.930 --> 01:59:56.930]

[01:59:57.250 --> 01:59:57.950]
Thank you, Larry King.

[01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:59.790]
Yeah, you think about it.

[02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:01.130]
Lake Worth, hello.

[02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:03.030]
This is John Faccano.

[02:00:06.570 --> 02:00:10.450]
Nope, sound like John was about ready to hit the bottom of the boulder, didn't it?

[02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:12.430]
Okay, we have an open line.

[02:00:12.570 --> 02:00:12.830]
Look at that.

[02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:14.230]
Bokeh is wrapped off at the same time.

[02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:15.370]
They dropped off like in tandem.

[02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:19.890]
278WID and Bokeh even veg didn't call today to congratulate us on a ready shot.

[02:00:19.890 --> 02:00:23.450]
You know, all you chronics like Paul Harvey at least, I can't say much for them

[02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:24.590]
because he's really a pain in the ass.

[02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:29.550]
But at least today he called in the book came out and he had the common decency to,

[02:00:29.890 --> 02:00:33.850]
you know, deflect his own egotistical, ego maniacal crap and you know,

[02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:35.970]
have a little something to say about us, okay?

[02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.690]
Yeah.

[02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:42.470]
But the rest of these professional, psychophantic, moronic, douchebag, subhuman,

[02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:45.510]
whatever they are, you know, they won't do that.

[02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:47.290]
Well, Cox did call in.

[02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:48.090]
Oh yeah, well, not.

[02:00:48.090 --> 02:00:49.030]
They're the only two chronic.

[02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:50.050]
I forgot about him.

[02:00:50.230 --> 02:00:50.350]
Yeah.

[02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:53.610]
Okay, it's way, I think you're playing at buzzer enough.

[02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:56.190]
Not yet.

[02:00:56.290 --> 02:00:56.750]
Don't panic.

[02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:57.330]
It's not yet.

[02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:59.050]
We don't want anybody on the line to get nervous.

[02:00:59.510 --> 02:01:00.110]
Poor Lauderdale.

[02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:00.430]
Hello.

[02:01:00.710 --> 02:01:00.930]
Neil.

[02:01:01.230 --> 02:01:01.630]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:04.470]
I wanted to thank you before I give you my little spire report.

[02:01:04.690 --> 02:01:07.690]
I just had an incredible out of radio experience at about one o'clock.

[02:01:07.930 --> 02:01:11.350]
You had an auto-erotic experience?

[02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:14.530]
There was no delay and I was freaking out and I'm like,

[02:01:14.710 --> 02:01:17.270]
gotta hope Neil picks up on me first so I can tell him before he goes.

[02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:19.270]
When was that coming out of the one o'clock news?

[02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:21.210]
Yeah, and then just real gradually like,

[02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:23.590]
oh, there's a one second delay and then there's a two second delay.

[02:01:23.630 --> 02:01:24.530]
Like I was on drugs.

[02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:25.090]
Well, yes, what?

[02:01:25.190 --> 02:01:25.970]
That's how it works.

[02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:26.390]
Really?

[02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:28.250]
Kind of like builds up, like other things, you know.

[02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:29.750]
Yeah, it kind of builds up to a crescendo.

[02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:30.490]
It's quite magic.

[02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.390]
And then in your case, it's kind of peeders out.

[02:01:32.650 --> 02:01:32.850]
Yeah.

[02:01:33.570 --> 02:01:35.630]
I just wanted to call and give you the great news.

[02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:38.150]
You're going to be sprinting around like a dreidel in about three seconds.

[02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:39.910]
So get ready to light your cigar back up.

[02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:40.310]
Hmm.

[02:01:40.530 --> 02:01:42.790]
Liz O'Neill is retiring from the weekly news.

[02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:43.650]
Effective this week.

[02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.990]
He's moving to one.

[02:01:46.450 --> 02:01:47.370]
He's moving to one.

[02:01:47.890 --> 02:01:48.930]
Washington of all God.

[02:01:49.010 --> 02:01:49.810]
Are you serious?

[02:01:49.930 --> 02:01:50.130]
Yeah.

[02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.630]
Wow.

[02:01:50.890 --> 02:01:52.290]
So the weekly news is this.

[02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:54.670]
Well, any kind of listen to Howard Stern show in Washington, right?

[02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:55.210]
Right.

[02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:56.710]
Ah, oh, really?

[02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:59.010]
This will be a good experience for him all around.

[02:01:59.230 --> 02:02:00.510]
Yeah, good learning experience.

[02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:05.090]
His last editorial is going to be in tomorrow's issue and he says he's going to rip everybody that's ever

[02:02:05.090 --> 02:02:05.490]
ripped him.

[02:02:05.690 --> 02:02:07.110]
So your name will probably be in there.

[02:02:07.190 --> 02:02:07.990]
It's in that wonderful.

[02:02:08.110 --> 02:02:09.170]
I hope he spelled it right.

[02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:10.090]
I hope so too.

[02:02:10.210 --> 02:02:13.510]
Cause remember what goes around comes around you to so to speak.

[02:02:13.630 --> 02:02:14.930]
Can you give me a buzz before I go?

[02:02:17.230 --> 02:02:18.870]
Well, it all depends on what you had.

[02:02:20.910 --> 02:02:21.630]
See you.

[02:02:21.630 --> 02:02:21.970]
Huh.

[02:02:22.170 --> 02:02:23.570]
Well, we're asking to get buzzed.

[02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:23.810]
Okay.

[02:02:23.970 --> 02:02:24.170]
Yeah.

[02:02:24.330 --> 02:02:24.610]
I know.

[02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:27.070]
Well, this has really been a day.

[02:02:27.190 --> 02:02:32.190]
We've had more news rumors and stories today.

[02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.790]
Yeah.

[02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:33.770]
Right from the beginning.

[02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:37.710]
Remember right in the beginning all the first day and stuff and then we had what was that?

[02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:38.410]
Dennis Reeves.

[02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.670]
Yes.

[02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.790]
Absolutely.

[02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:41.210]
You know what?

[02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:42.110]
I really missed out.

[02:02:42.210 --> 02:02:43.750]
I was I should have thought of it.

[02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:45.290]
Then when he got into that rumor, I was so shocked.

[02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:46.730]
I didn't know what the scream read the microphone.

[02:02:47.010 --> 02:02:51.770]
I wanted to ask him about that night at old I 95 when he had all those kids in their underwear

[02:02:51.770 --> 02:02:52.210]
in the studio.

[02:02:52.210 --> 02:02:53.350]
Cause I keep telling you about it.

[02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:56.310]
A lot of people think I'm making that up or I was wishful thinking.

[02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.510]
Yeah.

[02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:57.570]
And it's a true story.

[02:02:57.670 --> 02:02:59.470]
Well, the Metro police came and chased everybody.

[02:02:59.470 --> 02:03:00.170]
Now a lot of them.

[02:03:00.170 --> 02:03:02.910]
I'm sure he'll call back a couple days.

[02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:04.350]
And we were pretty pio to talk.

[02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.690]
Okay.

[02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:05.970]
It was getting to look pretty interesting.

[02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:08.070]
Oh, excuse me.

[02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:10.470]
Oh, this one.

[02:03:10.710 --> 02:03:11.050]
Look at that.

[02:03:12.010 --> 02:03:13.750]
We got the bad radio.

[02:03:14.010 --> 02:03:14.170]
Okay.

[02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:16.810]
We only got an eight six and 25 to 50.

[02:03:16.890 --> 02:03:18.690]
We're only number one, but it's bad radio.

[02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:21.290]
See what you don't understand, boy, Gary is in this market.

[02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:22.270]
Bad radio is good.

[02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:22.990]
It's like the kids.

[02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:24.050]
They said, boy, that was really bad.

[02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.770]
I mean, it was good.

[02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:25.490]
Okay.

[02:03:26.690 --> 02:03:29.670]
So if he says maybe wait a minute, maybe he's talking kid talk.

[02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:30.030]
Okay.

[02:03:30.170 --> 02:03:31.450]
He said it was bad radio.

[02:03:31.810 --> 02:03:32.470]
It is boy.

[02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.930]
It does.

[02:03:33.090 --> 02:03:35.470]
Don't I mean, he's giving us a stinking compliment.

[02:03:35.670 --> 02:03:35.890]
Okay.

[02:03:35.890 --> 02:03:36.910]
He said, man, that was bad.

[02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:40.410]
And when he said the other thing was really good.

[02:03:40.610 --> 02:03:41.250]
He meant it's.

[02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:45.190]
So now I'm beginning to understand this kid.

[02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:45.430]
Okay.

[02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:47.190]
See when you got like a four year old program director,

[02:03:47.190 --> 02:03:48.230]
you got to learn a little different.

[02:03:48.570 --> 02:03:50.330]
You know, we got a little generation gap there.

[02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:52.790]
We weren't even thinking like about 42 years.

[02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.670]
Okay.

[02:03:53.710 --> 02:03:54.730]
Here's a constant comment.

[02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:56.230]
I'm sure about our male callers.

[02:03:56.290 --> 02:03:56.450]
Hello.

[02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:57.510]
Hi, Neil.

[02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:58.010]
Yes.

[02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.790]
Hi, Kathy.

[02:03:59.050 --> 02:03:59.450]
Hi, Kathy.

[02:03:59.650 --> 02:04:01.790]
I'm a reject from Nazareth College for Women.

[02:04:02.230 --> 02:04:02.990]
Does that ring any bell?

[02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.770]
In Rochester.

[02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:04.370]
No, no.

[02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:07.770]
Nazareth College is in Kalamazoo.

[02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:08.130]
Right.

[02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:09.350]
Well, if you say so, I don't know.

[02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:10.070]
It's been a rough life.

[02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:11.070]
You know, I get them confused.

[02:04:11.190 --> 02:04:11.450]
All right.

[02:04:12.330 --> 02:04:13.850]
Congratulations, by the way, on your rating.

[02:04:14.010 --> 02:04:14.670]
Thank you, Kathy.

[02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:15.430]
We do care.

[02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:16.650]
Well, a few.

[02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:18.950]
Care enough to send their very best.

[02:04:19.370 --> 02:04:21.370]
I'm finding though a lot of your male listeners,

[02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:24.750]
as soon as they say, oh, yeah, I listened to Neil Rogers.

[02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:25.390]
He's great.

[02:04:25.710 --> 02:04:27.110]
They have to issue a disclaimer.

[02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:29.930]
They say, I mean, I'm not gay or anything, mind you.

[02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:30.350]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:33.030]
And as soon as they say that, you know what that means.

[02:04:33.250 --> 02:04:33.430]
Yes.

[02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:35.850]
That means that they're, you know, wearing puse underwear.

[02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.850]
I think so.

[02:04:37.390 --> 02:04:37.490]
Yeah.

[02:04:37.630 --> 02:04:38.670]
Very insecure at least.

[02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:39.090]
Exactly.

[02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:42.010]
Well, see, part of that, now my audience is used to that,

[02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:43.210]
because I've been out of the closet for like,

[02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:44.490]
almost 13 years on the air here.

[02:04:44.530 --> 02:04:45.210]
So it's not a big deal.

[02:04:45.610 --> 02:04:47.490]
But there's a certain segment of the people

[02:04:47.490 --> 02:04:49.290]
across over Steve Kane audience.

[02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:51.730]
His guys are very insecure, okay?

[02:04:52.210 --> 02:04:55.270]
So like when he does these shows about the guy breastfeeding

[02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:57.370]
and about all these other weird things that Steve gets into,

[02:04:57.850 --> 02:05:00.110]
his guys call up and they want to be like padded on the head

[02:05:00.110 --> 02:05:01.530]
and reassured that they're okay.

[02:05:01.710 --> 02:05:04.230]
They want to make sure that they would never do any of these things.

[02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:05.230]
They wouldn't, I'm sure.

[02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:07.230]
And the amazing part of it is, if you listen closely,

[02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:08.830]
you can tell they're usually calling in pairs

[02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:11.710]
together on the phone, which tells me a lot.

[02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.730]
I think so.

[02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:13.890]
Anyway, good luck.

[02:05:14.090 --> 02:05:15.070]
Keep up to good work.

[02:05:15.130 --> 02:05:15.670]
We really do.

[02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:16.210]
Thanks, Scott.

[02:05:16.330 --> 02:05:16.930]
You have a good one.

[02:05:17.050 --> 02:05:17.450]
Thank you, Scott.

[02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:20.190]
Oh, yeah, I wasn't that sure, but the Corp.

[02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.830]
I'm great.

[02:05:23.710 --> 02:05:26.210]
Just like a lot of guys in a business who are always, you know,

[02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.870]
sure.

[02:05:27.970 --> 02:05:29.290]
126 at WIOD.

[02:05:29.410 --> 02:05:31.530]
Everybody do with the WPK.

[02:05:32.230 --> 02:05:32.230]

[02:05:33.530 --> 02:05:37.670]
Oh, the DJs are moving to the WPK art quiz.

[02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:42.690]
I think he never somebody all at once.

[02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:44.790]
I do a no-factor quiz.

[02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.810]
Wow.

[02:05:47.070 --> 02:05:49.010]
The WPK art quiz.

[02:05:50.370 --> 02:05:53.890]
I mean, there's no discussion of situations or events

[02:05:53.890 --> 02:05:56.890]
of social problems or anything else.

[02:05:56.970 --> 02:05:58.610]
It's just shock and radio.

[02:06:02.590 --> 02:06:04.770]
You know, the bad part, you know, that's the end.

[02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:12.330]
127 at WIOD.

[02:06:12.490 --> 02:06:13.630]
We have an opening in Broward now.

[02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:14.610]
It's pretty shock.

[02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:16.250]
Broward's been pretty mediocre today.

[02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:17.910]
I got to, you know, the fact that one line is not.

[02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:19.010]
I don't think it makes too much difference.

[02:06:19.230 --> 02:06:21.550]
Broward's been very, very fair weather today.

[02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:24.350]
524 at WIOD.

[02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:25.770]
524, 9463.

[02:06:25.890 --> 02:06:27.810]
Probably a lot of the listeners in Broward are busy standing

[02:06:27.810 --> 02:06:29.590]
across the lake, cross from my house.

[02:06:30.710 --> 02:06:34.070]
Looking to see if my satellite dish is still up there with their hand over their eyebrow.

[02:06:34.490 --> 02:06:35.090]
What is that?

[02:06:35.190 --> 02:06:37.150]
What is that over there and running all around you know, a little circle?

[02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:37.610]
Wow.

[02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:38.910]
That's my philosophy.

[02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:40.110]
What in question or in doubt?

[02:06:40.290 --> 02:06:41.670]
What in circle screen and shot?

[02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.490]
I like that.

[02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:43.330]
By George.

[02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:44.650]
Let's go to Miami.

[02:06:44.670 --> 02:06:45.070]
Hello.

[02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:46.490]
Neil Bird, how are you?

[02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:47.130]
Okay, pal.

[02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:48.230]
Hippasa.

[02:06:48.650 --> 02:06:49.050]
Nothing.

[02:06:49.770 --> 02:06:50.670]
Nothing's happening yet.

[02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:51.090]
Yeah.

[02:06:51.630 --> 02:06:52.030]
Neil.

[02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:53.150]
Nothing on this end either.

[02:06:54.010 --> 02:06:55.730]
I was going to ask you for something.

[02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:58.150]
Could you play that?

[02:06:58.330 --> 02:07:00.090]
I know I don't like requests and...

[02:07:00.090 --> 02:07:00.850]
Hey, let me tell you something.

[02:07:00.930 --> 02:07:01.850]
You sound desperate enough.

[02:07:01.850 --> 02:07:02.710]
What is it that you want?

[02:07:04.530 --> 02:07:05.930]
The Michael Tyson song.

[02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:07.830]
Oh, I didn't know why.

[02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:09.090]
That's not really a song.

[02:07:09.210 --> 02:07:10.650]
It's something like a song, but we didn't really say goodbye.

[02:07:10.650 --> 02:07:12.350]
We can debate it while I'm looking for it.

[02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:13.230]
We can debate it as a song.

[02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.830]
Is it a bit?

[02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:15.270]
Is it a comedy thing?

[02:07:15.450 --> 02:07:15.890]
It's something.

[02:07:16.590 --> 02:07:17.190]
It's something.

[02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:18.470]
Well, it's in a machine right now.

[02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:19.090]
How do you like that?

[02:07:19.190 --> 02:07:19.770]
Oh, that's great.

[02:07:20.070 --> 02:07:23.290]
And I want to congratulate you guys on the rating you showed.

[02:07:23.570 --> 02:07:24.990]
I love your show here.

[02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.590]
Thanks.

[02:07:25.670 --> 02:07:26.590]
And you even admitted, right?

[02:07:26.850 --> 02:07:26.990]
Yeah.

[02:07:27.170 --> 02:07:28.630]
In spite of what all your friends say.

[02:07:28.630 --> 02:07:29.110]
Nice, sure.

[02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.930]
We love it.

[02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:32.850]
And before I go in the...

[02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:34.390]
Can you belt in...

[02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:35.870]
And belt me off that...

[02:07:37.110 --> 02:07:38.430]
Let me just say this to you.

[02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:40.130]
Okay, that cart is in the machine now.

[02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:41.450]
I'd hate for you to lose it.

[02:07:41.530 --> 02:07:41.870]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:07:42.090 --> 02:07:42.590]
No, I know.

[02:07:42.710 --> 02:07:44.490]
You got me to do something I almost never do.

[02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:46.190]
And now it's like you're backing out of it.

[02:07:46.230 --> 02:07:46.610]
No, no, no.

[02:07:46.610 --> 02:07:48.910]
Like winning a lottery and then burning the ticket, you know?

[02:07:49.010 --> 02:07:50.050]
It is that that's bad rating.

[02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.770]
I know.

[02:07:51.570 --> 02:07:52.590]
Well, that bad is good.

[02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:53.370]
Yeah, I know.

[02:07:53.370 --> 02:07:54.790]
And this has been a bad call, believe it.

[02:07:55.710 --> 02:07:56.250]
See you later.

[02:07:56.430 --> 02:07:56.510]
Okay.

[02:07:56.690 --> 02:07:56.970]
Thank you.

[02:07:56.970 --> 02:07:57.090]
Bye.

[02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:59.370]
Well, congratulations, Mr. Kane.

[02:07:59.570 --> 02:08:00.330]
We've done it again.

[02:08:01.710 --> 02:08:02.830]
A miracle, okay.

[02:08:03.190 --> 02:08:04.990]
I did what I missed later, I'll send it.

[02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:06.910]
You know, I get...

[02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:08.130]
I am so upset with you.

[02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:09.730]
I give you your number so many times.

[02:08:10.070 --> 02:08:10.850]
I give it...

[02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:12.070]
And always, I give it.

[02:08:12.070 --> 02:08:12.610]
What's over?

[02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:14.190]
Oh, excuses.

[02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:17.070]
When a book comes out, you don't have time to be running around.

[02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:18.110]
It's a priority.

[02:08:18.570 --> 02:08:19.010]
Please, though.

[02:08:19.250 --> 02:08:19.510]
Come on.

[02:08:19.710 --> 02:08:19.930]
Get it.

[02:08:20.050 --> 02:08:21.130]
25 to 54.

[02:08:21.530 --> 02:08:22.750]
WIOD, the Steve Kane show.

[02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:26.070]
Number three in a market with a five five, your highest ever.

[02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:28.390]
In 25 to 54.

[02:08:29.190 --> 02:08:31.070]
Alice, not on the second page.

[02:08:32.770 --> 02:08:37.390]
Barely made it to the third page at the very bottom with a one-sixth, his lowest ever.

[02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:41.530]
So like three and a half times, his 25 to 54 number.

[02:08:41.670 --> 02:08:46.090]
And of course, in 12 plus any afternoon, you had a four-seven, which I think is your highest number ever.

[02:08:46.630 --> 02:08:47.630]
And Alice had a three.

[02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:50.110]
So he's right on the edge of dipping into the twos.

[02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:51.450]
How about 60 five?

[02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:54.550]
Well, the interesting part of it is, now listen to that.

[02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:56.030]
You're joking, but three.

[02:08:56.570 --> 02:09:00.790]
See, when the 35 to 64 scheme, and I said, finally something Dennis Collins can get excited about.

[02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:03.350]
But unfortunately, it just didn't materialize.

[02:09:04.690 --> 02:09:05.630]
Well, you know what that means.

[02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:07.330]
That means you're all 65 plus.

[02:09:07.530 --> 02:09:10.270]
Yeah, 35 to 64, for example, what do we have?

[02:09:10.330 --> 02:09:11.530]
We had a seven eight and midday.

[02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:12.590]
Sandy.

[02:09:13.170 --> 02:09:14.110]
Oh, Sandy, man.

[02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:16.070]
She just disappeared from the face of the earth.

[02:09:16.090 --> 02:09:17.550]
She's not even on the third page.

[02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:20.070]
Sandy, are you on here at all?

[02:09:20.070 --> 02:09:20.970]
Let me look again.

[02:09:20.990 --> 02:09:21.570]
That was unfair.

[02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:22.090]
Sandy.

[02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:23.950]
35 to 64.

[02:09:24.150 --> 02:09:24.950]
So we had a seven eight.

[02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:26.210]
Sandy had a two five.

[02:09:27.670 --> 02:09:29.130]
You had a five seven.

[02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:33.030]
And Alice had not on the second page.

[02:09:33.110 --> 02:09:33.850]
A two two.

[02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:34.810]
Two two.

[02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:36.430]
35 to 64.

[02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:40.830]
So obviously, virtually all of their audiences over 65.

[02:09:41.370 --> 02:09:43.930]
What little they got, because they've only got, what do they have a three one?

[02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:44.910]
We had a five one.

[02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:46.490]
They had a three two and wins out of three one.

[02:09:46.490 --> 02:09:51.070]
But like, it's not just the 12 plus numbers don't aren't sufficient to give the story.

[02:09:51.170 --> 02:09:54.830]
The real story is when you break down the demographics, they got nothing 18 to 34.

[02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:56.470]
They got very little 25 to 54.

[02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:58.710]
And even 35 to 64, they've gone way down.

[02:09:59.190 --> 02:10:01.050]
Their audience is getting older by the minute.

[02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.770]
Okay.

[02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:06.810]
So when they start giving out that five or one, you know that they know their audience, all right?

[02:10:07.130 --> 02:10:09.850]
Did you say Alice had a two two?

[02:10:10.210 --> 02:10:10.750]
A two two.

[02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:13.770]
He's going to be, he's going to be wearing it this afternoon.

[02:10:13.770 --> 02:10:17.090]
Hi everybody, this is safety office of Mike Tyson, heavyweight champion of the world.

[02:10:17.110 --> 02:10:17.910]
You're bad as dude around.

[02:10:18.130 --> 02:10:20.830]
The baddest driver around too, with your driving tip of the day.

[02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:24.610]
A few months ago, I was in the K-Mart with my ex-wife, Robin Gibbons.

[02:10:24.730 --> 02:10:25.310]
I can't believe it.

[02:10:25.710 --> 02:10:26.870]
Maybe you read about her in the papers.

[02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:31.350]
Anyway, she buys me one of these cute little garfields of cats with suction cup feet,

[02:10:31.530 --> 02:10:33.770]
which takes stuck on the window in my car when we left the store.

[02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:36.010]
On the way home, I drove into a tree.

[02:10:36.130 --> 02:10:36.770]
I can't believe it.

[02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:38.070]
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

[02:10:38.250 --> 02:10:40.490]
I couldn't see the tree because the damn cat was in my way.

[02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:44.030]
Robin said that I was stupid as to garfield on the windshield.

[02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:46.490]
I mean, that's really bitchy to me.

[02:10:46.570 --> 02:10:48.370]
I mean, call the heavyweight champion the world stupid?

[02:10:48.810 --> 02:10:49.410]
Now that's stupid.

[02:10:49.690 --> 02:10:51.890]
So I faked Robin, I left it.

[02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:54.510]
I took her out with a clean right hand, knocked her right down completely.

[02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:56.410]
First, a standing account.

[02:10:56.630 --> 02:10:57.110]
I couldn't believe it.

[02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:58.510]
Maybe you read about that in the papers.

[02:10:58.670 --> 02:11:01.710]
Anyway, my attitude toward Garfield the cat has really been affected greatly.

[02:11:02.150 --> 02:11:05.370]
In fact, if I see you driving around with Garfield the cat in your car,

[02:11:05.530 --> 02:11:06.750]
I may lose complete control.

[02:11:06.990 --> 02:11:07.770]
I don't know what will happen.

[02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:09.530]
Maybe you'll read about that in the papers too.

[02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:10.690]
All right, and just try to relax.

[02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:14.530]
Would you please, 132 at W.O.D., all these rumors flying back and forth.

[02:11:15.110 --> 02:11:15.110]

[02:11:15.110 --> 02:11:15.970]
While rumors are there.

[02:11:15.970 --> 02:11:18.590]
Indeed today, sex surrogates and other sex show, that's what we love.

[02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:20.730]
Don't get much, but we love it.

[02:11:20.970 --> 02:11:22.890]
Therapist or prostitute, sex surrogates.

[02:11:23.230 --> 02:11:25.970]
And I hate to say this because I like Marilyn Volker.

[02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:27.230]
She's a very, very nice lady.

[02:11:27.370 --> 02:11:30.630]
But I just, I watched that on TV, you know, on the really intellectual shows like Heraldo.

[02:11:31.330 --> 02:11:33.670]
And I got to, I don't buy it, you know.

[02:11:34.630 --> 02:11:35.550]
You don't buy what?

[02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:37.490]
Well, they're not selling it to me.

[02:11:37.490 --> 02:11:38.810]
But I've got the whole thing there.

[02:11:38.850 --> 02:11:40.390]
I mean, it's like prostitution.

[02:11:40.610 --> 02:11:41.030]
It is?

[02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:41.690]
Yes.

[02:11:42.410 --> 02:11:42.990]
Oh, no, no.

[02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:43.390]
It is.

[02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:44.330]
I haven't decided.

[02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:45.230]
Yeah, I ought to hear.

[02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:45.530]
Will you?

[02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:48.610]
I have to say how old was it to the show?

[02:11:48.690 --> 02:11:50.510]
Do we have any calls about Amsterdam, by the way?

[02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:52.310]
Are the people there really as ugly as I think they are?

[02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:54.350]
We don't have one stinkin' call about that, did we?

[02:11:55.770 --> 02:11:56.490]
Oh, man.

[02:11:56.630 --> 02:11:58.210]
You know, we could have a 97 share in it.

[02:11:58.270 --> 02:12:00.330]
We would not talk about anything that we talk about.

[02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:04.690]
Anyway, by the way, amazingly enough, they're getting incredible response

[02:12:04.690 --> 02:12:07.310]
on the Stanley Cup contested sports channel of Florida,

[02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:10.430]
even with that long convoluted address, which shocks the daylight settlement.

[02:12:11.190 --> 02:12:18.990]
If you liked Fly, the movie, fly the rebate, fly to the sequel,

[02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:26.130]
your love, the album, fly, and the family stone.

[02:12:26.570 --> 02:12:28.030]
It's a family affair.

[02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:32.650]
That's why I'm going this home.

[02:12:33.330 --> 02:12:37.610]
I want to thank you for letting me be fly, so,

[02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:42.950]
but it's not fun in the summer time, too many old testers.

[02:12:42.970 --> 02:12:48.530]
The album, fly, and the family stone.

[02:12:49.650 --> 02:12:51.430]
Let's prove the music.

[02:12:52.050 --> 02:12:52.810]
Get it today.

[02:12:53.290 --> 02:12:55.050]
Let's prove the music.

[02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:56.150]
Take it home.

[02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:58.650]
Let's prove the music.

[02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:59.650]
And get a buzzard.

[02:13:04.350 --> 02:13:04.850]
Oh, yeah.

[02:13:05.290 --> 02:13:08.330]
Well, we're right in the middle again of a real intensive thing here,

[02:13:08.490 --> 02:13:09.630]
and that stuff runs out.

[02:13:10.330 --> 02:13:11.950]
I got to make those bits a little bit longer.

[02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:13.030]
I did do that.

[02:13:13.330 --> 02:13:14.270]
Yeah, I took care of it.

[02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:15.150]
Well, take care of it again.

[02:13:16.190 --> 02:13:16.670]
137 at WIOD.

[02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:18.670]
It's a little ratings party here.

[02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:21.170]
Everybody's just celebrating AMFMPM,

[02:13:21.490 --> 02:13:22.670]
and they're even having a big beat.

[02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:23.710]
I'm off the front of the building.

[02:13:23.810 --> 02:13:24.490]
That's about time.

[02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:25.850]
Lauderdale Lakes.

[02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:26.130]
Hello.

[02:13:26.770 --> 02:13:27.590]
Congratulations, Neil.

[02:13:27.730 --> 02:13:28.710]
Thank you so much, sir.

[02:13:28.710 --> 02:13:32.470]
I got a Morton Downey Jr. spy report just came over the news.

[02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.770]
Yeah.

[02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:33.830]
Can I get a drum roll?

[02:13:34.190 --> 02:13:34.550]
Wait a minute.

[02:13:34.710 --> 02:13:35.090]
Oh, boy.

[02:13:35.150 --> 02:13:36.370]
Now they're asking for drum rolls.

[02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:37.190]
What a maniac.

[02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:39.830]
Well, just a second here.

[02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.970]
We might be able to do it.

[02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:41.490]
I wouldn't bet.

[02:13:47.810 --> 02:13:48.210]
Yeah.

[02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:50.550]
Today in a Los Angeles County airport,

[02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:52.990]
Morton Downey Jr. went into the men's room,

[02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:55.790]
and was thrown down by three young punks.

[02:13:55.790 --> 02:13:59.590]
His hair was cut, and they painted a swatsook on his face.

[02:14:00.290 --> 02:14:01.790]
Just another routine day for Morton.

[02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.750]

[02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:03.290]
Yeah.

[02:14:03.850 --> 02:14:05.950]
Does everybody in the business is listening today?

[02:14:06.150 --> 02:14:08.110]
Can I do a I-95 audition?

[02:14:08.370 --> 02:14:09.470]
Okay, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.850]
All right.

[02:14:10.110 --> 02:14:10.630]
First one.

[02:14:11.070 --> 02:14:12.510]
I-95.

[02:14:13.390 --> 02:14:13.850]
Not bad?

[02:14:14.490 --> 02:14:15.290]
Not bad.

[02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.430]

[02:14:15.550 --> 02:14:17.190]
I'll give your name a number to Rose, okay?

[02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:17.810]
Thank you very much.

[02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:19.550]
See, although that only knows where Rose is.

[02:14:21.310 --> 02:14:21.710]
Wow.

[02:14:22.450 --> 02:14:22.990]
Poor Rose.

[02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:24.090]
What's he going to do now?

[02:14:24.090 --> 02:14:25.570]
He bought a house at town.

[02:14:25.570 --> 02:14:26.410]
How do you tell them not to do that?

[02:14:26.410 --> 02:14:27.010]
I told them not to do that.

[02:14:27.010 --> 02:14:28.770]
I told them not to buy a house, especially with your track record.

[02:14:28.990 --> 02:14:29.230]
Yeah.

[02:14:31.210 --> 02:14:32.810]
It doesn't have to be old and be a clown.

[02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:33.410]
Yeah.

[02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:35.390]
You know what we ought to do now?

[02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:37.130]
We ought to play as something in honor of Rose.

[02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:38.030]
What is it called?

[02:14:39.230 --> 02:14:40.190]
Oh, I know what it's called.

[02:14:40.250 --> 02:14:41.190]
It's in the rack here, too.

[02:14:41.290 --> 02:14:43.790]
Now, seriously, this is going to be so perfect for this day.

[02:14:44.230 --> 02:14:44.850]
Here it is.

[02:14:45.590 --> 02:14:47.710]
And we know that Rose is probably monitoring right now.

[02:14:47.710 --> 02:14:49.990]
I'm going to see all the disgusting things we're going to say about them,

[02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.810]
even if they are true.

[02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:54.470]
Excellent.

[02:14:55.110 --> 02:14:59.090]
Peter Bouldier was a normal man with a new bride, a lovely home,

[02:14:59.390 --> 02:15:01.470]
and a cushy, local, final job.

[02:15:02.230 --> 02:15:05.650]
Normal, that is, until just three weeks ago.

[02:15:06.650 --> 02:15:07.990]
Peter, is that you?

[02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:09.290]
Of course.

[02:15:10.130 --> 02:15:11.030]
How is the traffic?

[02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:13.210]
It's fine.

[02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:18.770]
Peter Bouldier is suffering from blend, hill, busy names.

[02:15:18.770 --> 02:15:21.170]
Our crime sense is the revoked, Peter.

[02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:23.670]
Are you okay, Peter?

[02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:24.890]
Fine.

[02:15:25.530 --> 02:15:26.470]
Everything's good.

[02:15:28.530 --> 02:15:29.470]
Just great.

[02:15:30.230 --> 02:15:35.590]
Blame-Hill disease is a nervous disorder, similar to Neil Rogers' disease,

[02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:37.810]
but even more debilitating.

[02:15:38.710 --> 02:15:39.950]
Pety, weedy.

[02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:41.130]
It's Friday night.

[02:15:41.290 --> 02:15:42.430]
You know what that means.

[02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:44.590]
What are we calling Mr. Curious?

[02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:47.590]
Oh, God, are you a man or a bird?

[02:15:48.630 --> 02:15:51.690]
Don't let this pathetic creature become a bird, brain.

[02:15:52.190 --> 02:15:55.190]
Send your contribution today and help us find a cure.

[02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:56.350]
Oh, don't do that.

[02:15:56.970 --> 02:15:57.770]
Why not?

[02:15:58.130 --> 02:15:59.070]
We need the egg.

[02:16:00.590 --> 02:16:01.850]
Well, they surely need a big one over there.

[02:16:01.930 --> 02:16:02.390]
I'll tell you that.

[02:16:02.570 --> 02:16:04.790]
140 at WIOD, we have one open line.

[02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:07.170]
It's in Dayton County who want to get in for those last ten minutes,

[02:16:07.290 --> 02:16:09.030]
where we, you think we're using that buzzer?

[02:16:11.610 --> 02:16:12.410]
Oh, God.

[02:16:12.530 --> 02:16:16.350]
I want to tell you, seriously, if they opened up Mike Disney's head and boy Gary.

[02:16:17.210 --> 02:16:18.270]
On the same day.

[02:16:19.010 --> 02:16:20.410]
They had like twin operations.

[02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:23.490]
It would be the shock.

[02:16:23.590 --> 02:16:25.490]
Remember when Haraldor opened up Al Capone's vault?

[02:16:25.630 --> 02:16:27.830]
It would be similar without the bottle, okay?

[02:16:28.490 --> 02:16:29.210]
Similar finding.

[02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:32.090]
I said, you know, I hand what we scrape.

[02:16:32.370 --> 02:16:34.970]
When they say that's great, when they say that's great, when they say that's great,

[02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:38.110]
when they start understanding it, you start understanding it, you start understanding it,

[02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.610]
you're in trouble.

[02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:39.570]
Oh, you're in trouble.

[02:16:39.730 --> 02:16:40.490]
Oh, you're in trouble.

[02:16:40.670 --> 02:16:41.750]
Oh, good point.

[02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:43.510]
Because if we start relating to them,

[02:16:44.170 --> 02:16:46.890]
we got a lot of pinheads out there, but at least they got an IQ of,

[02:16:46.890 --> 02:16:48.530]
in a plus, maybe only one or two.

[02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:50.450]
At least it's in the plus column.

[02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:51.190]
They don't owe points.

[02:16:51.690 --> 02:16:54.070]
Okay, here's some Amsterdam information on four.

[02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:55.290]
Hi.

[02:16:55.950 --> 02:16:58.050]
What would you like to know about the people in Amsterdam?

[02:16:58.050 --> 02:16:59.430]
I live near there for many years.

[02:16:59.490 --> 02:17:02.750]
Well, they don't look like burnt out hippies with beards and they don't look like something

[02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:03.790]
out of the sixties, do they?

[02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:06.090]
No, there's only the tourists you're talking about.

[02:17:07.290 --> 02:17:10.290]
You're around here, American Express, and they sit there on this,

[02:17:10.290 --> 02:17:12.450]
whatever the statue is that we're gotten by now,

[02:17:12.450 --> 02:17:13.890]
and they wait for money from home.

[02:17:13.890 --> 02:17:17.530]
They're trying to find themselves, but I don't think they've had any hope.

[02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:17.850]
Yeah.

[02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:20.350]
But the women look like men in Holland.

[02:17:22.310 --> 02:17:23.730]
Well, I could be a little dangerous here.

[02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:26.770]
They always have a wonderful stalker team.

[02:17:27.010 --> 02:17:30.490]
I must say, the Dutch football team.

[02:17:30.510 --> 02:17:31.070]
You mean the women?

[02:17:31.530 --> 02:17:32.110]
No, no, no.

[02:17:32.130 --> 02:17:36.530]
Today, I don't know what the women do, but they make me, bulls, you know, things like that.

[02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:42.430]
And they have a lot of Indonesian food in them.

[02:17:42.530 --> 02:17:43.450]
Yeah, I read about that.

[02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:44.650]
It sounds pretty good, too, huh?

[02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:47.270]
Well, there are also some beautiful hotels there.

[02:17:47.370 --> 02:17:49.670]
Now the most gracious one there is the Amps.

[02:17:49.710 --> 02:17:51.210]
It's all right on the Amps, the river.

[02:17:51.510 --> 02:17:51.750]
Uh-huh.

[02:17:52.090 --> 02:17:57.690]
And if you know what a adult world hotels with a birch-cage elevator and a bad friend

[02:17:57.690 --> 02:17:58.810]
who will the birds go up in it.

[02:17:59.750 --> 02:18:03.770]
But it's a nice place and everybody goes, you're not too bad.

[02:18:03.770 --> 02:18:06.450]
The most wonderful museum in the world you'll find in Amsterdam.

[02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:06.870]
Great.

[02:18:07.010 --> 02:18:07.710]
And then it writes museums.

[02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:10.190]
Well, we got a lot of relics here, though, too, you know.

[02:18:10.350 --> 02:18:11.990]
I know, but I'm a relic, too.

[02:18:12.130 --> 02:18:12.490]
What can I do?

[02:18:12.490 --> 02:18:13.130]
Well, that's all right.

[02:18:13.210 --> 02:18:13.890]
We all hope to be.

[02:18:13.930 --> 02:18:15.570]
But I'm a swinging relic.

[02:18:15.690 --> 02:18:16.390]
Well, that's what counts.

[02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:17.230]
Yeah, listen to me.

[02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:18.410]
So in other words, you like it, right?

[02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:20.250]
Because I'm not 100 percent, you know.

[02:18:20.290 --> 02:18:21.130]
100 percent of what?

[02:18:21.290 --> 02:18:21.750]
Amps, damn.

[02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:23.190]
I'm not 100 percent sure where I'm going.

[02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:25.910]
Oh, well, I lived in Europe for 15 years.

[02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.730]
I'll leave my number.

[02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:27.170]
Call me.

[02:18:27.210 --> 02:18:28.210]
I can tell you where to go.

[02:18:28.530 --> 02:18:30.330]
Well, listen, I don't have to call you.

[02:18:30.330 --> 02:18:31.870]
A lot of people tell me where to go every day.

[02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:33.950]
Yeah, well, that's a different place.

[02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:34.250]

[02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:35.670]
Well, probably post-pilot.

[02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:35.950]
West.

[02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:40.410]
Do they rate any of the weekend talks show hosts?

[02:18:41.610 --> 02:18:43.510]
For some reason, they didn't give me the weekends.

[02:18:43.650 --> 02:18:44.790]
And I think I know why.

[02:18:44.890 --> 02:18:45.270]
Mine.

[02:18:45.390 --> 02:18:47.230]
Because the weekends here were pretty disastrous.

[02:18:47.370 --> 02:18:49.250]
But I don't have any numbers for the weekend.

[02:18:49.450 --> 02:18:51.730]
When a whole book comes in in a few days, we'll have that.

[02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:53.390]
Yeah, I want to ask you something else.

[02:18:53.550 --> 02:18:54.730]
What do they rate, Craig?

[02:18:55.770 --> 02:18:57.270]
They don't have ratings for overnight.

[02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:58.330]
Oh, they don't.

[02:18:58.490 --> 02:19:00.550]
They just tap them for the morning drive time.

[02:19:00.650 --> 02:19:01.490]
Still one in the morning.

[02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:04.310]
And well, from five in the morning to one in the morning.

[02:19:04.450 --> 02:19:07.330]
Yeah, well, anyway, I think I'm going to tune in to you from now on.

[02:19:07.330 --> 02:19:08.210]
You've got a live leap.

[02:19:08.470 --> 02:19:11.010]
If you don't mind having somebody that's beyond 35.

[02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:12.170]
Hey, listen, we'll take anybody.

[02:19:12.630 --> 02:19:13.750]
Oh, yeah, gee, thanks.

[02:19:13.930 --> 02:19:15.410]
No, I don't mean it that way.

[02:19:15.610 --> 02:19:16.490]
I mean, as long as you're...

[02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:19.470]
As long as you're breathing, and you got a sense of humor, that's all.

[02:19:19.470 --> 02:19:20.650]
I have a great sense of humor.

[02:19:20.650 --> 02:19:22.750]
Believe me, some of our people stopped breathing years ago.

[02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:24.290]
Yeah, well, I breathe occasionally.

[02:19:24.630 --> 02:19:24.910]
Okay.

[02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:27.310]
Listen, you know, I recommend you to listen to you.

[02:19:27.370 --> 02:19:30.710]
I can't give his name, but with the talk show host from another station.

[02:19:30.710 --> 02:19:31.830]
Well, sure you can give his name.

[02:19:32.010 --> 02:19:35.410]
No, I really can't do that, because he's just fighting to hold on.

[02:19:35.490 --> 02:19:35.910]
Oh, okay.

[02:19:36.170 --> 02:19:37.470]
Yeah, okay. Good luck now.

[02:19:37.470 --> 02:19:38.170]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[02:19:38.310 --> 02:19:39.630]
I appreciate the information.

[02:19:39.810 --> 02:19:39.930]
Bye-bye.

[02:19:40.030 --> 02:19:40.030]

[02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:42.830]
Okay, we have a sizzling call, ladies and gentlemen, on the hotline.

[02:19:43.510 --> 02:19:43.890]
Hi, Neil.

[02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:47.990]
It's Phil, Frantic Saltsman from Haley, I'll see you for the hotline.

[02:19:48.130 --> 02:19:48.130]

[02:19:48.550 --> 02:19:49.470]
So much going on.
