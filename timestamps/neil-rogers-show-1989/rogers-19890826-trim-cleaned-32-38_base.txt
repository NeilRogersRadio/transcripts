[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.220]
Okay, that was great. 5.60 W2 AM, I'm Bill Calder and nice to be with you this morning.

[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.960]
Hope everybody's okay and we're going to go right to the phone.

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.180]
We've got some calls on hold. I can't believe it. It's wonderful.

[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.640]
I'm online one. What do we have a surprise? Calder? Is that what they said?

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.160]
Oh boy. Keep your hand on the dump button.

[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.660]
Steve, Steve, read my lips. Keep your hand on the dump button. Good boy.

[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.640]
Hello. Hello. Hello. Good morning, Bill. Good morning. How are you?

[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.020]
Fine, thank you. Bill? Yes. How's New Orleans? How is it? How far is New Orleans?

[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.660]
How is New Orleans? Yes. Phil Kabasi. Oh? Hello. Phil Kabasi. What's that?

[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.360]
Okay, well, I just take it a guess. Okay, could you put me in hold?

[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.820]
Would you hold? Yes. What do you want to hear the show? No, no. I have a radio. That's what it's for.

[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.560]
Who is this? Oh, come on, Bill. Wake up. Do you know who it is, Steve? You don't know. Okay.

[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.540]
I'll wait for you while you play a song. You wait for me while I play a song? Play a song, please. I sing one.

[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.680]
No, I can't. I won't be able to talk. You mean off the air? Yes.

[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:33.040]
No, I can't do that. Oh, yes, you can. Bill? What? Well, Bill, Bill. Yes, you. Bill, Bill.

[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.020]
I wrote you a letter while you were playing in New Orleans. You wrote me a letter while I was in New Orleans? Yes.

[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.980]
I'm on work. I'm on, I'm on leave. Intent. You're on leave? Yes. What, like a work release program? No, no, no.

[00:01:49.980 --> 00:02:00.980]
A vacation. From where? From the Middle East. There you go. Well, I am really...

[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:19.960]
Are you still don't know? No, I do. Come on, call her. Hey, listen, I'll just...

[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.360]
Okay, now have you got it? No. You're still don't know. I have no idea who it is. No, you're kidding me, of course.

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.020]
Yeah, give you a clue. You already give you another clue because I'm sure we're boring. You're...

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.860]
You're... You're many listeners. All that... That's seven of them?

[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.500]
Hello. I'm going to hang up on you if you're going to do that to me. If you don't embarrass me.

[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.120]
No, I'm not trying to embarrass you. Oh my God, I don't believe this. There you go.

[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.520]
Oh, I hope Neal is listening. No, he's not listening. Where is he at? Where is he at?

[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.200]
Oh my God. He doesn't know I'm reformed. So that's the whole thing I called him up yesterday and he was totally out of it.

[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.620]
Did he hang up on you? No, he didn't hang up on me. I said, what am I coming to visit?

[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.440]
Does that plant to visit him? Whether he likes it or not. Oh my God.

[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.980]
How do I get to QAM to say hello before I leave? Where are you going? I'm leaving on the 12th of September.

[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.660]
Well, we can't have any visitor. We're not set up for visitors until after the 13th.

[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.320]
Ah, that's funny. That's a good one. How do I sound?

[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.580]
You sound wonderful in the music because even better.

[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.580]
This is... Isn't this weird? Don't give your name.

[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.680]
No, I don't. Please don't say who this is either. I wouldn't... I wouldn't even attempt to...

[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.200]
That's right. I've backed up. Well, that's incredible. Are you going to come by and see me someday?

[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.440]
Yes, I want to do that. I want to have a chance to because I haven't and like how long have I been... been... been...

[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.280]
...busing your show for? Yes, and yes. Yes.

[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.760]
...on believable. Yes, and yes. Ever since you were all over the place.

[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.400]
Did you get... Did you get on Neal's show? Yeah, but took it. It took too long, too long.

[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.260]
And what did he do? Hang up on you? No, he didn't hang up on me. I said hello, Neal.

[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.300]
I want you to... Did he recognize your voice? Yes, after... after... Well, it's... I started out like Minan.

[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.940]
I said hello, Neal. I said, how are you? And he says, well, by the sound of this cause getting kind of boring.

[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.360]
I go, well, that's because he don't know if you don't recognize the voice. He goes, oh, it sounds like somebody from Kendall.

[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.640]
Oh, I said right. I said, one, can I visit? And he says, never. I said, why not?

[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.040]
And he goes, the voice has changed. What have they done? How it's made giving you an operation? Yeah, that's right. That's what I was going to say, man.

[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.960]
No, you want to say that? No, he's already said it. I don't want to write on his cotail.

[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.220]
All right, listen, I got to run. Call me now, okay? I will. Okay, there he goes.

[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.440]
Miss Freakolor. Well, Roger's here as that. I'm going to be in so much trouble. But he put him on the air. What the hell?

[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.360]
Chris, okay, you're on WQAM. Chris. Yes, good morning, Bill. QAM welcomes you with open arms.

[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:11.380]
Oh, well, that's so nice of you. Well, we, we go a step further. As a matter of fact, where am I at the coffee or?

[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.120]
Thank you.

[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.900]
Oh, okay. All right. Okay. Listen, Bill, what time are you going to be at the base tonight tomorrow?

[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.440]
From a guy who has been booked to sing, oh, promise me in Lithuanian at Larry King's wedding.

[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.780]
A guy called us from West Palm Beach. His name is Larry Barronov.

[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.700]
For Hoki football. That was an incredible call. I wish everybody could have heard it.

[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.900]
But listen, you can't, you can't, if you just have to go with what you have, right? Okay.

[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.120]
Now, Bob Harnes just standing by.

[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.660]
Now, I'm, you know, I'm putting this stuff in there. I'm taking my life in my hands. I'm putting this in a machine without having heard it.

[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.960]
The birds of wire. The birds of wire.

[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.920]
Okay. 10.07 at WID. Yeah, the bird is really making noise. I'll tell you that.

[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.160]
I got a couple of calls at home yesterday. A couple of frantic calls with some more bird spottings and sightings.

[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.660]
And what can I say? What can I tell you? Anyway, Alex Bennett is going to be here next week to do this show.

[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.960]
I have no idea who that is. Everybody else in a business seems to know who that is.

[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.480]
Okay. So he must be very famous and really great.

[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.520]
And he got fired at KITS in San Francisco. And it says his sudden departure from kids has caused quite a stir in the market, et cetera, et cetera.

[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.680]
So he's going to be here next week with the bird. I understand. And then of course, when I come back the following week, then we'll take care of that problem.

[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.500]
Okay. Anyway, it's 10.07 at WID. A Michael Putney of Channel 4. We certainly want to waste good luck too.

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.960]
Heidi overpaid a great guy, but evidently very much overpaid. I want to say it.

[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.700]
I don't give any numbers in here. Well, Steve will probably come on and tell you how much Michael is going to make.

[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.300]
Steve likes to talk about how much people in the business are making. But Michael Putney is going to Channel 10.

[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.380]
And it's kind of like what they do over at WS News. I'm not trying to relate to talent because that would be a shot at Michael.

[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:19.280]
But I'm just talking to these revolving chairs that they've got in the market. How one day, one guy is one station and one anchor woman is another.

[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.240]
And they just keep revolving around and around like a deck of cards.

[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.240]
So Michael's going over to be an anchor, I guess, at Channel 10 in February, no less.

[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.320]
This is only August, still. He's going there in February. I wonder what that means.

[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.180]
Is he still going to be on four between now and then? And every time you look on there, you're going to think you're watching Channel 10.

[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.500]
I heard all about Larry Barron office morning on the Build Calder Show and I was just driving off the road.

[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:49.020]
Nobody understands what that means except me. So I'm glad that the bill has got somebody in the audience who's understanding

[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:56.300]
that some of that bizarre humor that was I just about when I also heard a call on that show this morning.

[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:04.320]
You know, it takes more than just changing your voice. Okay. This is a little message to one of our friends in Kendall who called here yesterday.

[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.040]
And is back briefly we hope it takes more than just changing your voice to show a, you know, a certain degree of maturity.

[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:18.700]
One of the things that certainly would help would be kind of diminishing your obsession with radio and with radio personalities and with being a groupie and call...

[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:25.440]
I mean, that was such a boring call this morning that I can hear it was almost as bad as Bob Martin. Okay. Same genre, I think.

[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.440]
But what can I say? Okay. Nine minutes after 10. We're here to kill four hours before I go on vacation again.

[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.700]
And then Steve has got open phones this afternoon and we have...

[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.360]
Oh, I didn't even realize we got the game tonight. This is really bizarre. I didn't even realize that.

[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.700]
We must not have done a great job of promoting it this week because I didn't know about that. The Dolphin Express had six.

[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:55.120]
And the special multi-hour NFL edition of Sports Talk following the game. The Dolphins at the Redskins with kickoff at eight o'clock.

[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:25.100]
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:59.220]
seen you well yeah I bet there's a reason Alex Bennett's going to be here next

[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.880]
week to work with you yes I know but that's not what I came by to talk about

[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.280]

hi it really is I re-writied

[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.940]
hmm one of the legends in the market that's correct now they said that one of

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.260]
your complaints maybe the biggest complaint this is what the main thrust of what

[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:57.640]
they finally told me was that I did not attend the remote on Wednesday is this

[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.640]
the all I want because this was the week that you were going to be gone and you had

[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.840]

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.240]
years about what about what about the fact that you first of all when we went to

[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.160]
Chicago you give him a lot of crap about that and then this week when we had

[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.380]
that big thing at the bizarre where we had a great turnout even without you it was

[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.940]

with Yolanda remember her in March I remember Yolanda that got squeezed out so that

[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.720]
boy Gary could bring his body in March and also who had I picked the memos in

[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.780]
out two weeks which could have been one of the I picked things in the history of broadcast

[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:11.780]
yes I really tacky in March I picked two weeks out of a hat at random you picked him out

[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:18.320]
of a hat virtually wrong would you like me to tell the true story about this I picked the weeks

[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.060]
that I was going okay as usual the week following when I go okay that's correct correct in two

[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:30.100]
of my three vacations thanks in part to the sales department and also thanks in part to the lawyers

[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:38.300]
in the courts and all this ongoing insanity with the as a friend um I changed two of the three weeks

[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:44.000]
my week stayed the weeks I picked in March stayed now the first week so in other words you can't

[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.960]
change is that what you're saying don't saying that there was no reason to say I mean if you can't

[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:54.460]
change no one asked me to change they didn't ask you about going to Chicago no they asked well he told

[00:14:54.460 --> 00:15:00.340]
me about the remote the birds of Lyre I went home I checked the dates I went back and I said I'm

[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:06.820]
going to be gone on vacation they said fine now that Chicago remote was decided the date on while

[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:12.080]
you were in Europe I picked this week in March now this week they they said they came to me and they

[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:18.560]
said we have a remote August whatever it was I went home I checked twenty-eighths twenty-third I

[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.200]
went home I checked the dates and I I should have brought the paper and you were over at magic

[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:28.080]
schmuzing around with Joe Johnson no it was not that day was the day before I was at magic oh the day

[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.760]
were at power 96 same day schmuzing around to some radio yentos over there yeah I stopped by to

[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.320]
visit some friends I thought it was okay I thought it was allowed in this station you were on

[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.880]
another station which even made it's like I'm working rubbing salt into the wound no it isn't

[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:49.360]
something it was my vacation related to I wasn't working it was my vacation I always did now you

[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:56.580]
told me something in June and if you rack your memory you may remember you told me the birds of

[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:03.360]
Lyre that when I go on vacation I should go and I should forget about work and I should have a

[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:11.380]
wonderful time I shouldn't worry about anything so that's what I did this week I went I had a

[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.980]
wonderful time I totally forgot about w i o d which is what you told me to do I did not even

[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:22.380]
realize it was Wednesday you want another truth I did not think anything about work you

[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.440]
didn't realize what was when I didn't even realize it was Wednesday or there was any room I didn't

[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.680]
think about this place I I did not listen to the show I've been out of touch I did what you

[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:44.200]
told me to do I went on my vacation and now because I do what you do I hear that you're on

[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.600]
the you're saying horrible things about not horrible things true things what true things that you

[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:56.960]
shine this again when we desperately needed you to be there we have a part of the show you

[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.200]
shine this and shows rather I mean if you'd have been over in Marco enjoying the sunshine and

[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.560]
relaxing and being oblivious to what's going on anybody could understand that anybody could relate

[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:13.840]
to that I I did not think here like within a stone's throw I was in Kendall's are I was in

[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.560]
Kendall I'm gonna go oh I'm gonna go to Fort Lauderdale and work on my vacation week do you do

[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.120]
that kind of thing on your vacation week but sometimes for example the reason I didn't take

[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.100]
two weeks to go off was because of the litigation that's going on to go to court the reason I didn't

[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:34.360]
take this week off was because we had the remote no the bizarre nobody said anything to me about

[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.780]
let me say it again now could I have taken this week off when we had a remote that we had signed up

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:46.340]
weeks and weeks ago could we have done that we could I have done that your show so I could have just

[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.660]
shine those nice people over there at the bizarre we had a great turnout the people who run a

[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.640]
place are great and little Tommy Dennenberg we sure wouldn't want to ruffle his feathers isn't

[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.220]
the copy say you're going to do your show from the bizarre and it said not one word about me not

[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:09.540]
one more is because you'd already planned this in cityists act in subordination there's a

[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:15.520]
trocity of in subordination yeah well I want to talk more about it well after we talk about Toyota

[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.880]
of Hollywood where he also was in subordinate that was treated many of the people in our wonderful

[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.320]
proud ones time like some kind of subhuman do kind of the same way he treated Jim Skyler who used

[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.860]
to be at hot 105 you're now you're right about that and Z2 summers ago and that's correct and

[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:38.060]
shine and just turning his back and treating him just like some kind of sewer rat but anyway

[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.060]
one thing about the bird at least he's consistent he may not be good but he's consistent and

[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.560]
they're consistent at Toyota of Hollywood and giving you the best deals in town and this weekend be

[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.680]
a good time for you to get your little fanny over there and check out the incredibly low prices

[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.600]
on those beautiful new 89 Toyota's you know that air v dealer in the country right now

[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.660]
is telling folks and honestly in fact some of the dealers it's the first honest thing they've said

[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.620]
for years but with Toyota of Hollywood they don't play those kind of games but the bottom line is

[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.860]
they all have to move out the 89's that they have on the lot to make room for the 1990s that are

[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.760]
coming in a just a matter of weeks so you're going to find prices slashed you'll find the same

[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.960]
great service and the same great folks to do business with and right across the street a course

[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.520]
over on the west side of 441 you'll find a tremendous election of really great reconditioned

[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.460]
used cars too it's all waiting for you at Toyota of Hollywood the southeast number one Toyota dealer

[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.940]
and you'll find them at 1841 North State Road 7 in Hollywood

[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.760]
what is this from is this from the oh it's from the sun sentinel that somebody just thanks to us

[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.340]
oh look at this here's another great fact it says the donut guy is not one person but two

[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:55.380]
David X manager of the bird road donut store and Tom fired from the Tammy Amy trail store

[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.560]
did you know that blanks has gone out I'm not going to mention your name is going out of business

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:06.580]
a few months now they've been out of business huh fascinating it's had so did this two other

[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:12.580]
places that were owned by the same company david is from Iowa and Tom from Miami and if they

[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.640]
didn't spend all day trying to call you their stores might still be in business anyway they're

[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:24.800]
both douchebags Tom once called the Steve King show and said oh geez I'm not going to repeat that

[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.540]
the donut stores are auctioned off today by a company appointed by the court

[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.820]
isn't that fascinating now I know why we never didn't fact rich though one time go into that donut place

[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.800]
I saw the guy calling remember and how long does it say that they've been out of business for a few

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.300]
months you know I guess that's possible sure the other thing is a want add a personal from the

that's that and I can tell you that's the lie I mean that's incredible well you have said

[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.880]
right in that chair over there what you don't dare to sit in today and said one ripped this man

an ass the likes of which I have so I don't just a lot of garbage no I have not oh trust me when he

[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:20.260]
was on that morning show at that unmechanable station about stealing ideas and oh just on didn't

[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:28.040]
we ever resolve doing those talkups that Johnny dark invented the idea come on let's cut the crap

[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:35.220]
but let's have a little bit of honesty here at least for a very I'm an honest person I don't lie

[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:41.020]
average said that the birds a liar I'm saying you were actually lying just that you get a lot of

[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.820]
misinformation in you in other words it's like the old thing about if you say something off

[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:51.200]
it enough you start to believe it no right that's the air that start believing your own BS that's true

[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.520]
yeah well I don't know what it is it's just that it's not a matter of lying it's just that you say

[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:05.200]
something and then you start to believe it's true and talk about it on the air and false of you just

[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.480]
exactly a hundred years from now nobody will give it damn right well I mean the fact that he was

[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.920]
in town he was supposed to be at Marko Island on vacation this week and he left me to do a remote

[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.440]
at the bizarre up in Fort Lauderdale all by myself on Wednesday which somehow I managed to squeak

[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:24.840]
through and meantime he was in town here smoothing around with his buddies over at magic I was on

[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:30.420]
the I was on vacation making the tour of the local radio studio now I visited a couple of

[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:36.060]
Johnny dark you know I visited a couple of friends with mobile Alabama and they visit broadcasting

[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:42.040]
studios you know no I have a talk about a disease I had to take you I had to take you Johnson

[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:54.120]
a videotape and Rick Peters was there and Yelton was there it's as plucked the bird oh

[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:59.460]
anyway I thought it was a glad you asked allowable I thought it was allowable on vacation when I

[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:04.100]
had some time Dave because I was in and out of town I wasn't in Marko as long as I planned to be

[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.620]
and I thought it was allowable to visit some friends when I had some time it's course not it's not

[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:14.340]
when you're in radio and I did not think I had to go to work while I was on vacation this is my big

[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.140]
crime now there's the fact that you're calling from Seattle boat well does this mean that you're working

[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.900]
oh yes oh well thank because I never heard from you again now I was at home a few nights ago

[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.760]
I was actually what happened just a minute now I was here in the daytime and Nick gave me a

[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.960]
message that the your manager of the station in Seattle had called and said if Capita calls you

[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.180]
meaning me give him this message and just by coincidence like some kind of a psychic vibration

[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.400]
that night I was watching the Cubs game or something and the low and behold here's Capita on the

[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.220]
phone and I gave him the message he sounded depressed he was hundreds of miles in the middle of nowhere

[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.000]
driving around aimlessly in the middle of the night wondering what the hell was life was going to be

[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.040]
in the middle of the night it was afternoon and Oregon well like I said I can lie with the

[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:04.260]
best of them too and anyway it's so weird to hear you guys on the radio doesn't it sound better

[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.520]
though you're driving around the middle of the night it's raining and your windshield wipers are

[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.360]
broken and you don't know whether to scream or eat a banana and all you get this message from me

[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.400]
and you call a guy and he gave you the job right it was it was it was real crazy I must admit that I

[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:25.980]
am patchlessly left pretty quickly and what was that that's my traffic person oh you're are you

[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:31.980]
on the air yeah 730 here but you're not on the year so anyway it's are you on the air yeah I'm

[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.540]
on the air I got to put you on hold for a second we got to do a break okay we'll write you too hold on

[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:45.800]
okay hold on oh see he won't put us on the air they're not ready for this show in Seattle okay we

[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.640]
have an open line in Palm Beach I have no idea why I'm saying that because we're never going to

[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.680]
get you on the air but I wanted to look good for our visitor in the studio 655 WIOD and we'll come

[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:09.580]
right back okay it's 1038 at WI these are celebrity caller back he's not back and see on the

[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:14.520]
air really to think or is he just probably calling in a phone booth he's got a couple of friends

[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.660]
standing outside you know making guttural sounds and making sounds of a helicopter for the traffic

[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.400]
you know trying to make it sound like he's working again I don't think he's working anyway Caprito

[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.800]
be back on the line any second we want to remind you of course so we don't want to forget about

[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.040]
that ball game that I cheese I wasn't even aware we know that the bird will be listening

[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:35.420]
uh-huh hanging on every word the dolphins had Washington oh and the boy my glad I'm not going to

i didn't like that part of it now it seems although that wasn't your fault that was tom dennenberg's fault

[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:45.300]
they because generally speaking he's a moron but they never i'm telling them when i came in this

[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:51.080]
morning he he or somebody had a big thing up there on a wall under the clock that said the cubs suck

[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:59.400]
it was not this is enough to make you speechless i would it was yeah it was not discussed with me

[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:06.500]
about postponing my vacation which i probably would have been open to if it had been brought up to me

[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:12.220]
how am i supposed to know this if it was well you have a lot of people who are a lot of

[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:16.700]
of vultures out there who are just gathering around preparing for your demise i'll tell you that

[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.240]
right now because i don't know because they hate your guts or something i don't have any i don't

[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.500]
have any knowledge of this i haven't done anything you are you must have done something because you

[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:31.180]
have a lot of people that are just ready to dance on your proverbial grave why i don't know you'd

[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:36.600]
have to ask fat re i mean have to ask some of these people who are just apoplectic with you just

[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:44.380]
to get tired of your people you know like fat like people you know he's upset with everybody's

[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.860]
upset with bill calder is upset with you i didn't do anything to him that riches upset with you

[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:54.920]
he's you like uh like like worse than management i think management of course is upset with you

[00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:01.800]
they think that you're just some kind of a uh total waste of space but other than that everybody's

[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:06.200]
okay you know what it seemed at the remote where you talk about the would have been sharing

[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:11.080]
sharing things that you ought to be boiled in oil is no question about that as he just walked

[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:16.520]
in there so i made it up i know i i could have been there to help at the remote it seems like

[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.760]
Alex Bennett boy is just foaming at the mouth wait till next week i'm sure glad i'm not going to be

[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:27.700]
here for that do you know who Alex Bennett is no i don't either everybody else seems to i have no

[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:32.900]
idea he just got fired in san francisco and he evidently does a real filthy show which is just

[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.880]
exactly what we need i think so i don't know what he does i really don't have to got any idea what he

[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:47.980]
does he's old he's about 182 good so you can relate to him mm-hmm it seems like i would have been

[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.820]
or you got a lot of calls here when we come back because you have a lot of risk and call in he's

[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.400]
got the bad one so if he wants to call in after the news and he would i would certainly be well

[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.580]
by looking i don't want to expose his uh confidentiality at all because he's a good guy but he's

[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:07.560]
also getting a little carried away and he's becoming a divisive and creating a lot of animosity and

[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:12.640]
getting the upset and hysterical yeah i think i just saw fort lotterdale on the list here somewhere

[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:21.400]
there is 113 up from 123 so it's not so bad Henry Barrow standing by the great uh expert on the

[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.000]
dolphins of course Henry is not going to be permitted to go with the team on the bus or even the

[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.860]
shower with the guys after the game and he's going to tell you why along with the 11 o'clock

[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.560]

delicious by the way some cold cuts and potato salad macaroni salad you're here to answer anyway

[00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.160]
there's a thing in the political people in the hero this morning on page two b about yesterday's

[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:07.900]
a steve had Xavier Cortata debating a Gerald Richmond and anyway it says a second would be surrogate

[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:14.640]
for Ross latinan dayd republican committee man Richard ciderman never got near the microphone

[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.520]
before Cortata arrived ciderman listened intently to Richmond solo interview with host Steve Kane

[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.740]
in case something has said that is totally erroneous in the building this is he was here in the building

[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:32.920]
mr ciderman okay ciderman state put despite repeated demands from w i would be executive producer

[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:38.020]
sure and mahalny that he leave the premises she finally pleaded to several people in a hallways

[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:44.120]
someone helped me get rid of ciderman please after a tense confrontation before reporters ciderman

[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:50.180]
finally left he wasn't pleased and by the way Sharon don't call me again he growled on root

[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:56.720]
to the exit what a douchebag okay comes in here uh points himself as the monitor of that debate

[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.480]
and of steve show yesterday this is steves good ex-friend okay who comes in here as no business

[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:08.340]
in this building who's a just piece of mong and the ciderman stay out of this building okay all right

[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.020]
that takes care of that piece of business now let's get right down to the nitty gritty of this show

[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:19.900]
i guess Glenn wants to know why i hate him so i'm curious i don't it doesn't hate but is very

[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.960]
upset i have a clue you know during the day there was a guy who called in Neil if you recall

[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:32.900]
and asking about glen's car about what color you know the color right over and i think that may

[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:38.160]
have been the guy oh that was the bubbles guy i was that who it was the bubbles they were hanging

[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:44.080]
out with bubbles over at the hall and bill boy people are talking boy i've been on vacation you've

[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.160]
been cited everywhere i've been with friends better watch you to jacks going to start following

[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.500]
you were right you know i haven't done anything could you imagine what do you like if i had done all

[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:59.700]
this i think the bone of contention is that uh it was it was under the impression that the you know

[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:05.120]
that you were going to be away and i plan to be things change this is real life there's no script

[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.500]
things change for personal reasons i was back early and it was just a coincidence that both times

[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:16.480]
that you're away were for the last two remotes no kidding and i think this is your fault no i think

[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:22.080]
about it you mentioned earlier that i picked these weeks you know by the way i have some incredible

[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.700]
affidavits here i just mentioned in passing it turns out that the a week ago today we wanted hearing

[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:32.000]
in court and uh a lot of people thought that was the end of this whole business with jack Thompson

[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.080]
which it's certainly unfortunately wasn't but it was a very narrow thing that judge was ruling on

[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:41.960]
to keep him away from me and away from this building while i'm here and uh et cetera because there

[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:46.800]
was a psychologist who testified as many of us also believe that mr. Thompson could be dangerous

[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.720]
and represent a threat to us some of us and we have affidavits from two of the people over here

[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.440]
channel seven next door they don't want him here either on the property and he has no legitimate

[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.160]
business over there in fact that after our hearing last week the people at channel seven called

[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.400]
the judge and said that we're very upset that you made an exception uh to allow him after three

[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.740]
p.m. to come on to property to come over to channel seven because he has no legitimate business

[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.860]
here and we don't want him here so i find that fascinating i just mentioned that in passing

[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:17.360]
okay now let's get back to the real important matters at hand what uh it's my fault that what

[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.300]
that i picked these particular weeks because you mentioned about an hour ago that i picked them

[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.640]
you know in conjunction with your vacations yeah but see i changed my vacations so you could have

[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.340]
also changed yours very easily in other words uh the fact that i'm going next week you could

[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:35.300]
be going to following week very easily you're right but no one mentioned anything to me about that

[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.600]
the logical thing to do but no one brought it up to me up on wednesday at the bizarre where

[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:44.260]
no it's true plan that you're going to be out the week of september 13th is that uh

[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:52.280]
no one i you see i see that was a shot i noted that was a shot a real really smiling but it was a shot

[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:57.680]
you people are saying very upset about you about what i think is your piece of um just mung i think is

[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:04.540]
the word i could use i shaking his head no no yes that's my track buddy come on oh you guys are

[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:13.380]
going to the track with me today well sure we're gonna go now this is tell the audience anything

[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:18.500]
tells me a lot boy i'm telling you you people are so fickle and so wishy washy it's just incredible

[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:24.440]
you just can't um i don't know what it is for this is sad this is really sad you're not

[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.720]
well don't joke around the audience doesn't know that they think that you're sucking around now

[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.760]
by the way can i have some more that roast beef it's delicious and it's been a spoil sitting there

[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.800]
and of course rich getting near the food is always a dangerous sign are there any more of those

[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:42.840]
great little olives i love those little olives with the pomegranate yes there are yeah i didn't

[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:48.940]

[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:54.700]

[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:58.440]

[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:20.360]
testimony out before the audience and they think it's starting to all fall together now in my mind

[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:28.260]

want to win in a lot of him fellowship but I'll tell you I was on I forget who I was I guess I was

[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:26.580]
talking to Bill Calder last night and the other line rang and it was fat rich and I don't want to

[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:32.460]
say that he was angry with you but there was steam coming through the receiver he was smoking

[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:37.540]
about will you give specific he was smoking about you and about all these sightings and about the

[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:43.780]
fact that when we really when the push came to shove you just a dessert of the ship you deserted a

[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:49.260]
sinking ship how come how come you didn't he was there come to me how come you didn't it was there

[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:56.160]
how come you didn't come to he was an on vacation yes he is as matter of fact how come he's on a

[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:02.940]
permanent vacation with their osman how come you didn't come to me to my face and say why don't

[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:07.560]
you you know push your waist did that on the air the guy just got through car we went through that

[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:11.440]
and you said I can't change this and I said you're going to let me go to that thing all by myself

[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.400]
and you said I've had this plan for months and I have my reservations it's all coming back to me

[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:22.660]
thanks to that last the pain in the ass caller now remember I do remember that very briefly one

[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:29.240]
time that was mentioned but no one had ever come to me now it's free no one had asked me anything

[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:35.940]
common sense would dictate not necessarily part of the show you don't just shine when there's a special

[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:44.180]
thing coming up that you would have gotten paid extra for speaking to getting paid extra for by the way

[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:50.600]
where is Tommy Dennenberg is Dennenberg in the building well I forgot about that where is my

[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:55.280]
check Dennenberg okay well I forgot all about this you may get either you may let off the hook

[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.540]
I got mine did you get paid Johnny Dark God his check right there in the spot

[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:08.320]
well now this this could be see why it came in just like on Perry Mason in the whole of the trial

[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:14.840]
all of the subtler is a little sidebar that comes in yes is this just dawned on me uh huh because I

[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:21.080]
was going to say you would have gotten paid extra for it just like I did and now it dawns on me

[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.260]
I didn't get paid anything that you see why I'm here that's supposed to be part of these deals

[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:31.740]
is supposed to be big bucks when the big celebrities go out on the road man's supposed to be some

[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:38.220]
serious serious dollars and it's just and you know me man I've just like Steve when I go out and

[00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:43.760]
do these things I want that check now oh look at that I want it right now because I'm broke man I

[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.640]
haven't got two nickels to rub together like Steve you know that seems to be next year in temperate

[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:54.960]
behavior that seems to be the number one on the hit parade question everybody is asking now

[00:59:54.960 --> 01:00:01.020]
because Steve keeps coming on here and um flaunting the audience well denna bergs on the road but

[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.380]
he's got a phone in his car and he knows the bad line he knew it enough to call in to be a pest

[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:11.040]
on the lightning round he can call in now okay on the bad line but uh where's Steve's money

[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.760]
all go and why is he always broken why does he owe Nick money and Bill Mullin and Sharon

[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.840]
that's an inquisitive guy that washes the cars out here and Spencer how come at it what is that

[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:25.540]
all about I mean it's his business obviously but when he chooses to come on the air and uh

[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:31.460]
beat his breast about how much money he's making he does make a lot and he does make a far too much

[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:37.860]
for him um one has to wonder and everybody is talking about that now that's like a new mystery oh

[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:43.740]
so you're you falling number two excellent well this is good news you know in every city you'll find a

juvenile and tempered way well oh you know it doesn't it fits in with your behavior with your

[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.420]
personality lately I want the audience before they vote I want you to be aware that he just

[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:47.920]
something to it then huh anyway it's 1131 looking at Palm Beach line is that embarrassing here we are

[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.680]
this could be one of the most consternating shows in the history that I've been on a year here it's

[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.100]
intense and they don't they couldn't care less in Palm Beach they do want to talk about Rick

[01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:01.500]
Ciderman getting his ass kicked out here yesterday though what would you like Cheryl or are those

[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:08.440]
yours those are huh those are great those are incredible in other words the people at channel seven

[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.820]
are just they're more apoplectic than we are they don't want them anywhere near the building

[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:19.700]
well poor patty over there boy that's that's shocking okay is what that is but what goes around

[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:25.200]

[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:30.420]

[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:37.780]
you with the audience makes out of all this so far Del Ray okay listen Glenn the reason you're not

[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:42.580]
on by yourself because you're not that entertaining man well that is a good point and now that's

[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.980]
the reason in fact that's what they told me and I said well now you're nitpicking I think

[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:51.440]
no Neil you're the greatest man well we know that I know that I'm gonna say we know this is

[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.620]
getting to be though when clandetane back today it reminded me of that jerk that used to come on

[01:06:55.620 --> 01:07:00.620]
at one thirty or so you know used to barge in there the guy I don't start ripping him again will you

[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:05.600]

[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:13.160]
ruin his show and I don't have any uh no he does not have the worst rated show on this station

[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:19.080]
well that's true Glenn go back man get out of here I'm hung over and I listen to your whiny little

[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:24.280]
mazely voice I don't need it man I don't need it I don't like it Glenn you know sir what I don't

[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:03.840]
you'll take care man get out of here what a you know what I'm 33 at WIO did he what a pleasant

[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.400]
call to that New York drop from number 19 last year to number 50 no wonder all the New Yorkers are

[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:14.620]
here boy it's dropping like a rock it's like dropping a penny from the top of the world trade center

[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:20.960]
anyway Palm Beach is now that must be a broken line huh no it sounds like it's working fine to me

[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:27.740]
655 9463 655 WIOD I guess Debbie's got that Palm Beach audience sewn up

[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:34.800]
doesn't she I don't know she why he's upset he is really upset the last caller I think was the

[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.800]
final straw the straw that broke the birds back but that caller did say he was hung over here yeah

[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.720]
well he considered the source sounded fine to me yeah sounded like a good guy to me

[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.280]
anyway let's continue I'm sure that they're going to come to your rescue here because you know

[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:54.240]
that all the bird suckers are going to get on here real quick now and start kissing and kissing

[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.920]
well I have a Palm Beach show was a fault well wait a minute let me handle this hello protect the bird

[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:04.800]
he's alright okay see just brief comments from Palm Beach I haven't done anything

[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:11.360]
I don't think it's like in my mind I have in my heart I have done anything all right let's take

[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:17.280]
a survey now who'd you rather have in the building Rick Ciderman or the bird my only crime seems to be

[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.860]
that I didn't go to work while I was on vacation that seems to be my big one well I like the way

[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.440]
you've twisted around I would probably put it in a different way that you took your vacation when

[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:32.280]
we needed you the most no one asked me no one said anything to me you like you know marginally

[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:38.160]
but I was missed so when we go you were miff and it's I was missed and instead of you were

[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.380]
missed and we were miff yeah and instead of appreciating me and saying oh well maybe you know he

[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:47.140]
does serve a purpose maybe he does no no instead I guess we had a chance to serve a purpose then

[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:52.280]
you shine this nobody asked me to you're kind of twisting it around nobody invited you remind me of

[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.740]
somebody I know who listens every day to the show and likes to take the obvious and twisted around

[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:03.820]
