[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]
Cheryl and Mitch said why don't we go across to Eli's and have dinner?

[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.520]
It's right across from the hotel and it looks like a good place and we wound up going instead to the palm which was tremendous at the

[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.340]
Anyway, so I said oh, that's funny. You should mention Eli's because we talked about going there last night

[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.140]
This is on the air and I said it's right across from our hotel. Oh

[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.280]
Now here is Mr. Thompson who obviously has a full rich life and does nothing but

[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.880]
Monitor these shows and conjure up all of these fantasies in his mind about everything that's going on and everybody who visits my home and every move that we make

[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.240]
Which is none of his goddamn business and has nothing to do with anything that's on the air

[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.180]
Okay, here are his notes. Okay phone calls

[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.360]
215 East Chicago Avenue. That was the address of this restaurant that somebody gave Eli's and here's the phone number

[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.280]
Hotels near Eli so obviously he called this phone number made up some story about probably needing to

[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.700]
Amit people who I need didn't remember the name of the hotel and what are the hotels in the area near Eli's and here's the Drake the

[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.620]
Barkley the Tremont the Whitehall the Raphael and the Ritz Carlton and as it turned out we did stay at the Ritz Carlton

[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.440]
It's got the phone number for the Ritz Carlton and evidently he after he called the Ritz Carlton

[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.240]
He was able to verify that

[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.300]
The Neorajers or whoever else he asked for Disney were staying there underneath Ritz Carlton

[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.760]
He's got 731 89 security in the name of an individual who works in security at the Ritz Carlton now

[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.380]
What he told that individual only time will tell because we're investigating that even as I speak all right

[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.040]
Coincidentally enough then and I just say this coincidentally

[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:42.220]
I underline that in red the next day after mr. Thompson's

[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.160]
We nearly got killed in the Renekar

[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.860]
Which you heard that story I so sure everybody remembers that story

[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.260]
Now I'm not can necessarily connecting the two

[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.120]
Okay, that would be reaching pretty far, but it looks bad doesn't it?

[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.300]
You see it looks bad when you keep sticking your tentacles and other people's business people assume things people start to

[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.720]
Assume things together and when you there's one sheet in here and the wish the audience could see this stack

[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.620]
This is only a small portion of the ongoing memoirs all dealing with Neorajers and W I and Z and Zeta and W I O D

[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.320]
There's one several pages in which he's talking to the CDC which is the citizens for decency

[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.420]
Counselor one of these ultra right-wing groups and on one page it says CDC a

[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.060]
Favorite violence towards Sodomites

[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.740]
Good Lord

[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.500]
Mm-hmm and even after that particular date there still are ongoing

[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.240]
Phone calls noted in his own. This is kind of like a diary

[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.180]
Okay

[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.740]
Very illuminating let me just read you one of the phone calls with Dennis Collins November 10th 88

[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.960]
That's three days after we started here on W I O D 11.50 a.m

[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.960]
Tim Williams told Dennis Collins that Gannett was talking with Disney through Williams to make sure Rogers didn't get into this

[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.400]
History of give and take Ray his old station on W I O D my note to Dennis

[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.780]
Interesting that Zeta let him beat on me for 15 months, but is now so very concerned about their rights not being beaten up by Rogers

[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.800]
11 788 that's the day we started on the air here. Yes

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.200]
Dennis Collins was talking into my machine from his car phone. I have his voice on my tape during this call

[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.400]
Someone called me and would say nothing, but Roger show was on in the background

[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.140]
Dennis and I concluded the call and I replayed message it was an obscene message from one of Rogers listeners and

[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.820]
Dennis and Dennis and Dennis is on here just repeatedly also remember the problems

[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.720]
I had the original problems with my satellite dish when some crank called up the real estate woman who rented me my house

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.660]
Mm-hmm and the true her got her told her that

[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.360]
Misrepresented himself as being from the city of plantation and that my landlords had been fined retroactive

[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.900]
$500 a day for the satellite dish which was a flagrant line got my landlords crazy

[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.380]
Well, here's another page all dealing with the zoning enforcement in plantation and with the a Roger satellite dish

[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.020]
And with the name of the woman with Murrill Lynch realty who is the woman who handles my the rental of my house

[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.960]
You think that's just another coincidence

[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.980]
And at the bottom of this page here is a description which I won't read because it's nobody's business

[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.180]
Here's a description of the location and the structure of Stan majors house

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.520]
What on the bottom of this page?

[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.020]
And here are pages and pages very clearly showing these surveillance and taking of license plate numbers and

[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.740]
Notes about Harlan and Bob and some of the other people from Cooper City and

[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.840]
Stem and Joe you know Joe with eight ends and this one and that one

[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:47.580]
This is a pattern this is like a book and it reads very clearly of someone who is committing the most heinous the most obnoxious and

[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.880]
atrocious harassment

[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.100]
Who is out not only to get neo-Rodgers off the air but just to absolutely destroy my life to destroy

[00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.460]
Anybody who stands in his path including Cox broadcasting Guy Gannett broadcasting anybody you name it

[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.680]
And this is America this is this is a legitimate reason

[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.880]
To get up out of bed every morning to conduct hours and hours and hours of this kind of harassment

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.280]
Mr. Thompson you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I mean I knew because I've lived through it for over two years

[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.620]
Now we're in the third year this month of this ongoing hate campaign all in the name of religion again. Yeah

[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.100]
I knew a

[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.860]
Lot of it but now having all of this in black and white. This is this is incredible shocking

[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.500]
sorry Jay

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.060]
And I would I just wonder about the legal all these great illegal minds because I'm I my feeling about the law legal profession

[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.000]
You know what it was for now. It's at the all-time low because nobody other than our own attorneys

[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.960]
Nobody really seems to give it damn and you can do anything as an attorney of course here are these hundreds and

[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.500]
Hundreds of letters. You remember American comedy network on the other station. Of course every song parity every one that we played

[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.240]
There is a letter adhered to the record company of the original

[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:14.300]
Talking about the fact that we on Zeta were playing this song parody and that American comedy network had recorded this without

[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.720]
Obtaining permission and rights etc etc

[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.260]
Now this is common practice in the industry it's done all over the country. Yeah

[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.360]
But here again is this self-appointed individual who's going to determine what we can do on the year what we can say on the year

[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:35.820]
What you people can listen to and what the standards for the industry are all in his little ivory tower because he has nothing else to do

[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:45.500]
1027 at WIOD. Here's another great page from this same a bunch of crap. Okay, I can find it the one that says April 1st

[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.740]
Neil's house

[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.480]
April well here it is

[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.440]
Neil's house April 1st. This is last year. Harlan and Bob there

[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.700]
Tags and here we have the license plate numbers of these terrible criminal youth from Cooper City

[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.780]
With all sorts of and then he's even got comments about Harlan bad grades occurred in January

[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.880]
The real dad is Joe

[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.780]
spoke with the so-and-so on 731 80 80 doesn't know Harlan's last name

[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:23.300]
But he was a senior and confirms that Harlan went to Vegas Harlan flunked and seems like a fruit it says

[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.360]
Well, I hate to break the news to you Jack, but Harlan is not as you would call it a fruit by any stretch of the imagination

[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.260]
Harlan is also far too ugly for anyone to be

[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.460]
Sexually interested, but of course that's the overtone of everything everything comes back to sex

[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.440]
Everything we talk about in this man's mind has some kind of a sexual connotation

[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.260]
Everyone who visits my house is there for sexual purposes, which is incredible because I'm not getting any of it

[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.900]
God only knows what happens when they leave the room

[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.180]
But you talk about an over immacute

[00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.920]
Overactive imagination and an overstimulated gland of some sort there or understimulated as the case may be it just incredible

[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.160]
I should read the notes about the Hollywood adult theater shouldn't I that that part is can I read that on the air?

[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.860]
No, you're unfortunately

[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.440]
No, are you sure the last part I don't think about the seats?

[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.600]
I don't think so

[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.000]
Boy, you're hearing some wild rumors Jack. I can't read the thing where he says they're semen dripping from the seats

[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:31.300]
Boy, I've never seen that I better take my magnifying glass in the next time

[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:39.120]
Yeah, according to what I said from the detective John Williams and Hollywood who of course gave him this real distorted

[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.120]
bizarre story, you know, but that honest a goodness if we ought to have a TV documentary and

[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:51.440]
Bring this all on the air and have in all of South Florida really get into this is one of the most bizarre and incredible stories

[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.060]
This isn't just somebody you know doing a little nuisance thing or making a few calls dispenses

[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:03.820]
This is somebody who is just dedicated his entire existence to the destruction of another human being and of course obviously this radio show

[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.080]
Yeah

[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.360]
10 30 at W on a do you look at that we got several calls on the board already

[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.380]
This is a are you still there? Yes, well, how about that a mobile who hung on for dear life?

[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.600]
You believe it not really and Neil I hate to change the subject after all this stuff

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.820]
Jack sounds like he really likes you. Yeah, he's a good buddy of mine

[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.640]
This and I was looking calls me every day to see how I'm feeling

[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.760]
Just a joke Jack. It's just a joke. See we have to say that because he has no sense of humor

[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.020]
So if we say something ingest he tries to make it seem as though you know, it was said seriously

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.680]
I know so in response to that line he was how we say that I call him on the year

[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.660]
I've never called him at home

[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.360]
I've you know, it's just a joke Jack light enough as if J. Will let us use his material. Go ahead sir

[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.220]
Okay, I was listening to winds. I don't know if you heard it

[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.760]
No, sir come on you were listening

[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.520]
Nobody listens to the news

[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:57.200]
By the way, Rick, can you crank it down? It's hot as hell in here in the morning sometimes for the news. Oh anyway great station

[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.940]
Now the guy that does sports what's his name?

[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.180]
Ron Harrison Ron Harrison almost forgot

[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:10.320]
He mentioned something he said you know why the dolphins are on W I O D

[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.260]
I don't know if you heard this no

[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:19.900]
Because there's a 610 kind of team 6 and 10 isn't that cute that cute. Yeah, I don't know if you heard it before

[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.020]
I just want another thing

[00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.220]
Mr. Field set it up

[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.480]
Goodbye

[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.980]
What does that mean? I don't get it no, I don't either I don't get either part well

[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:37.740]
I get the 610, but that's pretty weak. Come on Ron stop knocking the dolphins. Will you please we leave that to Steve over here

[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.440]
Miami hello, hey Neil how you doing good morning. Yes, sir morning. Good. Hi

[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.680]
Neil I'm really sorry to be calling you on this kind of

[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:53.280]
That note, but I was just wondering it's all turned around for a play is it possible that is it in fact?

[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.320]
I'm not even letting that go on the air, okay?

[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.880]
Because that's just exactly what he wants is to play the wounded soldier and to try to turn the tables

[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.700]
And I'm being oppressed and they're conducting a orchestrating harassment

[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.700]
I don't want we don't give his number or his address

[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.880]
We don't want to be calling him or harassing him. I've made that very clear how many times dozens of times over the year

[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.260]
And whatever in and if it does happen that's his problem. Okay, that's his tough luck

[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.280]
Sonny Fox

[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.100]
Sonny who?

[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.480]
Uh, how y'all doing for Dallas Texas?

[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.820]
By the way, there's a letter to you in here too, Mr. Sonny Jr

[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:29.960]
Yeah

[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.540]
Phone call from you, I guess it is about drug, Dave Caprita being a drugie or something alleged

[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.940]
I never said anything

[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.240]
Ah, that's yeah, wow, it's funny Jack must have just made it up

[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:48.960]
And there's also a letter to you from Jack about how I sit on the air on Zeta that you and Don Agony are homosexual lovers

[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.940]
Oh wait a minute. This is Sonny not Greg be excuse me Sonny. I'll give you and Greg so confused

[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.320]
Actually actually I'm calling because we want to take you up

[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.560]
On that offer to extend the olive branch of peace

[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.400]
Uh to plan we want uh we want to let them know that we love them that we want everything to be okay

[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.600]
Wait a minute Greg why am I

[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:16.660]
It really is I re-regret you why am I getting all these this barrage of phone calls from love 94 they love you

[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.640]
That's right. This is gone on long enough. They're not a bunch of sore heads like you are

[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.740]
They just want to go on on long enough Greg. We're very happy for your success there. Uh, are you sure?

[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.180]
Especially now that we're not on in the morning. Mm-hmm

[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.940]
Absolutely

[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.860]
I wonder if my ratings over here. Yeah. By the way, how's Jack doing these days Greg?

[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.760]
He cares a lot about you. I'll tell you that

[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.200]
Uh, yeah, I know yeah

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.240]
I am shocked. I'm sorry

[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.060]
This olive branch actually did mention the other day. I want to know what you and Donald have been doing

[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.280]
I said it's none of your business

[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.980]
a good one but i'm doing this like uh all by himself now that it also isn't a good one because i'm

[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.680]
anyway i was gonna say something about exposing it but i guess that wouldn't be this so you see

[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.640]
you get boxed into a corner where no matter how you phrase it somebody can make it into something

[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.480]
that it's not but it the the the bright flood lights are going to be on all these activities from

[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.580]
here on in but you know what that you know what this also makes me think about yes okay this this

[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.820]
creep that's following you around about your sex life and all that who does that that doesn't

[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:29.600]

[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.360]
it might cost you a little bit why don't you get yourself a private investigator oh yeah and have

[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:40.520]
this douchebag followed and every day that's because i don't have any did i don't have any desire i

[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.760]
don't care where he goes as long as it's not you know near me or any of my friends i don't care

[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.120]
what he does just go live his life see i don't i don't have this voyeuristic desire to know what's

[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.640]
going on with him i've never been with near his house i don't know where it is i don't have any

[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.280]
description of what it looks like and i don't care i couldn't care less yeah but if these judges aren't

[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.820]
gonna help you well we did get we did get it sir we did get another injunction yesterday and if

[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:09.600]
he violates this one the judge has ordered that any municipal police like a plantation or davi or

[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.740]
whatever or the brown county sheriff our under instructions to arrest him if he violates this

[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.160]
injunction and comes anywhere near me or my house that's good yes but you never know if you had

[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.440]
someone follow him you might uh find him at the Hollywood movie theater well he seems to have a pretty

[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.160]
all i don't know i've never seen any of these things there that he's uh writing about but i guess

[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.640]
i guess i haven't been looking closely and i'm gonna have to start

[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.860]
doing my own little investigation up close in person you know i mean no about all this stuff

[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:44.600]
okay good point thank you sir hey take care okay that is an excellent point we're gonna have to

[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.620]
start to investigate these some of these things a little more closely and up personal we do have

[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.440]
some open lines on the board i guess i shouldn't say that the audience has come back today we have

[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.120]
three open lines so it's not overwhelming that we're just waiting for a lot of good food to come in

[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:03.160]
i mean it's this stuff is gonna go to waste which is a shame no no Johnny's here it's okay no

[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.840]
no seriously he's holding back don't you see he's not touching any of that it's like uh that

[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.320]
stuff looks real good but i want to wait for the good stuff because he knows wings plus is coming

[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:16.520]
that's your way i was coming way i would be surprised if pizza lock shows up i mean i said that

[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:22.640]
we want a real giant party i hope who would make a cake do we have a sponsor oh i know who do you

[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:27.880]

[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.300]
somebody will come up with some kind of like a birthday not a birthday but a going away cake

[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.240]
good luck best of luck sharing it's that because this is sharing last day i know

[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:43.220]
boy is she lucky or what oh you talk about jumping off just at the right time you know

[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:50.620]
now you didn't find any letters in that mountain of paper de febby in there did you

[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:54.680]
any not yet okay oh yeah let me know if you run across anything

[00:32:54.680 --> 00:33:01.820]
okay i'll tell you there's uh there's an interesting page here where it talks about bob and

[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:08.740]
alan and stem and now and i said to somebody the other day you know if if my uh sex life were

[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:14.460]
really centered around all the here it is right here yeah bob alan and andrew and i thought to

[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:19.780]
myself i thought about that for a while i said that sounds fine to me i'll never leave the house

[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:28.120]
unfortunately none of it is true but uh boy kind of what is that like alternating days like on

[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:35.680]
Monday it would be talk about fantasia talk about just sitting out there in the um oh and there's one

[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.020]
when we were at i and z i got to find this during the break and he's written down the license

[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.920]
plate numbers and he's he's convinced himself that capita drove a black Mustang what he never did

[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:49.640]
he's got all the cars out in the lot of sign to a different person i leave the building at 1019

[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:56.580]
that morning and then in the next space he's got written down 1046 am rogers arrives home at such

[00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:01.060]
and such a great implantation so obviously he followed me home on that day and maybe many others

[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:06.420]
isn't that fabulous but it's america see so you can just run around conducting your own little

[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.460]
subversive surveillance and harassing people and which has a lot to do with what's on the year

[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:17.720]
doesn't it so in other words if i meet somebody through the show and they want to be a friend of

[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.640]
mine or come into my house then that proves i'm trolling for something on here didn't stand

[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.880]
meet his wife lori through the show i think so didn't i meet big Dave who lives with me but definitely

[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.300]

[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.580]

[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:46.820]
of the joey rental show today yeah now we'll probably be really um hard pressed for calls this

[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.320]
our bs now what what is it you're doing you're not turning the sound up are you

[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.840]
no no no no no turn it down we we're not going to start re-broadcasting channel 10 on the year

[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.240]
okay it's bad it's hard enough to watch it we don't want to listen to it west palm beach hello

[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:08.840]
yes sir uh just here to prove that uh people appear do care now i've been care about what

[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:14.140]
uh you said people appear don't care and i've been holding for quite some time because i do care

[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.460]
i wanted to speak you in glen have you seen the joey rental show sir on tv no i

[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:25.540]
i trust well oh there's mag she really looks great that she heyes mag how you doing go ahead sir

[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:29.920]
it means nothing do you any of this right that's absolutely right that's it's an elephant too that's

[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:37.600]
a good sign a couple things number one as far as your uh this individual in choral gables you

[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:44.820]
mentioned something earlier that uh there's campaign have been stepped up after you would cow cow

[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.500]
to him and taking certain things no no wait wait wait a minute i didn't count on station station

[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:54.700]
there you go okay well i think that just proves it's like you're dealing with little children when

[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.740]
you give them reinforcement they keep doing what they're doing i don't think in this case i

[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:04.140]
don't think it makes any difference i mean this individual is so obsessed and so driven by this

[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.380]
i mean doesn't have any other purpose for getting up in the morning i mean this is all he does

[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.180]
sure well you don't you don't you think if they give him encouragement well it doesn't it doesn't

[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:18.620]
he'll just do it even more it doesn't help that's for sure um does that i'd like to know can you

[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:24.900]
enlighten me as to what where we stayed in chicago what that has to do with what's on the ear and

[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.720]
cleaning up the earways can you tell me what that has to do with any nothing but if you can

[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.560]
better yet of all this i've been listening to if you can prove that he was the guy that was

[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:42.520]
making misrepresentations regarding your satellite dish uh-huh well it's not a really good legal

[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.160]
case against it well it's all right there in the telephone records because the real stately

[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:51.580]
lives in brown he lives in date i've already uh uh through through various uh stuff that's been

[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.820]
slipped under my door anonymously i've already seen certain telephone records which are

[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.380]
incredibly incriminating and uh you know you just put all this together and it's right there in

[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:03.740]
black and white well as you have if you have as you have said there's a lot of things that

[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:10.240]
that are immoral and he shouldn't be doing but that legally uh nobody's going to even slap his

[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:18.020]
hand for but um what you've described as far as if you can prove he was doing that with about

[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:23.520]
the satellite dish and impersonating these other people and trying to get it taken out um i think

[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.540]
you're going to nail him on intentional inflation of emotional distress if that i hope that's one of

[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:33.900]
the counts in your lawsuit and uh you get punitive damages and get to get into his financial record

[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.700]
now you don't get anything this man got he hasn't got two nickels to rub together in his name

[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.640]
he's got everything in his wife's name so it's uh you know it's just an exercise sure

[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:50.120]
it well a lighter note um i listened a little bit to uh bill calder this morning and he told a

[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.440]
caller who didn't know his name he was trying to give her a t-shirt he says well do you know

[00:39:54.440 --> 00:40:00.360]
what my name is and uh she didn't and he said well it's Glenn Hill be sure to ask for

[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:06.740]

[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:12.120]

[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:51.940]
bye you'll be all right be believable okay eleven we've got a card for everything in here

[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.060]
what Laurie major no that has to be a mistake isn't it

[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:04.300]
uh hello there it is Neil yeah hi how you doing okay it's not a mistake but i just had to say

[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:08.240]
something first i'm so glad you're able to talk about all this stuff well i'm sure

[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.460]
interested to see this nice description of your house it's very accurate that's what i'm calling

[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.220]
about i was floored when stand told me last night but i want your listener why you better govern

[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:23.080]
yourself accordingly Laurie absolutely um what i want your listeners to understand one thing which

[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:29.860]
is really interesting to the extent that this man goes to all right that um first of all

[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:35.740]
stand did not start living here and so after he and i were married which was more to 88

[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:43.920]
and okay i'll give you the date of this it's June 7th 88 okay and then he was shortly off the air

[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:52.260]
after that right this house is in my name and it's not like you're here all the time you know you're

[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:57.360]
welcome here all the time you know that but it's not like you're here every day i never i'm never

[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.520]
there i don't think i've been here twice but yeah you've been here a couple of times and you know

[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.920]
we've been over there a couple of times and stand goes over very infrequently with no pattern

[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:12.200]
or anything else and that's what i mean it just like really got into my gut last night i mean what

[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:17.820]
an invasion it really it like that you're good how about this thing about chicago where we nearly

[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:23.240]
got killed and here's the evidence in this man's handwriting of these phone calls and the hotel we

[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.920]
were staying at and he calls the overnight late night security guy and god only knows and we're

[00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.530]
investigating all of that right now but what in the world does this have to do with anything other

[00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:37.510]
words we go out of town and it's his business where we're staying no i mean that that is just amazing

[00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:42.490]
it is just absolutely in front of the public they're just beginning to get an inkling of the kind of

[00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:46.890]
invasive kind of thing that's been going on here for two years where you practically don't it

[00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:53.690]
can't even leave the house i know absolutely and to know where where my house is i mean if that was

[00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:58.910]
just like i said that to stay on my side but this house is in my name i mean it's not like you can

[00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:05.970]
go look in public records and find that this is stand major house that's what's real well you got

[00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:10.430]
to understand most of this doesn't have to do with public records it has to do with following people

[00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:18.150]
that's what it has to do and license tags mm-hmm yeah well that's you know that's interesting enough

[00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:24.350]
in itself yeah how some but just a private person can start pulling all that kind of

[00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.730]
information well when you don't have anything else to do when it's a 20 hour day occupation i

[00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.550]
guess you have plenty of time to do these things and of course i'm fascinated by this long list

[00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:40.150]
back and forth of telephone conversations with Dennis Collins from w n w s which i find very very

[00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:47.930]
embarrassing for them over there uh remember the lunch and add with Dennis yes i do and the pumping

[00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:56.090]
session about you on the pretense of a job yeah uh information gathering session that's it

[00:43:56.090 --> 00:44:00.130]
well nice work Dennis you can't beat me on a year in a rating so you have to try to give me out of

[00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:06.530]
the market nice work incredible okay one thing Dennis Collins is no J are youing because he would have

[00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:11.410]
never gotten caught in something like this that's for sure take care of Neil covering yourself

[00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:18.770]

[00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:01.970]

[00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:26.250]

[00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:32.670]
i'll be damned well how does that work i'm not too familiar with that kind of stuff like a pen

[00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:42.930]
i'll be damned well don't waste all my fluid thank you thank you very much that's nice isn't it

[00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:49.590]

[00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:54.330]
a little commotion in the background it's because the first wave of food is coming now we should get

[00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:58.350]
sharing in here for some of this because it's her party shouldn't we feed her it wouldn't that be

[00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:03.750]
the appropriate thing to do well i would think so wouldn't that be the gentile thing gentile thing

[00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:08.710]
yeah gentile anyway it's 20 after the hour we're going to kind of get this all arranged Johnny over

[00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:13.230]
there is just starving by the way give him a little something to keep him from being so

[00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:18.510]
yeah a little fat rate there's one box for Johnny and fat rates those nilly burgers anyway can

[00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:24.090]
i talk about wings plus while we're small enough not fair i just took a bite of this little bacon

[00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:28.470]

i won't have to unplug my dish today after baseball season and of course i may want to

[00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:56.470]
of course the fact rich is kind of smugging complacent here today because he knows the cubs are

[00:47:56.470 --> 00:48:01.770]
starting paul killgust this afternoon against the cardinals which is an act of hearing sanity but

[00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:06.490]

[00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.530]
a little bit close give the cardinals a fighting chance and of course they're not stirring anybody

[00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:16.570]
only migraine today so no big deal poor de mezz playing tidewater oh the pirates boy pirates

[00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:22.590]
doesn't it reminds me about the three game sweep in new york the last time the two teams met boy

[00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:28.050]
that was i guess a bad stroke a luck by the mints station to probably save some of those runs

[00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:32.070]
from yesterday i bet you davie johnson and i will be thinking boy when we lose four to three

[00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:38.590]

[00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:53.470]
favorite just loaded with the extra garlic you know just really

[00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:57.810]

[00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:59.870]
those little pieces of garlic to get in your throat

[00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:03.310]

i think i've had two or three of those

[00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:26.650]
red at mushrooms because they just disappear and there's a little salad

[00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.590]

[00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:32.030]

the cubs cardinals games are all day games and i have a feeling that i just may have to forego the track

[01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:38.430]
i see i may have to forego it as healy adoro justina is what it's that right well if you don't make

[01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:43.870]
it then i guess so we'll see you uh the the following weekend no question about it all right

[01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:49.690]
save me a seat take care and i'll talk to you next week here what i said what save me a seat you

[01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:56.010]
see you later you got it five well he did eventually call in but uh you know he's had a rough life

[01:06:56.010 --> 01:07:01.330]
you know three minutes till noon at w i o t oh yeah and veggie was on boy you have more problems

[01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:06.290]
when you called i mean god and i was nice enough to stay on but i was an important call it wasn't

[01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:10.630]
it was very important it was touting on the air trick you learned from his old friend Hank Goldberg

[01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:15.530]
yeah well you know i just called to give you a few of those things that went on in uh just

[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:19.330]
saying hi and saying i'm still alive oh so in other words you were done anyway

[01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:23.250]
oh actually i was just saying you know hey i'm still alive and still listening you guys great

[01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:28.970]
so i'll be talking to you next uh my my about a month from now it would be a real good day to call in

[01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:34.070]
all right take it easy guys bye bye i wasn't that great he didn't overdo the welcome today i guess

[01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:39.550]
he understands hmm he knows the lay of the land anyway in the noon to one hour we're gonna be reading

[01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:44.570]
about 300 letters from jack's collection here uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:48.410]
letters to everybody in the business several letters to Dennis Collins in there i find it

[01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:52.950]
fascinating by the way we're not gonna be reading letters today jacks just to chill out but uh

[01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:59.830]
no most of the letters he signs j b Thompson yeah with that very uh distinct handwriting the letters

[01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:06.530]
he writes to Dennis Collins he signs jack really like their buddy friend close yeah well i guess it

[01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:11.450]
coincides with all those phone calls going back and forth too i guess the philosophy of w snooze

[01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:17.450]
we can't beat him so let's get him off the air that's the Dennis Collins philosophy at wold see if

[01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:21.590]
i would general manager of a station in the market and word got out that i was consorting or

[01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:25.330]
communicating on a fairly regular basis back and forth with somebody of this illke i'd be

[01:08:25.330 --> 01:08:31.050]
embarrassed humiliated and degraded i couldn't even face uh the employees i'd probably go into the

[01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:35.250]
closet so to speak and shut the door never come out again you know what i mean Dennis kind of a

[01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:38.890]
i was gonna say it's kind of embarrassing but when you're used to the books that they get

[01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:44.010]
the embarrassment factor has to be so great before it starts sinking in it doesn't make any

[01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:47.970]
difference you know but i do like their demographics and we're gonna be all getting our pollen and

[01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:53.010]
out after the newscast just in honor of them chuck mire has got the one at the uh one o'clock news

[01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:57.210]
but he's gonna bring it to you at noon and then we'll come back at twelve oh five

[01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:25.190]
some time

[01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:33.510]
anymore

[01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:34.850]
i

[01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:35.010]
st

[01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:35.070]
okay

[01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:43.250]
drop off during that new news don't they? They really just go nuts. Well it's

[01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:51.310]
about something exciting. Okay we can we can we tell us now? Yeah. What? Well no Steve

[01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.590]
has some we all let you do it. He's got some very exciting positive news. Thank

[01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:59.250]
goodness it two o'clock. Great thing happened and then you'll understand why he's

[01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:03.950]
been like kind of in and out the last couple of days but as it always does in the

[01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:08.710]
end Jack just as prevailed. You know what I'm saying? So govern yourselves accordingly Dennis

[01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:13.030]
and Jack and Mike and all our good friends out there in radio land. Oh now did you

[01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:18.570]
you were busy so you didn't hear about the letter? Well it's not a letter about this page

[01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:24.130]
about when we were in Chicago that weekend? No. And it has well it's interesting because

[01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:27.890]
here's Eli's and I mentioned people were calling in when I did that show and they were

[01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:31.750]
saying hey you got to eat at this place you got to eat here. Eli's was a very great

[01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:35.830]
steakhouse which we didn't get to but the day I did the show listen to this very important

[01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:39.630]
day I did the show somebody called and said you got to try Eli's and I said oh that's

[01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:47.150]
right across from our hotel. Well our friend our dear friend Jack got Eli's number and

[01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:51.890]
then got a list of all the hotels that are in the area right there by Eli's and it's

[01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:57.950]
sure enough here is the Ritz Carlton hotel which is where we were staying and then called

[01:11:57.950 --> 01:12:02.930]
this individual whose name is here in security and wouldn't you know just by coincidence and again

[01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:07.650]
I'm not suggesting anything I'm just saying it and bizarre coincidence the next day we had that

[01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:13.390]
episode and nearly got killed in our rent a car so you see when you keep them and of course this

[01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:17.410]
has a lot to do with what's on the year on the state that when we were staying in Chicago and

[01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:21.530]
nosing around and playing Sherlock Holmes this has nothing to do with anything and it's certainly

[01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:25.390]
not a his business or anyone else's but when you start messing around and I've an

[01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:29.410]
of course something happens then people are going to put two and two together and start

[01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:34.030]
assuming things you know what I mean so I think perhaps our friend is just overstepping his bounds

[01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:39.770]
to the point where who knows what's going on not of course to mention all these contacts with Dennis

[01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:51.730]
Oh well that's another thing yeah but I guess we better all govern ourselves accordingly we do

[01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:57.570]
have some open lines on the board now one in brown or at five two four W I O D and Boka and

[01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:03.570]
Palm Beach are as dead as the proverbial door nail yeah but he in three days thank goodness now he's

[01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:07.970]
got his healthy appetite back everything worked out nothing after a great meal like a great just

[01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:12.450]
stick with nor just stick with norm can I'm telling you if you would just listen to his radio show

[01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:17.350]
you'd you'd pick it up just from that show that that show is so brilliant you can you can

[01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:21.570]
perceive that anything you hand over to him you'll handle with brilliance and a plum

[01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:26.810]
you tell him about all that talent under one root guess yeah all the three there we were in that

[01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:33.110]
courthouse and there were the three greatest tacos in a history of broadcasting all in one building

[01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:41.330]
at the same time in a year Rogers Steve Kane and Norman Elliott it was shocking really was

[01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:45.390]
like they brought in extra security because they thought that you would never be the same

[01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.750]
oh my god that's right five hundred thousand listeners and two

[01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:57.790]
and Norm said I've got at least three or four because my friend listened and I said no I know

[01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:04.290]
you don't have any friends so cut the crap anyway twelve thirteen at W I O D and the Steve just

[01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:09.150]
eating like like he never saw food before he said first time in three days well that's

[01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:14.190]
her is thank goodness for that yeah by the way post abilities is bringing in tons of food to

[01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:22.850]
our remote it specs this Wednesday it says uh for riches grinning from earlobe to earlobe they'll

[01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:28.690]
have loads of sampler items pastas pastas salads and everything that's ever been invented okay so

[01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:33.930]
that's all the more reason I know is that for the crown or is that just for rich you'll have to

[01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:38.650]
come by and find out for yourselves and Dion's gonna be there too I know we'll feed Dion Miami hello

[01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:45.230]
Neil yeah speaking of cheap cigars and bad radio I'm glad Steve is there I was listening yesterday

[01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:49.670]
turn on my car radio in the afternoon and there's Stan right now you're gonna not start ripping

[01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:54.130]
Steve no no no no I realized the show wasn't much but you're not gonna start ripping him on no no no

[01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:58.330]
that's not what he was over the house last night and I promised him his birthday is that tomorrow I'm

[01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:02.530]
gonna take him to dinner that's not why I'm called he invited me to take him to dinner I didn't say

[01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:09.410]
it wasn't mine no no honestly I'm not calling to rip him but the thing that is amazing how did all

[01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:15.030]
the juniors know since it wasn't advertised every junior in the world that ever called him

[01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:19.730]
called yesterday oh that's the junior computer pipelines here they have they have got a computer

[01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:24.230]
thing a chip that they put in their computers and as anytime Stan is on here anywhere that immediately

[01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:29.870]
sent along it's amazing and the well but one thing I do want to get a little spire report he did

[01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:34.910]
go through the garbage yesterday and found that article about the Chicago AM station that's going

[01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:38.730]
talk yeah I threw that he mentioned to me last night that he saw and I thought to myself she I

[01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:42.890]
threw that in the waist basket how did so he was so desperate he was digging in the garbage well

[01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:50.670]
but I wanted to say he what his comment was that how that station went and tired every single nobody

[01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:56.810]
and lousy talk show host in the country yeah Stan if you're listening not everyone

[01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:03.690]
and that's I'm believe me I'm not that's no put down or nothing I've been listening to

[01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:10.230]
anyway listen the best of those tapes you've got to start doing it immediately of those letters

[01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:16.750]
by the I was hysterical when you're reading those letters if you got to do it okay well listen I

[01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:20.810]
only have enough here to last till two years from sookas so I'll see what we can do it one thing

[01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:26.390]
though how we miren and andy are all nickheads and this is the last day we can call people nickheads

[01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:32.150]
okay and govern yourself accordingly by you read open read on the air what I've been reading a lot

[01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:37.110]
of the stuff this is all public uh stuff now because it's public record well I read the one that he

[01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:43.830]
wrote to you you didn't hear that what did I do that no no this was about uh that I said something

[01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:51.070]
about you showered uh my daughters or something here's the one to Greg Budelle and here's a phone

[01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:56.690]
called the Dennis Collins uh eleven ten eighty eight uh there's also a little you know he's got

[01:16:56.690 --> 01:17:00.970]
these little notes in here and one of the notes that he couldn't sleep on November second because

[01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:04.390]
he was worried about what I would say on your show remember I came on your show before I started

[01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:09.190]
working here and here's a little note remember a Joe with three ends our friend Joe out there

[01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:14.070]
by the way Jack Joe is like 22 years old okay I guess that's still not old uh how old does

[01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:18.750]
somebody have to be before they can come into studio I mean I'm not saying that I would old

[01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:22.530]
enough to do something with them because that has to be over 80 I already know that Jack all right

[01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:27.130]
but I mean just to look at him and talk about they got to be like 40 50 you know what I'm

[01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:32.890]
interested in why is he talking to my old boss Dennis Collins from W.O. Wells is I don't know but

[01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:37.650]
there's sure a lot of conversations back and forth and there are letters and there is a relationship

[01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:43.310]
well for example November 7th 88 which is the day I started on W.O.D. it says Dennis Collins was

[01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:49.390]
talking into my machine from his car phone and uh goes on I mentioned that earlier but it's

[01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:53.430]
certainly bear mentioning again because there seems to be this somewhat incestuous relationship

[01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:58.010]
between and then here Neal's home April 1st Harlan and Bob were there Jack was busy outside

[01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:02.910]
surveying tag information request what you were in court yesterday you heard about these about

[01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:07.450]
this police investigation that Jack was conducting even though of course he's not a member of

[01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:12.870]
law enforcement but it's fascinating but the best one of all that was about the Hollywood movie

[01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:19.530]
theater though no that's fine you know what I think I got a copy from Norm of a lettery sent

[01:18:19.530 --> 01:18:26.770]
talking about how he had written Janet Reno oh yeah for relief okay and Norm pointed out to him

[01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:30.030]
you know it's interesting that you would expect relief from a lady who you falsely accused of

[01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:36.310]
being a lesbian during the year Jack say that oh my god anyway

[01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:42.350]
March 14th 89 Detective Murray remember that thing that was we'd affect the normal here on the show

[01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:46.050]
we talked about that Hollywood that terrible dirty theater with all those movies that you would

[01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:52.050]
enjoy well nobody talked he did talk to Detective Murray of course from the Hollywood police uh the

[01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:58.570]
vice-pig and it says Hollywood Rogers is known at theater for trying to pick up guys in theater

[01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:03.090]
in bathroom oh my god now I must say that's a that's a technique I've never learned yet although

[01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:07.750]
certainly I'll think about why did Jack has been surveying in well listen and then it says

[01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:14.890]
semen drips down theater seats and was when Murray was there once he's been doing a close-up

[01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:21.910]
and personal I mean even more he's safer wouldn't do investigative reporting like that

[01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:27.270]
we're wondering you guys say about Jackie's thorough well I don't know that's the word

[01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:34.650]
incredible anyway 12 9 10 W whatever it is and well listen I'm gonna give you my

[01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:41.550]
timber this weekend I'm going to Key West and there's this gay bar there they got this gigantic

[01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:46.210]
restroom okay it's incredible it's the size of Mount Rushmore can you give the phone number for

[01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:50.430]
Jack well no as a matter of fact that I found somebody's phone number on the wall there was

[01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:57.010]
of embarrassing uh coca-cola pre-killer hello yes deal I called you today well isn't that something

[01:19:57.010 --> 01:20:02.550]
uh it's amazing I could dial that past but anyway I left out something I was gonna call one of my

[01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:07.910]
friends which is the quain series Rodney's listen and tacking up his horse right now Rodney's

[01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:13.530]
an idiot sir Rodney is an idiot well that's an understatement of course correct but I'd like to

[01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:20.090]
call him and a couple other outriders douchebags of the most severe kind okay and that's a new movie

[01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:26.770]
coming out douchebags of the third kind and it is also a unique kind of guy really well it sounds

[01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:30.750]
like we got more investigating going on boy a lot of investigators in this time you all better

[01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:36.790]
govern yourselves and that's it okay thank you so much I can't believe Phil had a line today can

[01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:41.330]
you believe that that I never heard Phil Saltsman track it a really hysterical line but that was

[01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:45.770]
pretty good he said that the governor martina's not only looks like Bella LaGosie but he has

[01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:51.970]
something else in common they both suck which I thought was excellent anyway we got the cigars

[01:20:51.970 --> 01:20:56.470]
here and everybody's in a good mood and Steve is he was chain eating here like oh and I got

[01:20:56.470 --> 01:21:01.270]
another cigar that's right from Steve hmm well this is just a little one well I don't mean that

[01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:06.530]
literally but anyway we want to yeah I got to find that letter that he wrote to you on February

[01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:13.810]
the 8th February 13th 1988 busy day and a busy day was writing a Gregory Benjamin also I can't

[01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:17.030]
find him but I'll find him over the weekend I'll I'll redig through here and put him in order

[01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:23.090]

these two stations have been played migrale originally sung by the Temptations are written by

[01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:36.670]
Smoky Robinson but set to different lyrics the new song is used as a theme song for stand major

[01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:43.430]

upon any of your insurances that their lawyer or his clients might give you sincerely then there's

[01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:58.750]

[01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:18.770]
open lines here folks this is your last chance it's either either you call in now or we're going

[01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:26.990]
to eat celery on the air for last hour and a half okay that's your choice what is that oh from

[01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:33.110]
two to six p.m. oh the parents of murdered children's been postponed until Monday okay well we

[01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:37.030]
didn't want to get you to depressed for over the weekend so we're saving that one for Monday on

[01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:42.570]
Steve's show and then today p.m.s a killer two women whose problems with pre-menstrual syndrome

[01:23:42.570 --> 01:23:49.070]
nearly led them to murder plus dr. Gail Brown of the Florida p.m.s clinic and Alice on Monday morning

[01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:53.650]
when he returns from vacation has got b.m.s which is another sub Florida syndrome that his audience

[01:23:53.650 --> 01:24:00.970]
can relate to okay let's go to for Lauderdale hello hello Neil yes sir I'm thinking after hearing

[01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:05.850]
these things about your friend Jack that maybe he's just going out of his way to cover up his own

[01:24:05.850 --> 01:24:10.570]
little problems by picking on you you don't think so do you think he's got problems I think he's

[01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:15.590]
probably a closet a closet queen and uh it's probably going out of his way to prove just some hot

[01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:20.490]
to is by picking on you or maybe it's a jody foster syndrome maybe you should start watching over

[01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:23.590]
your shoulder maybe he's going to come to your house some night in the middle well he comes to my

[01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:28.370]
house uh the judge said yesterday that he's going to get his answer rested so I don't think he ought to

[01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:32.470]
come anywhere near my house well what's hope he does because he needs to be arrested he needs to put away

[01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:37.450]
well he needs some airing out I'll tell you that these are long rests somewhere absolutely true okay

[01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:42.870]
sir thank you you know it's an interesting question jack jack records and listen to this do you

[01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:49.330]
as these things you don't think he's looking today do well monitor what can I ask you this

[01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:56.050]
yes what else would he do he's got a lot of correspondence to catch up but do you think as he

[01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:59.650]
listens to these you know these factual things he's written come out over there do you think he is

[01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:05.770]
embarrassed by that no no he's outraged because he you know he just as sure as could be that we're

[01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:09.330]
twisting and distorting and of course he should it would be an expert at twisting and

[01:25:09.810 --> 01:25:12.950]
distorting because that's what he does to everything that I say on the air and he's been doing it

[01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:18.830]
for over two years now but the bloom is off the rose as Steve would say and jack you're just going

[01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:22.250]
to have to get used to it because this is only the beginning we're going to discuss in any damn time

[01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:26.130]
we feel like it and all of this stuff is a matter of public record we're going to get some good

[01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:31.090]
of holly Ridge strings music to play in the background as every day we'll have the best of jack and

[01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:35.570]
read some of these letters on the air I think it makes great radio yeah oh some of these are just

[01:25:35.570 --> 01:25:42.610]
in crowd almost as good as eating almost no that's pretty bad radio oh man some of these

[01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:25.770]
Maclotelle I thought he wasn't stunned well he was for a while in Europe and then they brought him

[01:26:25.770 --> 01:26:30.910]
back to racing again I I wish they would have retired him because I think I think they're really

[01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:35.670]
pushing their luck at this point he has nothing left to prove but they're still racing him

[01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:42.650]
he was a trot was like 250 thousand dollar trot at all right you didn't get down to Norwich

see done reciting he's done name got it baby you got it I think about that card I like the best

[01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:43.070]
is that it's so muffled you know I know it's perfect so it would fit on almost any station in

[01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:47.110]
the market like if you heard it on WLD with that muddy sound of theirs it would fit right in with

[01:27:47.850 --> 01:27:55.110]
okay open line in Boka 278 9463 and what in Palm Beach at 655 WIOD were Lee Fowler is really

[01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:34.010]
yet uh yeah I want to get to be here uh yeah in fact the fat Riches from there I just think that

[01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:40.950]
you know maybe like an only in to about a year about an hour and a half baby a day would be perfect

[01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:47.050]

[01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:51.290]
and a half well we'll do our best this is the most entertaining I've heard not that you're not

[01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:55.270]
always entertaining me oh but you know I'll tell you once we get into some of these letters boy you

[01:29:55.270 --> 01:30:00.950]
talk about entertaining talk about a live it imagination may you just it'll just uh open up new horizons

[01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:06.130]
for you well this is definitely plays into the heart of most people today with the new TV uh

[01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:10.170]
scandal shows that they have now you're doing it on radio for us it's wonderful yeah

[01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:15.110]
yeah now what do you think about that Dennis Collins the WNWS what do you think he's going to have

[01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:20.290]
to say for himself when we take his deposition in a few days uh oh what do you do for that me too

[01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:24.630]
are you gonna serve lunch I'll come to yeah we got something special we're gonna serve Dennis

[01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:30.850]
pardon the expression yeah all right okay see you in only at uh well don't forget to be true to

[01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:37.690]
your show this weekend Neil okay bye bye why a little hyper there wasn't it's a ducker 1232 at WIOD

[01:30:37.690 --> 01:30:44.650]
you're not suggesting there's more than one or two contacts with Dennis Collins numerous two

[01:30:44.650 --> 01:30:49.110]
numerous dimensions one or two hundred and that's only in this stack I haven't gotten to the other

[01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:54.190]
45 billion pages in the other room there yet would but I would like a conspiracy but I will I

[01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:58.090]
didn't say that see now I think you ought to just kind of remove yourself from all of this and just

[01:30:58.090 --> 01:31:03.070]
uh oh the question I don't I have now I would never allege such a thing because I know what I

[01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:08.070]
I don't think that Dennis as desperate as his ratings are and as geriatric as his demographics are

[01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:13.430]
and his tenuous as his job probably is with Jefferson pilot I don't imagine that Dennis would ever

[01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:17.430]
stoop to such a level because the things that I hear about him would indicate uh he might

[01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.710]
well that's why you see I would never say anything like that because what I've learned on the

[01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:29.270]
air is our job is to ask questions we're not there to get here to try to jump to contusions like

[01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:33.850]
Jack does and try to put two and two together and get eighty seven we're here to try to probe what's

[01:31:33.850 --> 01:31:38.590]
going on out there in radio like this thing you try to open your mind what pro you can't say

[01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:48.230]
you know trying to think of another alternate term but there aren't any there's several that came

[01:31:48.230 --> 01:31:54.650]
to mind but also in the same category could easily be misunderstood by alcyx up at the FCC in

[01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:59.530]
Washington and all these other great bureaucrats who are listening very very carefully to see who's

[01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:03.070]
naughty and who's that of course we know that there are a lot of great liberals like Jesse Helms

[01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:07.710]
and people of this ilk who are really very concerned that they want to keep everything in fact

[01:32:07.710 --> 01:32:12.550]
we could play tinkerbell every day for 24 hours and probably still be in a certain degree of

[01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:18.510]
absolute clinkerbell well you know what that tinkerbell I understand I know it's first of all

[01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:24.310]
first of all tinkerbells are fair to begin with that's correct that is correct well I guess Rick

[01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:30.150]
and Spud's are out of the closet after all 1234 at wio.d we do have an opening in bokeh man Nick

[01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:35.010]
is doing a hell of a business on that bat line today I got news for you he is taking orders so fast

[01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:41.190]
278 9463 is that bokeh number we desperately want to hear from bokeh and Delray because oh look

[01:32:41.190 --> 01:32:48.310]
at that is this the men's tennis oh that was martin I'm sorry 37 at wio.d we have an open line in

[01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:53.370]
the palm beach I feel like I've said that so many times this since I came back and of course Harvey

[01:32:54.150 --> 01:33:00.690]
Bennett what was his name Alex Marshall Alex Bennett Alex Trebek who did that show it's going to

[01:33:00.690 --> 01:33:05.510]
take me a good two weeks to get the audience back no you think I'm joking I'm serious it's going

[01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:09.370]
to take me two thousand weeks to get the whole audience back it's it's improving as each day

[01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:15.130]
goes by but he must have blown a good 90% of the audience right out the window he was great wasn't he

[01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:21.310]
happens every time you go on vacation now about 80% what are you saying when he does it it's about 80%

[01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:25.030]
what happens when I go on no no I don't know I didn't know what no no yeah well he doesn't

[01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:30.890]
what I go on I didn't you took it wrong your paranoia oh I took it wrong now what I what I what I

[01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:35.270]
meant now I don't know what I meant can I tell you what I know I take anything wrong yeah I know

[01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:40.890]
what I would no let me tell you what I meant all right take it back no what I meant was that

[01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:47.230]
I meant to imply that every time I go on vacation and you know the guest host said and it takes me

[01:33:47.230 --> 01:33:53.130]
like a week to get everybody back was what I meant I didn't mean you well I never sit in for me I

[01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:36.830]
time ago don't even get into that sir don't let's start getting into you know those things on a

[01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:41.970]
year what the Baker Act oh if you're familiar with the Baylor Act yes I am okay can I use you a

[01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:48.010]
serious question though you you're not a homeowner if yes I am you are yeah I don't own the

[01:35:48.010 --> 01:35:54.170]
home I live in he's talking about the Jim Baker Act in no not the Jim Baker Act seriously the

[01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:59.570]
Baker Act at the Jim Baker Act although I guess in his case it did apply it does for the net you

[01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:07.370]
are a homeowner I I was at one point in time sued for liable and it was covered under my homeowners

[01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:15.610]
insurance policy I didn't know you were a homeowner if you rent what what covers liable what are

[01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:20.130]
you talking about sir what what the hell the what does homeowners insurance have to do with liable

[01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:27.470]
no that's not liable it's liable liable you're a doctor absolutely oh my god I think you've been

[01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:32.290]
looking at too many of those lately sure it's 1240 20 to one at W I O D he told us in the

[01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:39.510]
beginning what kind of doctor you look and we have one open line in date 751 W I O D 7519 463 by

[01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:43.970]
the way you were I must say you're not right too often but you were absolutely right about Hank

[01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:47.470]
I mentioned that the other day but you couldn't hurt it because you were tied up with all that stuff

[01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:54.590]
um Hank is a douchebag he really is he's a putts I know he's my best friend and it pains me to say that

[01:36:54.590 --> 01:37:01.090]
what did he know it's no it's just true it's just this this ongoing viciousness this no not what

[01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:05.710]
he's done to me it's what he's attempting to do to you oh yeah well and I think you know fun and

[01:37:05.710 --> 01:37:10.110]
games is great and we can all like you know give and take and do the shots but when it when it's

[01:37:10.110 --> 01:37:15.610]
personal and vicious and when he it's intended to be vicious then it's a different story and I

[01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:21.990]
think Hank ought to really re-examine his entire agenda and govern himself accordingly I don't

[01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:27.090]
comment on Hank anymore but I agree no I didn't expect you I'm just I'm just telling you that you had

[01:37:27.090 --> 01:37:31.830]
an excellent point I think the audience shouldn't be sucked in by a guy who pretends to be this

[01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:37.750]
caustic uh rack on tour or whatever he is nor the nor the interesting enough the sales department

[01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:42.630]
he is going to members of the sales department betting them a hundred dollars I will not be here

[01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:47.430]
a month from today which is always helpful for morale in the sales department and I just keep

[01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:51.570]
running around to everyone he's been with asking if they can kind of double the bet and give me half

[01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:57.570]
so far he hasn't matched my thousand but what can I tell you I told Phil that and never

[01:37:57.570 --> 01:38:02.110]
never once another race had called her to call me and I personally would go over there to take

[01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:07.690]
the number down myself I will climb up onto the scoreboard you know the tote board in the infield I

[01:38:07.690 --> 01:38:11.710]
will personally climb up on there and take the number down myself you know also I was thinking if I

[01:38:11.710 --> 01:38:18.210]
was Mike Disney I would I would say that I would be very angry I would be very angry imagine your

[01:38:18.210 --> 01:38:25.110]
underwear bills if you were if I were Mike Disney I'd be very angry at mr. Gobert running around

[01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:29.650]
betting with the sales department on something like that which might deter them from selling the

[01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:35.150]
show and making money for the state Mike doesn't have time I do understand it your Mike this is with

[01:38:35.150 --> 01:38:40.450]
the FCC and Jack Thompson he's got his own agenda and he's got important things to take care of

[01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:46.130]
over and over and don't bother him with these little unimportant thoughts boy Laura certainly

[01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:49.950]
looks good I think she for she looks like she's going to be springing forth any day.

[01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:57.370]

[01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:08.930]
oh okay well I just wanted to say that I'm glad that both of you you and bird are both back

[01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:15.530]
from vacations I couldn't take much more of this show is without the two of you there at least

[01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:21.670]
bird by himself is even good I heard Alex was tremendous Disney told me that Alex Bennett was so good

[01:40:21.670 --> 01:40:26.770]
that was frightening I'm betting that I heard a little I thought it was frightening too I just wish

[01:40:26.770 --> 01:40:31.570]
they would have left bird by himself he does a great job I they hate him don't you understand they

[01:40:31.570 --> 01:40:35.310]
hate him with a mom I'm being honest with you there's no point in meeting around a bush they

[01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:41.230]
despise him they don't trust him they think he's untrustworthy he has no judgment no talent that

[01:40:41.230 --> 01:40:46.690]
by himself he absolutely sucks well I'm glad that the two you're back can you say what you just said

[01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:51.410]
on the not the sucks part can you say the other part can you say together on the radio no no it's

[01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:56.050]
being around the bush now we can't say that okay we take that back president's family gets very upset

[01:40:56.050 --> 01:41:01.630]
about that well I'm just glad that all the vacations are over I hope yeah ordinarily when you work

[01:41:01.630 --> 01:41:06.250]
at a real radio station you know vacations come and go and people fill in there no major problem

[01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:11.810]
and life goes on but here it's a gigantic upheaval you know when air vacations for anybody they just

[01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:16.230]
can't quite get their act together and they have all these bureaucratic people running around making

[01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:21.350]
these wild the neurotic decisions and bringing people are just got fired in to see how bad a job

[01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:26.910]
they can do it's it's great I have to give you a compliment of it Neil well going I've been following

[01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:33.910]
you for many how much I loved it like Alex did I've been following you for many many many years since

[01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:42.030]
you were like like Jack would you like some license plate numbers here's wait a minute April first Bob

[01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:51.030]
and Harlan here's that silver fox airway our silver fox pampered pines dfz no that's okay silver

[01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:57.370]
Toyota van I don't even know anybody who drives a Toyota silver van go ahead I have to say that you've

[01:41:57.370 --> 01:42:02.810]
been very very nice about the whole situation with mr. Thompson there I mean this has been going

[01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:07.970]
on for years and you've never really done anything you know you know what really we have been doing a

[01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:11.850]
lot of things behind the scenes we've been spending millions of dollars to try to get this goofball

[01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:16.670]
uh find him a life and do something else but about it that what really set me off was this

[01:42:16.670 --> 01:42:22.170]
Chicago business this page that's got all these notes when we're in Chicago having a good time and

[01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:27.010]
having a few meals and seeing some ball games and just there to have a good weekend and this puts

[01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:32.710]
is out there making phone calls to arrest them confused what was the purpose that was to find out

[01:42:32.710 --> 01:42:37.450]
where we were staying what was the purpose beyond that you'd have to ask him I don't know all I

[01:42:37.450 --> 01:42:42.870]
know is what happened to us the next day I'm very proud that you guys have been just so good on

[01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:47.250]
the air about it and this guy just looks like a total jerk in the paper and you know everything

[01:42:47.250 --> 01:42:53.010]
else that he's done and it's about time you guys get to say stuff about it I mean it's well you're

[01:42:53.010 --> 01:42:57.190]
going to hear a lot about it including our regular daily feature okay so Jack's going to have to stay

[01:42:57.190 --> 01:43:03.290]
real close to home taping will not be sufficient he really deserves anything you guys give him now

[01:43:04.090 --> 01:43:09.730]
I mean you guys have been just so good about all this guys of doing it because he's concerned about

[01:43:09.730 --> 01:43:14.730]
the airwaves and about public these and in the meantime he's in no tracking us down everywhere we go

[01:43:14.730 --> 01:43:19.790]
and snooping around the house and taking our license plate numbers and contriving in his mind conjuring

[01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:24.110]
up all these illicit things that are going on in the house and I went to Vegas with some people so

[01:43:24.110 --> 01:43:29.110]
therefore you see he believes I guess that anybody you meet you have sex with so I guess he must be

[01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:33.790]
living very limited circles because they don't look like he's had too much lately but I get a lot

[01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:38.450]
of people yeah so I hope that's not true but quite frankly I think I guess he figures that's the

[01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:42.970]
only kind of relationships that people engage in oh it's really a shame that the man has nothing

[01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:47.350]
helps in nothing nothing else to do zero it's all I will tell you something you'll find very

[01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:52.570]
amusing and looking through thousands of these pages so far I have found three or four pages that

[01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:58.570]
are not directly related to me or this however they are phone calls made to places where they

[01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:04.070]
sell videotapes see what he does is he records these shows on the audio on vcr and videotape every day

[01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:09.770]
and he's trying to buy videotapes in bulk at a lower price so that's the only other calls I found

[01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:15.730]
that aren't directly related to the erudges only peripherally but I think I might lately I saw

[01:44:15.730 --> 01:44:20.750]
a little of it the other day and I can't I can't handle it Holly was there with Roger in the same

[01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:26.270]
room and Roger's a good guy and I can't deal with him it's getting really bad don't you see we have a

[01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:31.630]
real-life soap opera here but they bring in best that kind of occupies is well you're soap opera is good

[01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:37.910]
but and it's real but it's that's the best car yeah exactly we can turn off guiding light

[01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:45.150]
yeah turn off yours excellent point well thanks again have a great weekend glad you guys are both back

[01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:21.570]
Sasha and wide double knit and the war never seemed to go out of style standing to believe

[01:46:21.570 --> 01:46:27.630]

they're so clever back there net sales department you know what especially Jeff Clark

[01:46:41.730 --> 01:46:47.370]
there is a guy with a said now I was cute for him especially because his sense of humor is

[01:46:47.370 --> 01:46:52.530]
sewn on his sleeve it's amazing they have to sew it on really what I heard he has an iron on

[01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:57.990]
a sense of humor anyway we do have an open line in brow which causes me great pain and consternation

[01:46:57.990 --> 01:47:03.210]
at 524 W I O D but your safe could Steve stepped out momentarily so now they'll start lighting up

[01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:08.930]
Miami hello hello Neil yeah yeah I think there's a torture host is going to take some of the

[01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:13.950]
the heat off of your rear end so to speak Alice Rantell is going to have Jerry Butler

[01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:23.450]
dressed as a motorcycle cop administering a breathalyzer test yeah I have a feeling and of course he

[01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:27.990]
probably can get ringside tickets because he seems to have a lot of good friends over there okay

[01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:31.350]
well we wish it a better luck I covering yourself accordingly take care

[01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:37.830]

[01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:42.710]
a communicator case back and forth and Dennis is this and Dennis said that and Dennis said Tim

[01:47:42.710 --> 01:47:47.230]
Williams said this and Tim Williams said that he was tickled a death that Disney would hire him

[01:47:47.230 --> 01:47:51.830]
and hope that he didn't back out at the last minute etc etc and on and on and on because I was

[01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:56.730]
a bitter pill for them to swallow over there at W I and C's last say to four because they wanted

[01:47:56.730 --> 01:48:01.390]
to be consistent right across the board and to once stand and I left there man they are there

[01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:07.150]

[01:48:42.670 --> 01:48:51.450]
good flip your week 11 4 88 Dennis Collins uh-huh he sought Tim Williams today and he admitted

[01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:57.870]
they never could sell Roger show right also Williams was hoping Disney would sign Rogers and

[01:48:57.870 --> 01:49:03.790]
was afraid Disney would back out I called to tell Dennis Kane had compounded the defamation

[01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:11.270]
so that's our little tidbit from 11 4 88 three days before we started on the year here's a matter

[01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:16.610]
fact now I remember couldn't sell a show 12 minutes an hour we used to add it up they add and then

[01:49:16.610 --> 01:49:20.270]
they added two more minutes because the show was oversold they had said demand they had a waiting

[01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:25.610]
list to get on the show on Zeta I remember I remember a fit eight months we were sold out you through a

[01:49:25.610 --> 01:49:30.870]
fit at the sales department what time member it's like it was yesterday because they went over 12 minutes

[01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:37.210]
and I remember what you said to them you said to them you can put all the spots you want on there

[01:49:37.210 --> 01:49:41.490]
but after 12 minutes that's all we're going to run you had to throw a fit to get them to hold it to

[01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:48.510]
12 minutes that they were lined up business trying to get on that show but they couldn't sell it

[01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:56.570]
enormous rates top rates but they couldn't sell it now now come Tim wrote that memo that said

[01:49:56.570 --> 01:50:02.110]
that I was responsible for a third of all the billing on both stations that's correct at least they

[01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:07.410]
couldn't sell it where did all that billing come from I used to hear the spots every morning there

[01:50:07.410 --> 01:50:12.390]
were 12 minutes an hour wow maybe this is all just a dream or a fantasy because you can't imagine

[01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:17.330]
that Tim would make up something like that and that Dennis Dennis would repeat it could you believe

[01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:24.910]
that man Dennis seems to be involved in the zongoing day-to-day conversations quite heavily

[01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:29.850]
doesn't it yeah we're finding out that's Dennis Collins a general manager at WNW

[01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:35.170]
once were of our competitors which would be I mean if that were true that would be so embarrassing

[01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:40.930]
to find out that he's by kind of been maybe it's right I mean in fact that Jack wrote it doesn't

[01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:48.090]
make it so we have to give Dennis the benefit of the doubt don't we do we it's eight minutes past

[01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:52.630]
one at WIOD we have an open line in Broward well there's a lot of stuff in here that we've been

[01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:57.210]
waiting for for a long time to be able to piece together and then of course that incredible

[01:50:57.210 --> 01:51:03.270]
Chicago masterpiece with those phone numbers and phone calls and I don't know I don't know about

[01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:07.210]
you but I sure wouldn't want to be involved in snooping around in a situation where four people

[01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:13.010]
nearly got killed in a rented car you know what I'm saying four-lawterdale hello hi Neil hi I

[01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:17.370]
just wanted to find out I've been listening to you I guess since the FM station I guess about a year

[01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:22.110]
you're in a house oh you mean the one where they couldn't sell the show yeah I remember that

[01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:26.470]
not to take an insulting I was just curious how long that you've been a radio talk show host how

[01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:31.370]
long you've been doing this not to take it in insulting well I just was curious if you've been doing

[01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:36.390]
this a long long time how many years I was missing your show oh 17 17 years in Florida

[01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:41.370]
so I've missed your show for quite a while well it's really not much according to some you know

[01:51:41.370 --> 01:51:46.730]
missing much I also wanted to recommend I don't know when your next vacation's coming up but I

[01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:49.790]
just got back from I'll be happy to tell you where I'm going and listen I'll give you the name

[01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:53.650]
of a restaurant close by so you can call in and find out which hotel I'm

[01:51:53.650 --> 01:52:00.250]
okay well I just got back from Lake Tahoe and I would recommend out to anybody it's a great spot

[01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:05.450]
can I tell you a little story sure years ago I was out in California I was I think I was in

[01:52:05.450 --> 01:52:09.990]
Sacramento and I said to myself well yeah I think I'll drive over to Tahoe you know it's not that far

[01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:16.830]
hmm and there's a there's like a fork in the road there and if you go to the right you go into

[01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:21.830]
the city there with all the casinos and if you go straight there's this winding narrow road that

[01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:27.370]
goes all the way around Lake Tahoe okay and it's about 50 miles out of the way oh man it's not always

[01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:31.650]
if 50 miles out of the way but it's this winding thank goodness it was in the summertime and it was

[01:52:31.650 --> 01:52:36.570]
breathtaking view but it's the most dangerous road in the winter they close it all together and

[01:52:36.570 --> 01:52:40.570]
there are these places that you have to actually come to a full stop and make almost a hundred

[01:52:40.570 --> 01:52:44.470]
eight degree turn to keep going back up the mountain you know and and you look down there no

[01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:48.810]
guard rails or anything and you look down and there there's the lake and all these rapids and it's

[01:52:48.810 --> 01:52:53.950]
breathtaking view but it's a it's a nightmare of a ride you know but did you enjoy the trip no it's

[01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:58.090]
great I came back and I thought it was just one of the greatest spots in the world yeah it's beautiful

[01:52:58.090 --> 01:53:01.710]
wasn't sure if you'd been there or not and I figured I'd recommend it to you yeah I'd recommend it to

[01:53:01.710 --> 01:53:06.370]
anybody it's it really is beautiful well that's all I wanted to let you know I enjoy your show and

[01:53:06.370 --> 01:53:11.670]
hope to listen for the next 17 years okay thanks a lot thanks boy 11 after one at WIOD we have an

[01:53:11.670 --> 01:53:14.750]
open line in broad I'm not going to give the boken palm beach line there's nobody calls on those

[01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:20.970]
anyway I'm tired of exerting and the reexerting and just wasting a lot of needless energy on that

[01:53:20.970 --> 01:53:24.310]
those people are not a part of the show they're not a part of the state they're not a part of the

[01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:28.050]
planet they're just they're just like vegetating I think it's probably appropriate that we have

[01:53:28.050 --> 01:53:32.390]
someone on both the line who's called veggie and they because they're just kind of in a vegetative state

[01:53:34.130 --> 01:53:38.730]
Florida in Broward though there is one open line if you move very very fast because the line is

[01:53:38.730 --> 01:53:44.330]
forming all the way to the rascal house 524 WIOD if you want to be a part of this big one to 2 hour

[01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:48.790]
even if you have absolutely nothing to say what makes you any different from the restaurant here's

[01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:55.070]
a mobile and brown or hello a meal how are you great I'm just on the first time caller I've only

[01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:59.930]
been listening to show about three months now virgin caller well maybe we can get you together

[01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:04.650]
with a reverend virgin wait can you say virgin on the air though no I didn't think so but what I'd

[01:54:04.650 --> 01:54:09.450]
like say is I've you know I didn't know anything about the story is going on and everything I've

[01:54:09.450 --> 01:54:15.390]
been hearing you say about this guy Jack Thompson is he supposedly a Christian or something oh yes

[01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:20.670]
very much so born again Christian and you know they don't hate the center but they hate the

[01:54:20.670 --> 01:54:25.270]
sin you heard that line well well what I was going to say Neil is that I'm a Christian and I

[01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:29.910]
listen to your radio and you know I don't agree with but some things you say and some things I

[01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:34.930]
really like what you say but for a man who claims to be a Christian and calling himself calling

[01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:40.070]
self that to harass you and to do something like that it's a very Christian like well if you could

[01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:44.910]
read these letters in the language in the tone and the threats of these letters in the lies and

[01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:50.230]
the twisted distortions of what I say on the air certainly nobody who was really a Christian could

[01:54:50.230 --> 01:54:55.130]
possibly you know do these things but then again they're throughout history people have

[01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:59.930]
masked themselves behind alleged religion you know even Tarky modest said he was a Christian

[01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:05.730]
right and Hitler at his SS had you know God is on our side on their belt buckles and thought that

[01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:09.770]
they were Christians too so just calling yourself something doesn't make it so that's right you

[01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:13.890]
know I just want to let you know just because you know what he says he's doing it isn't really

[01:55:13.890 --> 01:55:18.590]
you know backing up is supposedly a lifestyle that really that's what it is you know I just want

[01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:22.790]
to let you know that you know I really enjoy your show and like you said if you don't like something

[01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:27.570]
that you say you can always turn the dial exactly and but I really appreciate you know you guys not

[01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:33.210]
slamming him that that shows more character and morals on your part than I think it does on his part

[01:55:33.210 --> 01:55:37.250]
well we certainly are looking to twist or manipulate any of the things that he said or to try to

[01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:42.130]
see imply crimes where there aren't any or have any investigations all we want is to go ahead

[01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:47.190]
and live our lives and do our thing and have him find a new hobby you know right okay have a great

[01:55:47.190 --> 01:55:53.190]
week you two deal by 113 at W.I.O.D. and open line in date now if you move real fast okay this is

[01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:04.890]

during these hours he's very broken up about it as a matter of fact during this break I'm going to

look through and find that note about jack's conversation with Nick before I came on the air

[02:02:17.710 --> 02:02:23.970]
which is devastating it really exposes Nick for the homophobic neurotic douche bag that he really is

[02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:56.310]

many people in law enforcement listen to this show they love this show sure let me ask for the

[02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:48.770]
upset about that but they all of this show i think it's something about police officers and the

[02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:54.350]
most people don't know they have got to have a unique personality and a unique sense of humor or

[02:07:54.350 --> 02:08:00.530]
they don't last very long yeah i would think so first with all the fun and so are we with all the

[02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:04.590]

[02:12:22.990 --> 02:12:27.910]
yeah he was great that's what the crowd said too is they were trying to lynch him on the way out i know

[02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:33.610]
but i got a question for you seriously um but the problems you have it okay let's say

[02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:40.390]
it happened to a judge that would be ended real quickly hey i got news for you if any judge in this

[02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:44.090]
town was getting the harassment that i'm beginning for two years and having people snoop around their

[02:12:44.090 --> 02:12:48.530]
houses and write down license plate numbers and make a general nuisance of themselves and calling

[02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:52.910]
all over the country to find out where they were staying on vacations uh you know as well as i do

[02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:57.070]
boy they would did the stiff arm of the law would come down so fast that our friend wouldn't know

[02:12:57.070 --> 02:13:00.710]
what hit him that's right that's the point i'm trying to make well you know most of these joe i'm

[02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:04.150]
sorry you know my attorney friends they seem to think that some of these judges are really hot

[02:13:04.150 --> 02:13:08.290]
child and some of them are okay but there are some in this town man i wouldn't give you a 15

[02:13:08.290 --> 02:13:12.670]
cents for them they're just a bunch of pseudo intellectual douchebags and they look at everything

[02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:17.750]
like it's some kind of intellectual exercise as opposed to a day in and day out life you know when

[02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:22.510]
you got somebody that's devoting their entire existence to ruining your life and i'm not exaggerating

[02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:28.370]
uh then you really got a real story going on you know i'll tell you this and and you know it and

[02:13:28.370 --> 02:13:32.890]
and for the yo yo that's listening i know hundreds of people and i've turned on literally

[02:13:32.890 --> 02:13:37.090]
dozens to your show over the years when you were straight talking also when you went to the

[02:13:37.090 --> 02:13:42.450]
stick type talk and they all love it straight talk straight straight straight straight talk

[02:13:43.330 --> 02:13:50.030]
can't say that no that'll really confuse jack but i've been listening to you for probably eight

[02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:55.410]
nine years and i don't know any i i got a change that i know one person that complained about it out

[02:13:55.410 --> 02:14:00.610]
of hundreds that i know yeah and i bet you they turned it off but you had a matter of fact he did

[02:14:00.610 --> 02:14:07.190]
yeah he turned it off isn't that a revolutionary idea but you know a lot of people out here that

[02:14:07.190 --> 02:14:11.830]
really enjoy your show and i'm not trying to you know suck up to you in any any way i mean it

[02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:16.610]
legitimately because it's it's kind of tiring when you get good stuff on the air good entertainment

[02:14:16.610 --> 02:14:22.190]
stuff that people enjoy and you get some meatball in the name of whatever he's doing it in yeah that

[02:14:22.190 --> 02:14:26.290]
wants to wants to knock it off and ruin it for everybody else he's got a finger you know he could

[02:14:26.290 --> 02:14:30.670]
use it to turn the dial over whatever he wants to do with it but he doesn't have to pull this kind

[02:14:30.670 --> 02:14:34.110]
of garbage and there's a lot of people that are pretty hot about it you know there's another

[02:14:34.110 --> 02:14:38.150]
interesting thing and looking through all his ramblings here in the dates on them he very clearly

[02:14:38.150 --> 02:14:43.430]
lied in front of one of our judges here in date county a few months ago when we had a hearing because

[02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:47.710]
he kept emphasizing over and over again that didn't want to get me off the air didn't want to

[02:14:47.710 --> 02:14:51.550]
deprive me of alive there because he knows that's a separate actionable thing and then all he

[02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:56.870]
wanted to do is clean up the act and yet in this series of thousands of letters and notes and so

[02:14:56.870 --> 02:15:01.350]
on it just repeated over and over again must be gotten off the air shouldn't be on the year he

[02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:05.070]
recently wrote a letter to senator in a way up in Washington about how I shouldn't be behind

[02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:09.030]
a microphone and no business being on here so on the one hand he will say for public consumption

[02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:12.950]
that he's just trying to clean up the air waves and on the other hand he's trying to attempt to

[02:15:12.950 --> 02:15:17.390]
deprive me of a livelihood even if I sit here reading nursery rhymes he still wants me off the

[02:15:17.390 --> 02:15:21.230]
air well I'll tell you something if I had somebody haunting my life for two years like you do I don't

[02:15:21.230 --> 02:15:26.750]
know how you uh it ain't easy okay it ain't easy I think I would have fallen apart and done

[02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:31.470]
something else myself well but I wish you a lot of luck and I know an awful lot of thousands of

[02:15:31.470 --> 02:15:35.790]
people do and we hope you stay on the air forever I'm not going anywhere believe me and you and the

[02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:41.770]
bird got a terrific show okay thanks a lot okay 141 at W outing now it says hotline fandom call

[02:15:41.770 --> 02:15:46.510]

[02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:24.050]
two weeks I did in July they were like I said I know they were well you don't know that now you

[02:17:24.050 --> 02:17:27.190]
don't know that because it's four weeks now the two other weeks that I was you're gonna

[02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:31.130]
rephrase it let me rephrase it let me rephrase it let me rephrase it the two weeks that I was

[02:17:31.130 --> 02:17:36.670]
here out of those four could have been an eight and two weeks that I wasn't here but listen could

[02:17:36.670 --> 02:17:42.410]
have been a four and that average is out to a six great I'm not saying it was or they will know very

[02:17:42.410 --> 02:17:47.210]

[02:17:47.210 --> 02:17:52.150]
out for if you're that can we go into the day but I'm not if you're that positive that you were

[02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:55.890]

[02:17:55.890 --> 02:18:02.090]
over you out in fact when I was here they probably went down quite a bit I'm just saying it stayed

[02:18:02.630 --> 02:18:08.910]
through July that's all I meant I'm real happy about that I'm real pleased that the numbers
