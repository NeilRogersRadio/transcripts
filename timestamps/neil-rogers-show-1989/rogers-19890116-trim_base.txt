[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.800]
now you know some of these other activities have chosen to include some of

[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.680]
these these silly minority groups

[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.600]
well we have decided to concentrate just on the angle of facts and

[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.480]
protestant angle of the super bowl

[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.120]

[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.780]

[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.220]

[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.380]
we will be providing

[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.880]
cooperation with local church is a Christian petting zoo

[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.200]
that children will either have the chance of petting some of our local

[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.080]
christians

[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.260]
who have decided they will be patented

[00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.020]
or they can pet cute little bunnies and white mice

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.500]
now we're also offering male

rick shawks

[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.240]
oh yeah that does it for me now the grand finale

[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.180]
this is really going to split this city on its side

[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.500]
we're going to melt down giant large statues of a children white christian

[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.720]
player from each of the competing kings

[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.500]
now once they are melted down we will have a communal

[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.680]
lot pool in the center of the mindy show country

[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.020]
we will invite all citizens to come in and swim

[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.060]
gleefully and express his christian emotions in a post and bishop will be hosting

[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.280]
this event as always

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.940]
as always yeah and of course any Canadians that are welcome by we are as always

[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.220]
we are offering three hours for all of them

[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.080]
you know it breaks my heart so to go by these trailer parks where they live and see them watching

[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.740]
their clothing in the water fountain

[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.960]
and

[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.020]
anyway near I'd say just think life is grand and of course I am praying for you

[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.040]
I am praying

[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.420]
well keep it up as they say

[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.380]
okay

[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.260]
you can listen and I have for half hour 45 minutes

[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.380]
and there is absolutely nothing on the air except this guy is a jerk that lady is a

[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.800]
whatever and so it on and on and on and on

[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.460]
1240s fall apart but they all work just don't touch him that's all

[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.580]
I had a little chat with Mitch on the way up

[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.660]
yes and told him that you loved his work

[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.320]
I do love his work he's the best

[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.200]
I said what does that mean was that sarcastic no we had some problems in here last week

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.000]
and he came in and he said don't mess with these other people they're wonderful

[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.760]
but they're all in work release just come to me and out of here the overhead

[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.580]
we got complete control over it and we can turn it off or we can crank it up

[00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.760]
oh

[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.020]
nice to have a high chair that's sunny chair but sunny is in California for bad

[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.140]
to be in here that's Henry's chair Henry when he does a little wine tasting and

[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.980]
resets in that chair

[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.460]
no I want you to sit in that chair for just a second

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.580]
so you can understand when you're sipping a little bit of wine Henry's very big in a way

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.660]
I don't know I just keep sitting there for a second

[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.820]
and it goes down so you drop down and then that isn't that good

[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.540]
it's something erotic about that chair I don't know what it is

[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.980]
I think we know why sunny sits in here all the time so what are you doing Stan

[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.160]
just a drop by just was in the neighborhood probably was over the florist for a little lunch

[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.240]
I figured you would have the lunch here

[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.840]
oh do you want food?

[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.500]
sure

[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.140]
you think Carmine is listening to that

[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.700]
I'd go for a salad I know that well it's 1140 only you know what no it's not really

[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.040]
he's doing so great on his diet I am 29 pounds

[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.480]
well we are what you ought to do is really you ought to start ordering the really big stuff down

[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.600]
the really good stuff down

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.540]
the big big z-d

[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.020]
it doesn't bother me

[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.640]
the only thing that bothers me are when they bring in like three of those giant cheesecakes

[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.320]
that bothers me

[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.820]
even the key lime pie the other day now you panic because you thought I was going to eat the whole thing

[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.380]
you started like it when you opened I heard that

[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.400]
yeah but luckily I had a new truss system spot coming up and that kind of tempered my thinking

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.680]
I thought boy this is embarrassing

[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.960]
the one thing that I would go to Hollywood Saturday I didn't eat a thing

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.920]
I drank the avion water and I was it

[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.040]
you probably couldn't have gotten near the food

[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.720]
no no people out there anyway Joe was there early really

[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.900]
I want to I want to find out what you eat at the track because you go to the track you talk about the horses

[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.040]
you talk about the race one and I talk about everything but craft of iced tea

[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.220]
and a bowl of onion soup and Linda gives me hell about the onion

[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.060]
it's got a lot of salt and I say Linda trust me how many onions does it have in it the whole thing

[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.100]
yeah I have to count the onion if I count my green all of it

[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.700]
so Carmine's listening stand would love that big z-d

[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.960]
I bet that for us has got great big z-d

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.320]
oh that would be great I haven't eaten too well lately

[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.680]
and they're they're right up the street see so there's no problem they'll probably bring it by

[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.320]
or something like that even though it is a holiday they are open to they are

[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.300]
I assume so this is a weird holiday yeah I don't mean to be demeaning to Dr. King

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.080]
but you know I wish we should you know I wish we'd get ourselves together in this country

[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.320]
I mean we're either going to do it or we're not going to do it

[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.380]
a lot of people don't want to open for us like that town of New Jersey

[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.180]
where they wanted to change the name of the street and one of the black politicians

[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.120]
so we don't want to do it because it'll give the area a bad image

[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.000]
we won't be able to sell any real estate because people will think it's in all black neighborhood

[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.860]
this was a black politician who said that

[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.200]
well listen I thought I was down on my luck until some friends in our neighborhood

[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.340]
two children young child and older boy went skiing up in New Jersey this weekend

[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.100]
both broke something two kids in one fall isn't that part of the whole thing

[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.080]
but isn't that part of the thing when you go skiing used to break a leg or something

[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.520]
two two children I mean one did it like on on Friday I think and another did it on Sunday

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.280]
well you know what they say the family that skis together oh less is together

[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.940]

[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.560]

well it's no no they were good it's just that in the very beginning what got me

[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.580]
a little nervous is because there was one line lit and usually when we sit down

[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.680]
they're like four or five lit already we don't have to even give the numbers out

there at 524 W I O D let's go to Miami hello

[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.640]
they all got a question for Stan Stan where did that come from the thing with Don Johnson

[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.540]
uh that the new plays all the time that it came out of an interview when I had Michael

[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.440]
top it on the show Don called in I think I've always wondered that when you'll play it all

[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.340]
time I wonder how that came about and the very last thing I asked Don before he hung up

[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.620]
was if he would say freeze major Miami vice needs it and you know what he said I don't

[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:06.020]
need a damn history lesson the answer the answer is so funny the way he says it you know

[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.380]
it's just yeah that done in his wildest dreams he never he never dreamed and the real story is and we can laugh

[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.520]
on it now but it was serious business back then Stan got very because Stan played the

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.240]
entire interview about 40 times on the year because it was long and it killed a lot of time

[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:26.120]
but he left out conveniently that closing portion of the interview so I somehow somebody

[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.080]
slipped me the hell on now you know I played it all the real story three day

[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.080]
I'll tell it from your van really please this man didn't speak to either one of us and finally one day

[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.160]
we had somebody go down a hall at about a quarter to two and drag him out of the office

[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.580]
and bring him in for peacemaking on the right and the only reason he came in is because we stop

[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:51.480]
playing it now he does he's to do the to this day he does not know the real story behind that well that's the way

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.140]
I remember it just the way you told it no no absolutely not because we were recording the

[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:04.320]
Talbot show on the big reels and when john's johnson came on at the end of an hour at the end of a

[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.220]

[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.600]
in all these, it probably got Lee Fauard, Disney 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2013 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 ball

[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:24.360]
o the astral

[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.740]
of seeing that alone i decided to wait for the one cable to see it

[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.320]
uh... uh...

[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.000]
uh... the one good thing about that is you'll be able to turn it off

[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.420]
yeah and foot foot something else now i will say this one guy in the theater

[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.680]
i would say in his fifties

[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.160]
he did after about a half hour he got up and walked out and i was wondering i

[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.580]
thought i wonder if he's going to the john

[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.060]
night blister and tell

[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.220]
and you know seriously no i'm not not getting him he just walked out he never came

[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:51.740]
back

[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.920]
and i don't blame them

[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.260]
this one of those movies will be on cable about two weeks

[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.780]
but i'm thinking about three months

[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.860]
they're going to be desperate to get to do

[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.220]
lead something out of this

[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.560]
well without even seeing and i'm waiting for them

[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.640]
trust me great

[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.320]
great area

[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.540]
by ticket

[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.180]
by

[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.860]
how's your

[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.040]
speaking cable how's your cable coming in

[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.240]
very good

[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.920]
a channel six was coming in like a real tv station

[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.660]
Saturday night because of the rain

[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.000]
all i see well i've been spirit once in a while but uh... yesterday

[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.040]
sick was so bad it was like

[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.780]
not a shadow was like a shadow of a shadow the worst it's ever coming

[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.280]
anybody to you were on the front page of the sun sent on sunday now

[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.160]
yeah about your satellite dish

[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.800]
absolutely about my satellite i don't have what about it

[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.520]
uh... story about the the way people are retaliating against the cable

[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.100]
companies by buying the light dishes and i think i'm putting back up now i

[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.840]
already talk to the guy i haven't read the story i was told this on paraphrasing

[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.220]
of but something about don't make the mistake that neal rogers of w i o d

[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.140]
by not going through all of the uh... you know the red tape

[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.840]
in getting

[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.640]
the the zoning and and all that kind of thing setting it up because you can get

[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.360]
the big problem

[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.280]
wasn't anything negative who's just you know warning people

[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.440]
sounds real positive yeah

[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.380]
well i didn't make the mistake it's the day up right that they said don't believe

[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.940]
what the salesman oh yeah because a lot of it was life i companies will just

[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.900]

[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.700]
any problem will

[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.780]
will follow with you and they don't follow through they don't do a damn thing

[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.760]
once they got your money you're on your own you know

[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.840]
and that was the problem but i'm a page of some it will be done

[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:30.140]
because my landlady said all my anything you want cut the tree down anything

[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.380]

[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.360]
yeah I did a lot you know I want to keep myself when I walked

[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.780]
out there I felt compelled to see it because like for example Tom jikka just

[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.400]
called me during the news yeah and they're writing a big thing about it in the

[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.480]
sun sentinel and I had calls from where was it from that paper in Dallas

[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.700]
mm-hmm well I got to see why they would do it because a movie was based in

[00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.140]
Dallas but you know so you feel because it's about your

[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.940]
profession that you're compelled to go see it but I'm not exaggerating it was so

[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.880]
bad that you just boring and you're waiting for something different and it never

[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.220]
changes it never changes how was it technically was it okay technically no it

[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.720]
was horrible what do you mean technically as far as uh... you know they

[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.280]

on long plate where he just he's just filled that over and over again and whatever I can

[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.560]
you ought to go see talk radio because I was saying before if you really have two hours to kill

[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:46.320]

man it really but that's from Greenland greenland yeah Greenland that call yeah right next to

[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.040]

right that's scary don't we have well too bad we don't have something in his on tape you know a

little card something yeah he cut any promo's while he was here of his voice no no he wasn't here

[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:13.480]
long enough huh although he did I will say that he did mention the call iters a couple of times

[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.700]
which is moving up in the world okay I'm sure on CAU they probably say you know once a week

[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:22.480]
Alan give those call iters it's not bad CAU they don't care don't think no they don't have any

[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.700]
numbers anyway oh you know how he's following you're holding right yes and I said I'd come right

[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:33.040]
back and we're munching around here go another call I'm sorry all right we want to go back on hold

[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:40.380]
no no don't do that okay listen I saw the uh as I said door radio yeah and uh you know within

[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:45.980]
minutes I knew the guy guy was going to die I there's I felt no empathy for the guy you knew it

[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:51.360]
or you were hoping it I felt I mean I could really you hate the guy obviously you know the guy

[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:57.400]
was sick um didn't you get the feeling from the way some of the other people kept looking at him

[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.600]
that some of the people inside the building wanted to finish the job off didn't you oh yeah

[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:08.100]
yeah there's you know the scene with him in the basketball game here nobody likes the guy

[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:12.320]
who is listening to him yeah that's a good thing but he's stay on the radio as you listen to

[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:16.520]
that show that he was doing you realize nobody could be listening except all those misfits that

[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.220]
were calling in yeah that that was I found that fascinating that the only people that would

[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:29.640]
call in were the maniacs yeah that there weren't any any uh minorly decent people no the not a one

[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:35.880]
see that's where it lost all her credibility every single call was another sick character wacko

[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:43.140]
a drunk a hillbilly redneck douchebag not see uh whatever I mean or always it was like one person

[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:48.220]
calling with a slightly different voice I felt like I was underwater the whole movie I really

[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:52.840]
felt like I was drowning yeah I wish I would have been really and I wrote with my wife I was surprised

[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:57.560]
that she didn't walk out and after the first half hour yeah but uh listen some Ray Man trivia

[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:03.460]

[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:13.320]

[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:59.520]
fabulous movie just made one mistake when I went to see it I saw it in the theaters across from

[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:05.300]
century village and deer field oh come on you should know better well I should but it was

[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:12.240]
started it was the earliest latent or the latest early movie I could find but despite all of that

[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.720]
it was still very enjoyable even though they were complaining about not being able to see because

[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:24.640]
the people in front of them were too tall they should have a special theater for those people

[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.920]
you know I mean yeah I'm surprised they went at night you know it's full price yeah the only time

[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:35.680]
to go if you're going to a theater like that is to go in the very last movie yeah late at night well

[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.640]
that that was the mistake I made hopefully I'll learn from it how you doing Stan I'm doing great

see that's a one nice thing about floris it's right up the street and we're pretty far now one

[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:46.880]
very nice lady came by Toyota 1254 WI O'Neal we got a collar in Fort Pierce hello hey hi how

[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.960]
you guys doing great I was just calling no I've been hearing you know you guys are talking a lot

[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:57.740]
this morning about talk radio and all and I haven't seen movie myself and you know even though you

[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:02.460]
consistently you know telling people not to watch that I probably will end up going to see it

[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:06.100]
I don't know if you know because when somebody tells you to do something or do the opposite

[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:10.560]
oh yeah no I know a lot of people do go see it so they can discover that I was right exactly

[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.500]
and say that you know I know it was bad because I saw it not because you know I told me it was but

[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.080]
I was just curious you know since you said a lot of it was it's realistic as maybe

[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:25.820]
something would hope it to be I kind of you know I'm kind of skeptical myself if they can really

[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:31.460]
make it look as realistic as it really is you know as far as you know talk radio is and I think

[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:37.660]
they did a good job on a good morning Vietnam as far as you know how it is for you know radio broadcast

[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:42.880]
or rather the talk show but again a good morning Vietnam was a fun at least parts of it parts of

[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:47.740]
it were very depressing but parts of it were very funny I mean Robin Williams is a hysterical guy

[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.960]
oh yeah he was entertaining yes he's really moving is not entertaining in any way believe me

[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.940]
I was you know curious because the guy doesn't I'm telling himself it sounds like that was a good

[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:03.740]
no he doesn't tell himself oh he gets shot you get shot by somebody else by another caller

[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:10.120]
are you ever afraid of anything like that happy no fanatic you know no no happens it happens you

[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:17.260]
know you don't worry about those things well I'm glad you took time out today but all right okay thank

[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:22.940]
a lot by speaking of the good morning Vietnam you guys didn't know that that happened when I was

[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:29.060]
over there what and I had to take a TV crew out when this guy got trans quote transferred quote fired

[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:36.040]
off of all radio and I got I had I went out and interviewing it was he was something I mean he

[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:43.720]
wasn't Robin Williams you know but he was very outspoken on what he said on the air and it was a

[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:48.320]
real shame the way that it happened it was one of those things where you know some officer didn't

[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:53.980]
like him and getting transferred out and everybody else suffered you know you know almost like what

[00:52:53.980 --> 00:53:01.960]
happens in this business normally what you trying to say damn I remind me okay let's go to

[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:08.220]
opalaka hello hello Neil yes sir yeah I got to agree with you on that talk radio movie you saw it

[00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:15.000]
oh yeah and you survived it huh I got to say the movie itself was okay the realism wasn't there I

[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.040]
mean it was totally fake I disagree with you forgetting whether it was realistic or not it was just a

[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:26.860]
total I was a fool whatever it was it still wasn't good it wasn't entertaining there was nothing

[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:33.140]
I started to get interesting it was just the same thing I started to get dizzy to those camera

[00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:36.980]
angles where you spinning around the room yeah oh yeah I would definitely take a couple of

[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:40.720]
exedrin and put them in your pocket when you go in there it was outrageous there was a waste of

[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:47.020]

[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:03.360]
it was terrific it is really enjoyed it was you were was you were someone the caller said something

[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.920]
about the ending they didn't like the ending or should have no I didn't say that and then the

[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.900]
several of the callers who who live in fantasy land they called in and they wanted I you know

[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:16.440]
some kind of emotional reunion or they wanted best and Hoffman to become normal I don't know

[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:21.080]
what they wanted they just they've seen too many Allison wonderland movies I guess well I thought

[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:26.320]
a little bit about that and talked to several people the movie could have ended where they got

[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:31.960]
together actually it probably should have but why why why the movie itself would have had the

[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:36.800]
effect that it did the way they ended it there's no way in the world those two couldn't get along

[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:41.840]
three million dollars you could hire the best help in the world yeah see what I mean I guess you

you were tempted but you didn't make a deal a lot of people did buy cars and traded and did all

[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.280]
kinds of things which is great but if you looked around and you were tempted and said boy these

[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.140]
Toyota's are sharp looking cars and we've heard about the great workmanship and equality and maybe

[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:03.420]
with this guy I mean what was his ex-life doing there made no sense her little testimonial yeah then

[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:09.180]
don't you like the way she was lying on her back on that table on the calling him exactly made

[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:15.380]
absolutely no sense I was looking at my watch but unfortunately it was too dark in there to see it

[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:22.840]
my friends oh they loved it but I just uh absolutely said what did they like about it I don't know

[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.860]
they we walked out of there and everyone was silent and they were all one girl I was with was

[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:33.920]
crying she was so teared up about it and I was crying yeah I was crying too because I just wasted two

hours I was crying well I was so glad that he was shot in the end yeah get it over with you know

[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.840]
exactly I just shared at the end and got up out of there and left it was really a way every call

[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:50.840]
in that movie every single call was a deep emotional experience they were all looking and psychoanalyzing

[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:57.860]
exactly and his ex-wife was frowning and uh what Sandy he's in big trouble you know I didn't

[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.340]
see any difference from one show to the next they were all the same goofball callers and he couldn't

[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:05.840]
hang up on anybody in the same thing well why did you take that abuse you know I'm sure you

[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.400]
can't look at the frozen fingers syndrome well either then or yet it stuck somewhere he couldn't

[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.700]
get it out and every other call with the women with some how poor white trash house wife with

[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.000]
a southern accent well it was in Dallas don't forget that may have been a foul that's true that's

uh promo yeah a promo for whoever whatever commercial establishment they were trying to get

[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:23.300]
on the earth at the time yeah it was almost as if they bartered the time to him you know no that's

[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:28.200]
true it's almost as if they bartered the three hours to Jay and Jay decided well I'm going to get

[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:33.520]
this guy on and this guy on and this guy on and uh they all happen to have business establishments
