[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]
You have this in writing no he called me yesterday his guest called now

[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.940]
I want you to rest assured for the rest of the week everything's gonna be under firm control here

[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.320]
We have a memo from Gary Bruce boy Gary the program director who's gonna be absent again

[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.000]
By the way

[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.940]
Is there anybody listening in day to the show? I don't want to get touchy

[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.520]
But I noticed that all the deadlines are open you don't have to speak to us

[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.000]
But it would be very reassuring

[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.180]
Because we got even the Palm Beach lines are both lit and Broward has been very quick to get involved in the show today

[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.580]
But did nothing I guess they're just shocked in Dave County by the announcement of the death of the bird

[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.240]
Either that or they're out having some Santa Rhea rituals right?

[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.920]
Oh, there they go. Okay, that's enough. You don't have to stay on hold just still that was good

[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.820]
Boy here. You'll be in New Orleans September 13 through 16th for the NAV programmers conference

[00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.920]
It says if you have any scheduling problems contact Nick Lawrence really so evidently Nick is gonna be in charge of the building the rest of the week

[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.860]
Comforting to know that will be in good hands the rest of the week boy

[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.460]
It ought to be some kind of luckily will be out of the building tomorrow. Yeah, we'll be over there. It's specs so

[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.020]
Shame because I'd like to be here with Nick kind of running things and orchestrating everything

[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.140]
There will be several vultures on top of the marquee in front of the WIOD GT are building but that's just Nick's personality

[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.420]
Anyway, dude, did you see this on one of those programming sheets?

[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.840]
Or did you find this out to the grapevine? He called me the person called this is from the horses now

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.180]
He'll have cost for it met left two messages

[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.580]
Mr

[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.260]
I can't be on your show because the Harold won't let me do it mr. Mr

[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.200]
No guts. That's right and isn't amazing almost all of Steve's guests

[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.520]
Come on the show at two

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.960]
Right up with it probably explains that big two to three hour, but today for some strange reason for

[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.260]
Like I don't want to be embarrassed and have to encounter you two people who I've shine for about two years now

[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.900]
Mr. Cosford's coming in at 4 p.m

[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.180]
Which I find absolutely shocking. What is that? Oh?

[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.680]
It's my insurance oh

[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.440]
Well, we don't have time for that during the show game

[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.660]
I was very kind of you to bring that in but we don't we're doing a big-time radio show here

[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.580]
We don't have time for all this is a rye. Okay exactly. Get your stuff together over there later

[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.680]
So mr. Cosford's coming in at 4 p.m

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.460]
Now does anybody in the audience think that there's a coincidence?

[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.760]
Between the fact that this man cannot look eye to eye at either one of us because he shines us for so long and given us this

[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.060]
Powerfully cockamami story about how the Harold won't let any of their people come on the near Roger show

[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.660]
We haven't had a guest on this show in ages

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.320]
Decay for ages decay pin was the last guest we had no no, I mean it's his

[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.640]
Direction now the editorial board probably voted to let cost

[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.460]
I'm on this show and they keep an overruled them saying it's in the best interest of the Harold and a community

[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.920]
Not to let Bill costford come on this

[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.600]
controversial notorious program

[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:17.800]
Right they won't they won't what they know Harold employees as I understand it from what cost for his said to me

[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.180]
From what are you said yeah is allowed to come on this

[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.360]
Radio station in this time period any other time period is what about if we brought back Paul Lyle

[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.620]
Then it would be fine. Okay, that's the answer great

[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.780]
So we just mentioned that in those of you who are Steve Kane groupies out there. What are they gonna be talking about?

[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.280]
The price of Hall of Oz Saudi Arabia. I don't know if you get a chance to call Mr. Cosper this afternoon on the cane show

[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.020]
You might want to ask him politely

[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.660]
Why he doesn't have the guts to come on this show because he was our guest

[00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.860]
Wasn't he yeah for a long a one time for a very long time and then he made up this ridiculous story about how the Harold won't allow him to come on this show

[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.640]
That's right because of your battle a couple years ago

[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.200]
I battle when we had all those people just say no to the hero. That's fine. Well, that's really a shame

[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.600]
Hmm. I don't think the show can probably continue with that Mr. Cosper anyway Bill called her now

[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.900]
He really he said you are please bag number one

[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.080]
It's number two. He said in describing you. He said if you took a big pot

[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.560]
Put it on the stove reach down the sides

[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.080]
Build it with water and through in a rat. He said that would be you now. I'm not making this up that way. I'm quoting him verbatim

[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.460]
I'm not even paraphrasing I'm making sure to quote directly so I don't have any problem. What is his problem?

[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.500]
He hates your guts. Why is he thinks you are a just a just a right?

[00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.780]
Any reason a piece of poop is what he thinks you are

[00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.860]
I think you just obnoxious and disgusting and a

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.660]
But looking fool and he heard your comment yesterday about when I was looking for his numbers and the trends and I couldn't find them

[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.040]
He's I better not say anything. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know

[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.760]
I'm throwing that you're what you're arguing with me about

[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.760]
I just don't attack the messenger. I'm just giving you the mess. If I say anything I get ripped if I don't get

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.340]
All the day lines went out again. That's the way it is if I don't say anything. I'm ripped

[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.520]
Is there some kind of like a foreign a festival going on a day today?

[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.320]
That's probably why cost for it's gonna be on here. It's another one of those foreign movie festivals

[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.300]
Like Bridget does Belgium or something like that?

[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.840]
I'm very upset

[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.420]
Yeah, you're not yes, I am because next thing you'll be attacking lester again. I didn't have a

[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.600]
Let's do it with the first thing. I didn't attack him the first time who?

[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.540]
Let's oh now you're gonna get into this thing about who started it. Isn't that kind of juvenile?

[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.200]
I didn't think about that. I didn't say anything about that all I want to say publicly is I like Bill Calder

[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.080]
I used to I've listened to Bill Calder for years. I have never said anything negative about him on the air or off the air

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.660]
It's all I want to say and I don't know what is problem

[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.260]
It is that's his problem

[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.100]
Because it is not reciprocated yet

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.300]
We'll see

[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.420]
Something's go here, but as of September 12th. It's not in other words. You're kind of holding off on that. Okay

[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.040]
Well, I don't want to make a big deal to do about it

[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.000]
I don't know what is problem is because I have no problem with him

[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.640]
Then I had this incredible experience with my bank

[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.900]
I don't well they don't even know about it and they well because they've somehow I tell you about it. It's amazing

[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.940]
But I bought my new car on Sunday

[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.800]
Okay, and I wrote out a check because I had to put down

[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.840]
You know how you get in these upside down
