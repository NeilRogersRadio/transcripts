[00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.040]
The music's pressed on the music.

[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:02.700]
Oh, not your-

[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.260]
Jerk Street.

[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.340]
Did he really say that?

[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.160]
I do not know.

[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.300]
I do not know.

[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.400]

[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:05.580]
I do not know.

[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:05.580]

[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.040]
I do not know.

[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.080]
I do not know.

[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.100]
I do not know.

[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.700]
I do not know.

[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.700]

[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.820]
I do not know.

[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.860]
I do not know.

[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.900]
I do not know.

[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.520]
I do not know.

[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.320]
I do not know.

[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.020]
I do not know.

[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.880]
I do not know.

[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.340]
I do not know.

[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.920]
I do not know.

[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.660]
I do not know.

[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.920]
I do not know.

[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.600]
I do not know.

[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.140]
I do not know.

[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.980]
I do not know.

[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.520]
Are you trying to write a movie?

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.020]

[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.360]
I myself shot the movie in800 reactor,

[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.660]
Free for the work mission or any other movies like

[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.060]
3000會 pronunciations

[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.860]
Next time it is worth.

[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.100]
For the rest of the movie I would ever recognize

[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.100]

[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.220]
I view what e-mail is e-mail updates

[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.240]
and that I see the piano skills

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.240]

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.620]
Men get pen니kels

[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.100]
I'll say goodbye

[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.020]
The video is vídeo

[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.120]
VRY

[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.560]
TV

[00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.960]
Read the movie

[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.680]
The Lord said, let there be light and law.

[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.240]
There was light from the same people who brought to the much beloved talking Bible.

[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.140]
Comes a new 10 volume set brilliantly updated for the 80s.

[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.600]
Jair's it the wrapping Bible.

[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.020]
There was dark everywhere than the man said.

[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.720]
Light and the light was there. He said, I've done good. There's no doubt.

[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.940]
On the seventh day he just chill out. Genesis. Genesis. Beginning of that. Beginning of this.

[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.900]
Finally, the good book is that. And his word is that.

[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.520]
Check it out. There's a town called Sodom and Dora. Everybody's body like no tomorrow.

[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.600]
God looked down said, now my fault. Don't look back or you turn to song. That's white sugar peat. Start at the freak.

[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.380]
The cow came up and they cut sheep. They go like y'all. I'll beat y'all.

[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.740]
Imagine all the song, all the peribos, every sacred, difficult word interpreted by the finest sugar in the youth of all time.

[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.020]
Genesis. Genesis.

[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.620]
The wrapping Bible. Making his word fresh again.

[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.360]
10101 at 560 WQA. I'm happy Wednesday too. No holiday today. No special events.

[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.240]
Although we do have a Curtis and Danny canal for the mad dog at four.

[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.240]
And we got the high school grid on reported eight. Wow. Well, we've got some real direct for it today.

[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.880]
Anyway, speaking of that. So Mo did not get fired at service. That was just not going to be rumored that.

[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.380]
Many Mooneos or whoever was sending 80 million emails yesterday.

[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.900]
I'm not. Yeah. Greg Budell. It was the fake Greg Budell.

[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.080]
Right. They've never heard of. I had to explain that. That to them.

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.260]
Yeah. Dave. Dave Hagen never heard of a Greg Budell. Even the real one.

[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.720]
And of course who the hell did whoever heard a Greg Budell.

[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.800]
Okay. Let's before we do anything else. Take a look at the poll result as it stands right now.

[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.960]
And it's good. As soon as we get to a thousand, we're changing it.

[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.600]
You're going to like the one for tomorrow. For later.

[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.980]
Mm hmm. I could at least tolerate an insult to my intelligence.

[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.360]
186. We got 907 on there. How much you got fat boy? What do you see on there?

[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.200]
Oh, let me refresh. 910. 10. 911. 911.

[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.360]
Oh, oh.

[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.980]
Oh, oh.

[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.160]
At least tolerate an insult to my intelligence. 186 kids 101.

[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.200]
Now, see, I'm the one that put kids on there. You see that?

[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.720]
Mm hmm.

[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.100]
Late edition and it zoomed up to number two.

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.140]

[00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.880]
Now, just before we got out of here yesterday, there was an email that came in but I didn't have time to read it.

[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.560]
I was already finished.

[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.500]
Mm hmm.

[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.200]
I could spend the whole four hours today just ranting on about the emails and the whole thing.

[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.080]
I mean, and don't get me wrong. The the hostile ones, the critical ones, the crank ones and they're all crank.

[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.660]
Yeah.

[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.100]
Yeah, the entertaining ones are cranks, which is fine.

[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.600]
It's material. It's funny stuff.

[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.760]
I enjoy them tremendously.

[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.660]
Ain't like Lucas yesterday with a phony name and phony address and phony phone number and phony identity.

[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.320]
Phony BS.

[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.860]
So just before the end of the show yesterday, I get this Jim DeFeedy is back.

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.020]
Now, I'll give the audience 600 choices who you think sent this to me.

[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.240]
Jim DeFeedy.

[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.940]
Yeah.

[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:23.900]
I mean, I know for years there have been a lot of really desperate people in the market looking looking to me to promote them on a year.

[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:32.300]
And I have no problem with that, but it's just when you do it yourself, it's like the day that Rich Pactor sent me a copy of a letter to the editor he sent to the SunCendela.

[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.580]
And I hope I'd read it on a year.

[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.560]
That was last week you run vacation.

[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.940]
Oh, sorry. I missed that.

[00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.950]
Yeah. By the way, that rap in Bible, that was just the first of many, many old predictable bits. I'm playing the plan.

[00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.910]
All the oldies today.

[00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.270]
Good.

[00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.530]
If you don't like it, your mama Jim DeFeedy is back. Jim DeFeedy is absent from the radio waves the past four months.

[00:05:52.890 --> 00:06:00.090]
Returns Monday afternoon on four Lauderdale talk station WFTL 850 on the AM dial. A station that's got a point just about all day.

[00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.090]
James Crystal Radio. In other words, real losers. Steve Laffa.

[00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.230]
Like Norma can't say anything Steve Laffa touches turns to instant processed Schmidt.

[00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.910]
Jim DeFeedy's new show run Monday through Friday, four to seven PM. His two years did a W.I.N.Z. ended in September when he and the station couldn't come to an agreement on new contract.

[00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.290]
An on-compete clause in his old contract kept him off the air, but it's expired now.

[00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.710]
DeFeedy says he hooked up with WFTL because no other station in South Florida is committed to local talk as WFTL.

[00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.870]
And let's face it, living in South Florida, we should all be committed. He said.

[00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:40.530]
Oh, with humor like that, he should go really far. He sent this to me himself.

[00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.530]
The real Jim DeFeedy's to promote his new show on WFTL starting four to seven on Monday.

[00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.850]
Oh, I'm assuming on Monday. I don't know whether it's next Monday or maybe he's already on there. I don't know.

[00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.470]
I don't think so. Is that pathetic or what?

[00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:05.550]
It's typical. It's exciting. It's sad. They always do. Like begging.

[00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.650]
Please, please. I know they know you'll promote them. Look at everything you did for footy.

[00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.570]
Yeah, I tried. You did. Not the only one. I tried. Don't blame me every day.

[00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:23.130]
Oh, here's the fake Greg Budell says I got a hold of Dave Hagen. Mo is still working part time on Sirius, but they still hate him like Poison and have a good show.

[00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.090]
That's not what Dave Hagen told George. That's right. Fake Greg Budell.

[00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:32.030]
That's not what Dave Hagen said. They've said Mo is on his best behavior. He hasn't pissed anybody off up there.

[00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.670]
And he's working. So up yours, fake Greg Budell. It's got to be Johnny Dork.

[00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.190]
You hear they're coming to take care. I heard that. I see it right out my window.

[00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:52.350]
Here's a poll suggestion. What topics in George not be allowed to discuss during Neil's vacation? And by the way, believe me.

[00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.650]
Believe me what I tell you, we need lots of help on these emails this morning. I came in here where there were 20 of them.

[00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:05.630]
And there wasn't one that was like a real email. It was like, Oh, I mean, I served by John. I need help to locate $3.6 million to put in your account.

[00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:11.210]
And like that, I keep winning the Nigerian lottery. And then I'm also getting fake American Express stuff on this email.

[00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:21.330]
Do you think American Express would be emailing me for all on this? And of course to to blank to no name to whoever, which is almost as good as to undisclosed recipients.

[00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:29.330]
That that's what I get. So we need some real serious activity there besides sending me links to articles or just articles, which have had several this morning.

[00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:36.890]
And they immediately get deleted. I don't want articles. Okay. Unless it's something like Earth shaking, unless it's like the end of the world.

[00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:48.330]
Right. What topics in George not be allowed to discuss during Neil's vacation? His miserable marriage, his drug use, his hatred of his mother, his vastectomy, his forced and and or smegma problem.

[00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:59.890]
His time roller skating, his favorite TV shows, Simpsons and Family Goy, his hatred of Israel, his sexual escopades at Swinger clubs, his pathetic salary, his younger years is born again Christian and his Cuban self hatred.

[00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:06.750]
I'm not doing that pool. There are a lot of things on there that I never discuss. Well, you bet there's some ideas for you.

[00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:15.510]
Oh, here's the fake Greg B. Deligan. I missed jerk, jerk street. Did you hear him? No, I did not. Nor would I listen to it. Nor have I got an interest in jerk, jerk street.

[00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:30.830]
Fake Greg. I think fake Greg B. Deligan is either man in the moon, you know, is or fat boy. Cry not not not our fat boy. Jeff. Hi, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

[00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:48.250]
Knee's excited to get a set to know you. We go, a fan, we go, a fan, we go to your

[00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.750]
RGM does. Besides school, everything up. Taste the time yesterday to send me a

[00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.190]
Psychotic email. Oh, I didn't give anybody your email address, but if you want me to I will

[00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.010]
Overgrown child

[00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:13.070]
Joe Feinberg and him were a perfect match. They kept exchanging hostile psychotic emails back and forth. Remember those days? Oh, yeah

[00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.250]
Joe Feinberg at least had enough common sense and decency to like step away

[00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.310]
Step out just walk away. That's right. That's what you ought to do, jolly Joe

[00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.950]
Just walk away one day people come in and your office is empty and you're long gone. Oh

[00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.990]
God would there be a celebration all corners of the universe. There'll be a gigantic celebration

[00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.630]
The evil this man hath wrought in this place

[00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:43.550]
So anyway, here's the email address kneel at nearodgers.com if you have anything to say whether you're crank or real or whatever

[00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.290]
It doesn't make any difference just to send it along

[00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.610]
Because now that the election is over it's really oh

[00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.050]
Here's young young young young young

[00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.370]
Breaking news Jim DeFetus

[00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:05.450]

The fetus was on the air yesterday. It says and an email to random pixels he wrote. I will I will

[00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:27.230]
Oh, I left WFTL today. He didn't elaborate. I followed up and asked him to read comment further

[00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.950]
Who knows maybe he's going back to W. Y.N.C.? Like this is important like somebody really cares about Jim DeFetus

[00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.730]
And then there's an email Jim DeFetus responded by email

[00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.970]
Which this is definitely not the same Jim DeFetus email address that I had

[00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.110]
Hi Bill. Here's what I'd say about my time at WFTL. It goes on and on and on

[00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:52.430]
We don't care you don't belong on here in the first place you fat. So you tubby you don't belong on the air period

[00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.170]
And

[00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.910]
Now here's an article from a CNN some crack

[00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.410]
Of absolutely no use or interest to anyone in the universe and that's it. That's the emails

[00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.210]
So an experiment that I thought was going smashingly well and was going to be really phenomenal

[00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:15.090]
It's it's another bomb because South Florida people have got nothing to say about anything. Yeah, that's right

[00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:22.510]
So luckily luckily for me I got just a zillion really good articles I go back to bedtime stories

[00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.290]
Or of course there's always the phone we don't have all day if league. It's really psychotic when I take calls

[00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:33.130]
Does it any Chris? Oh, he loves it. No, he does not he thinks it's great

[00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.370]
He's always tells you to take the calls. No, he does not he does

[00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:50.290]
Now when are you leaving? Oh Friday no, I don't mean for one day. I mean when you leaving the show I'll see you later

[00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.090]
Come I'll go get a flee for you. No thanks

[00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.410]
It's not that he's a bad guy. He's just got nothing to say and he's got that

[00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.550]
Torpy voice

[00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.070]
Like that we got enough of that on here already

[00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:12.730]
We got the big O2 to 4 today in spite of just gigantic protest. They're masked all the way down to a laquipa

[00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:19.030]
All the way up to a laquipa 4 to 7 it's Curtis and Danny canal mad dogs taking one of his 8 million days off

[00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:24.010]
And so we got Curtis and Danny canal. We like Curtis a lot. What's Danny can now doing on here? Another ex-joc

[00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:32.070]
Dolphins tonight 7 to 8 high school a great eye and report 8 to 9 that gets at least a point oh minus 80 and then the ad a show and item in night

[00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.470]
Which could say oh point something maybe in this trend he'll break a two share at night. You think no

[00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.730]
You finally broke a one last in the book

[00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:41.970]
Aren't you proud of good old EA?

[00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.090]
How much your every day he thinks about look at that no items in this view no items in this view

[00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.290]
I'm the email thing

[00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.990]
Outrages absolutely and we get Jim DeFetus. I see it so now it doesn't make any sense

[00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.110]
The email that I read maybe that was another fake

[00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.750]
You think I don't I don't really care. I mean, you know with something to read, you know

[00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:12.290]
Jim DeFetus is back and it's dated Tuesday November 11th at the day to the yesterday and it's from him allegedly

[00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.750]
Returns Monday afternoon

[00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.410]
Of course this could be dated way back. Yeah way back when he came back

[00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.790]
So who the hell knows what the date was on this Jim DeFetus

[00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.530]
Two and a Monday and see if he's anywhere in the dial and let us know nobody will care trust me when I tell you

[00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.130]
And look at that phone. I said we might take a few calls. You see anything happening on the phone boy

[00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.430]
What oh there is one I

[00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.130]
Get the feeling we're like in the middle of a death now what that a Q.A. M death radio

[00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.130]
That one that was good one that was special even the real one. Oh

[00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:50.250]
I

[00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.210]
All the retardos all the time

[00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.390]
Look at that phone I

[00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:06.330]
Said those emails right yeah here crickets. I think Lucas was right

[00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.470]
Time to step aside

[00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:17.470]
Oh look at the time instead of getting a vasectomy Georgia. They've gotten neutered ha ha ha says Anthony ha ha ha Anthony

[00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.990]
Wow, I'll say that for later

[00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.150]
Neil they keep adding nights now four sold out shows at the Hard Rock in January

[00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.170]
Miami loves Billy Joel and Billy Joel loves Miami now he spends most of the year living in Miami Beach

[00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:35.030]
I know that you love Billy Joel and we'll be there all four nights. I can't stand Billy Joel. I won't be there at all

[00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.690]
Better him than me. Don't you just love Billy Joel like some of his older stuff. I don't

[00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:47.010]
1015 is five I like him about as much as had a sign and said mission accomplished as much as him

[00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.550]
It just keeps getting bigger

[00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.810]
Riley stole my

[00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.610]
Like the park in his face

[00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.850]
That's where he think what gives him the right

[00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:07.210]
Oh, I think his wife what up bite it off tonight

[00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.790]
Riley stole my

[00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.190]
Distraised to the human race

[00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:22.550]
But that wheel of meat should also include

[00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.410]
I like a part in his face. I can help

[00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:42.330]
1020 I haven't lost it 10 20 at 560 WQM the audience has lost it though boy. They're disappearing today. They pulled a vanishing act

[00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:47.950]
Can you believe it look at that phone man? There's not a single there's not even a tickle on it. Right

[00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.130]
There's no trickle or trickle weekdays. Do you see there here? It is in the middle of the week

[00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:56.830]
Yeah, Wednesday the 13th the 12th whatever the hell it is. Mm-hmm somewhere after the 10th

[00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:03.350]
Happy birthday, Neil be lit and somebody just sends me another article which I already have about Miss Foley. I got it in my pile

[00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:10.450]
Don't send me any more articles don't send me any links don't send me any attention say something

[00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.890]
Yeah, Anthony who thinks he's really funny who won the election?

[00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.390]
I've been hiding in my mom's house scared the old man would win while the old man didn't win

[00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.750]
So it's safe to come out now Anthony on second thought back in in the closet 948 on a pool

[00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:33.370]
When we get to a thousand and we're gonna change to that other one for the other one is good the most tedious personal hygiene routine for you

[00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.390]
You like it even George likes it George usually is very very indifferent about the pool

[00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.150]

You know the elections over I hate to break the news to the elections over those of you people like to want to continue

Wallowing in the eight years of misery under Bush and Cheney and those of you want to continue

[00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.170]
Hakan a China about Sarah Palin just keep just keep going to the mirror and stand there and talk to yourself

[00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:32.430]
Bapapapapa, because I'm burned out on it. Aren't you way before it ended?

[00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.570]
I was broke. Oh my god

[00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.010]
I was saying that a couple days before the election. Let's get it over with already, you know enough

[00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:42.450]
Oh two Sid Rosenberg's fiery ports. It must be so important. It's been sent twice by Rod Wow

[00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.550]
Sid was saying how much he thought you sucked and

[00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:51.410]
Can't understand why anyone would listen to it even though he was pretty up to that and everything you were doing on the show was still using the

[00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.250]
Something drop two

[00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.150]
The Roy oh the Roy drop

[00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:03.390]
And he's using our drops Roy we don't really care go ahead said it doesn't help by the way

[00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.270]
You still suck and you still got no numbers

[00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:10.230]
Even when they get an upbook he still gets a two-shear no way that's why he talks about me

[00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.490]
He thinks I'm gonna like go into a big thing about him forget it go back to New York said we hate you

[00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.390]
Here's Carlos

[00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:24.130]
It says I started listening to a show during IOD years when Henry was colleague of yours spelled very badly

[00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:29.050]
I've just returned to Miami also spelled wrong after a long sabbatical of sorts

[00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:32.790]
But I must say thanks to the internet no matter where I can hear the show

[00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.910]
Thanks for all the last and related Feliz cumpleyanos

[00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.010]
On you know better late than never one question

[00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.250]
Why do you lower than to stay in the dolphin so much?

[00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.790]
I know they've been in a downward spiral as a blade

[00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.470]
It's got nothing to do with that if they won every game. I hate them even worse

[00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.870]
But is there anything about the team that tickles your fancy? No

[00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.090]
Keep the faith fight the power and made the force be with you says somebody Carlos

[00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:58.930]
Thanks Carlos. I hate the the fish now if they had a drafted Brady Quinn

[00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:05.530]
But they didn't draft Brady Quinn because Brady Quinn is rumored to be gay. I think that's what it was all about probably

[00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:13.070]
Well, here's a poll suggestion. I would like to see Neil a state QA for many more years moved to another local A.M. Station

[00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.130]
Move to a local FM station

[00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:21.570]
Move to satellite radio go away work two shows a day like big O get a real agent so we can earn what he's worth

[00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.810]
Buy the station you can do what the show he wants to do do a television again

[00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:30.250]
When big at the slots and say bye bye bye and who's Neil? Oh, God

[00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.770]
They they left some options off there

[00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:38.690]
Grunt wings and fly shoot lasers out his eyes. I mean there's a lot of really shoot lasers out my ass

[00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.530]
Yeah, there you go laser

[00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:48.730]
60 Q a.m. I think for it's leave get a life

[00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:00.550]
Oh

[00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:08.370]
Talkers what are we gonna do? I say talkers. We are all being screwed. I say live there

[00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:13.490]
Why is this happening to us? We want the MCC to get a

[00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.610]
I don't like

[00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:22.470]
There's no place for us now even DJs are all down in the mouth you can listen

[00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:29.390]
But now you will find any words that will carve your mind

[00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.750]
No fun to be

[00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.510]
FCC no fun to be

[00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.490]
FCC

[00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:45.130]
There'll be nothing left or up to enjoy we'll soon be playing with children

[00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.690]
For your fun to be then for body of

[00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.330]
No, your fun to be then for body of

[00:23:52.330 --> 00:24:00.210]
They want us to be clean they think they know what we should feel they try to dictate to us. What is real?

[00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:02.970]
Young at all

[00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.410]
Listen to us. I think

[00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.370]
Please don't put up a bus

[00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.550]
Oh, but petition

[00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.630]
The FCC but you

[00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:24.050]
Can't do it all by himself let's help him don't put it up on the shelf let the FCC

[00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.750]
No, just how you feel and maybe we'll get this

[00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.230]
We'll

[00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.550]
Do

[00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.270]
All rating

[00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.250]
In fact, they might die because of the FCC

[00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:54.710]
You want to ban what we can do and see if you then what we can say

[00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.190]
You've even tried to ban the record

[00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.730]
That the DJ's

[00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.230]
People I

[00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:06.690]
I

[00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:07.010]
Think

[00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.310]
Let's stand and fight for what's true spend your letter

[00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:17.250]
Into so far so we can tell the FCC what the end of the

[00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.210]
Arneal Roger and so far are on your side

[00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:25.170]
We have nothing too hard young and

[00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:32.290]
Get your opinions out and maybe the FCC will stay out

[00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:37.750]
FCC

[00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:39.610]
In the morning now

[00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:46.230]
In the evening now no one knows what words drive them insane

[00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.370]
We are the FCC to

[00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.230]
FCC

[00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.610]
Go away

[00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.490]
Get off our path

[00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:59.130]
FCC

[00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:01.230]
Let's live our lives

[00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.510]
For real

[00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.430]
FCC

[00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.450]
Why are you going to backcase of the grip?

[00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:10.370]
FCC

[00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:11.350]
Let's get that bacon

[00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:12.870]
Go away

[00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:13.610]
Go away

[00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.730]
I love it

[00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.230]
Oh yeah and I was thinking you're going to get a kick out of this maybe

[00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:24.630]
I was thinking back to those days at INZ and they did that for the show just like that wasting away in Hellenville

[00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:30.090]
Right where there's a little little thing where you hear the phone ringing in the background on that bit and this one

[00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:37.410]
I'm trying to think of who the people were who were involved in recording stuff for the show back then we actually had people do creative stuff right Frank ex-Locato

[00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:38.970]
Excuse me

[00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.150]
That was the guy's name

[00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.510]
But the dump that?

[00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:42.530]
No

[00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.170]
Okay just the export

[00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:44.590]
Okay

[00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:51.350]
So I googled him to see it I mean this is in years ago and I'm thinking geez my memory is as sharp as a a Maceball

[00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.410]
Frank ex-Locato

[00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:59.370]
He was a political maven he also did a thing about Ronnie Reagan's surprise supply side economics blues

[00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:05.330]
God I wish I still had that that was a great sound sounds really familiar the Ronnie Reagan supply side economics blues

[00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.090]
Why wish we had that

[00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.990]
So I googled him and wait till he heard this letter

[00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:12.270]
Okay

[00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:16.650]

Now the fake Rick Spider-Man though on the other hand a lot of people care about Rick with his his head that's Rick Spider-Man

About how Mo is on his best behavior and doing a fine job up there and he's still working and everybody stays away

[00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:22.310]
So they don't hate him right Rick Spider-Man follows up. He says Phil Henry is a slime ball

[00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.910]
Slime ball are you sure I hated when he did my voice

Little Pusion like a midget

[00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.630]
That's how gigantic Jim DeFetus was and they put him on TV

[00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.490]
But they didn't realize that not everybody's got a wide screen TV the Dow is down 300 points

[00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.170]
There's Henry Paulson on CNN going

I'm just drawing a show.

[00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:36.050]
Joyce is a fake attorney.

[00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.910]
You don't know nothing about me.

[00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.450]
Absolutely.

[00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.070]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.050]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:53.090]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.530]
Oh, they had your thoughts.

[00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:08.510]
Joyce went to get to the law school.

[00:34:09.450 --> 00:34:14.350]
But it won't stupid had a fraudulent term.

[00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:20.730]
And it's not a big deal.

[00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.830]
It's not a big deal.

[00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.550]
It's not a big deal.

[00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:30.590]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.790]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.110]
Oh, Joyce won't let me.

[00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.330]
I don't want to hear any more.

[00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.090]
It's not about me.

[00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.950]
I'm not a bad show.

[00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.050]
I'm taking a prisoner.

[00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.370]
It's not about me.

[00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.230]
I'm just drawing a show.

[00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:56.830]
It's not about me.

[00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:00.450]
Joyce won't let me.

[00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.370]
You know we can't pay no price.

[00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.510]
I don't want to pay no price.

[00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.450]
I don't want to pay no price.

[00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:20.130]
I don't want to pay no price.

[00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:21.730]
Maybe that's why she ignored me.

[00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:25.870]
WQYM, hello.

[00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.150]

[00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:29.930]
Yes, I can speak to you.

[00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:30.010]
Speak to what?

[00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:31.410]

[00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:33.970]
What do you want?

[00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.510]
Zach here.

[00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:37.370]
How you doing?

[00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:39.050]
Go get us.

[00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.230]
This is our friend.

[00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.190]
Yeah.

[00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.870]
I'm in the hospital, but I'm stepping out right now.

[00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:54.150]
Can you hear me?

[00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.370]
I can hear you.

[00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:57.210]
We hear the fake voice.

[00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.290]
What did you say?

[00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.790]
I said, yeah, how you doing?

[00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.850]
I'm good.

[00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.090]
The fake voice deserves a name.

[00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.050]
I hear two people talking at one time.

[00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.090]
Two people talking at one time.

[00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.130]
With the real voices, not a fake voice.

[00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:13.110]
What can we do for you?

[00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.190]
About what?

[00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.230]
Drugs.

[00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:19.850]
It's a drug deal.

[00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:20.570]
About what?

[00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:20.570]

[00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.770]
It's a drug.

[00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.850]
It's a drug.

[00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.230]

[00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.630]
It's a drug.

[00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:25.750]
Well, you're in a hospital.

[00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.450]
You ought to be able to get all the drugs you need.

[00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.150]
That's right.

[00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.970]
Just pull them right in.

[00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:29.830]
That's right.

[00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:30.790]
Just pull them in the grip.

[00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.610]
Go check out the old cabinet.

[00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.230]
Just like in Godfather 3.

[00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.390]
Remember the nurses were having like a New Year's party or a Christmas party?

[00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:37.830]
Mm-hmm.

[00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:42.910]
And the guy, the assassin with a dark black thing, comes in there.

[00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:48.470]
And all of a sudden, all of his army people, who are the government people?

[00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:52.850]
I thought that was the bulletproof pillow.

[00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.750]
Damn, it's not the bulletproof pillow at all.

[00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.950]
I like that color, though.

[00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.390]
He was good.

[00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:01.450]
WQYM, hello.

[00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:02.370]
Hey, Neil.

[00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:03.070]
Yeah.

[00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:04.370]
What's going on?

[00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:05.390]
What do you got?

[00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.430]
Um, well?

[00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.650]
Yeah.

[00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:10.610]
Just wanted to see, uh, see how you doing.

[00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.990]
Listen, uh, looking for a long time.

[00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.890]
Mm-hmm.

[00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.350]
Well, uh, don't have any material, really.

[00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:20.110]
Well, then, don't call.

[00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:21.570]
If you don't have any material, don't call.

[00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:22.390]
It's as simple as that.

[00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.470]
Very simple.

[00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:25.670]
You know how I'm doing, because you're listening to the radio.

[00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.630]
You hear the sound of my voice.

[00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:27.290]
I'm still alive.

[00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.290]
I'm still, you know, uh, crazy old fag.

[00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.370]
That's it.

[00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.190]
You don't need to call and ask me how I'm doing.

[00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:34.570]
How are you doing?

[00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:35.330]
How are you doing?

[00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.550]

[00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:36.210]
How you doing?

[00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.170]
I want to talk to you, I want to talk to you, Zach, about drugs.

[00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.630]
Yeah.

[00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:39.630]
Yeah.

[00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.670]
Jolly Joe sends me...

[00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:43.690]
This is the fake Jolly Joe.

[00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:44.190]
Not the real one.

[00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.950]
Okay.

[00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.730]
Neil, we are getting complaints that the stream from yesterday is having problems.

[00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.770]
Are you aware of this problem?

[00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.550]
Can we get this fixed?

[00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:51.530]
ASAP, thanks.

[00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:52.330]
Jolly Joe.

[00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.170]
No, we don't care about the stream.

[00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.150]
WQAM, hello.

[00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:00.710]
Hello, Neil.

[00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.550]

[00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.250]
Meja, mora, mora, mora, mora.

[00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:05.230]
WQAM, hello.

[00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:08.190]
QAM, hello.

[00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.590]
Hello.

[00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.330]
Hello.

[00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:11.150]
Yes.

[00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:19.570]
So, what is it that you disagree with when the people send you emails telling you that your shows are relevant, that you're washed up?

[00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.030]
What is it that you're...

[00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.370]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.390]
Let me ask you a question, my orange-carts friend.

[00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.410]
Are you listening to the show?

[00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:29.690]
Yes, I am.

[00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:30.650]
And why is that?

[00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:32.890]
Because I listen to it.

[00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:33.830]
That's why I...

[00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:37.530]
You know if I'm washed up in the show sucks, why are you listening to it?

[00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.890]
I listen to your show.

[00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:40.910]
Do you hear me?

[00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:41.830]
Do you hear what I...

[00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:42.450]
I hear you.

[00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:43.230]
And?

[00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.970]
And I'm listening, yes.

[00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.250]
So, what is it to you?

[00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:51.390]
Do you have a problem of me listening to your show?

[00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:52.070]
Yes.

[00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.310]
What's your problem?

[00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:55.390]
How old are you?

[00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:55.930]
150?

[00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.890]
Oh, that's funny.

[00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.730]
That's all you can talk about now.

[00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.150]
How old people are?

[00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:01.830]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:04.310]
I'm going to record and believe me on a teenager compared to you.

[00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.170]
Go put your teeth in and go gum some lunch.

[00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.750]
You...

[00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:08.670]
Oh, pervert.

[00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.270]
God.

[00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.550]
Just listen to the sound of that voice, my guy.

[00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:14.270]
And people...

[00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:15.830]
Wonder why I don't want to come back down there?

[00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:18.330]
My God.

[00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.010]
You make me feel like an infant, not a team of group in the infant.

[00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:24.170]
Maybe you disagree...

[00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.010]
You're Alta Kaka man.

[00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.770]
You should only croak a wicked thing.

[00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:29.870]
Oh.

[00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:31.590]
But have a nice day.

[00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:33.430]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:34.790]
Can I have Christmas Eve?

[00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.430]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:38.510]
How'd you retire?

[00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:40.210]
Your show is so still.

[00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.030]
I know, just like your voice.

[00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.070]
Yeah, God, I know.

[00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.870]
God.

[00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.470]
Stay like last year's Halifah, go eat some.

[00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.490]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:50.870]
Hey, Neil.

[00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.570]
Yes.

[00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:55.690]
I want to be the millions that voted for change this last election.

[00:39:56.150 --> 00:40:02.490]
One of the things that worries me is reports that say, well, for example,

[00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.510]
Bush receives all these daily reports.

[00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.870]
Now that Obama's starting to get these, do you think that now that he sees what's actually going on,

[00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.950]
he might start backpedaling or changing his mind about certain issues?

[00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:20.270]
Because again, these candidates do say, you know, we're going to do this, we're going to do that.

[00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:21.010]
I'll tell you what.

[00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.330]
But they don't see what the president has done.

[00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.010]
You see the movie and the exorcist? Have you ever seen that?

[00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.090]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.150]
And you know the scene where Linda Blair closes the...

[00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:30.770]
She opens and closes the drawer.

[00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:33.610]
Yeah, I know.

[00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.710]
And he says, do it again. And she says, in time.

[00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.170]
That's my entity, you, sir, in time. We'll find out.

[00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:41.230]
I don't have a crystal balls.

[00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.010]
How are we doing on the pool? By the way, the Dow is down to $259.

[00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.630]
I'll keep your breath to that. Henry Paulson says the bailout must support

[00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.870]
securitized loan lending for auto student and credit card loans.

[00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:55.050]
But a beep, but a boop, but a boop, but George was saying, little people who are in trouble,

[00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.250]
nobody is going to help them out.

[00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:56.530]
Right.

[00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.710]
People who are responsible, people have been paying their bills.

[00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:02.850]
But if you're a deadbeat and you bought a house that you couldn't afford and you knew you couldn't afford it.

[00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.750]
And they made you some kind of a bogus horse ball loan.

[00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.470]
Right. Then the government's going to bail you out.

[00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.730]
If you're rich and you manage your business, that...

[00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.830]
If you're responsible business that's been doing like AIG.

[00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:13.450]
How do you like that?

[00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.450]
More and more of these bonuses and trips and...

[00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.950]
Trips, yeah.

[00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.890]
These trips to these spas in Arizona.

[00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.610]
Yeah.

[00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.450]
And Lou Dobbs.

[00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.430]
You know something I noticed last night, Lou Dobbs has got 122 teeth.

[00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.430]
I never noticed that before.

[00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:26.270]
Really? Like a shark?

[00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:29.530]
His bottom teeth are like real small and real tight.

[00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.470]
He must have like 99 bottom teeth.

[00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.070]
Maybe he's a great white shark.

[00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.150]
And he's a pretty tall shark because he's angry.

[00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:40.290]
Lou Dobbs is angry on CNN with that big fat bulb of his hair.

[00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:44.210]
If you look in the mirror and so I had 10 times bigger than the rest of your body, you'd be pretty angry too.

[00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:44.750]
Let me tell you.

[00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.250]
Freaking Lou Dobbs.

[00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.550]
Go kill some Mexicans, Lou.

[00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.110]
WQAM, hello.

[00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:52.390]
Yeah.

[00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:53.090]
Yes.

[00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:59.590]
So I don't know if you heard this word when Bush was trying to compliment the Obama County or Dresden the other day.

[00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:04.930]
I use optimal and a travel account now.

[00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.610]
Let me make a suggestion to you.

[00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:09.070]
Okay.

[00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:10.110]
Okay.

[00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.770]
Elections over.

[00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:11.650]
Go find a hobby.

[00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:12.530]
Go play par cheesy.

[00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:13.290]
Go play an opera.

[00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:15.230]
The elections over.

[00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.730]
Wow.

[00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.010]
It's all over.

[00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:19.170]
We went in a landslide.

[00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:19.910]
The good guys won.

[00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.370]
It's over.

[00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:21.250]
Give it a rest.

[00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:23.890]
WQAM, hello.

[00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:28.110]
WQAM, hello.

[00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:29.130]
Yes.

[00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:30.890]
WIOD sucks.

[00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:33.890]
Many munoz or many mokoz sucks.

[00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.350]
You should hire a footy.

[00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.030]
Become the Neil and footy show.

[00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:37.630]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:38.970]
That's just what you need to see.

[00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.110]
How about that?

[00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.250]
How about my back?

[00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:41.310]

[00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.030]
How's he doing?

[00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:43.170]
Oh.

[00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:44.590]
How do you like that?

[00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:45.010]
Wow.

[00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.330]
Little trinker there.

[00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.230]
The angel Scarborough would have been proud of the end of that.

[00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:50.450]
Wrong.

[00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.590]
They make in Scarborough now do the show with a seven-second delay.

[00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.170]
No other shows on MSNBC are doing delay, by the way.

[00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.610]
They're not even doing Tom Delay.

[00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.690]
Oh, here's one from Joe.

[00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.790]
Not related.

[00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:04.430]
Not Joe Bell.

[00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:06.930]
I'm so burned out on the election, Sarah Pailin, etc.

[00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:09.670]
Just like the election, the focus on celebrities comes and goes,

[00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.450]
such as Britney Spears, Paris Sulton, Brad Pitt.

[00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.030]
But Jennifer Aston sees Manly, an Aston's manly face.

[00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.050]
Never goes away.

[00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.170]
She's pasted on every tabloid cover.

[00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:23.010]
And whenever I log onto the internet with a non-story attached,

[00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.850]
are you able to play the car security system with a big black guy named Ben

[00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:28.250]
and the white Jewish guy Yaddi Yaddi?

[00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.470]
Thanks for not retiring.

[00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:30.730]
Joe, not Joe Bell.

[00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.890]
Well, thanks, Joe.

[00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.330]
There's one.

[00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.950]
That's it.

[00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:33.830]
That's all we got in there.

[00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.650]
Slim and grim on the emails today, boy.

[00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:39.230]
Slim and grim.

[00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.650]
And that's because our good friends aren't coming through for us.

[00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:42.430]
You know, Greg B.

[00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:43.570]
No, I thought I'd say Greg B.

[00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:46.450]
No, it was going to be like, and I thought the fake fat Chris would be sure.

[00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.590]
To be back today with lots of stories.

[00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.010]
Fake Jolly Joe sent us one, but it was pretty weak.

[00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.150]
Fake Rick Spider-Man, I thought was like starting.

[00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:55.930]
How about the fake, what's your name?

[00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:57.070]
Who?

[00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:58.530]
Joey's Kaufman.

[00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:59.790]
Oh, we have a fake Joyce Kaufman?

[00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.770]
Not yet, but I'm saying why don't we get one of those?

[00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.110]
You better get those sensible shoes.

[00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:03.890]
Why?

[00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:05.930]
You wear those big round-toed sensible shoes?

[00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.630]
Does she really?

[00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:07.230]
Oh, yes, she does.

[00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.650]
And she's a Haitian man, or Jamaican, or something like that.

[00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:10.950]
Is she?

[00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.330]
She's an island's bitch.

[00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.170]
What the biggest name?

[00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:15.570]
The best out of you.

[00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:19.030]
This is Neil Rogers, sport radio 560 QAM.

[00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.690]
The fourth lead.

[00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.470]
The biggest name.

[00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.050]
The best talent.

[00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:29.750]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.

[00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.290]
I am a Ford Lutterdale.

[00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.250]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:35.830]
Oh my God.

[00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.990]
This is your brain.

[00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:38.310]
Oh my God.

[00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:39.970]
Any questions?

[00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:43.950]
And now here's another exciting offer from Video Treasure Chest.

[00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:47.570]
The hit game show, Jeopardy, is known as the thinking band's game show.

[00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:50.310]
Famous for its low-key format and survey pace.

[00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:51.870]
But that wasn't always the case.

[00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.610]
In the original pilot called InJephardy, contestants' lives were actually at risk.

[00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:58.730]
As this lost pilot episode shows.

[00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.150]
Use your category, Bob.

[00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.030]
I'll take US Presidents for 200.

[00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:04.570]
US Presidents for 200.

[00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.210]
Now remember, Bob, I'm pointing a loaded gun to your head.

[00:45:07.330 --> 00:45:10.150]
From this point on, your life is InJephardy.

[00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:11.750]
Should you fail to respond correctly.

[00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.630]
I'll be forced to splatter your brains across the sound stage.

[00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.270]
Preventing you from going on to the final InJephardy round.

[00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:18.950]
I understand. Very good, Bob.

[00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.150]
And the answer is.

[00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.070]
A man with the Harryiest belly ever to occupy the Overlapus.

[00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:26.630]
What the hell kind of question is that?

[00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:28.410]
It's not a question, Bob. It's an answer.

[00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.430]
Your response must be in the form of a question.

[00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:31.230]
Well, that's stupid.

[00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:32.250]
You have 10 seconds, Bob.

[00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.550]
And why do you're pointing that thing?

[00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.410]
I'm running out, Bob.

[00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.830]
I don't know. I can't think the gun's making me nervous.

[00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.690]
Five seconds, Bob. Please don't kill me.

[00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:41.110]
Remember, Bob, you must answer in the form of a question.

[00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:42.610]
What is, please don't kill me.

[00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.050]
I'm sorry, Bob. That's incorrect.

[00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:45.810]
Oh, God.

[00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:48.710]
The correct answer is. Who is Millard Fillmore?

[00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:50.390]
Who is Millard Fillmore?

[00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:51.510]
Sorry, Bob.

[00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:55.190]
The lost jeopardy, pilot. InJephardy, what is death?

[00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.650]
Can be yours for just 1995 in local video stores.

[00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.430]
Video treasure chest. We've got rooms in this ground.

[00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:02.930]
Oh, speaking of the, uh, Dow.

[00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:04.230]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.070]
Speaking of death, it's not almost 300 points.

[00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:06.570]
Again.

[00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.490]
Well, Henry Paulson is saying they're reassuring us

[00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.870]
that they're going to bail out all the deadbeats.

[00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:11.710]
It's an important step.

[00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.670]
But first, he says, she's got a good email here.

[00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.550]
It says, please tell me what incentive do we have to get up

[00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.230]
and go to work every day, like fools.

[00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:20.430]
When everyone else can stay home by expensive crap

[00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.170]
they can't afford and have the government pick up the bill.

[00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.230]
I quit, she says.

[00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.550]
You go, girl.

[00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:26.130]
Nicole.

[00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:29.790]
I don't know why Nicole has an email that says first key.

[00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:30.550]
But it's, it's cute.

[00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:31.130]
First key?

[00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:32.610]
Maybe she's frisky.

[00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.150]
Oh.

[00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:36.910]
This is very funny from yellow belly.

[00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.410]
Neil, there's a reason that independently wealthy people.

[00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:43.270]
People who have an income that doesn't require them to be in a specific place.

[00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.610]
Choose to make South Florida their home or then any other place in a world by far.

[00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.330]
And that's because it's the greatest place to live if you can afford it.

[00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:49.930]
Right.

[00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.490]
Will you stay there and I'll stay here?

[00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.250]
Okay, yellow belly.

[00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.390]
You turd.

[00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:58.090]
The greatest place to live if you can afford it.

[00:46:58.210 --> 00:46:59.730]
Does anybody with a brain believe that?

[00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.790]
Does anybody who's ever been north of Palm Beach County believe that?

[00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.950]
No.

[00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:03.330]
No.

[00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:05.330]
God.

[00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:08.150]
The fake Woody Graybird is back.

[00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.370]
He says, where is Fatsow today?

[00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:10.910]
I guess you haven't been speaking up enough.

[00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:12.410]
I'm sorry, I'll talk more.

[00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.710]
Maybe he's home giving you to jolly Joe up the old shoot.

[00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:16.470]
Says Woody.

[00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:17.950]
The fake Woody Graybird.

[00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:18.950]
I thought Woody was our friend.

[00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:20.110]
He is.

[00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:22.830]
The real, the real one, right?

[00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:23.170]

[00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:24.630]
WQAM, hello.

[00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.890]
Good play out there, Neil.

[00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.810]
Yeah?

[00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:28.830]
Hi.

[00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:30.190]
How you doing today?

[00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:30.910]
Okay.

[00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:37.530]
Okay, I just want to call and tell you that Joyce Kaufman is a Puerto Rican Jew person.

[00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:38.430]
Yeah.

[00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.310]
She doesn't agree with O'Connor.

[00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:41.930]
I used to listen to her about that.

[00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:43.010]
She started making me sick.

[00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:43.830]
Mm-hmm.

[00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:44.950]
Anyway, so I thought I'd be fine.

[00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:45.810]
She hasn't belonged on here.

[00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:46.870]
She's not a broadcaster.

[00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:48.910]
Yeah, besides that, yeah, right?

[00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:50.910]
She's like most of the people we have on here, not a broadcaster.

[00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.630]

[00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:52.290]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:53.170]
Get the mush out of your mouth.

[00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.670]
Sound like you're two and on 85 marbles.

[00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:57.010]
Mushmouth.

[00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.610]
He sounds like Kenny Albert on a bad day.

[00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:02.350]
I don't want to say Kenny Albert's a good example of nepotism, but you know what?

[00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.810]
Kenny Albert's a great example of nepotism.

[00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.890]
That was down 301.

[00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.690]
Oh, boy.

[00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.830]
And we got a thousand more votes on the poll.

[00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:09.570]
Let's hear it.

[00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.590]
Nice going, fact. Chris, now I can change it.

[00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:12.950]
Say what?

[00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:13.170]
Right.

[00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:16.110]
I said we got a thousand and one votes on the poll.

[00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:18.910]
And now I'm, I'm clicking on pull switch.

[00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:20.210]
Pull switch.

[00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:20.990]
There's the new one.

[00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:21.650]
Nice going, Eric.

[00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:22.830]
Thank you so much.

[00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:28.070]
What is the most tedious, personal hygiene?

[00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:29.690]
Routine for you.

[00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:31.930]
And there are so many good choices on here.

[00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:33.730]
I'm going to put shaving my face.

[00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:35.430]
Hello.

[00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:35.690]
Okay.

[00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:39.910]
Now that they have for all these years, you know, edge and all those other fake edges.

[00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:43.670]
And shaving is basically a piece of cake.

[00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.470]
Oh, I did pick myself the other day on my chin.

[00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:49.310]
Oh, I hate that.

[00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:49.750]
Yeah.

[00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.070]
It's still a bit in the ass.

[00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:52.230]
Shaving?

[00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:52.670]
Yeah.

[00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:53.650]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:54.550]
That's why I voted for it.

[00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:57.310]
I'm sure it's not going to vote for all these other filthy things on here.

[00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.450]
Like douching and stuff like that.

[00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:05.370]
Those men votes on the poll that's exiting here, I could at least tolerate insult to my intelligence 210.

[00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:07.110]
Like these collars today.

[00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.830]
Oh, you think they're going to be all right.

[00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.690]
That guy couldn't have been a day over a thousand, you know what?

[00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.230]
He made Methusa look like a child.

[00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.130]
Intelligence 210, kids 107.

[00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.010]
Be true to your school.

[00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:12.990]
Got the new poll up there.

[00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:14.510]
Do what shall read the other choices on there.

[00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:20.990]
You might well, it might you know, entice some of these people to hop on it and the poll too.

[00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.970]
Charlie B comes through this week with some good polls.

[00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:27.770]
He took some time off to you know, unscramble his brains and come up with some really good ideas.

[00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:30.610]
There won't be any more very soon.

[00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:38.170]
I'm sure but nevertheless what is the most tedious personal hygiene routine for you shaving my face, douching, wiping myself clean after a douce,

[00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:44.490]
squeezing hair, clipping nails, waxing or shaving body hair waxing body hair.

[00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:45.290]
Oh my god.

[00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:48.070]
You know who that brings to mind immediately.

[00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:56.470]
That sick bitch bathing or showering cleaning out my ears shaving or trimming my pubes, brushing my teeth,

[00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:00.870]
flossing, gargling, changing my tampon, emptying my colostomy bag.

[00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.250]
That's it right colonoscopy bag.

[00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:03.750]
Whatever.

[00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:12.030]
I'll clean the smegma for my foreskin cleaning the lint for my belly button washing my hair blow dry my hair combing or brushing my hair.

[00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:16.170]
The most tedious personal hygiene routine for Jews.

[00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:19.230]
Well for Jews certainly not foreskin.

[00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:30.330]
Shaving my face so far six there was an old lady at Woodbun a few days ago she had a mustache that even really.

[00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:34.190]
Oh my god even Jeff rumor would have been proud of it.

[00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:35.070]
The rimmester.

[00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.670]
How about those leafs that they lost the dekeldry last night four to three they suck.

[00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:44.110]
Go leaf go there's the game.

[00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:49.750]
Here's count re now bringing it back in over the line working in this press with the press the center.

[00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:56.050]
And it's deflected right on the doorstep into the crowd by Wayne Primo going hard to the net.

[00:51:56.050 --> 00:52:01.790]
You big turd Wayne Primo he ain't no Keith Primo I'll tell you that that's his brother he ain't heavy he's his brother.

[00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.170]
So I guess we don't want to hear any more hockey huh.

[00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:11.470]
Even with my friend the great Joe Bowen 40 to reason murky today I'll tell you winter is here there's no snow yet but oh boy.

[00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:17.570]
You feel that chill the big chill and you know what what I don't like it.

[00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.190]
And you know what I really don't like is this damn standard time.

[00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:33.810]
Now the first thing Obama could do is he could like make a presidential declaration and say that on January 21st the day after he sworn in we're going back to a daylight time all year round.

[00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:43.110]
Now what's the excuse that we go back on standard time is it got something to do with the farmers or some damn crap like that back on the well that's the excuse for daylight savings time.

[00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:46.070]
Yeah so excuse going off of it back to standard time.

[00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:51.230]
I don't know it's dark like it for 15 430 here just make up their mind and stick with it.

[00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.890]
Stick with daylight time man so at least we get a little bit of light and blade.

[00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:59.590]
Who now needs it to be light outside at four o'clock in the freaking morning for Christ's sakes.

[00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:07.050]
Right right and as far as some of those pan and he has little kids are waiting at the bus stop if it's dark out there in the morning.

[00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:12.370]
Maybe a few of them get run over okay decreased the surplus population some of them are probably pretty pretty pretty kids anyway.

[00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:16.470]
The Lord will sort it out the Lord will call them home.

[00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.590]
Don't you love those when they call him home.

[00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:28.910]
You religious people man you talk such garbage such nonsense it's just it's just enough to make me weak and just want to bend over and puke for hours.

[00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:35.170]
The Lord call them home. He's in a better place now. Yeah in a box rotting the worms are eating him. He's in a better place now.

[00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:41.010]
You should live so long cherish life because once it's over with baby you're dead.

[00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:44.490]
You ain't going to have any way go in a hell you ain't going to purgatory. You ain't going anywhere.

[00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:49.870]
Oh you'll see when you meet your maker. Yeah when you meet Marvin maker of Monticello raceway.

[00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:56.470]
What a clown show by Brad Kramer wins a raceway last night. Nice going Brad hit him again.

[00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.230]
Cut across the infield it might help once in a while.

[00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.850]
Neil I love your show says Glendo thanks for paying the playing the old bits is there enough ready Quinn to go around.

[00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:07.630]

[00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:10.090]
Keep up the great work and dump Chubby Chris.

[00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.010]
Oh that's the kind of spunk we like.

[00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:18.670]
A little bit of emotion out there these people are dead.

[00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:20.690]
I think they're spent from this election thing.

[00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.030]
I know I am God.

[00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:28.490]
Thank God I mean thank God number one that it was a we heard you say it thank God.

[00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:31.170]

[00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:39.010]
Divor from the Nesca Peter Hagaso.

[00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.110]
Okay that's a good one.

[00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:42.730]
Oh here's one from fake Chris good.

[00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:44.390]
This is the kind of stuff we need.

[00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:51.850]
If this email thing is going to work at all on this show otherwise we'll have to come up with something entirely different like messages in a bottle.

[00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:57.190]
Fix the stream from yesterday so I oh this is from the fake flea.

[00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.470]
I know because it's spelled FLEA.

[00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:07.970]
Fix the stream from yesterday so I can hear my email right on the air you fat fat fat gauge you bag the fake flea.

[00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:12.610]
Was there something wrong with the no idea.

[00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:15.370]
We don't we don't really care in the archives.

[00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:21.190]
Correct we don't we don't care the price is right and you take what you get in quick belly again.

[00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.530]
Here's one from the fake fat Chris.

[00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:25.470]
Hi Neil sir I can't be with you today.

[00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:31.450]
Jolly Joe called me at 6 a.m. say he'll be in my home at nine after my parents leave with the jar of Chris go and a box of rubbers.

[00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:36.410]
Jolly Joe used to enjoy bear backing meat but as a wild case of herpes I don't want to catch it.

[00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:40.690]
What time does Taco Bell open to the meal is at 10 a.m. here's my order for today.

[00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:45.250]
Two gorditas, two to lupas, not just with cheese and six off child tacos.

[00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.770]
After eat I eat all of that I'm gonna oh no I can't read that.

[00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:53.430]
Jolly Joe has asked me if he can give me a Cleveland steward you know what this is.

[00:55:53.530 --> 00:55:53.690]
Yep.

[00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:59.910]
Well Neil I should be back tomorrow hopefully my pimpley ass won't be sore from the pounding I'm taking from Jolly Joe.

[00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.470]
I love you Neil I love for the day that you can oh no I can't read that.

[00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:09.470]
I have to go now I have to go butter up my anus so it's tender for Jolly Joe by Neil fat Chris that is disgusting.

[00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:12.450]
I bet you Joyce Brackham would be grossed out by that.

[00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:18.750]
Joyce probably isn't listening to she's probably listening to tapes of no fart sounds.

[00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:20.310]
Remember that?

[00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.970]
Yep.

[00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:25.970]
Can't play that on the air because corporate don't want it corporate don't want it.

[00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:28.570]
Ain't no fart sound anymore.

[00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:32.130]
Oh just a little taste just a little teeny tiny taste.

[00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.910]
That's so good.

[00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:33.210]
Yeah.

[00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:36.250]
She blows she blows you know she blows.

[00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:41.370]
She's probably the most popular fake attorney in town I would say.

[00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:46.510]
Shaving my face is winning the personal hygiene pain in the ass 44.

[00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:48.590]
The Dow is down 309 points.

[00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.290]
It's a buying opportunity.

[00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:52.210]
What's his name?

[00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.410]

[00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:14.530]
The village is the nearest thing that I do to the door.

[00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:16.690]
And they don't stay paid me by that.

[00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:17.330]

I ain't never said door.

[00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:33.470]
I ain't never said door.

[00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.770]
Well, it may be but he the last couple times I saw Gour on TV

[01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:06.190]
He's looking about at least 180 years old. He's not looking too good or speaking too good

[01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:11.250]
He's like he's great, but nevertheless we know how he felt about that half silly half-witted bush bar

[01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:15.450]
I can't wait to hear his take on Obama the weather mind is sparkling and lovely love and kisses Liz

[01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:55.350]
Even the Republicans aren't that stupid they made the point on now your favorite show the Daily Show that she's taking big advantage of this

Vacuum this news vacuum right now boy anything fill a bill stick anything in there right now. That's right including her ugly push

Congratulations are getting out of there even though I'm hearing a rumor that the people with the money you can afford to live anywhere they want

[01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:42.710]
overwhelmingly live in South Florida, you know important people like Ricky Martin and Madonna

[01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:45.230]
Jose can suck. Oh people like that

[01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:48.250]
Important people not little people like me

[01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:52.930]
Marty says I cut my own hair takes a little time. Can you add that to the pool? No?

[01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:59.950]
I mean like shaving my hair. I do that too and that takes some time. It's it's you know the nuisance you want to put it on there?

[01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:01.170]
whatever

[01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:02.450]
No

[01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:06.370]
I don't want it. There's already a hundred choices on there

[01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:14.350]
Oh, here's one was was more in the GOP and John McCain's blame game not interested go away

[01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:18.130]
Here's a spy report on Joe Bell. Oh, this ought to be good

[01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:24.750]
The real mole now the real mole is flea believe me. He is a mole

[01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.730]
You know that don't you nothing is a bad guy, but he's a mole

[01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:35.450]
The minute he leaves that studio on the days when he fills in on this show. He's running over to Joe's orifice

[01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:40.170]
Let's have plenty of the pictures he's taken. I wouldn't wouldn't surprise me

[01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:46.190]
You better not pick your nose man. He'll be in there with a picture of it. I always speak my nose

[01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:50.230]
Okay, here's what this one says. This is from the mole

[01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.050]
Uncle Neil I wanted to give you a spy report on Joe Bell

[01:02:55.050 --> 01:03:00.570]
I spotted him at the stadium diner having lunch yesterday with flea flea had a notepad. I overheard the following

[01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:07.210]
Flea told Joe Bell that Neil and the rest of the crew are onto the secret love affair between him and fat Chris

[01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:11.510]
He said also said even though it seems fake that the old man knows it's real

[01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:19.670]
Flea went on to say that someone reported about the bloody diarrhea love canal and Chris's asless chaps and beef state tomato nipples

[01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:25.830]
I heard Joe Bell say I love Chris and will never stop slamming his big fat cottage cheese ass

[01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:29.050]
Joe went on to say it all started because Chris is my real informant

[01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.090]
I've grown to love it when Chris gently puts my

[01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:34.390]
Pimpley I can't say it in his plump rear now counting on you flea

[01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:39.690]
Then Joe Bell ordered liver and onions while flea rubbed his cracked fat feet under the table

[01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:47.550]
Then the thing I heard as I was walking out was flea asking to take Chris's places Joe's lover, but Joe said he prefers a bear over a tweak

[01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:53.670]
But that a job under the table is not of the question strange, but true says the real mole

[01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.570]
Stadium diners it's still there. I'm sure it is

[01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:00.410]
It's one of those places that'll never go away

[01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:03.470]
Go away

[01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.130]
Yeah, let's play that again just so we can sure the go away

[01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:09.490]
It's my favorite

[01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:12.050]
73 votes on the new poll

[01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:18.190]
Let's look at that outwardly express. Oh look at this. There's some stuff in there. Here's the freight Greg Vudelle

[01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:19.190]
I've been helping

[01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:26.230]
Program the new serious channel to the blend the people in the building can't stand mo including his co-host on late hits

[01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:29.950]
I think they was afraid of something that George fearing the word would get back to mo

[01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:32.490]
Says the fake Greg Vudelle

[01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.110]
Hey

[01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:45.030]
Uncle Neil I look to which Liz happy birthday for when she was 18 years old says Ed

[01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:51.010]
Quit picking on a Liz okay, at least she cared enough to say something nice. Okay Ed chronic ed

[01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:58.950]
Yeah, the people who could afford to live inside anywhere they want they come to South Florida so they can hear

[01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:03.570]
Yeah, so the new people the notion whining and moaning

[01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:10.250]
Growning all the old cockers gumming the food gumming the jello at that coconut creek seminal place my god

[01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:13.850]
I wanted to go up to the counter and ask the

[01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:17.410]
Ask the cashier am I old enough to be eating in here or what

[01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:19.510]
God

[01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:25.410]
I'm surprised they don't have like a a funeral

[01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:29.890]
Parle were representative coming going table to table probably to a land office business

[01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:34.650]
But wouldn't the president if I saw it very similar stiffs on the way out

[01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:43.210]
Steve says while most of us struggle nationwide and again the higher-ups of the AIG corporation to decide to spend another half million dollars of bailout money on a three-day retreat and an

[01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:51.870]
Extremely luxurious getaway including two-story townhomes for each person thousands on food thousands on recreation thousands on travel expenses and so on

[01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:54.150]
This guy's almost as pissed off his Lou dobs

[01:05:56.030 --> 01:06:01.590]
According to wired and the AP AIG spend over five hundred and sixty seven grand on taxpayer money the bailout money

[01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:06.950]
It's supposed to help these companies get a leg up now AIG is asked for forty billion more more money for these money

[01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:10.410]
Grubbing a host a little of the life that they want by most people suffer and do without

[01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:14.150]
This is the kind of thing that needs to stop and stop immediately

[01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.570]
I wouldn't expect the Bush administration to do anything about it

[01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:18.790]
But I hope an Obama takes over this kind of a

[01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:26.370]
Smetting will be stopped. I'm sick and tired of paying for other people's fun lots of nerve AIG's to Steve and you know what Steve you are

[01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.890]
His name

[01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:38.650]
No

[01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:42.710]
He sure did he made all these

[01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:43.990]
Baby

[01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:54.310]
All these stories oh you're such a bastard you're such a heathen bastard Neil. Yeah, that's right. That's me. You got the right one

[01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:58.730]
Let me thirty two at five sixty wq a.m. It's woodbind Wednesday

[01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:04.470]
Maybe I'm gonna go there when I was a zillion dollars today and then Joe Belkins stick the whole place right inside his shoot

[01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:07.010]
If Chris will permit

[01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:11.070]
Move over Chris. Yeah move out of the way see you

[01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:13.110]
Got a big delivery coming in there

[01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:17.670]
Oh yellow belly says yes, there are more wealthy people here than anywhere else in the world

[01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:20.410]
This is true all year round but especially in the winter

[01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:27.070]
estimates are during the winter 80% of the wealth in the country and 40% worldwide wealth are controlled by those in this area

[01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:28.930]
From Miami Beach through Palm Beach County

[01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:33.310]
There's a big difference between visiting someplace and living there. It's fundification in Berlin

[01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:37.190]
Italy etc but try actually living there and it gets old real fast

[01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:39.730]
Well, you know what? I'm not gonna live there. I'm not gonna try living there

[01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:43.830]
I'm living in Toronto when I like it real well and as far as people with money believe me

[01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.610]
They got money here that hasn't even been printed yet

[01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:49.250]
And as soon as they start printing it

[01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:54.690]
So there's a guy that's all excited about being in South Florida. I guess that makes him rich

[01:07:55.370 --> 01:08:00.390]
I guess sams is I heard you talking about moving back to South Florida. I hope you're a kidding. Yes, I am

[01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:01.970]
For last many years

[01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:03.970]
You continually talk about how

[01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:07.510]
Nasty cold and bitter most of the people are in South Florida. That's right

[01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:10.670]
I'd rather have cold nasty weather than cold nasty people

[01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:13.190]
And of course you are absolutely correct sir

[01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:17.070]
You always say the only people still living here are people who can't afford to leave

[01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:22.170]
Again correct in spite of that last chronic emailor. Oh, what's his name yellow belly a turd

[01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:28.070]
I moved here 10 years ago from northern California and if I had your cash, I certainly would be gone

[01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:31.470]
Neil, there's no doubt you're getting older and it's quite possible

[01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:37.690]
Synility could be setting in if you did move at least you could be you could party hard at the hard rock and the tracks

[01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:39.390]
What's your real take on the subject?

[01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:42.290]
That's my real take. I'm not going anywhere

[01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:45.930]
Sam says p.s. I got a good feeling about the pants tomorrow night

[01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:50.810]
The jets actually have a very good attacking defense and I think Matt castle will really struggle

[01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.690]
He's got a bad feeling about the pants. I wish you all lots of luck

[01:08:54.690 --> 01:08:56.830]
Well, you know what my life will go on winner lose

[01:08:56.830 --> 01:08:58.370]
I'm not one of those people against

[01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:03.230]
Psychotic about ball games. I wasn't happy that they blew the Super Bowl to the horseball giants last year

[01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:08.870]
But nevertheless they had the game one and the defense took off last the minute and a half of that game, you know

[01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:14.950]
Am I right fatso? Mm-hmm the defense took a c-estid last part of that game. Yep

[01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:20.290]
Eli manning my ass. I know the giants are pretty good. I don't ask me why they bother me

[01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:26.950]
And you know why they bother me because they're a New York team. I agree. Oh, it's phones ringing up and you know what it is? It's that package. I'll be back

[01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.390]
I

[01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:30.130]
Was ready this time

[01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:43.130]
Now he's just answering the phone right he's not gonna go get that pack. I hope

[01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.110]
Okay, hearing me say that you might just get that idea. What? Huh?

[01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:52.730]
When he say something bad about me, I never that's right behind that. I haven't mailed it. I'm below

[01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:54.630]
That's fine. I mean

[01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:57.890]
No, just afraid that you were actually gonna go get that package instead of just answering the phone

[01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:03.770]
No, I'm not gonna go get the package because I already told you I'm playing oldies today. They might on save the new stuff for tomorrow good

[01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:08.190]
Oh, boy, I'm getting too old to be running in the other room

[01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:14.150]
Uncle Neil says Scott one of the choices in the poll is wiping yourself clean after a douce

[01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:17.370]
If douce is douce a typo or just

[01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:23.890]
No, no, I'm just a dumb shmit. Don't know what a douce means. Oh my god. Well, Scott. I'm sorry. Don't listen to this show

[01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:29.230]
Doesn't know what a douce made look at up in the urban dictionary here. Yeah, go look up Schmidt in the dictionary

[01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:34.670]
97 votes on the second poll. What do you have on a first one a thousand and one thousand sum

[01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:41.190]
He is so slow. Oh my god fat people are slow

[01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:46.250]
I think one leads to the other didn't it wouldn't be by that. Well if you move fast you wouldn't be fast

[01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:50.270]
I was down to 82 come on fat. So what do we have on the other one? Are you not gonna look? Yeah

[01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.310]
I'll find it right

[01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:55.970]
2001 I'm way ahead of you and 102

[01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:57.990]
God, huh

[01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:04.790]
And 102 said it means we got 1103. Yep 1103. It's only 1136 lots of numbers for that guy

[01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:08.290]
It's just doing numbers Neil you're mailing it in that's right. I'm mailing it in

[01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:16.450]
I'm mailing it in getting paid a lot of money to mail it in believe you me this week put a big fat check in the bank

[01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:18.590]
Big and fat like a tubby there

[01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:20.770]
Not that big or that fat

[01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:24.770]
Loses back again. She says Ed can kiss my cute butt

[01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:32.050]
I'm sorry. I was late but I happen to have a life unlike dorks like Ed. Oh, yeah, Ed is a dork Liz by the way

[01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:32.910]
He's just chronic

[01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:38.030]
Until I put the cabash on him in the beginning. Where's they're doing the emails? He was on it. This is Ed from poor Lutterdale

[01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.370]
I'm sure

[01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:41.890]
Over and over and over again

[01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:45.510]
I've got a job in hobbies and parties and the husband and many other busy things to do

[01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.510]
So Liz as a matter of fact I've got to get on the road in a few minutes

[01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:53.090]
Which always makes me think of one of my favorite bits little brown coupe if you can play it for me

[01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:55.030]
I'd smile all the way my next fabulous thing to do

[01:11:55.650 --> 01:12:01.610]
Little brown coupe. It's old. I think it qualifies for the four. Oh, yeah, little brown coupe. It's my little brown coupe

[01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:04.110]
I haven't played that in a right coupe stage

[01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:17.750]
I do up my car and that's my Alex Brown

[01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.210]
It has a hole in the trunk and a dent in the door

[01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:24.830]
And you can see the road through the hole in the floor

[01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:26.710]
It's my little brown coupe

[01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.350]
I'm so proud with that guy

[01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:31.850]
I'm so proud with that guy

[01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:35.310]
It's an 82-curl only with one hazelight

[01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.990]
So when it gets dark I can use my flight

[01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:40.790]
With something breaks down

[01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.530]
No, it's not hard to fix

[01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.650]
I stopped taking failing wire

[01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:47.850]
That's the trick. It's my little brown coupe

[01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:50.350]
I'm so proud with that guy

[01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:52.890]
It's so proud with that guy

[01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:56.230]
I don't want to know how to drive a car before

[01:12:56.230 --> 01:12:59.870]
But they handed me the keys when I got too short

[01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.350]
I didn't let in enough to make you really flip

[01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:07.390]
There's one more thing I got no blanks on it

[01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:10.470]
It feels up with water on the rainy day

[01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:14.130]
When the tape and the windows seems to work okay

[01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:17.570]
The front wheels start to shake when I try to steer

[01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:20.870]
And I can't get it out of second gear

[01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:22.810]
It's my little brown coupe

[01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:25.450]
I'm so proud with that guy

[01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:27.990]
I'm so proud with that guy

[01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:29.910]
It's my little brown coupe

Okay, the fake Damon says this was funny at first but it really needs to stop now

[01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:43.710]
I was finishing my shift last evening and I went to the control room to pick up a few things before leaving

[01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:48.070]
The door to the control room was closed. I heard some loud squealing coming from the room

[01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.610]
I had heard this noise before

[01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:52.390]
I cracked open the door was disgusted at what I saw

[01:16:55.090 --> 01:16:58.290]
There was Joey Joe Bell met over the best with his pants around his ankles

[01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:01.630]
He had a small pillow in his mouth and seemed to be moaning into the pillow

[01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:05.410]
There was fat Chris with a cowboy head on pumping away like a madman

[01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:07.310]
Swat sweating like a hog and heat

[01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:08.990]
What color was that

[01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:14.510]
It was at this point that fat Chris looked up to the sky started squealing and slapping Joe's fat ass

[01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:18.910]
This grow test display went on from about 15 minutes at this point

[01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:22.590]
Joe's ass was as red as a tomato from Chris's um something

[01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:27.450]
It's chopped off

[01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:33.510]
Joe seemed like he was excited for Chris to finish fat Chris then stopped squealing as Joe if he was ready

[01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:36.130]
Joe spit out the pillow and said oh god. Yes, give it to me

[01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:38.710]
Then Chris pulled out and oh, I can't read that

[01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:43.230]
When they were finished it says Joe's face looked like a sweaty glazed donut

[01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:51.470]
Please fire that fat slob ASAP makes me sick sign Damon. I guess you pissed off Damon. I'm in Delara D.A.

[01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.210]
What did you do?

[01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.410]

[01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:57.490]
Police spurned him. Oh, that's you're talking to the fat Chris not me

[01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:01.590]
Or the fake Chris or whatever it is the fat the fat Chris yeah the fake one

[01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:08.430]
I'm beginning to think that um some of these stories are too not at all

[01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.970]
I noticed Joe Bell didn't deny any of that

[01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.850]

[01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:21.530]
You know of like one tenth of one percent of the people that they send around you. Yeah

[01:21:24.570 --> 01:21:27.430]
It's throwing off crap on the air and so it'll maybe come down hit the ground

[01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:28.310]
It's like joe bell

[01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:32.150]
You put enough crap on here. Maybe somebody you listen to it. It hasn't worked so far though

[01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:34.870]
But he keeps just throwing more and more crap out there

[01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:42.910]
We've got so many people on the in the years. We've been on this radio station. We've had so many people who have no business being on here

[01:21:44.230 --> 01:21:45.930]
People are not blog castus

[01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:52.990]
How's Jimmy syphilis doing that's gonna be our next poll by the way can I smas macho and it's markfully a limperist Charlie

[01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:59.830]
How is the Jimmy doing?

[01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:06.890]
Clear ask them. Yeah, I mean I'm just a rhetorical question. I'll allow. I'll allow that's all. I'm just thinking I'll

[01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:14.250]
I mean and you kept chastising me for talking about footy all the time and look what it did for him. I know you

[01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:19.790]
I was promoting him I promoted him right off the air nice going footing. Yeah, isn't that good to my madness?

[01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:25.550]
Oh, God when you tell everybody it's the worst show in history and I'm hearing that Jimmy syphilis is even worse than footsy

[01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:28.490]
Oh brother at least footsy was a broadcaster of sorts, you know

[01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:33.110]
He was in y100 for a hundred years. That's why they called it y100

[01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:40.490]
But Jimmy syphilis. He's just another silly-ass ex-jock Jimmy you fairy how's that wine business coming Jimmy

[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.210]
It went belly up just like Jimmy

[01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:48.710]
Rons is so if we bail out the automakers don't confuse this with bridge loans

[01:22:48.710 --> 01:22:53.130]
Do we know that they'll be able to survive and go forward or they'll be needing more money soon like maybe six months

[01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:59.650]
I don't know and whatever they need will give it to them billions and billions and billions and I say let them go bust and all those people are gonna lose their job too bad

[01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:03.310]
Too bad. Let them move to Mexico and pick lettuce

[01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:09.530]
And let the people who really want to work hard come in from Mexico. That's what I say. I'm all for the Mexicans

[01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:15.790]
One thing I know about the Mexicans they sure know how to spend money not their own necessarily somebody else's oh

[01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:20.490]
They know how to do it and here I thought I was safe marrying an Irish

[01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:28.090]
What does that mean? Well, they know how to spend money too. I thought the average were 50

[01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:34.530]
Though those are the Scottish oh the Scottish are 50 and the Dutch are just playing damn cheap like the frogs like the French Canadians

[01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:38.530]
Do we know what the result of them going bankrupt and then restructuring without the unreasonable

[01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:42.450]
Um something salaries other obstacles would be and how long it would take to me

[01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:49.630]
It looks as though they wouldn't survive and currently has currently configured a matter how much money we give them and giving money to the reconfigured company would be the best long term investment for the country

[01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:50.250]
Cisron

[01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:52.190]

[01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:54.850]
Give us won't tell us what type of collateral they got for their loans

[01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:59.110]
These are some bastards running our country our sure hope Obama will at least be honest and open

[01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:01.150]
I want to know what they're doing with our money

[01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:22.490]
I'd love to see a min pin in the White House wouldn't that be cute sure tiny

[01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:27.430]
Dropping tiny turrets all over the White House they could call it the Brown House

[01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:33.590]
Don't think about little dogs man. They are sneaky like little kids

[01:24:34.530 --> 01:24:38.670]
Sneaky like little people like midgeeks. I bet you jockeys are sneaky too. I don't know why

[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:41.530]
Yeah, jockeys are like munchkins

[01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:44.670]
They all talk like they got a mouthful of helium

[01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.890]
Well mister right. I think it was a good ride. I think

[01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:51.350]
Opening on the rail I could have bus through there and my mom

[01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.370]

Oh here's one from chronic chronic head. Oh, this is at an homestead

[01:24:59.730 --> 01:25:02.090]

[01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:05.410]
Oh, hey, you're such a panic that's it

[01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:09.410]
Neil at neorages.com get those emails coming man load them up

[01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:15.750]
We got two hours to go here on a Wednesday and it's just shocking the the lethargic crowd we got out there today

[01:25:16.190 --> 01:25:20.250]
Well, I say crowd I'm exaggerating the lethargic group

[01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:25.150]
How many people do think we really have listening right now

[01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:29.610]
And then I'm hearing more about that signal jolt by the way in his lunch hour

[01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:33.890]
Gonna go out and pee on the tower today jolly joe bill and Chris as he wants to help him out

[01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:40.150]
He said he wants to be standing right there like two gigantic fountains from Rome

[01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:44.910]
Okay on the tower side by each boy that talk about a flood huh?

[01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:50.190]
Can you envision that? I'd rather not holding hands no

[01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:55.290]
Like football players in the huddle, you know, no now at what level do they do that college?

[01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:58.450]
Not certainly not pros pros don't hold hands in the huddle do they no

[01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:00.070]
I don't think so

[01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:02.770]
I never really watched all that much

[01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:08.030]
I know that when Brady before got injured they when he was the pivot man there for the patriots

[01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:10.250]
They were all up real tight and cloy and in fact

[01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:14.310]
I notice that that game that Brady Quinn started for the browns last week same thing

[01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:16.870]
The huddle got really tight

[01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:20.810]
Unlike Brady the huddle got really tight

[01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:26.110]
What do you think about Brady gay or not gay that's a good pull for somebody if Jimmy syphilis could take that pull tomorrow

[01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:27.250]
gay or not gay

[01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:29.310]
Or

[01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:33.790]
We could what which one of these jocks you think really is a definitely gay

[01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:35.330]
Mike Piazza

[01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.830]
Brady Quinn

[01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:42.050]
Any other contenders?

[01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:44.250]
You're not a canylie

[01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.630]
Camneyly or maybe Jimmy syphilis

[01:26:48.530 --> 01:26:51.810]
Biggest name the best talent he built his new projects

[01:26:51.810 --> 01:26:54.270]
Sport ratio 560 QAM

[01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.890]

[01:26:57.010 --> 01:26:59.550]
The biggest names the best talent

[01:27:00.610 --> 01:27:05.210]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM

[01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:07.670]

With the round beams today

[01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:18.950]
Oh right

[01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:24.030]
I'd say classic set of wheels fixed up the way a brother would like it

[01:27:25.190 --> 01:27:30.270]
Now we've been keeping the China and the trim is cold and it dies to the mercy

This is the best kid now so I've bounced out the road

[01:27:48.490 --> 01:27:50.830]
In a big status superfoward

[01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:54.210]
Now in the office stop the big deals

[01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:57.110]
A day of the random things in the breaks

[01:27:58.210 --> 01:27:59.790]
By 1979

[01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:01.850]

I got my windows down on a hot summer day

[01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:49.890]
Because they hazy don't work no way

[01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:53.150]
This wedding fresh with all seats starts to smell

[01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:55.650]
And gets the tussey look at all the time

[01:28:56.870 --> 01:29:00.730]
And from a factory you find a shiny ground and smell like lime

[01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:02.190]
And it's my coffee channel too

[01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.390]

[01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.270]
Okay

[01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:34.330]
As far as professional athletes that are a little light and they're loafers

[01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:37.430]
I know it's not a big sport but Roger Federer

[01:29:38.230 --> 01:29:40.930]
He said in the magazine a couple months ago

[01:29:40.930 --> 01:29:43.230]
They're asking tennis players

[01:29:43.230 --> 01:29:44.750]
What do they listen to what music they listen to

[01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:46.110]
When they get ready for a match

[01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:47.070]
And most of them are saying

[01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:48.990]
Led Zeppelin Metallica

[01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:50.370]
And Federer said

[01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:51.070]
Madonna

[01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:52.010]
You're fair

[01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.430]
Wow

[01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.830]
I know

[01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:53.370]
And

[01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:54.910]

[01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:56.330]

[01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:57.630]
He's with that heparit too

[01:29:57.630 --> 01:29:58.870]
All the fine pieces he can have

[01:29:58.870 --> 01:30:00.490]
He's still with that big heparit

[01:30:00.490 --> 01:30:00.690]
You know

[01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.390]

There aren't any

[01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:15.770]
Well I didn't give any numbers out

[01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:16.970]
I didn't say anything about taking calls

[01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:18.810]
These people need a little heads up

[01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:20.090]
You know they need to get their head up

[01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:22.330]
And most of them do have their head up

[01:30:22.330 --> 01:30:22.990]

[01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:25.010]

Oh Dr. Adam is still listening

[01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:32.830]
Even though I broke down and got sinus

[01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:35.490]
I'm still an avid fan for 20 plus years

[01:30:35.490 --> 01:30:36.170]
I'm 41

[01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:37.770]
Oh I got serious

[01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:39.090]
I thought I said I got sinus

[01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:41.210]
Anyway

[01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:43.930]
Putting a shout out to let you know

[01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:45.930]
Someone living but barely breathing is listening

[01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:47.290]
I'm a psychologist

[01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:48.710]
Who had a patient once

[01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:50.210]
Who might consider quite intelligent

[01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:53.450]
She went online into an IQ site called

[01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:54.070]
Tickle

[01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:56.750]
Which was also a romance matching site

[01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.350]
While my 54-year-old little QD patient

[01:30:59.350 --> 01:31:00.850]
Fell for this 25-year-old

[01:31:00.850 --> 01:31:02.090]
Schmartseer from Nigeria

[01:31:02.650 --> 01:31:05.030]
And before she knew what was uh what hit her

[01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:06.390]
She was caching checks

[01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:08.070]
Uh inner work counts for him

[01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:10.150]

Oh my god and then he writes uh this isn't the real doctor

[01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:17.010]

[01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.310]
It sounds like something Johnny Dark would write

[01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:26.670]
Last time I wrote was eight years ago

[01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:28.510]

[01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:29.470]

[01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:07.230]
154 votes on a pool

And the Dow down 249.86

Then they think they know us because we're on a radio right

[01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:42.750]

They think they know because somebody's on TV whether they're good person bad person evil you know

[01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:50.490]

G. Yeah

[01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:23.670]
Speaking of fake everything is fake now. Mm-hmm. Most of our emails are from fake people

[01:44:24.210 --> 01:44:26.270]
Fake New York Times proclaims end to wars

[01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:32.310]
The Iraq and Afghanistan wars are over if you can believe a fake copy of the New York Times circulating around Manhattan today

[01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:35.310]
The paper was allegedly printed by the periodist the yes-man

[01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:40.650]
Who are responsible for myriad of politically oriented pranks that were the subject of a major film

[01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:45.310]
Early this morning commuters nationwide were delighted to find out that while they were sleeping

[01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:51.670]
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had come to an end if that is they happen to read a special edition of today's New York Times

[01:44:52.290 --> 01:44:57.450]
In an elaborate operation six months into planning one point two million papers were printed at six different presses

[01:44:57.450 --> 01:45:02.530]
And driven to pre-arrange pickup locations were thousands of volunteers stood ready to pass them out on the street

[01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:08.590]
Articles in the paper denounced dozens of new initiatives including the establishment of national health care

[01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:12.910]
The abolition of corporate lobbying a minute maximum wage for CEOs and of course the end of war

[01:45:14.050 --> 01:45:19.810]
The paper and exact replica of the New York Times includes international national New York and business sections as well as editorials

[01:45:19.810 --> 01:45:23.410]
Corrections on the number of ads including a recall notice for all cars. They were on gas

[01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:29.010]

Commitating in president Obama's yes, we really can't speech the paper is post dated July 4 2009

[01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:46.910]
We've got to make sure Obama and all the other Democrats do what we elected them to do after a there may be 28 years of hell

[01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:48.690]
We need to start imagining heaven

[01:45:56.130 --> 01:45:58.890]
I'm all for freedom of speech, but they should have started their own paper

[01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:03.750]

[02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:10.510]
Hmm we didn't think he'd have at least a couple hundred

[02:06:11.110 --> 02:06:17.210]
Uh-most radio people do yeah, yeah several hundred usually you know if anybody's listening maybe nobody's listening Greg

[02:06:17.210 --> 02:06:22.390]
Maybe everybody everybody in Montgomery hates Greg just as much as the people of South Florida didn't everywhere he goes

[02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:25.930]
They hate you Greg because they know that you're paranoid uptight and insecure

[02:06:28.170 --> 02:06:28.650]
Boy

[02:06:28.650 --> 02:06:30.090]

Do you know who the gravity guy is?

[02:08:14.490 --> 02:08:15.370]

That person is whoopie goldberg fat. I can't even look at her

[02:08:40.810 --> 02:08:45.470]

He says like you I had a thing for Tony Dow when the show was for his broadcast. I bet you did

[02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:18.150]

[02:09:46.170 --> 02:09:47.810]

[02:10:14.130 --> 02:10:16.270]
George Rodriguez there we go and it's on away

[02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:19.810]
To the miracle of modern technology it'll be their momentary

[02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:25.310]
I mean you wouldn't care because you know you're like one of those straight holes. Mm-hmm. Sorry, darling

[02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:30.130]
Current photo. Oh, yeah, when you ought to be I think a lot of you straight people ought to start apologizing to us fags

[02:10:30.130 --> 02:10:31.470]
That's right. Yeah

[02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:37.310]
You straight bastards. Hey, listen. We don't have any problem with each other. We're not competing for the same things

[02:10:38.010 --> 02:10:38.570]
Yeah

[02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:43.610]
We're never any other way. There's great concern about facts. Oh

[02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:46.530]
Amongst us straight people there isn't

[02:10:47.410 --> 02:10:52.090]
Only closet queens. That's right. I saw my folks people with issues. Yes

[02:10:52.090 --> 02:10:57.270]
So speaking of that the Palm Beach County Republican Mark Foley served in Washington, tell I had seen like worth for nearly three decades

[02:10:57.270 --> 02:11:03.890]
Until his resignation from Congress in 2006 after news reports of his sexually explicit online chats with congressional pages

[02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:12.950]
Torturous difficult embarrassing. I don't know how many adjectives I can throw at you to quantify what has been the experience Foley said of the emotional fallout of his political scandal

[02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:17.470]
A disgrace that press odds to the defeat of other congressional incumbents and the 2006 elections

[02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:23.550]
Foley has ended the two-year boardcott of the media by telling news anchor Roxanne Stein of Channel 5 in Palm Beach

[02:11:23.550 --> 02:11:28.170]
Then he struggled for decades to face childhood abuse by Catholic priest Catholic priest. Oh my god

[02:11:28.170 --> 02:11:30.450]
unusual one another isolated incident

[02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:34.790]
He says he's embarrassed by the illicit electronic message. He's sent to congressional pages

[02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:36.550]
But strongly denies being a pedophile

[02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:40.990]
He says it took time to become comfortable telling others that he is gay gay

[02:11:41.670 --> 02:11:45.510]
No question. You don't let people in your life. You said of keeping a sexual orientation secret fears

[02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:50.090]
When's the governor coming out of the closet? Oh boy the Republicans are gonna have a nervous breakdown of an ad

[02:11:50.690 --> 02:11:53.610]
First mark fully then Larry Craig and then miss Limpress Christ

[02:11:56.490 --> 02:12:02.770]
When Foley resigned from Congress in the fall of 2006 his west Palm Beach attorney David Roth no relation to Hyman

[02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:06.410]
It's funny. I have a thing here about Hyman Roth an email

[02:12:06.930 --> 02:12:11.470]
Reveal that Foley was molested by a clergyman between the ages of 13 and 15 by Catholic priest

[02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:14.690]
He also said he was recovering from alcohol abuse

[02:12:17.070 --> 02:12:22.770]
Everything David Roth said that day was true despite the fact so many people said we were making it up to save my political seat Foley said

[02:12:23.530 --> 02:12:26.430]
Foley 51 and I'm involved in a real estate business based in Palm Beach

[02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:30.230]
Contents that much of his life has been shaped by the abusive encountered when I was 12

[02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:32.790]
I was abused he said while wiping tears from his cheeks

[02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:37.310]
So I recognized that pain that suffering. I wish I'd confronted those demons

[02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:41.070]
But there was a lot of hesitation because my parents had such deep faith

[02:12:41.070 --> 02:12:45.390]
I didn't want to let them down. I don't want to let them believe a man of God could have done this to their son

[02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:49.550]
A man of God my ass. Oh you people with your priests

[02:12:50.130 --> 02:12:52.670]
The world's biggest closet the priesthood baby

[02:12:53.710 --> 02:12:56.650]
You see a priest just shout across to him. You fair that's

[02:12:59.110 --> 02:13:02.210]
So keep this inside you keep this inside yourself. You had it from everyone

[02:13:02.210 --> 02:13:06.530]
He says when this voice cracking with emotion foley at it because you feel like it may have been my fault

[02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:11.010]
You try your best to move forward ignoring that it happened when you're 12 years old a priest is telling you

[02:13:11.010 --> 02:13:14.970]
This is healthy. This is good. Oh God. It's good. If you tell anybody I'll kill myself

[02:13:15.630 --> 02:13:21.030]
Your life is instantly changed doesn't make it right. I regretted it this day this incident when I've done but I can't change history

[02:13:21.710 --> 02:13:26.490]
Throughout the interview conducted this West Palm Beach office and briefly outdoors while walking dogs near his Palm Beach home

[02:13:26.490 --> 02:13:28.270]
Foley expresses embarrassment and regret

[02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:30.930]
He said he sympathizes with his political successor

[02:13:30.930 --> 02:13:35.270]
US representative Tim Mahoney Democrat who took over the 16th congressional district seat and lost

[02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:39.470]
Re-election this month following revelations of his own sex scandal involving multiple extramarital affairs

[02:13:41.190 --> 02:13:44.550]
Watching Tim was not anything that made me say yippee yippee i.o

[02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:47.530]
That's exactly the quote yippee yippee i.o

[02:13:47.530 --> 02:13:50.990]
He got what he deserved fully said it was another person to fall short of expectation

[02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:55.290]
Another person person resting with some demons. There's a reason for some to behavior

[02:13:55.290 --> 02:13:58.070]
It's not for me to sit here and have pity party or celebration

[02:13:58.550 --> 02:14:00.030]
Says miss Foley

[02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:04.170]
Andre says on this this must be the Andre admiral who this is

[02:14:06.050 --> 02:14:10.510]
Andre must be like Mexican or something because he says now that we got to be Republicans out of the White House

[02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:17.610]
Out of Miami. Maybe we should hire Hyman Roth he says Andres could be French to Andres Fountainias

[02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:26.270]
Fountain is Fountain is maybe he's a Dominic anna from the Republican to be anna maybe Larry public he'd do

[02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:30.270]
Manicana or maybe he's close to recon maybe he's an old Salvadorian border beacon right

[02:14:31.630 --> 02:14:33.310]
Maybe he's from Guatemala

[02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:37.230]

We're just scouting areas calm down

On the bottom of the bunch don't tell me to calm down. We got lucky with Lee low and state to 128 million dollars

[02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:05.670]
Now you're trying to ruin the whole network. What kind of programming are you running?

[02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:08.450]
Hang on a minute

[02:18:05.650 --> 02:18:06.090]
Ha

[02:18:07.330 --> 02:18:10.530]
Now do you think this stuff is really coming from the real Greg Vidal of course not

[02:18:11.770 --> 02:18:15.490]
Because he felt it was so important to send me this when he sent it again a second time

[02:18:16.510 --> 02:18:19.030]

Fred Souter who's at Keynesville Community Radio our good old friend Fred finally came out of the closet. I mean

[02:19:07.490 --> 02:19:11.790]
He says hey, I'm not sure if this is the same guy who was news director channel seven when we were w.w.w.o.d

[02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:13.190]
But I thought I passed it along

[02:19:17.490 --> 02:19:21.690]
I don't think he was news director Andrew Asson the woods he was pd at this station

[02:19:24.090 --> 02:19:29.050]
Just started listening about an hour ago. So sorry if somebody already told you no nobody told me Fred from radio ink

Premier radio never said in the statement our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family and Fred Souter says it's going around

[02:19:50.810 --> 02:19:56.890]
It's going around Fred. I'm dying over here. Andrew Asson the woods. Wow. I could take a stir about him, but I won't

Speaking of it. Well, I don't want to go into it. I mean when a guy has a heart attack. I don't want to rip him while he's down

[02:20:14.130 --> 02:20:17.650]

No, the inquirer's exclusive bomb shell expose as John McCain's wife Cindy is cut with another man

[02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:26.930]
Not only that but maybe multiple witnesses have caught the pair lip locking on several other occasions

[02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:32.230]
I couldn't believe I was watching Cindy McCain passionately kissing and hugging another man

[02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:39.610]
That's the stun reaction of eyewitnesses who also said she watched in shock and snap photos as the former presidential candidates wife

[02:22:39.610 --> 02:22:46.590]
Romantically kissed a long-haired man who resembles washed up 80s rock musician. It's the one of them. We don't know which one

[02:22:47.430 --> 02:22:50.090]
Searches until the inquirer investigative team

[02:22:50.650 --> 02:22:53.830]
The pair have been in concerts and sporting event. Oh who the hell cares. Okay

[02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:57.490]

Wow, that must be Lucas Lucas Pedolski or remember Lucas from yesterday

[02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:23.870]
Lucas vanished there especially after he blurted out about the political stuff, you know

[02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:27.070]
Just another pissed off McCain right wing Nazi bastard

[02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:32.050]
And then he's then he thanks this for getting him off the religious kick it didn't make any sense at all

[02:24:32.050 --> 02:24:33.510]

Okay, well, that's one of our fine sponsors. We're certainly not gonna put that on here

[02:24:54.210 --> 02:24:55.810]

[02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:57.590]
Maybe he dumped it too

[02:24:58.250 --> 02:24:59.450]
Sounds like it

[02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:02.730]
Sounded pretty nervous sounded like maybe he was coming from across the street

[02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:07.270]
Maybe he was looking to old naked pictures of Joel Feinberg

[02:25:08.010 --> 02:25:10.730]

They search it every wall or Taliban on the run

[02:26:01.390 --> 02:26:04.250]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:08.850]
Well the bombs kept falling till they're deserts

[02:26:08.850 --> 02:26:12.130]
We got too close to down

[02:26:12.850 --> 02:26:16.550]
In the town we're searching for them everywhere

[02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:20.250]
Well it's back till they made it town

[02:26:20.250 --> 02:26:24.150]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:27.510]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:32.370]
They're on the land for a good sign

[02:26:32.370 --> 02:26:34.210]
They search it every

[02:26:49.790 --> 02:26:51.990]
They search it every wall or Taliban on the run

[02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.030]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:52.270]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:52.270]

[02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:52.350]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:52.350 --> 02:26:52.370]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.390]
Taliban on the run

[02:26:52.390 --> 02:26:53.550]

[02:26:53.550 --> 02:27:04.990]
Taliban on the run

[02:27:04.990 --> 02:27:09.270]
Taliban on the run

[02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:11.010]
Taliban on the run

[02:27:11.010 --> 02:27:14.550]
Taliban on the run

[02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:16.550]
There are many trillion entries on the internet

[02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:17.830]
about Charlie Christ's gay

[02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:21.270]
I just found something somewhat interesting

[02:27:21.270 --> 02:27:24.210]
Charlie Christ was married once when he was 23

[02:27:24.210 --> 02:27:27.770]
from 1979 to 1980 for seven months to a woman

[02:27:27.770 --> 02:27:29.010]
Amanda Moro the realtor

[02:27:29.010 --> 02:27:32.570]
She is reportedly living in an open lesbian relationship with

[02:27:32.570 --> 02:27:33.390]
Mildred G. Harrison

[02:27:33.390 --> 02:27:37.010]
This is all open information found in tabloids and open records

[02:27:37.010 --> 02:27:38.970]
After this no steady girlfriend for Christ

[02:27:38.970 --> 02:27:40.510]
No open flirtations nothing

[02:27:41.010 --> 02:27:42.850]
Right around the time he was running for governor

[02:27:42.850 --> 02:27:45.130]
There were claims of a steady girlfriend here and there

[02:27:45.130 --> 02:27:47.030]
And then of course when he was hoping to be the VP

[02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:49.630]
Pick for McCain all of a sudden this wedding got announced

[02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:51.190]
How do you like that?

[02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:53.030]
It says here hey Charlie

[02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:54.970]
Just come out and see you like the Greek love man

[02:27:55.450 --> 02:27:56.930]
What? I said hey

[02:27:57.970 --> 02:27:59.290]
He's a geek who likes the Greek

[02:27:59.710 --> 02:28:01.230]
That's your limperous governor Christ

[02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:04.950]
Not that it makes a difference except the fact he's a Republican

[02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:06.930]
And a hypocrite in a liar but other than that

[02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:11.110]
And also covered up from his folly by the way

[02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:12.090]
Birds of a feather

[02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.990]
Pluck together

[02:28:16.490 --> 02:28:19.390]
These are good steady decent men who don't go around flipping people

[02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:21.210]
Offer screaming eff you with the top of their lungs

[02:28:21.210 --> 02:28:22.830]
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said

[02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:24.730]
I'm live Monday broadcast of Morning Joe

[02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:26.850]
Reminiscent of his slip in 2006

[02:28:26.850 --> 02:28:28.870]
When he called an introduction from Tucker Carlson

[02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:30.030]
Pretty effing awesome

[02:28:30.030 --> 02:28:33.070]
The reason that he says the F-Bomb on TV is because he's not a

[02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:35.550]
Broadcaster he says another washed up ex-politician

[02:28:36.190 --> 02:28:37.730]
Everybody's a broadcaster in America

[02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:39.550]
Everybody's on TV and radio

[02:28:40.470 --> 02:28:42.510]
By the way don't forget to big oh rock solid

[02:28:42.510 --> 02:28:43.390]
I'm sorry

[02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:46.230]
Monday's gap came about as Scarborough

[02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:47.750]
Praise President elect Obama's campaign

[02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:49.570]
Advocates while criticizing a contrary

[02:28:50.250 --> 02:28:52.090]
Heavy-handed approach by Rahm Emanuel

[02:28:52.090 --> 02:28:54.390]
Who's service chief of staff and the Obama Cabinet

[02:28:55.890 --> 02:28:58.330]
MSNBC as spokesman Jeremy Gaines told the AP

[02:28:58.330 --> 02:29:01.330]
Told came to the mutual decision to add a seven second delay to the

[02:29:01.330 --> 02:29:04.470]
Networks morning Joe no other shows will be similarly delayed

[02:29:04.470 --> 02:29:06.990]
That's because quiss Matthews and the

[02:29:06.990 --> 02:29:09.470]
Oldman and even pasty faced Rachel Maddo

[02:29:09.470 --> 02:29:10.670]
Don't swear on the air

[02:29:11.610 --> 02:29:14.550]
That Rachel Maddo she she just annoys the hell out of me

[02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:17.870]
Mm-hmm I tried watching a little bit last night

[02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:20.630]
I just can't watch her she just she just

[02:29:20.630 --> 02:29:23.370]
Goes out of her way to be pasty faced dikey

[02:29:23.370 --> 02:29:27.590]
I mean well what is what is the point of that I mean she's entitled to do that I just I just can't look at her

[02:29:28.590 --> 02:29:34.150]
Maybe she likes that look maybe other dikes like that look maybe that's what she's trying to attract maybe she's maybe that's the MSNBC

[02:29:35.310 --> 02:29:36.370]
Thing for her show

[02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:39.770]
Works for Ellen I guess

[02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:41.690]
Dikes

[02:29:43.650 --> 02:29:50.810]
But at least at least Ellen I think looks a little you know I mean she's butch but she don't look like some kind of a diesel truck driving bull bike

[02:29:51.310 --> 02:29:54.430]
Rachel won't even put on no lipstick or mascara or even like

[02:29:55.310 --> 02:29:57.230]
Finger and fingernail polish

[02:29:59.110 --> 02:30:02.510]
Why does she do that she looks she and it makes her look so damn gross

[02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:04.450]
She looks like an ugly guy

[02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.910]
Mm-hmm

[02:30:06.530 --> 02:30:11.130]
You know what I mean nothing Keith Olberman's a good looking guy or anything like that but at least he's got credibility

[02:30:11.130 --> 02:30:16.950]
She lacks credibility because all she's doing is ripping off his act and all his guests and she sits there looking like a

[02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:18.250]
A pasty faced dike

[02:30:18.930 --> 02:30:23.470]
Not that there's anything wrong with being a pasty faced dike I just don't think I want to see my my TV set

[02:30:23.970 --> 02:30:25.590]
With the same stupid ass guests

[02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:26.490]
Oh yeah

[02:30:27.010 --> 02:30:29.410]
I love Olberman but boy the same

[02:30:29.410 --> 02:30:37.910]
My god people like give us crap about we got no no new material and know this and that every single here's Howard Feynman again and last night

[02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:40.810]
It's funny because he did look like he swallowed a canary like I said yesterday

[02:30:40.810 --> 02:30:47.470]
He always has that smirk on his face like he just saw good evening Howard good evening key high Keith high Keith

[02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:49.910]
It's always the same

[02:30:52.330 --> 02:30:54.990]
He doesn't say anything none of them say anything

[02:30:56.730 --> 02:31:03.490]
Oh Brandon says tell those goofballs to stop messing around with the internet stream because in the middle of the last bit they cut you off to run a spot

[02:31:03.490 --> 02:31:09.510]
You're back on the year but I think fact Chris has got something to do with it because I want to remove him from his post via the firing squad

[02:31:09.970 --> 02:31:12.410]
Brandon's got your ass and line tell me get a life

[02:31:15.210 --> 02:31:20.850]
There's screwin with the streaming well, you know they're screwin with whatever they can I wouldn't be surprised pretty soon if it's on the air

[02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:26.650]
If jolly joseph in somebody in a control room to start pochking around with the pots pochky with the pots

[02:31:28.890 --> 02:31:39.030]
Would it surprise you not in the least now just like that bit says she'll joys and Joe will do any and of course they're accomplice their partner in crime clearance

[02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:45.190]
Do anything to destroy the show and by the way magnificent job wait till that trend comes out next Wednesday right in the cramp

[02:31:46.470 --> 02:31:50.450]
Still a highest numbers on the station though when I have a feeling they still will be I could be wrong

[02:31:51.350 --> 02:31:56.010]
Maybe jolly gets some more wired 2534 man diaries in the morning and beat us I doubted them

[02:31:57.830 --> 02:32:03.550]
270 votes on fat Chris's pole shaving my face 99 what a waste of time

[02:32:06.190 --> 02:32:08.190]

Well, we want to hear the quarter-slot guy and of course the obvious question for anybody with an IQ more than one

Do you find it very quiet in your house now do you miss your pets my dogs died like years ago?

[02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:22.870]
Right do you miss that or do you like not having a pet now if I could have a dog in this building? I'd have one but I can't have one

[02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:26.990]
So yeah, you would you miss them so much that

[02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:28.390]
Well, let me see

[02:35:30.250 --> 02:35:36.510]
Like I'm coming home every day and it's like yeah, it's just things you're quiet now, right? That's right. There's a sense of yeah

Like I was just missing you'd quiet. There's you know, right? That's right. I didn't know if you you know

[02:36:00.570 --> 02:36:04.970]
I can't get one here. I can't have pets in this building other than Mexicans

[02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:07.830]

[02:36:15.470 --> 02:36:17.350]

Heard you got a Mexican hairless. Yeah, that's true

[02:36:22.810 --> 02:36:25.250]
I don't know how Brandon or any other of your email friends

I don't know them but I have to give a crisp credit for shooting them the finger and telling me good life

[02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:35.330]
Nothing pisses me off more than these professional radio critics says whoever. Oh, this is this go

[02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:41.550]
These are the same people who say Georgia shows sucks and you're mailing it in they just pretend to side with you

[02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:47.710]
So you can read their stupid emails on here. It's the 15 seconds of fame. You don't have to read this on here

[02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:52.650]
Let Chris know I said good job with again good life to a what's his face. Thank you Cisco

Fuck it in and hold it first

[02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:31.110]
Let me be clear. I am gay. I have been gay

[02:37:32.130 --> 02:37:34.510]
Furthermore, I love sex

[02:37:35.550 --> 02:37:43.250]
Because of that I will seek inappropriate conduct at the Minneapolis airport or anywhere else

[02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:50.270]
Again, I am gay and I should have told my family and my friends about it

[02:37:50.270 --> 02:37:51.430]
I

[02:37:51.430 --> 02:37:53.230]
Should not have kept my wife

One of the teachers aid said that Obama was gonna be shot and killed

[02:39:49.770 --> 02:39:57.130]
Mara Gilligan told KDK a news and that our flag is gonna be the KFC Kentucky fried chicken flag and the new national anthem will be

Yep, moving on up to the east side I like that song the new flag is gonna be the KFC flag. I didn't know KFC had a flag

[02:40:23.970 --> 02:40:27.250]

Gilligan who is white said that her biracial daughter took the comments personally being biracial

[02:40:45.770 --> 02:40:49.610]
She was overjoyed that someone of color was elected and was happy and excited to come to school

[02:40:49.610 --> 02:40:54.890]
And for this teacher to yell these things that her and her fellow classmates was just un-unbelievable

[02:40:54.890 --> 02:41:00.690]
Believable a teacher with the AWBD career center over her the comments filed a complaint with a principal and Gilligan

[02:41:00.690 --> 02:41:05.290]
Ascends received an email from the administrative director saying the aid would be suspended and disciplined

[02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:08.790]
However, the school would not comment to KDK a on the story

[02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:13.690]
You don't have to yell at other people especially our youths who are excited about the election Gilligan concluded

[02:41:13.690 --> 02:41:20.070]
I mean anybody should want that to happen especially a teacher and for you to destroy that joy that they have because of an election is terrible

[02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:22.410]

[02:42:00.430 --> 02:42:00.990]
Boy

[02:42:04.270 --> 02:42:06.830]
Scary now here's that story about some mom

[02:42:07.450 --> 02:42:11.050]
At this year vast wealth of a religious knowledge

[02:42:12.050 --> 02:42:18.490]
Right this this week the US Supreme Court will hear the case of a federally recognized church called a cult by opponents

[02:42:18.490 --> 02:42:24.170]
Whose followers have come under fire for the desire to have their seven aphorisms put alongside the ten commandments in public places

[02:42:25.210 --> 02:42:27.890]
Some mom SUMMUM some mom

[02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:33.730]
Was founded in 1975 by SUMMUM Bonum Amon Ra or Korki Ra

[02:42:33.730 --> 02:42:40.950]
Nate Claude Korki Norwell after an encounter with summer individuals said to have introduced him to concepts regarding the nature of creation

[02:42:40.950 --> 02:42:44.950]
Which are said to be reintroduced to humanity throughout time by advanced beings

[02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:53.730]
Some of them teaching combined Nostocrystianity with new age philosophy and mummification rituals with no particular recognized deity aside from p.

[02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:57.730]
Perhaps the collective mind of the universe the collective mind of the universe

[02:42:58.610 --> 02:42:59.090]
Wow

[02:42:59.090 --> 02:43:07.930]
All of these things some mom is also Utah's first federally bonded winery due to authorities insistence that the organization's spiritualist

[02:43:07.930 --> 02:43:14.510]
Nectars which are produced as a meditative meditative aid qualify as wine boy Jimmy Cifalus was in a wrong business

[02:43:14.510 --> 02:43:17.130]
You know you should go out there and hang out with some moms

[02:43:19.410 --> 02:43:21.830]
What I mentioned Jimmy's hang out with some moms

[02:43:22.490 --> 02:43:24.250]
Hey Jimmy you fairy

[02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:29.670]
The supreme court and hearing pleasant growth city versus SUMMUM will address whether or not the municipality of pleasant

[02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:35.530]
Grove Utah's required to allow some mom and seven aphorism statue to be placed alongside a privately donated ten commandments

[02:43:35.530 --> 02:43:39.090]
Monument the city's pioneer park as SUMMUM requested in 2003

[02:43:40.090 --> 02:43:46.150]
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of SUMMUM in April 2007 saying that SUMMUM was denied its right to free speech

[02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:47.630]
And has been subjected to discrimination

[02:43:48.470 --> 02:43:52.570]
Several Utah municipalities removed their ten commandments monuments entirely in response

[02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:58.490]
Liberty council attorney Matt Staver told one news now that SUMMUM was a cult

[02:43:59.070 --> 02:44:01.610]
That has some kind of Egyptian religion associated with it

[02:44:01.610 --> 02:44:05.850]
Staver contended that al-Qaeda would be allowed to direct the companion monument to the donated

[02:44:05.850 --> 02:44:09.870]
911 memorial or a statue of tyranny to stand alongside the statue of liberty

[02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:13.130]
It would require for example if someone donates the Vietnam Memorial

[02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:20.070]
Which in fact has been made by private funds that someone else could come and donate something that is contrary to the theme of the Vietnam Memorial of Washington DC

[02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:25.510]
The seven aphorisms for SUMMUM's teachings are in companion to the 10 commandments

[02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:31.490]
According to SUMMUM Moses first ascended Mount Sinai with a new higher law the seven aphorisms

[02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:35.390]
But they were ultimately only shared with those advanced enough to understand them like Joe Bell

[02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:38.670]
The 10 commandments were Moses seconds at the stone tablets

[02:44:38.670 --> 02:44:44.510]
According to the teachings the lower law that was easier for common people to understand or arguments are underway today

[02:44:45.110 --> 02:44:46.750]
Ain't the arguments start next week

[02:44:47.390 --> 02:44:49.070]
Those are the ones that Chris wants to see

[02:44:49.890 --> 02:44:52.650]
Huh, I wonder if you enjoy have any anal arguments

[02:44:55.250 --> 02:44:57.470]
No, they have they have them in the orifice

[02:44:58.790 --> 02:45:02.210]
So what I'm hearing probably another spy report from DA tomorrow

[02:45:03.130 --> 02:45:05.550]
It's getting a little bit out of control without a hand

[02:45:06.750 --> 02:45:11.130]
Brandon says isn't what this goes in that last email hypocritical because

[02:45:12.610 --> 02:45:15.690]
He emailed you to complain about people who complain about things on the show

[02:45:15.690 --> 02:45:20.510]
I really don't have a beef with anybody on or about the show other than quarters and fact Chris

[02:45:20.970 --> 02:45:25.930]
And fact Chris is just recently George is good people and by the way sounds very perky in the spot

[02:45:25.930 --> 02:45:28.610]
I heard on the stream. Well, that's because it's about naked broads sure

[02:45:29.310 --> 02:45:31.590]
They they've paid me for extra perqueyness

[02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:36.090]
And he's getting paid for it right he can get real perky for your painful. That's right

[02:45:37.290 --> 02:45:39.890]

Of ace venture repetitive. Yeah, I've seen it. It's a gross and I don't want to see it again

[02:45:47.270 --> 02:45:53.690]
Mike says can you play a marked fully bit before the end of the show please do we have miss oh yeah? What's that one call

[02:45:54.510 --> 02:45:56.890]
Which one do we have a couple fully?

[02:45:57.530 --> 02:45:58.090]
Wait a minute

[02:46:00.270 --> 02:46:02.670]

[02:46:05.970 --> 02:46:11.670]

And I got some really great articles here but they're way too long and I don't want to read no more.

[02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:48.970]
Oh, a computer ad campaign spoiled by a song from Odin, sex offender Gary Glitter.

[02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:54.510]
I'll say these for tomorrow. What was the other thing I was saving for tomorrow?

[02:48:54.930 --> 02:48:59.130]
I don't know. Oh, the new bits. Yeah, no items in this view.

[02:49:01.350 --> 02:49:05.990]
Even though the fake Greg Vue down never got back to us, we got 1301 on the total on the pool today.

[02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:12.170]
All right, Tommy. How do you like that? Very happy. I'm looking at that phone. No, looks awfully

[02:49:13.310 --> 02:49:19.910]

[02:49:20.610 --> 02:49:23.930]
Here's their chance. WQA Am hello.

[02:49:23.930 --> 02:49:29.030]
We ask you something real. Yeah. What is the set you have against that road?

[02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:34.690]
What's wrong with his talent and also what's wrong with 40 show?

[02:49:35.090 --> 02:49:38.690]
Let me ask you. Footy got fired. Footy don't have a show anymore. Footy's off the air.

[02:49:38.770 --> 02:49:41.270]
We got five. Let me say it again. Footy's off the air.

[02:49:41.350 --> 02:49:44.990]
Oh my god. These people are older than a thuseless great grandpa.

[02:49:45.430 --> 02:49:49.670]
Wow. What's wrong with footies? They show what we're sitting. Sid Rosenberg.

[02:49:51.570 --> 02:49:53.910]
Oh my god. Sid Rosenberg sucks.

[02:49:56.250 --> 02:50:01.750]
I got the greatest guest from from an MBA. I got this. I got that. Yeah. You got squatting.

[02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:05.330]
You got no numbers either. WQA Am hello.

[02:50:05.770 --> 02:50:08.670]
I'd rather listen to sunny Rosenberg. Yes, sir.

[02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:13.510]
Questions? Joe Bell who caught you, Chris.

[02:50:14.550 --> 02:50:20.910]
What? I don't have any idea what word he was trying to say.

[02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:24.570]
No idea. I don't think it anyway. Just to be extra safe.

[02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:29.010]
302 on your pole today. So you may be Tuve and I'm not just in doing a lot of

[02:50:29.010 --> 02:50:32.690]
nasty things with Joe Bell, but nevertheless you're still the polemeister.

[02:50:33.050 --> 02:50:36.670]
Yeah, that's me. WQA Am hello. Hey Neil, how you doing?

[02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:42.170]
Okay. I got a quick question for you. In regards to Obama being elected, I have no problem with it.

[02:50:42.170 --> 02:50:43.890]
I wish you're the best in the luck and all that.

[02:50:44.110 --> 02:50:47.090]
You know, being that obviously the majority of the United States want them to win anyway,

[02:50:47.090 --> 02:50:50.830]
but I got a question. How come somebody be considered you know, an African-American if they're mixed

[02:50:50.830 --> 02:50:54.430]
if they're either half white, half white? Let me ask you this question. What difference does that make?

[02:50:54.830 --> 02:51:00.150]
So I don't, I'm just saying. I don't. I don't. I don't. I mean, talk about coming up.

[02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:04.670]
We're really reaching to come up with something stupid. I mean, most of our people are stupid,

[02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:08.310]
you know, with with a minimum of effort into the criteria and the olden days,

[02:51:08.310 --> 02:51:12.690]
with the separate water fountains and all that stuff. Right. It was real simple. If they look black,

[02:51:12.770 --> 02:51:18.350]
they are a chat room would be nice on you, Neil Rogers.com. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

[02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:24.510]
Likely story. You should live so long, Andreys. Get a life. You are great, Neil, but I don't know what

[02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:30.150]
I would do without you. No chat room. We already been down that road. And what about Frank Sinatra?

[02:51:32.030 --> 02:51:34.470]
Beautiful voice. The pole from like six weeks ago. Yeah.

[02:51:34.470 --> 02:51:39.750]
Mm hmm. Well, he's still got some material there as opposed to what makes him African-American.

[02:51:39.910 --> 02:51:45.990]
If he's only half, uh, yeah, how about half African-American? I was that you jerk. God.

[02:51:47.470 --> 02:51:52.050]
And you know, interestingly, I don't there are black people here. I never heard in my life of a

[02:51:53.130 --> 02:52:00.110]
African-Canadian. No. No. I never heard of an African German. I saw lots of black people in Germany

[02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:07.570]
in Netherlands. I never heard of a African Dutch. Only an America as Jay Black would say.

[02:52:08.290 --> 02:52:13.290]
So what did you think of that picture of Tony Dow, pretty scary, huh? No, I don't know how old he is now.

[02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:20.630]
110, whatever. But if I get to be that agent, look, half that decent, uh, I'll be happy. Oh, yeah,

[02:52:20.670 --> 02:52:27.790]
but come on. Why do you look healthy? Yeah. I'm out of the live. Q.A.M. Hello. Yeah. Hello. I want to answer the dolphin.

[02:52:27.790 --> 02:52:30.150]
Give you a question. WQ. Y.M. Hello.

[02:52:31.130 --> 02:52:36.710]
Veal. Yes. I know you don't have anything to do with it, but love 94. Why did they decide to go to

[02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:42.090]
Christmas music in the middle of November 24 hours a day? They're playing Christmas music. Yeah.

[02:52:42.770 --> 02:52:47.610]
What marketing executive came up with that idea? They did it last year and maybe, maybe Joe Belk and salted.

[02:52:48.270 --> 02:52:53.070]
Oh, man. It's terrible. I mean, you know, it's bad. I don't think it has started at the end of summer. But, uh, you know,

[02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:59.710]
here it's mid November and let me let me say something to you. I mean, I'll honesty. Okay. This should be your worst problem.

[02:53:01.130 --> 02:53:07.810]
That's my advice. You think that's good sound advice? Yes. This should be your worst problem, sir.

[02:53:08.650 --> 02:53:13.910]
And I have another easy solution. Just for just like for the people I hate this show, don't listen.

[02:53:14.510 --> 02:53:18.110]
If they're playing Christmas music or something, you don't like don't listen.

[02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:22.450]
Can an iPod listen to some music that you actually like if there is any?

[02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:25.650]
It's more of the same. Where?

[02:53:31.170 --> 02:53:36.550]
God, I just I don't know how people cope with the negativity. I'm supposed to be Mr. Negative. I

[02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:42.030]
get that knock all the time. Oh, Neil is so negative. No, I'm not positive. I'm positive about that. I'm

[02:53:42.030 --> 02:53:48.630]
positively negative. I mean, I'm negatively positive. Look at that. No items in this view. Good. We clean. We

[02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:53.310]
are clean. The slight maybe Greg Vudelle is in those important high level meetings now. And maybe we'll be

[02:53:53.310 --> 02:54:02.830]
on serious someday soon. Oh boy. What's going to happen when they shut down serious XM? When their stock

[02:54:02.830 --> 02:54:10.070]
goes down to like penny stock? What's going to happen then? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, when you look at

[02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:16.270]
some of the great, they got the Lynn Samuels on there and they got Alice Bennett. They got there.

[02:54:16.470 --> 02:54:20.750]
And they tell might be on there. What I googled the Boudelle but all I can find is that station in Alabama

[02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:25.770]
with the banjo on his knee and that little puppy looking him. He had to have somebody kiss him. It sure

[02:54:25.770 --> 02:54:32.330]
wouldn't have been human. Greg Vudelle, boy, they hate you. And of course, they can actually could be

[02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:35.710]
the real one. You want to know why? Because he's obsessed with his show like so many other people

[02:54:35.710 --> 02:54:41.910]
have come through this market who have come and failed badly like Joey. Obsessed with his show.

[02:54:42.470 --> 02:54:48.250]
Am I right? Yep. Like Mo. Absolutely. Remember Mo used to listen like 24-7 when he was down here.

[02:54:48.470 --> 02:54:50.810]
He was home in Boka listening to the radio.

[02:55:07.530 --> 02:55:08.210]
WQ.

[02:55:13.770 --> 02:55:20.930]
Will we should stay away because we all had our day? We might forget the words so please be kind.

[02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:29.850]
Sure we're all done being in a little grumpy and we got too much free time. Take it safe.

[02:55:29.850 --> 02:55:39.950]
Take it safe. Take it safe. Don't want to start a new career because we're lazy.

[02:55:42.190 --> 02:55:47.850]
Catching it while we're still okay. We're raging rebels in New Haven.

[02:55:49.330 --> 02:55:54.390]
It's rockin' roll, start sound and land when you take it safe.

[02:55:59.850 --> 02:56:06.370]
And he says that cries are told in washes of payload but they made a pin that's all behind.

[02:56:07.850 --> 02:56:13.150]
Take it and we'll splether, get it back together. We'll wave past our pride.

[02:56:13.930 --> 02:56:23.850]
Take it safe. Take it safe. Don't let our conscience take it and cry to it.

[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:32.940]
Drive your crates. Come on play. Money's crazy.

[02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:42.540]
You know couple's billion more. It's gonna save me.

[02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:56.900]
Go over gone. We're gonna make it easy.

[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:06.420]
The biggest names of death pellets. Are you sure?

[02:57:06.420 --> 02:57:09.780]
And you're open for Miami Dolphins football.

[02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:14.920]
Ready, go five sixty WQAM.

[02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:18.040]
Miami on Saturday.
