[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:11.600]
5605, the Kenny Prisid, the new Roger Show, Detoxify, Dial 567-0560 and Dade and Rowan, in the Counties,

[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.460]
Coltville Free, 877-75 Neil, or Pound 560 on your AC&T and Horizon Wireless Fonds.

[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.700]
The appellants expressed by Neil, his guests, or his colleagues, do not represent those of WGLM

[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.340]
No, no.!!!!!!!! No, no! NO, NO!!

[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.080]
No, no!

[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.780]
..on 560, WQAM!!!

[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.840]
We've aligned the second world....

[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.060]
It's Friday, you b ¡squish me!

[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.600]
One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction...

[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.080]
...and while others find it funny,

[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.520]
For those who have it, it's no laughing matter.

[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.660]
It's called frequent burping syndrome.

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.740]
It's terrible.

[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.040]
I'll be on a date or a business meeting and...

[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.760]
and...

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.820]
Excuse me.

[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.360]
See? See what happens?

[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.240]
Frequent burping syndrome.

[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.000]
It can ruin your life.

[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.740]
But it doesn't have to.

[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.940]
Now there's a clinic that can help.

[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.400]
Trained specialists, sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers.

[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.020]
A special place known as...

[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.900]
Burp Inders.

[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.420]
Gosh.

[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.580]
Burp Inders saved my life.

[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.940]
Go in and I were in love.

[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.040]
I really wanted to ask her to marry me.

[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.880]
But...

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.020]
I just knew that when the moment of truth came,

[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.500]
I'd let out with a big ripper.

[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.020]
You know...

[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.180]
Burp Inders.

[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.940]
No shame, no guilt.

[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.820]
No more tummy rumbling smelly belches.

[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.340]
No more stopping in mid-sentence

[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520]
to uncoork a big cheesy blaster.

[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.840]
Burp.

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.640]
Carrying professionals.

[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.160]
And to help you need.

[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.140]
Don't wait.

[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.780]
Here's the number to call.

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.260]
555-2877-5555

[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.340]
Burp Inders.

[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.800]
Call today and stop being so gross.

[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.780]
10.0.560-7Q.A.

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.700]
Well, there may be some people who are out of the loop

[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.320]
and don't understand why I'm so excited today.

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.000]
I wait nine months every year for this magical moment.

[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.340]
This marriage, it's a moment.

[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.680]
Janie Merkins, I bet you got it.

[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.760]
This man you got him?

[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.260]
You do?

[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.320]
No you don't.

[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.820]
Sure I do.

[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.120]
I doubt it.

[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.920]
What was that while we were looking for the other day

[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.860]
and you never found it?

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.220]
I found it eventually, but now I can't remember what it was.

[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.700]
Patients and prudence, it's not you belong to.

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.840]
That's right. No, I never did do it.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.200]
Find that.

[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.340]
No, not hard.

[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.940]
That's right.

[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.600]
That's right.

[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.700]
It looks like I'm at United Artists.

[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.900]
But it was a pink label, the radio record.

[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.940]
This magic moment.

[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.720]
I'm not sure how to do it.

[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.900]
You don't see a lot of it.

[00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.340]
You have the one.

[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.720]
You're going to be great.

[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.380]
I'll set you up.

[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.820]
I'm going to put on a great breast.

[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.100]
Yeah, you people don't know your breasts.

[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.380]
I'm going to still like you.

[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.060]
OK, that's enough.

[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.520]
Yeah, his voice could melt you like butter, man.

[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.980]
I'll tell you, if you're an old queen like me,

[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.280]
or even a young queen, or probably some chicken,

[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.960]
some nasty looking, well, anyway, he was good.

[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.600]
Jamie Africans, but all things must pass.

[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.540]
You know, yep, happen when I had that gallbladder out.

[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.440]
All things must pass.

[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.740]
They didn't even kill me with that thing.

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.680]
So anyway, today is the last Friday.

[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.460]
I'm working until middle of September,

[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.880]
because starting on Monday, starting next week,

[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.880]
the summer schedule starts and George is all puffed up

[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.940]
about that like a, like a parrot.

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.400]
OK, it's all puffed up.

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.360]
OK, I guess they do.

[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.240]
Yeah, and then they start shaking a little bit

[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.880]
and then they fall off the porch and they die.

[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.960]
But anyway, George is all hooked up about Monday, Wednesday,

[00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.420]
and Friday.

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.580]
That guy that called the other day,

[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.240]
what I'm, I say what I'm more on.

[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.900]
Well, which one?

[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.660]
Most of them.

[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.560]
You leaving the show, Neil?

[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.500]
Oh, here's a good call coming to start us today.

[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.800]
Hello.

[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.360]
Yeah, how's it going?

[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.160]
All right.

[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.520]
Yeah, I have a spot on the port for you.

[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.440]
That's right.

[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.120]
I saw a zombie on a cable.

[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.860]
Let's do it on.

[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.140]
Ow!

[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.080]
Great.

[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.960]
Boy, you talk about having no life.

[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.540]
I have no life.

[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.760]
So, Gildi, the Cuban restaurant.

[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.260]
Who cares?

[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.600]
Get a life, Schmuck.

[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.140]
Anyway, the guy that called, oh, are you leaving the show?

[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.800]
Remember that call?

[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.440]
Yeah.

[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.540]
Am I leaving the show?

[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.160]
Yeah, I'm leaving the show on Monday, Wednesday,

[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.060]
and Friday for the summertime.

[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.600]
That was one of the great things.

[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.040]
See, one thing about Greg Reed, he treated people like humans.

[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.360]
He gave you all these opportunities to like survive,

[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.060]
because it's a tough business.

[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.180]
It's a pressure business.

[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.800]
And, you know, like that.

[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.120]
Oh, you just sit there and flap your gums four hours a day

[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.900]
and make all that money.

[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.720]
Yeah, you try it.

[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.260]
You try talking to morons four hours a day,

[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.500]
especially working for these penny-pinching bastards.

[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.800]
Oh, no.

[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.800]
We're like, gonna really promote the hell.

[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.580]
Yeah, sure you are.

[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.760]
Full of crap.

[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200]
So anyway, it starts next week.

[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.880]
And like I said, when it gets to September

[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.740]
and the summer schedule ends,

[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.960]
then I got away the whole nine months

[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.160]
for it to start all over again.

[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.980]
That's the only bad part of it.

[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.140]
If you have any idea how fast that summer schedule goes by,

[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.020]
not fast enough.

[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.560]
Like, just like that.

[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.720]
What do you mean that fast enough for you,

[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.340]
probably, right?

[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.620]
You understand?

[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.620]
Well, that's not good.

[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.940]
Why?

[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.680]
Look at all these, of course.

[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.440]
Look at all these, of course you can't make

[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.480]
some of your kind of things.

[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.920]
If, again, they treated you right, but they don't.

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.780]
If, if, if chickens peed, man, we'd have a flood,

[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.220]
worse than the ones in the Midwest.

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.240]
So we're gonna take a billion calls today.

[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.000]
This is, you talk about mailing it in.

[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.780]
I'm not, I'm not even putting a stamp on it today.

[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.720]
Oh, there's my phone.

[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.280]
I'll be back.

[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.060]
Oh, jeez.

[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.100]
So, but that is slacker.

[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.760]
Just runs off the drop of the phone.

[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.980]
I know.

[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.660]
And he was criticizing Hank that one time

[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.940]
for taking a call from his bookie.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.600]
Tell you what, taking a call from a bookie

[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.400]
is way more important than whatever he's answered for.

[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.640]
Probably gonna be another telemarketer or something like that.

[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.720]
Or is the liver is ready?

[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.320]
Right.

[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.800]
Either you got rental people.

[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.160]
We should just let there be dead air.

[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.380]
That is a stir.

[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.880]
What?

[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.360]
That was an automated recording

[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.160]
from the sales manager of the place where I bought the,

[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.840]
the Pontiac dealer, where I bought the,

[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.780]
whatever that thing is.

[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.380]
Solstice, solstice.

[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.480]
You haven't even know what is him.

[00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.160]
Where I'm not connected with that thing anymore.

[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.600]
Thank God.

[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.800]
But we haven't seen you since you buy, yeah.

[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.320]
Well, you know what?

[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.100]
You ain't gonna see me.

[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.220]
Let's play the Beatles and you won't see me.

[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.460]
Can you believe that?

[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.480]
Yeah, they treat me.

[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.300]
I told you that deal.

[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.000]
That was the worst transaction I've ever done in my life.

[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.040]
Treating me like I was some kind of a criminal.

[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.100]
And I paid cash for the damn thing.

[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.860]
They should only croak over there at that pot.

[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.820]
I should put the name of the dealer on the ear.

[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.100]
Not a good idea though.

[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.580]
So what was I saying before the phone rang?

[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.600]
You're gonna get an answering machine.

[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.200]
Yeah, what?

[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.900]
That you were gonna get an answering machine.

[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.160]
I have a voicemail thing on it.

[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.520]
So that you were gonna get your priorities straight

[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.080]
and you were gonna stop slacking in the middle of the show?

[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.840]
No, it could be something important.

[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.440]
Yeah.

[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.440]
Important to miss.

[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.900]
Right.

[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.040]
You kidding me?

[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.920]
This is important.

[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.680]
If this were important, they put a little bit effort into it

[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.800]
but they sure as hell don't.

[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.580]
That's a good point.

[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.300]
Yeah, you ought to tell Joe Bell that you're

[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.580]
to spit in his face next time.

[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.540]
It seems to you guess what?

[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.620]
By the way, we didn't understand.

[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.520]
You're not putting any effort.

[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.080]
You won't even lift a finger for us.

[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.660]
You fat turd.

[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.700]
That's what you ought to say to him.

[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.040]
WQI am, hello.

[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.360]
Hey, New Yorker, wonderful to call.

[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:31.760]
Terror read.

[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.160]
Terror read.

[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.760]
I want to say something about vote.

[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.480]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.280]
George, thank you.

[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.300]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.900]
Bad boobies.

[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.820]
They put your her boobs.

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.100]
That was a boob job gone.

[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.280]
Oh, horribly wrong.

[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.300]
That's so sad.

[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.200]
Oh, well, it's good to have your boobies.

[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.080]
Which talent was child of privileged capitalized

[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.240]
best than his or her family's name and fame and fortune?

[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.180]
That was yesterday's pool.

[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.600]
We had a thousand 38 votes.

[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.680]
So I felt like, hey, let's go ahead and change it already

[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.440]
and put the booby pool on there.

[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.600]
The booby trap.

[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.840]
Is that place still open?

[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.380]
The booby trap?

[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.700]
No.

[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.460]
I think so.

[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.000]
I believe so.

[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:04.680]
It is?

[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.080]
Yeah.

[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.480]
The booby trap, possibly a different incarnation

[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.920]
from the one that you're talking about.

[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.800]
What was the one in Tampa, the dollhouse, where Randy wanted

[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.680]
to go and les it up?

[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.240]
Remember that?

[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:15.720]
Mm-hmm.

[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.020]
That was very sad.

[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.580]
Why?

[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.580]
Because it just, I don't know.

[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.900]
She just, lesbians aren't sad necessarily.

[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.200]
Well, now you call Randy a lesbian?

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:26.900]
No.

[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.080]
Look, that's what you did.

[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.440]
I did not.

[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.400]
You just sure did?

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:31.260]
I did not.

[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.680]
I said you wanted to go les it up.

[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.700]
That doesn't make her a lesbian.

[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.520]
And I just had to stay a lesbians aren't sad.

[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.220]
She was a hero.

[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.840]
With Jim's multi-colored unit.

[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.100]
Right.

[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.580]
That may or may not have anything to do with Randy.

[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.740]
Which talent does child-approved capitalized best

[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.260]

[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.040]
George W.

[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.900]
Formed to eat for.

[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.660]
By the way, Ron Paul is officially done.

[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.400]
He's not going to have his own convention.

[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.420]
What about Jackass?

[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.920]
Not as much of a Jackass as those internet clowns who've been,

[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.160]
oh, Ron Paul is the answer.

[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.280]
Remember that guy who called?

[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:57.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.480]
Oh, you afraid of Ron Paul?

[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.540]
Yeah, I'm afraid of him.

[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.860]
It's a very scary guy.

[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.860]
Like Luca Bratzie.

[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.420]

And an O'Lana.

[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.500]

[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.580]
Gianni, of course, Gianni.

[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.500]
What's she in the mood?

And Casey Affleck 1.

[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.980]
We didn't put the Joaquin Fenas on there.

[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.600]
I guess he's a better actor than his brother.

[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.880]
Or at least is a bad guy.

[00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.820]
W2YM, hello.

[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.340]
Yes.

[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.320]
What's so funny about burping anyway?

[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.700]
Ha ha ha.

[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.460]
Ha ha ha.

[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:08.900]
It's a joke.

[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.260]
You're a ghost.

[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:11.460]
You're a ghost.

[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.740]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.320]
He?

[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.700]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.500]
Oh, and that was that digital exam he was getting.

[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.860]
Back home.

[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.000]
He was being penetrated.

[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.980]
I think it was a digit.

[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.460]
Ever been a finger.

[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.760]

W2YM also celebrity has the ugliest breasts.

[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.240]
That's the new pool.

[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.880]
See, the only reason to burp enders is we can't play fart sound.

[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.500]
So at least we can expel gas to the mouth of not through the anus.

[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:41.840]
Great.

[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.720]
Oh, and by the way, I did not go get one of those black anus burgers from McDonald's.

[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.380]
I should have.

[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:47.980]
I.

[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.400]
But there was a line there.

[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.380]
Oh my god.

[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.980]
There was a line from here to Ishmael, Michigan.

[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.200]
And so instead I got me a sandwich.

[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.560]
Which female celebrity has got the ugliest breast?

[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.920]
Yoko Ono 30.

[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.640]
She won the first time we done this about 600 years ago and she appears on her way to another

[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:05.900]
win.

[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.580]
She is nasty in every respect.

[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.580]
Sad Reburnhart 17, Pamela Anderson 8.

[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.800]
Didn't they just get married again?

[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.820]
Her and that slime ball?

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.440]
I don't know.

[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.880]
I think so for the form.

[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.140]
There is the Loughlin Boyle 5 Deborah Messing 4 and Nicole Smith 4.

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.800]
I bet they know they're too good now.

[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.480]
So go any weaver 3.

[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.360]
Oh, come on.

[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.660]
That's terrible.

[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.280]
Holy Hawn 3, Barbara Strison 3, Bavs.

[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.300]
When you got bad breasts and cross eye, that's not a good combo.

[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.220]
Gwyneth Paltrow 3, Dolores O'Rearden 2, Rearden.

[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.720]
You said she's the lead singer of cranberry, yeah.

[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.480]
When will we see her boobs?

[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.540]
I don't know.

[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.240]
Somebody evidently did Adrian Barbotu for his faucet 2, Meg Ryan 2, Courtney Love 2, Glen

[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.940]

[00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:00.240]

[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.120]
And none yet for Mira Servino, Jerry Hallowell.

[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.360]
Why did she like vanish or something or what?

[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:10.980]
I hope so.

[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.320]
Who Mira Servino or Jerry Hallowell?

[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.080]
No, Jerry Hallowell.

[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.600]
She's on some TV show somewhere I think.

[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.280]
Sean Young, Irene Cara, Gina Davis, Susan Day, Jennifer Conley, Andrew Burmore.

[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.620]
Damn good things, Jennifer, don't have any here out of the first time.

[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.040]
That's right.

[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.880]
She had 11 the first time we didn't, people who just had bad eyesight.

[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:27.680]
Really bad.

[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.500]
Dancing wrong with her ass or her boobs.

[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.000]
She must have done something to those people.

[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.860]
No, maybe she didn't do something to those people.

[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.240]
Maybe that's what they're pioed about.

[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.360]
The biggest name.

[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.500]
The best tower.

[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.120]
You're the best.

[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.400]
You're the strongest.

[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:40.780]
Four to go.

[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.120]
Five to fifty QAM.

[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.980]
The fourth leader.

[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.060]
It's back to our Friday, you bastard.

[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.140]
Coming this summer to the John Davidson arena.

[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.080]
So I says did his baby, honey.

[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.140]
Andrew, nice clay.

[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.280]
What say we get married and adopt a foster child?

[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:00.820]
No.

[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.400]
It's not nice man who's back, telling it like it is.

[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.400]
Then these gay people ate it ain't my thing.

[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.460]
But then again, who am I the judge?

[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.120]
Andrew, nice clay.

[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.740]
Okay, I got a poem for you.

[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.780]
Little boy blue is nose.

[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.280]
Andrew, nice clay and the I love everybody tour.

[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.840]
With special guests Pat Boone and Debbie Gybson.

[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.560]
Sponsored by Wonder Bread.

[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.440]
Reserve your tickets now.

[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.280]
Hey, and one more thing.

[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.620]
Have a nice day.

[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.540]
1016 at 560 WQAM.

[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.600]
Happy Friday to June 13th.

[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.820]
It's Friday the 13th.

[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.000]
Oh, unlucky to work on this day.

[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.520]
Here's George.

[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.560]
Hey, how's it going?

[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.660]
Somebody got planned for this summer time on here.

[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.840]
Oh, you know, what did the guy say?

[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.260]
Lucy Lopez, vasectomy talk, drugs, adultery, street loading,

[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.560]
who roller skating, the role of your sign language.

[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.480]
Did I already mention adultery?

[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.240]
Yeah.

[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.820]
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and

[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:52.980]
and, and, and, and, and, and and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

[00:14:52.980 --> 00:15:00.640]
and, and, and, and, and, and, and, there,

[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.400]
of a sun convert your face.

[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.160]
These things, simple things.

[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.080]
Somebody cue in, hello?

[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.740]
There's patients improving.

[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.140]
On Liberty Records.

[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:22.840]
Cue in.

[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:23.740]
Yes.

[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.660]
From Leo, how's it going?

[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.300]
Great.

[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.580]
I had something I had been dying to tell you.

[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.580]
Candy Crowley and the Humper.

[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.400]
Is it possible they could be the same person?

[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.120]
No, it's a Barbara star on CNN is the Humper.

[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.280]
That's right.

[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.340]
Yeah.

[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.680]
Now, cut, cut.

[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.540]
Yeah.

[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.860]
Too bad, well, he didn't get it right.

[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.980]
And the answer is, and the board goes back,

[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.400]
constipation with two downs.

[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.460]
And Dennis James.

[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.520]
No, not Dennis James.

[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.360]
What was it?

[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.820]
Art Chains.

[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.460]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60,

[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.140]
and the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.080]
Somebody cue, hello?

[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:01.900]
Hello, Neil.

[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:02.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.040]
Back in the day, Jeff Jr. lived in New York.

[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.920]
He bailed the bar three times, and he ended up

[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.200]
in the Consumer Protection Unit of the District

[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.160]
Attorney's Office.

[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.340]
He ended up in the ocean.

[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.380]
Not very glamorous guy.

[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.620]
He was a great, great person, a really nice guy down there.

[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.180]
And I'm trying to figure out how he profited

[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.400]
from being the son of a famous person

[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.800]
when he had such a run of the mill job

[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.320]
and was a regular guy.

[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.840]
That's a pretty ridiculous assessment, don't you think?

[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.660]
No, it is not.

[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.040]
He had fame and fortune, man.

[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.200]
He had a lot of cash, and he had, it was famous.

[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.320]
He was a humble guy.

[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.460]

[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.060]
He was pretty cool.

[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.740]
I got to tell you.

[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.740]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.180]
He failed the bar three times.

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.500]
They put it on the front page in New York.

[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.360]
Who was his daddy?

[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.220]
Yeah, well, he was dead as famous, no doubt, though.

[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.400]
But then the poll should have just been,

[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.640]
who's a famous son of a famous guy?

[00:16:59.280 --> 00:16:59.540]
OK.

[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.460]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, see.

[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.320]
He misses the whole point.

[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.020]
And that is that if his name was like Joe Smith,

[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.580]
then nobody would have ever even heard him

[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.940]
reckless, whether he had fame, would have had all those advantages,

[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.840]
and probably he would be fortunate, whatever.

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.320]
That's right.

[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.740]
Well, that's good to know.

[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.080]
He's just a lot of good guys.

[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:15.280]

[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.660]
We just don't need to hear about them.

[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.380]
That's right.

[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.700]
A lot of those people might have been good people.

[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.600]
Well, here's a guy that wants to, he was a buddy of his.

[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.240]
He doesn't like the fact he's on the poll.

[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:23.860]
Well, you know what?

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.860]
It's kind of pointless.

[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.080]
He's not going to be upset about it.

[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:26.640]
He's still dead.

[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.960]
He shouldn't have been flying that plane.

[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.480]
That's all.

[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.880]
And that goes with that whole deal,

[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.560]
that whole Raymond Fortune deal,

[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.420]
and goes with the Kennedy curse as well.

[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.

[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.880]
And they've rise in singular wireless line.

[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.480]
Kind of a lackluster start here by the audience today,

[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.960]
probably because most people are on vacation.

[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.240]
Because I'm getting spy reports that it's 140 degrees

[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.400]
in the shade, and the mosquitoes is as big as bowling balls.

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.680]
Could be alive, you know, could be exaggerations.

[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.420]
I don't think so.

[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.720]
How many QA and hello?

[00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.340]
On the needle.

[00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.880]
Hey, I live up in Palm Beach.

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.040]
And you can keep asking.

[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.900]
I've heard you a few times.

[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.680]
One or two Donald Trump Jr.

[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.480]
That's his son.

[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.960]
He's a pretty good son.

[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.500]
I know what his son, but what does he do?

[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.660]
I mean, how much more so?

[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.360]
Oh, he's got an MBA and all that from work.

[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.280]
But he's a he's at works for that and this building and stuff.

[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.460]
But he's a pretty good looking guy, actually,

[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.520]
that's what his dad looks like.

[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.740]
But I want to say something funny.

[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.840]
You're always ragging on your sales department.

[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:35.000]
And Joe Rose does a spot about some company that sells,

[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.160]
you know, sell your business.

[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.260]
And it says before the real estate market,

[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.480]
the bottom fall is out of it to sell your company.

[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.420]
I mean, it's a polite two year old copy.

[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:45.640]
Pretty funny.

[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.360]
We have.

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:49.160]

[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.060]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.980]
Well, I knew something would be funny,

[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.080]
but it sure wasn't the first part covered all the bases.

[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.280]
Yeah, five six seven, oh five 60.

[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.660]
Come on, let's get these phones going.

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.820]
Man, it's my last Friday for the whole summertime.

[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.960]
I'm going on that limited schedule next week

[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.000]
to these people really care.

[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.800]
Oh, you know something?

[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.940]
You know, you pointed out that the people

[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.480]
who were at our appearance at Gulfstream.

[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.560]
Yeah, almost everybody took pictures.

[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.320]
And only two or three people sent you any.

[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.580]
And you weren't in a while.

[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:17.960]
You weren't in a while?

[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.080]
Because the other people, it's like the Myspace thing.

[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.880]
They don't listen.

[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.260]
They don't listen.

[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.860]
What were they there?

[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.700]
They're not fans.

[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.020]
Who knows why fans, how do they know how to be there

[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.700]
if they don't listen?

[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.920]
Well, who knows, the little birdie told them,

[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.620]
I have no idea.

[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.800]
They're just lazy.

[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.540]
They don't listen like the Myspace crowd.

[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.860]
Most of them don't listen.

[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.060]
I'm even getting shy this morning

[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.360]
by my most regular Myspace.

[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.080]
And that's okay, I can handle it.

[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.760]
I can deal with it, okay?

[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.860]
He's probably got important fish to fry on there.

[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.540]
Well, it is fish fry Friday.

[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.240]
That's right, all fish Friday.

[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.420]
And macaroni and cheese are fish today.

[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:56.940]
What are you saying?

[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:57.280]
Both.

[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:58.980]
WQAM, hello.

[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:02.100]
QAM.

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.700]
Hi, Neil.

[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.560]
I listen to that poll.

[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.740]
You don't have Mariah Scarry on there.

[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.520]
Yes, she's scary.

[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.340]
She's got that one boob in the middle of her chest.

[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.540]
Okay, I pull on her.

[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.560]
Get around there, you got her?

[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.020]
Adding it now.

[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:15.920]
I don't care.

[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.900]
I don't know if she is on it.

[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.900]
We got 6,000 names.

[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.520]
I like the polls.

[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520]
I've got 6,000 names.

[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.880]
Because then I can read them two or three times.

[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:21.440]
And we're done.

[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.580]
We're finished.

[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.740]
Numbers, that's all he does is numbers.

[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.600]
WQAM, hello.

[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:29.780]
Hey, Neil.

[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:30.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:31.380]
How you doing?

[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.540]
When are you coming back from vacation?

[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.360]
I'm not going on vacation.

[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.340]
Oh, you're not going on vacation.

[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.460]
Let me say it again.

[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.300]
The summer schedule starts next week.

[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.800]
I'll be here two days and Thursday.

[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.020]
Right.

[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.480]
All right, when you do go on vacation,

[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.680]
just be careful with your junk, all right?

[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:47.940]
No, yeah, okay.

[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.100]
Be careful with your junk.

[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.060]
Right, keep it in the trunk.

[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:50.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.720]
And don't show it to a skunk or a punk.

[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.660]
Well, five, six, seven, oh five, 60,

[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.540]
pound five, 60 on the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.580]
Be careful with your junk.

[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.720]
Oh, God, these people, it's just,

[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.180]
although it's very weak today,

[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.260]
I don't think we're going to make it through

[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.360]
with four hours of these calls.

[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.660]
I want to do the whole four hours with calls today.

[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.700]
What do you think of that?

[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.240]
Good luck.

[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.120]
Good luck.

[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.800]
What do you mean, good luck?

[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.180]
Well, the way they're going so far,

[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:18.760]
it's pretty awesome.

[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.040]
What an aim.

[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.860]
I'm in Grim, WDQYM, hello.

[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:21.740]
Hello, sir.

[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:22.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.580]
Joey Reynolds, Bob Lasseter,

[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.300]
uh, uh,

[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.840]
little caller, anything but George,

[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.320]
you put something on Bon, but you're...

[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.380]
Oh, this is Woody.

[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.280]
Yeah.

[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.660]
Anything but you already do it.

[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.160]
Well, they do it a bad imitation of the standard of your

[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.140]
career, a bad imitation of what he would hate you.

[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.480]
We want you to die.

[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.440]
Of course, he's what I want.

[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.320]
When I'm on two, stuff.

[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.300]
Is he really?

[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:45.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.480]
Oh, yeah, well, he never goes away.

[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.620]
You're another one of those people complains and belly-

[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.320]
It's up in my air every single day.

[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.460]
And he sucks your ass, too, huh?

[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.700]
Well, maybe that explains his mental condition.

[00:21:59.300 --> 00:21:59.660]
Tragic.

[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.040]
See, he's one of those people with a real distinctive voice.

[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.260]
Right, it stinks.

[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.320]
That's right.

[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.360]
And he stinks.

[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.400]
And one day I was leaving Paxen IOD and driving out.

[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.640]
And who's driving in?

[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.440]
And he rolls down his window.

[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.340]
Neil, it's Woody.

[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:14.840]
Stalker.

[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.320]
Crazy person at a stop.

[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.540]
Right.

[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.100]
And an A-hole and an idiot.

[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.220]
If he had a dog, the dog, I'm sure would attack him.

[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.440]
Somebody QA in, hello.

[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.800]
Good morning, sir.

[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:28.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.600]
One thing for that, let me give a little phrase for George.

[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.020]
I miss you, but he's really, if you're one, he's one A.

[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.100]
And I'm glad to hear him during the summer or any other.

[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.480]
He's mine.

[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:40.900]
And that one, yeah, he's one.

[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:41.480]
I'm a clarinet.

[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.640]
And I'm the other one.

[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.020]
But anyway, and that last guy, he should go home

[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.040]
and shave his mother's back.

[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.400]
But on the other hand, sir, on the other hand, sir,

[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.380]
you had that wonderful show of the other day.

[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.200]
You were talking about restaurants that were disbunked.

[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.240]
You were hypothesized about people

[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.480]
lying there, plastic, their purses.

[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:57.900]
Right.

[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:58.580]
OK.

[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.200]
Do you remember Sweden Health?

[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:00.980]
Sure.

[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.820]
My grandmother just be a waitress there on Saturday night.

[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.240]
They have the stone crabs or crabs,

[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:05.980]
all of them, never.

[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.720]
And they used to catch the off the cockers all the time.

[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.820]
It was going out with bags that had crab meat.

[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.340]
It was hilarious.

[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.680]
Sure, no question about it.

[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.680]
They put every restaurant in South Florida out of business.

[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.260]
Well, especially the buffets.

[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.100]
That's why all the ones that you have buffets now

[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.640]
are either everything's breaded or soybean laden.

[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.260]
So I find the way I smart.

[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.800]
All of the phase now ought to be poisoned.

[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.520]
That would solve a big problem in that town.

[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.680]
I have to tell you, Memorial Day Week.

[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.080]
And I finally paid a pilgrimage to Toronto.

[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.040]
It is everything you say and more.

[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.600]
I do the search into Niagara.

[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.360]
And I can see why you.

[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.620]
It's a great city.

[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.360]
It is a great city.

[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.520]
It's got a buzz like nothing I've ever experienced before.

[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.420]
I envy you, sir.

[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.520]
And I'm rightfully so.

[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.340]
Have a great life.

[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.060]
You too, sir.

[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.080]
See, he envies me.

[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.900]
Well, he ought to.

[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.780]
I lost a few bucks at Woodbine yesterday.

[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.160]
Finally, it's my first losing day in quite a while now.

[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.020]
Not that much, though.

[00:23:59.180 --> 00:23:59.700]
300 bucks.

[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.240]
Now, Chris would like that 300 bucks.

[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.180]
And to be pleased to know that Josh Cortes' check

[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.000]
is in the envelope.

[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.200]
They stamp his on it.

[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.980]
It's addressed and it'll be mailed today.

[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.640]
So if he comes bugging you, oh gee, I think of that check

[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.940]
and I can't spend it this weekend.

[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:13.380]
That's good.

[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.140]
Spend it next weekend, OK?

[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.480]
See what I'm saying?

[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.020]
Yeah.

[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.540]
The longer I postpone in mailing it out,

[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.200]
the longer before he just blows a grin.

[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.840]
Look at that name.

[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.960]
The text is out.

[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.260]
He wrote the new context.

[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.660]
Fortunately, you're 550 QAM.

[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.460]
The fourth leader.

[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:31.720]
It's Friday.

[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.100]
You bastard.

[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.520]
Every woman is looking for that fragrance

[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.200]
that he's our own unique scent.

[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:39.680]
Cool.

[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.400]
You're fun.

[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.500]
I know.

[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.800]
I am designer, shop-repeans.

[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.300]
And I have a new fragrance.

[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.380]
So overwhelming, it practically announces itself.

[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.040]
Cool.

[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:50.780]
You're fun.

[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:51.660]
Yes.

[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.940]
Cool of homage.

[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.480]
This silent, but deadly scent

[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.040]
that turns a crowded room into a quiet place for you.

[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.200]
And you alone.

[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:00.840]
Cool.

[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:01.640]
You're fun.

[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.800]
It surrounds you with your own smell.

[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.700]
It's plunged as opium as lethal as poison.

[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.080]
Cool of homage.

[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.100]
The aroma that says,

[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.020]
anywhere I call that much,

[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.520]
Cool of homage.

[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.060]
Just look for the bathroom,

[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.740]
sink like a finger and give it a pour.

[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.500]
Yes, she who smelled it,

[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.280]
dalted,

[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.940]
Cool of homage.

[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.500]
Is English hot, too?

[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.580]
For her,

[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.820]
Cool of homage.

[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.620]
And for the outdoor man,

[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.880]
Win Brecker.

[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.680]
Wear it and be alone.

[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.320]
No sound effects, though,

[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.460]
and they're, thank God for that.

[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.200]
I'm out of head.

[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.240]
What do you come out?

[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.220]
1032 at 560 WQM.

[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.960]
George sends me some voluptuous pictures

[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.020]
of Jennifer Conley's voluptuous breasts.

[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:49.560]
Right.

[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.540]
What's wrong with those?

[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.740]
Not a damn thing.

[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.720]
I'll say that right now.

[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.820]
I know a hot breast when I see one.

[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.600]
Like that one that Mariah Carey's got.

[00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.560]
But there's something bizarre about her.

[00:25:59.680 --> 00:25:59.940]
I don't know.

[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.200]
I'm sure Luis Miguel can find.

[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.980]
I think that's why you don't like her

[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.460]
to that whole,

[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.000]
Luis Miguel Association.

[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.260]
Oh, because you can't sing

[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:06.740]
for crap.

[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.760]
That's why I don't like right.

[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:08.700]
That I agree.

[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:09.760]
She can scream.

[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.720]
She's what?

[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.120]
She can screech.

[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.640]
She's like, I know what that is.

[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.020]
I happen to know that she has two breasts.

[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.080]
One just like the other one.

[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.260]
They sit right next to each other.

[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.120]
No, they don't.

[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.820]
She's got one big one in the middle of her chest.

[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:21.620]
All right.

[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.420]
Like right between were her two ought to be.

[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640]
Yoko O'Ono 48,

[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.940]
Sandra Bernhard 23,

[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.820]
the ugliest breasts.

[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.540]
Pamela Anderson 13,

[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.400]
Terrible Read 10,

[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.900]
everybody else single digits.

[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.700]
Mariah Carey's got three votes, by the way.

[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.640]
Yeah, and Jennifer Conley has no votes.

[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.680]
Well, maybe these people have come to their senses

[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.280]
since the first time we did this

[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.240]
when she got 11 votes.

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:47.940]
WQA M, hello.

[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.180]
QA M.

[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.440]
Oh, that's that phone that's under Joe Bell's ass.

[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.020]
WQA M, hello.

[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.120]
Listen to it here.

[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.740]
There's no school though.

[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.240]
Why don't you drive it less than 50?

[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.220]
There's no school here.

[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:08.580]
You idiot.

[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.340]
No, the square out in your car.

[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.560]
5670560,

[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.180]
pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.360]
Kids are out of school today already.

[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.280]
It depends on if you're in a brow or a date

[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.540]
and if you're in an F school and you know,

[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.380]
F school.

[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.880]
Most schools are out not all of them.

[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.280]
Oh, so next we're here.

[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.880]
Next week here, this kid's going to school.

[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.460]
I know that I think this is the last day.

[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.260]
Can't be told everybody.

[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.800]
My good close personal buddy Paul,

[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.660]
the candy, the lesbian, he's cab driver.

[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.800]
WQA M, hello.

[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.040]
You go and these canners.

[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.960]
Oh, we go away.

[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:43.880]
Oh, you're in in Caledon.

[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.380]
I think he's just got that recorded.

[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.460]
Just like a guy.

[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.060]
Way in hello.

[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.420]
Hey, Neil, how are we doing, pal?

[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.180]
Okay, sir.

[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.660]
Well, you're so glad you're not here.

[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.280]
It's raining like madhouse, man.

[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.320]
Oh, maybe that explains it.

[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.400]
Let's go to the second.

[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.720]
Oh, I think the summer schedule is my favorite part

[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.580]
of the year for you guys.

[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.860]
Yeah, yeah, I mean, the whole week of Georgia is too much.

[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.320]
No offense.

[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.160]
George, love you.

[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.100]
But way too much of three days is nice.

[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.880]
And then to you with the good setup to me.

[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.320]
I was ready to guys ratings do well in the summer with that.

[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:10.540]
That's that.

[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.120]
Okay.

[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.260]
I mean, lately are we don't have any ratings.

[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.560]
Yeah, that's normally please be you guys up.

[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:16.980]
That's right.

[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.220]
You only were number one in the summertime and the course.

[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.400]
Did we reward George with nothing?

[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.260]
Right.

[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.660]
We were charged by badmouthing around the building.

[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.360]
Okay.

[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.880]
Another thing was I wanted to tell Chris talk about 99 cents.

[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.240]
Try to open.

[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.440]
You can pull it in the front.

[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.040]
College you both.

[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.500]
You're all right for 99 cents.

[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:35.840]
I got.

[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.600]
Should be a real heavy duty weekend for Chris.

[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.340]
I'll tell you that.

[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 and Pant let's take a look at that schedule.

[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.560]
First, the jerk show to that is something.

[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.980]
I can't say the word on the air anymore.

[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.720]
Man dog 4 to 650.

[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.860]
Then the 10 minutes of that Marlon Pregame report.

[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.200]
Would just the aggregate fast bitch.

[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.640]
Dolphin to that with Kim.

[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.100]
A book camper.

[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.840]
Oh, I do have to get to a very jackass.

[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.180]
What did I do with his crap?

[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.500]
Here it is.

[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.080]
TV leagues Marlon's stranded on the road to Marlon's.

[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.860]
They got too many games that aren't being televised.

[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.840]
Nobody cares about that.

[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.260]
Dolphin that I would Kim a book camper at 7 which

[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.220]
Barry thinks is just swell and then Curtis for D.A.

[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.460]
12 the night because D.A.

[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.540]
was on for Joe this morning.

[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.720]
Got it following all these substitutions.

[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.800]
Well, the summertime now it's like whoever shows up.

[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.560]
Well stick them on there.

[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.700]
Anybody out there on Ives Dury Road near the ballpark.

[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.160]
Just drive out over to the station.

[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.960]
We'll put you on the air.

[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.600]
Let me do Q.A.

[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:28.960]
M. Hello.

[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:31.800]
Q.A.

[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.080]
Hello.

[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:33.340]
Hello.

[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.120]
Hello.

[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:34.360]

[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:34.440]

[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.200]
Yeah.

[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.260]
I heard someone.

[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.160]
Okay.

[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.680]
I was looking at the pictures when you were dying in Florida.

[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:41.620]
Yeah.

[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.560]
Hey, you get it pretty fast.

[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.320]
Yeah.

[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.020]
But it's a camera cell.

[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:46.940]
Mm hmm.

[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.540]
We don't want you to die.

[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:49.380]
Mm hmm.

[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.180]
Hello.

[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.220]
Hello.

[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.340]
Hello.

[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:54.520]
Hello.

[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:55.700]
Yeah.

[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.100]
Oh, well that pulling out of Joe Bell's ass is getting a lot of

[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.660]
we're getting good workout today isn't it?

[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.540]
Showed up.

[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.620]
Maybe sitting on a on the Raspberry patch.

[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.680]
Be a good place for them in the Breyer patch.

[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.900]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.820]
Yeah, a lot of people when it rains hard, they won't call

[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.820]
because they don't want to get fried.

[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.180]
You know, people really believe that they're going to get

[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.220]
electrocuted if there's like lightning or something like that.

[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:21.480]
Right.

[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:22.800]
Remind me.

[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.720]
And maybe they will WQ I am.

[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:24.960]
Hello.

[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:25.820]
Hello.

[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.440]
I'm the hour.

[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.380]
OK, sir.

[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.700]
I regret that I didn't get to see the grocery.

[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.100]
28 years old and a fan says a little kid.

[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.540]
And I love listening to you.

[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.100]
Mm hmm.

[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.140]
What that being said, I'm happy for you that you're happy that

[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.800]
this is the.

[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:38.940]
I'm not happy.

[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.720]
I'm ecstatic.

[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.760]
I'm delirious.

[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.660]
Well, don't don't get too excited.

[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.780]
I want you to wait for yourself for a poop to pee.

[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.420]
But I'm.

[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.500]
More importantly.

[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.940]
I want to ask you why does that other shows

[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.340]
whether it's AM or FM?

[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.740]
I've heard like the farst downs, etc.

[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.220]
But yet you can't play because it's because Joyce doesn't

[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.400]
turn around on the shows can do that's why.

[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.880]
Well, you know, she'd be taking up her.

[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.240]
Joyce.

[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.160]
Take care guys.

[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:03.440]
Love you.

[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:03.660]
OK.

[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.480]
I mean, it's not a not a complicated question for a simple.

[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:08.260]
Mm hmm.

[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.920]
Now we got a bitch over there in Naples who makes up up as

[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.500]
she goes along.

[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.940]
We got a general manager who's a real wimp and won't stand

[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.640]
up for the station or for the town or for the shows or for

[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.260]
the content or for anything, which is one of the main reasons

[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.380]
that the numbers are disappearing vanishing on this station.

[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.780]
But he's like in denial.

[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.240]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.800]
He's just a good time Charlie.

[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.440]
That's all I just look a cheerleader.

[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.440]
Good job for him to be a greeter.

[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.700]
One of those old restaurants where the 90 year olds come

[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.160]
in, you know, he could be like Larry Glick.

[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:39.380]
Right.

[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.200]
Or Walmart.

[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.720]
They have greeters.

[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.860]
Do they really know where they also have greeters?

[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:44.900]
Abacrombian bitch.

[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.780]
I don't know if I've ever told you this on the air,

[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.400]
but when last year when Paco got me running around all I,

[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.600]
oh, I don't know how I survived all of that.

[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.600]
All those fancy, schmancy with a loud music and eating center.

[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:58.500]
Mm-hmm.

[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.280]
And Abacrombian bitch they have usually guys very,

[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.040]
very hot young guys like 20-ish who are greeters and when you

[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.340]
come in the store, hey, how are you today?

[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:07.840]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.560]
You want to do this?

[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:08.860]
Yeah.

[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.340]
Wow.

[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.320]
There was one where was I almost fainted.

[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.360]
I almost passed out stone cold on the floor.

[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.280]
Because I seldom have seen anybody who looked like that.

[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.440]
All the plastic young people going there,

[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.480]
Abacrombian bitch or Hollister.

[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:25.940]
Hollister with it.

[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.220]
And the thing about it is,

[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:31.860]
in those stores the checkout is like almost impossible.

[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.140]
They lined up like 800 deep like they were given money away

[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.780]
for all the overpriced crap that they're selling.

[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:36.360]
Mm-hmm.

[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.240]
And the people that were working behind the counter

[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.360]
are the same as the customers.

[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.700]
They were a bunch of young punks.

[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.420]
They couldn't give a crap all this about anything

[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.400]
and they're laughing and yuking it up and having a grab ass.

[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.080]
They don't care.

[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:47.520]
Right?

[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.540]
It's kind of like us here at QAM.

[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.400]
We just don't care.

[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.140]
What do you think of this?

[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.620]
Yeah, the best out here is you know what?

[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.100]
It's 4.50 QAM.

[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.940]
And the fourth leader.

[00:32:59.460 --> 00:32:59.980]
It's calling.

[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:01.860]
All right, class.

[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:02.680]
OK, OK.

[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:03.460]
Clear engine.

[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.660]
Children, please to be getting away from that slurvy machine.

[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.660]
Please to be getting away from that slurvy machine.

[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.840]
Very good, very good.

[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.660]
Now let us try.

[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.360]
These students are beginning an exciting new career

[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.320]
in the high-risk low-paying world

[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.740]
of convenience store management.

[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.040]
And you can too.

[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.340]
Here at CSMI, the convenience store management institute

[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.120]
will teach you English as a seventh language.

[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.760]
Will you be acting master with your low-hat?

[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.360]
What is it?

[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.480]
What to say during a hold-up?

[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.700]
I'm acting with you all of my money.

[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.020]
Please do not keep blowing me away.

[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.120]
How to remove a bullet using only a peasant dispenser?

[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.360]
I think I'm going to be thinking.

[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.360]
It all adds up to a stimulating new career.

[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.520]
Just ask recent CSMI graduate, Swift Gangemon.

[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.100]
Uh, Swift?

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.800]
Can I hate you learn?

[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:56.960]
Never mind.

[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.720]
To find out more, write to CSMI,

[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.180]
PO Box 7-11, ComboLinFarmS Montana.

[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.540]
Remember, if you're looking for a livelihood,

[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.300]
there will be plenty of livelihoods looking for you.

[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.620]
After you graduate from the convenience store management institute.

[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.720]
Okay, it's the 1045.

[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.880]
I think I ever played that.

[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.060]
Did you?

[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:16.580]
Nope.

[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:17.360]
No.

[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.740]
I won't ever again, either.

[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:26.240]
WDQA M Bruce Ross Myers-Harley Davidson and Dayland Dodge

[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.840]
presents 105 days of Harley.

[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.420]
You could be one of 56 winners of a 2008 Harley Davidson motorcycle

[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.880]
and a free two-year lease on a 2008 Dodge Ram.

[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.260]
To register, be one of the 56 finalists

[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.240]
to go to any Bruce Ross Myers or South Day Dodge showroom.

[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.860]
Hooter's location are logged on to WDQM.com.

[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.180]
It's on the right hand side, scroll down, you'll be finding it.

[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.200]
It's 105 days of Harley from the state and putting some excitement

[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.240]
between your legs, 560 WQ.

[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.500]
WACOM AM.

[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.180]
What's up with that Kaplan writes very jackass.

[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.920]
After he laments the fact that the Marlins are stranding the fans

[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.820]
with some of their games on the road not being televised.

[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.140]
Well, that's Waco, is their chief.

[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.420]
Drop by WDQM in October, Eddie Kaplan City would consider local

[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.540]
offers to do a talk show but is happy playing tennis,

[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.280]
betting on horses and traveling.

[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.320]
At a boy, Eddie.

[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.440]
I'm enjoying my retirement, he said.

[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.640]
Hey, Eddie, we're tired.

[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.300]
There's a reasonable chance I may not be broadcasting again.

[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.180]
I don't really miss it.

[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:20.960]
At a boy.

[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.460]
I haven't had to deal with an nonsense surrounding the NFL

[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.980]
draft on the Jason Taylor saga.

[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.540]
I'm shocked after being a sports fanatic that I don't watch

[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.860]
nearly as many games I used to.

[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.480]
Good, see his life is getting better.

[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.620]
He's finding a life.

[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.120]
Kaplan said he's received three or four unsolicited inquiries

[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.360]
from stations out of town, but it doesn't want to leave South

[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:37.640]
Florida.

[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.320]
And then Barry Jackass asks, what is the early view on WDQM's

[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.260]
revamped off-and-show?

[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.380]
The very encouraging he says, oh yeah, WDQM made the right move

[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.560]
never away by cutting it to an hour.

[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.400]
You know what this reminds me of?

[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.040]
It's like rush, shelling for Hillary.

[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.660]
You know what I mean?

[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:54.260]
Yep.

[00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.200]
QM made the right move never away by cutting it to an hour,

[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.160]
but also selecting Kimba Bo Camp or his host.

[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.740]
Bo Camp or has a keen eye for evaluating players.

[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.020]
Last summer when others were predicting seventh round

[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.240]
or Abraham Wright would become a standout,

[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.280]
Bo Camp or said he wouldn't amount to anything here,

[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.480]
Wright was cut last month.

[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.340]
The guest list is improved with Coach Tony O'Soprano

[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.600]
and General Manager Jeff Ireland,

[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.960]
agreeing to weekly segments through at least June.

[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.840]
And finally, last but not least, some more craft,

[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.500]
but the most important, which does Miami-Fore Lauderdale have

[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:22.860]
more of?

[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.440]
Sports talk stations or major pro teams, well guess what?

[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.680]
Beginning Monday the answer will be the former.

[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.320]
Just what we need is another all-sports station

[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.880]
and we'll have one in Esponule W-O-C-N-1450-A

[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.700]
and we'll become the market's fifth sports station,

[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.440]
but unlike the others this one broadcast in Esponule

[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.880]
as the 26 ESPN Deportes Affiliate Nationwide.

[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.680]
Well, not exciting?

[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:45.760]
No.

[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.000]
As Ray Perry would say, if we just had 50,000 sports talk stations

[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.260]
in town it would bring a lot more people to sports talk.

[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.000]
No, it won't.

[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.500]
But that's what Ray Perry says.

[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.660]
And that's because Ray is a silly person,

[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.600]
not a bad guy, but just a silly person,

[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.980]
with a silly suit and silly glasses.

[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.340]
5670560.560 and I wonder if Lion one is working at all?

[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.640]
What is?

[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.880]
Let's try Lion 8.

[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.360]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.820]
Oh, we got to make some cutbacks,

[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.140]
Neil's going to be some hard times.

[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.200]
Now we're going to have a big recession and depression

[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.220]
and we'll be hard pressed to pay your salary.

[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.940]
Just keep the checks coming, Jolly.

[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.820]
Joe, that's all you're doing a wonderful job of that.

[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.180]
Keep them coming all summer and whatever.

[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.420]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.580]
Get in the car!

[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.420]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.600]
Is this Neil's a thrill?

[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:35.920]
Yeah.

[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.340]
What's going on, Ray?

[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.520]
You're all right, Neil.

[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:38.920]
I'll tell you.

[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.740]
Anything calls all day, huh?

[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:41.460]
Yeah.

[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.200]
Hey, I say, hey Neil.

[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:44.480]
Yeah.

[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.900]
Hey, what's the latest on Paco?

[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.860]
Are you going to give this two-one out of one?

[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.060]
Huh.

[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:51.920]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.200]
Hey, Neil, have you heard the good news though?

[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:55.700]
What's going on?

[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.860]
What's that?

[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.980]
The weed is a lot stronger than it used to be.

[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:00.580]
Really?

[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:01.340]
Yeah.

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.000]
That's great.

[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.840]
Everybody says it's bad, but I think it's a positive thing.

[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.500]
To net against a nearing.

[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.560]
Is it possible that you might ever grow up someday or is that unlikely?

[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.500]
Maybe, but I doubt it.

[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.180]
I doubt it, yeah.

[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.200]
Just keep sifting them seeds out, man.

[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.200]
Keep sifting the seeds.

[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.080]
That's the important thing.

[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:19.880]
Indulceeds are quick.

[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.960]
Make it into a big project.

[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.360]
Now he's going to make it into a project.

[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.720]
So he's got to find some seeds.

[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.580]
If there aren't any in there,

[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.720]
he'll look for them anyway.

[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.960]
Put some bird seed in there then.

[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:27.600]
That's right.

[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.640]
Stick it a lot like with Luke Krohn at time on WNWS.

[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.200]
Yeah, boy.

[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.460]
I had a bottle of bird seed, and I kept saying on here that it was pot seeds,

[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.720]
and he just went ballistic.

[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.440]
And Tom Jickel was my guest at night,

[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.980]
and Tom went out in the hallway when they heard Luke Krohn's screaming,

[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.020]
oh, you're going to get our Luzor license, Neil.

[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.020]
You're going to have a...

[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:45.640]
Oh, brother.

[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.200]
Was he here?

[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.880]
Do we still have his kids selling our...

[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.560]
Yeah, Josh, but then...

[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.100]
Well, I'm sorry.

[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.780]
Not everybody can have a same daddy, you know.

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.240]
I know Luke Krohn was on the throne,

[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.600]
and Luke Tommy Jickel was in there hearing everything that was going on.

[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.040]
He just couldn't believe it.

[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.060]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.540]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.640]
Call him!

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.280]
It's QAM, hello.

[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:09.460]
Neil.

[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.840]
I want to wish you a happy summer season.

[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:15.640]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.360]
I know you're doing it two days.

[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:18.260]
Yeah.

[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.780]
You have a lot of fun at WNWS.

[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.040]
The quarter-slot guy, yes.

[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:21.980]
Yeah, well, I...

[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.180]
Let me make a suggestion to you, okay?

[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.180]
Look at that, buddy.

[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.260]
Why don't you listen to...

[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:26.960]
No, I'm not your buddy.

[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.420]
I want you to listen very carefully.

[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.000]
You have a buddy.

[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.960]
Don't ever...

[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.420]
No, you're not.

[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.100]
Don't ever call the show again.

[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.380]
Are you sure?

[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:33.920]
You know I will.

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.320]
Don't, Ellen, do you hear what I just said?

[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:35.840]
He doesn't care.

[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:36.840]
It's all good.

[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.340]
No, it's all bad.

[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.320]
Huh?

[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.740]
Don't ever call the show again.

[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.440]
I want you to relax my...

[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.860]
Don't ever call the show again.

[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:46.560]
Ever.

[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:47.340]
Never.

[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:47.780]
Bye.

[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.040]
Like I said, of all the knitwits on here,

[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.840]
I mean, the other ones I don't even pay any attention to,

[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.880]
but this guy is just...

[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.860]
He's a wannabe.

[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.360]
He just wants to be another annoying A-hole,

[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.680]
and he's doing it.

[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.420]
And got that thick nasty, disgusting voice.

[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.280]
I wonder if that sports collar ever cloaked.

[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.300]
The one with the thick voice.

[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.240]
Well, he used to get so upset when I would say that.

[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.380]
When I came to WKAT 100 years ago,

[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.760]
he was called Sonny Hirsch.

[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.760]
What was he calling the other shows?

[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:19.140]
Huh?

[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.120]
What was he calling them?

[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:21.520]
Jerk.

[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.800]
I can't think of what his name is,

[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.420]
but oh my God, if you heard the voice,

[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.460]
well, you wouldn't know it.

[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.180]
Here we are 32 and a half years later,

[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.560]
and we still got some of the same retards.

[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.960]
Although, you know, at least this guy,

[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.660]
he's a new retard.

[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:37.880]
Quarter-shot guy.

[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.040]
I'm a quarter-shot guy.

[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.140]
Yeah, that's my claim to fame.

[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.180]
I'm a quarter-shot guy.

[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.500]
I'm the hotel pharmacy guy.

[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.480]
How come I'm getting a new thing?

[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.520]
I just got you guys.

[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.100]
Revised what?

[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.880]
The name was incorrect on the one that you were reading

[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.400]
and it's called...

[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.380]
Well, I didn't... I didn't make a mistake.

[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.720]
I read what it was so...

[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.260]
I was so mad to do it again today.

[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.180]
I'll do it on Tuesday.

[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.140]
You do it on Monday.

[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.480]
All right.

[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.320]
That's your good buddy, Spley, okay,

[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.780]
who seems like a decent guy,

[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.840]
but man, he's got some real issues.

[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.880]
You know what one of them is?

[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:09.640]
You want to...

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.040]
That's it.

[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:12.480]
God.

[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.440]
He must have a Todd Direct disease.

[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.400]
Just keep reading and PD Laney disease too.

[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.420]
He's the worst of all of them.

[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.380]
Keep doing it over and over again.

[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.080]
Keep making changes, 400 times.

[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:25.900]
Although they...

[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.240]
They were...

[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:26.900]
They changed their name.

[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:28.500]
I beg your pardon?

[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.580]
And what do I have to do with that?

[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.220]
Nothing.

[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:32.860]
It's just...

[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.860]
I'm reading whatever he's right, right?

[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:35.120]
Right, right, right.

[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.820]
Well, get it right, Spley.

[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:37.800]
Get it right.

[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.880]
Whoever the goofball is behind this...

[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.360]
Huzzarai.

[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.460]
The goofball responsible.

[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.560]
Things change and there you have the changes.

[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.120]
The dealership changed their name.

[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.000]
Well, let me see what the difference is here.

[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.380]
WDQA and Bruce Rossmars,

[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.920]
Holly Davidson and Deadland Dodge.

[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.100]
Well, well, what's the difference?

[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.340]
Wait a minute.

[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.220]
See, this isn't even right.

[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.680]
Deadland Dodge and then says,

[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.360]
go to any Bruce Rossmars or South Dave Dodge showroom.

[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.200]
So they've got two different dealer names in here.

[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.200]
It's supposed to be Deadland Dodge now.

[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.140]
Then what does it say, South Dave Dodge showroom

[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.480]
in the second part?

[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:13.840]
What?

[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.940]
I don't think this is even right.

[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.360]
I don't think this is even right.

[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:16.780]
It's not.

[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.760]
It's not what?

[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:18.220]
Right.

[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.500]
Well, tell him to wipe his ass with it then.

[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.060]
Hey, a flee.

[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.000]
Wipe your ass with this.

[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:23.320]
Okay.

[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.460]
Put some correct information in it once would be nice.

[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.500]
You idiot.

[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.180]
You vozo.

[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:28.820]
You fairy.

[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.700]
WDQA and hello.

[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.060]
Hey, good morning, Bill.

[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:32.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.540]
Hey, I want to apologize earlier.

[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.340]
I was sworn that was in that road rage

[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.000]
for a minute, uh,

[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.520]
a little incident there.

[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.300]
I want to apologize.

[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:40.060]
Yeah, sure.

[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.320]
No, I'm on the road in ILEA.

[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.540]
So I imagine that.

[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:43.540]

[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:44.920]
Hey, I knew.

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.940]
It wasn't funny the first time.

[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.940]
It ain't going to be funny no matter how you try to slice it.

[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.440]
You go ahead, come up with something interesting.

[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.380]
No, no, sir, I'm serious.

[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.300]
Yeah, I'm serious.

[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.220]
Um, my wife's taking me out to, uh,

[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.580]
Grand Lux Cafe in Navantura, Sunday for fall of the day.

[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.080]
You had a bad experience there?

[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.500]
Never heard of it.

[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.960]
Oh, Grand Lux Cafe.

[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:04.780]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.240]
Grand Lux Cafe.

[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:05.920]
You're going to have a good time.

[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:06.460]
You're going to have a good time.

[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.280]
Yeah, right in the middle of the road.

[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:07.980]
Oh, my God.

[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.520]
I wouldn't take my dead dog there.

[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.260]
What do you know what you're laughing about?

[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.820]
I'm telling you, I wouldn't, that would be cool.

[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.020]
I took her out of Houston for a moment.

[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.780]
So I guess I'm not going to go back to Houston.

[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:19.980]
Houston's is great.

[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:20.960]
And where is it?

[00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.320]
Where's the, where's the still a Houston's open?

[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.940]
I ran out of the skateboard.

[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:24.940]
Really?

[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.220]
The PF Changs and Morns.

[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.300]
It's all three of them right now.

[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.900]
Can you show it to me?

[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:29.640]
No.

[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.480]
I'm sure it's how to rather go there

[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.700]
than that PF Changs, man.

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.380]
That's like in Dustbule Strike, Chinese.

[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.380]
Yes, it is.

[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.500]
I went there also.

[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:38.820]
I mean, it's okay, but it's nothing special.

[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.540]
Yeah, but there's a Morns fear Chang and Houston's right there.

[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.100]
I know exactly where that is.

[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.940]
Well, next time I'm down there, I'm going to Houston's.

[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.380]
I love Houston's.

[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.380]
Let me know, though, and I'll see you there.

[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:50.780]
Okay, unlikely.

[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.160]
Yeah, let me know I'll see you there.

[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.500]
I'll see you there.

[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:54.940]
No.

[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.060]
Oh, Neil, aren't you going to hang out with your listeners?

[00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:58.460]
No.

[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.560]
Absolutely not.

[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.100]
I'm sure there might be some of them I wouldn't mind hanging out with,

[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.860]
but he sure ain't one of them.

[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.560]
190 votes on the poll, which female solvers got the ugliest breast,

[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:13.460]
nasty boobies, Yoko Ono 54, Sandra Bernard 25, Pan Anderson 17,

[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.720]
Tara Read 11, that were messing.

[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.380]
What a mess.

[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:16.800]
Nine.

[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.700]
Who is Deborah Messing?

[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.400]
I don't know who that is.

[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.320]
Will and Grace.

[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.060]
I don't, I don't watch that crap.

[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:23.580]
I know.

[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.620]
Laura and Flynn Boil 8, Anna Cole Smith 8, and 8, and 8.

[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.540]
Whitney Houston 6, Courtney Love 6, who went with Falcrow 6.

[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.380]
Too bad about her kid cooking in the hospital room, wasn't it?

[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.200]
What a palchron?

[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.320]
No, Anna and Cole.

[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.360]
Oh, here it is again.

[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.520]
Corrected.

[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.020]
Oh, I'll tell you what, please just keep writing it over and over and over again,

[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.660]
and maybe if you write it four or five hundred times,

[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.500]
maybe you'll get it right, but I don't.

[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.180]
What the heck is going on?

[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.440]
The best out of fear for the little Rogers.

[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.920]
Forty-four-five sixty-qua-am.

[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.640]
The fourth leader.

[00:44:59.000 --> 00:44:59.500]
Your brain.

[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.620]
This is your brain on drugs.

[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.700]
This is your brain being shot to bits by a finely-hoomed meat cleaver.

[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.100]
This is your brain in a blender.

[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.160]
And this is your brain being stirred into a big pot of chili.

[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.140]
Mmm, brains.

[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.320]
Real food for real people.

[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.520]
And now here's another exciting offer from Video Treasure Chest.

[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.140]
The hit game show, Jeopardy, is known as the Thinking Bands game show.

[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.760]
Famous for its low-key format and sedate pace.

[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.500]
But that wasn't always the case.

[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.960]
In the original pilot called Ingevrity,

[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.400]
contestants' lives were actually at risk as this lost pilot episode shows.

[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.800]
Shoes were category-bob.

[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.660]
I'll take US Presidents for 200.

[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.180]
US Presidents for 200.

[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.820]
I'll remember Bob, I'm pointing a loaded gun at your head.

[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.620]
From this point on, your life is Ingepody.

[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.220]
Should you fail to respond correctly, I'll be forced to splat your brains across the soundstage,

[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.880]
preventing you from going on with the final Ingepody round.

[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.600]
I understand, very good Bob.

[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.740]
And the answer is,

[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.680]
come in with the Harryist belly ever to occupy the Oberloffis.

[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.220]
What the hell kind of question is that?

[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.020]
It's not a question, Bob. It's an answer.

[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.040]
Your response must be in the form of a question.

[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:08.840]
Well, that's stupid.

[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.900]
You have 10 seconds, Bob.

[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.160]
And why are you pointing that thing?

[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.000]
I'm running out, Bob.

[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.420]
I don't know, I can't think the gun's making me nervous.

[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.440]
Five seconds, Bob.

[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.300]
Please don't kill me.

[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.700]
Remember, Bob, you must answer as a form of a question.

[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.220]
What is please don't kill me?

[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.620]
I'm sorry, Bob, that's incorrect.

[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.460]
Oh, God.

[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.320]
The correct answer is, who is Millard Fillmore?

[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.000]
Who is Millard Fillmore?

[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.040]
Sorry, Bob.

[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:32.780]
The lost jeopardy pilot in jeopardy, what is death?

[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.260]
Can be yours for just 1995 in local video stores.

[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.540]
Video treasure chest.

[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.980]
We've got rooms of this crap.

[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:39.780]
I'll be too new.

[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.820]
Well, we haven't played any of those in a long time.

[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.680]
You know what? I have an idea.

[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:43.120]

[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.620]
There's a whole bunch of them.

[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.520]
I think I'd have to play them all.

[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.080]
Sure.

[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.800]
Just loop them all up there and do the loop-de-loop.

[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.860]
I take a lot of calls the whole next three hours, man.

[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.640]
You have no idea what you're for you.

[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.000]
I'm experiencing right now.

[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:55.680]
Yeah, I do.

[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.680]
Do you?

[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.340]
I feel it when the summer schedule is over.

[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.600]
I don't have to think anymore.

[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:01.940]
I'm not saying anything.

[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:02.200]
I'm not saying anything.

[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:02.520]
I'm not saying anything.

[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.560]
I'm not enjoying being on those three days.

[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.860]
It's just what my brain is.

[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.040]
You're laughing.

[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:05.820]
Yeah.

[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.700]
Don't you want to hear from your fans?

[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.800]
Is Jolly Jo would say,

[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:10.300]
don't you?

[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:11.640]
Don't you?

[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:12.440]
No.

[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.740]
Some of her was nice meeting all those people.

[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:16.520]
They were all very nice.

[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.560]
Except a couple that we didn't need to see.

[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.440]
The guy with the eyes and that thing he got in the mail.

[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.420]
What do you think of this?

[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.500]
So...

[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.420]
I mean, if you look up Moron in any dictionary,

[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.000]
you'll see his push right next to it.

[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.500]
And the guy with the green teeth too.

[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.880]
Out of the...

[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.720]
His boyfriend.

[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:38.480]
Isn't that amazing how they find each other?

[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.340]
No.

[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.360]
Not amazing at all.

[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.400]
All the Ricardo's they find each other.

[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:41.660]
That's right.

[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.280]
It's not amazing.

[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.720]
Sit around and play with each other.

[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:44.960]
It can only be that way.

[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.420]
No one else will talk to any of those people.

[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.220]
They win by default.

[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.000]
And then of course it says,

[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.580]
How's that?

[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.240]
How's that?

[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.480]
That showed up there with the...

[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:52.880]
Yeah, they did.

[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.340]
The evil bitch still.

[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.120]
Yeah, it was right there.

[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:55.680]
It was the uncle.

[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.620]
They all think it's funny, the family.

[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.980]
They're all the same.

[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.400]
The uncle was there?

[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:00.840]
Yeah.

[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.140]
Somebody had to drive it.

[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.240]
You think it drives a car?

[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:05.820]
Thank God.

[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.620]
Did I meet the uncle?

[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.620]
I guess.

[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.260]
He was there.

[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.040]
How do you know it was the uncle?

[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:10.760]
Because he said...

[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.040]
My uncle, my uncle, my uncle.

[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:12.980]
No, my dad, my uncle.

[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.420]
People with higher IQs are less likely to believe in God

[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.320]
according to a new study.

[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.180]
This is an etel-graph UK.

[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.820]
Professor Richard Lynn, emeritus professor of psychology

[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.220]
at Ulster University said,

[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.240]
Many more members of the intellectual elite

[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.580]
consider themselves atheist than national average.

[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.520]
A decline in religious observance over the last century

[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.480]
was directly linked to a rise in average intelligence,

[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.720]
he claimed, this is in Britain, of course, not in the USA.

[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.880]
But the conclusions in a paper

[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.740]
for the academic journal intelligence have been branded

[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.260]
simplistic by critics.

[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.720]
A survey of rural society fellows

[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.060]
found that only 3.3% believed in God

[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.400]
at a time when 68.5% of the general UK population

[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.860]
described themselves as believers.

[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.180]
A separate poll in the 90s found only 7% of the members

[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.260]
of the American National Academy of Sciences believed in God.

[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.000]
American.

[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.060]
How do you like that?

[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.160]
Professor Lynn said,

[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:10.880]
Most primary schoolchildren believed in God

[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]
but as they entered adolescents

[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.340]
and their intelligence increased,

[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.560]
many started to have doubts.

[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:18.460]
As in what a bunch of stupid craft this is,

[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.840]
what kind of a God would it create all of this?

[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.960]
What kind of God would invent mosquitoes, for example,

[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.400]
on hurricanes and floods?

[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.000]
And that's a pissed off God, that's the kind of God.

[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.620]
Every time his wrath waxes hot,

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.800]
there's a flood, there's a famine, there's a bunch,

[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.640]
there's another one called Hornets.

[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:35.680]
What? Hot wax.

[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.200]
Hot wax, yeah, let's spin some hot wax.

[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:41.440]
32 A.M. Hello.

[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.520]
2 A.M. Hello.

[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:46.820]
Hola.

[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:48.440]
Hola.

[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.240]
I'm sorry, who's this?

[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:52.500]
Yeah, who you calling?

[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.980]
Is this an neurologist program?

[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.720]
Yeah, it's called, it's a show where morons like you call it.

[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.160]
Listen, we worked your event.

[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.400]
We worked your appearance.

[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.360]
Well, you know what? It's a good thing we didn't know who you were

[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.980]
because, yeah, we were your appearance.

[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.320]
Him and the boyfriend joined at the hip.

[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:08.640]
We.

[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.960]
Little fraternity of losers, a misfits, a subhuman misfits.

[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.420]
5, 6, 7, 05, and by the way,

[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.520]
if you think I'm ever going to do that again, guess again.

[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.160]
Okay.

[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.080]
This thing with the promo here, with the liner.

[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:23.920]
Yeah.

[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:26.380]
The fact that he had a type of 600 times,

[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.200]
and there's something wrong.

[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.700]
I don't know what your issue is.

[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:29.900]
They changed the names.

[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.600]
You don't understand, but he put two different names in the same thing.

[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:32.980]
He changed it.

[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.060]
It was a typo.

[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.220]
You got a thing with him.

[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.320]
I don't know what he ever did to you.

[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.760]
I don't have anything with him.

[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.420]
He seems like a fine human being.

[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.320]
Yeah, they changed the name.

[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.860]
They changed the name.

[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.060]
They changed the name, and they put it in two different names in the same thing.

[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.760]
So he only corrected one and not the other.

[00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:48.800]
It's called a typo.

[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:49.820]
You're a...

[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:50.680]
I don't know what he's doing.

[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:51.220]

[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:56.660]
I'm not going nuts, but I mean, the kind of insanity and the kind of ineptitude that you say.

[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.960]
All depending on who does it.

[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:58.520]
No.

[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.380]
You're very selective.

[00:50:59.760 --> 00:50:59.900]
No.

[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.200]
See, it's not personal with me.

[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:01.620]
It's business.

[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:02.840]
I feel like I'm just fine.

[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:03.720]
I think it's a good guy.

[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.160]
You know, here's about this show.

[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.260]
You rip everything he does.

[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.620]
You rip into everything he does, whether it goes over or different.

[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:10.700]
No, I don't.

[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.740]
What are you talking about?

[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.780]
You see, you did a fine job at the appearance.

[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.060]
Right.

[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:14.720]
Yeah.

[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:17.240]
So then why you saying I rip into your room?

[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.480]
Okay, well, there's one better thing.

[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.000]
George has got a thing with Flay.

[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:20.360]
I do.

[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.600]
They're doing something.

[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:22.180]
I'm sure.

[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:22.260]
I'm sure.

[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.260]
We're doing everything together with O.

[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:24.800]
But you are.

[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.140]
A lot of it has to do with...

[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:27.520]
You know it.

[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.600]
Who I am, hello.

[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:31.640]
Not there.

[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.240]
What is shame?

[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.520]
Who I am, hello.

[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:34.060]
Who you love?

[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:35.940]
That's...

[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.580]
Well, I'm...

[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.160]
That's...

[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:39.400]
Well, I'm...

[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:39.400]

[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:39.460]
Okay.

[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:41.780]
Hello?

[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:43.980]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:44.820]
Yeah.

[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:45.660]
Yes.

[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.820]
I just want to say happy vacation and I love you and your awesome...

[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.880]
And George, check your email.

[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:52.460]
He's saying something.

[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:54.500]
I hope it's money.

[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:56.640]
He didn't send you no money.

[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:57.540]
Check your email.

[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.240]
I just did.

[00:51:58.740 --> 00:51:59.420]
And they...

[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.280]
Nothing there.

[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.700]
Well, he's thinking about it.

[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.620]
Maybe if he ever figures out how to...

[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.340]
Tap it out.

[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.840]
You'll get something really good.

[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.540]
pound 5, 60,

[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.060]
and a Verizon Singular wireless line.

[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.840]
This isn't what I had in mind for today.

[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.520]
I thought I'd have like a big send off, you know?

[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.600]
I can't even begin to imagine what's going to happen.

[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.200]
There's absolute last show I do.

[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:21.140]
Oh, I think so.

[00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:22.080]
I've always told you.

[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.980]
Don't ever expect anything from South Florida.

[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:24.440]
Oh, I don't.

[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.160]
I'll never be disappointed.

[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:25.740]
That's right.

[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.940]
Because they'll definitely live up to that every time.

[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:29.560]
WQA, I am.

[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:29.740]
Hello.

[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:32.420]
QA.

[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:33.680]
Yeah, man.

[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.380]
Yeah, speaking.

[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:36.760]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:37.360]
Okay.

[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.700]
You were staying.

[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:40.380]
Yeah.

[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:41.760]
Oh, good.

[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.440]
Smell this.

[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:44.320]
Welcome.

[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.020]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:50.020]
That was Futsi.

[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.560]
That was Futsi doing a, uh, voice.

[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.520]
Is he still on the air, by the way, Duff, uh, he looks regularly?

[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.160]
What?

[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.660]
Is Futsi still on the air?

[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:00.100]
Yeah.

[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:00.940]
I don't know.

[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.080]
Well, why not?

[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:02.820]
Well, I've a list.

[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:03.560]
Check in the website.

[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.800]
There might be an important poll on it.

[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:05.420]
That's your job.

[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.160]
Find the best mayonnaise.

[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.120]
There's only Feds.

[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:08.880]
WQA and hello.

[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:10.040]
Welcome, Neil.

[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:10.780]
How are you, man?

[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:11.440]
Okay, sir.

[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:16.040]
Hey, so you're only going to be working on Tuesdays and Thursdays, is that it?

[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.160]
I've been doing that for years.

[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:18.200]
I know.

[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.160]
I just do that.

[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.440]
Hey, listen.

[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.700]
I'm not a horse guy.

[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.300]
Can I talk about big brown?

[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.040]
Well, why are you talking about whatever you want?

[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.180]
Hey, okay.

[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.080]
I'm not a horse guy, but I sent my kids down in front of the TV and said,

[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.940]
let's watch history.

[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:34.760]

[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.440]
Oh, on and on and on.

[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.060]
And it just seemed to me like the fix was on, man.

[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.900]
He was not good from the get-go.

[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.640]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.760]
He wasn't good from the get-go.

[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.640]
So he slipped a little bit coming out of the gate, but when he went into the backstreet,

[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.540]
he was sitting right there, third on the outside.

[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.100]
He had all the clearance in the world.

[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.220]
He had two rank long shots in front of him.

[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.620]
If he had any horse, he would have zoomed by them and would have won by 20 ranks.

[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:04.560]
Well, the one that won just shot out immediately, and then no one ever had a chance against him.

[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:05.920]
I forgot what it was.

[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.820]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.620]
When I had a chance, he said a slow pace.

[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:09.680]
He slowed it down.

[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:14.280]
He backed into big brown in the first turn, and he said a slow pace, and that's it.

[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:15.240]
Yeah.

[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:20.100]
And now, and now, Rick Dupter was saying, oh, I don't know what Dessurmo was doing there in the first turn.

[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.340]
I don't know why he pulled him up.

[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.480]
I don't know what he was thinking about.

[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.980]
Now he's looking to blame the jockey.

[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.920]
You know, that his horse came up empty because he didn't have his, he didn't have his witties.

[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:28.880]
That's right.

[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.860]
Well, I mean, hey, have a good summer.

[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:31.940]
I was great talking to you.

[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.100]
I'm a long time listener, 20-year club, buddy.

[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:34.780]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.180]
Yeah.

[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.000]
See you.

[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.700]
He didn't have his witties.

[00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:39.160]
That's all they have his vitamins, man.

[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.880]
And that's why they're trying to make her ball these other excuses.

[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:43.760]
Roids, steroids.

[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.360]
It's not just ball players that do steroids.

[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.960]
And in this case, it wasn't any secret.

[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:51.280]
They were legal in the middle of three states, and he talked about the fact he gave him roids.

[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.640]
It's been getting worse, and our words all along.

[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.280]
Do you think that was why I was saying not taking him?

[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.760]
Did so bad?

[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:57.560]

[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.780]
You think with him not taking the last time, is that's why he did so bad?

[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.280]
What did I just say?

[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.480]
What did I just say?

[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:05.920]
What do you say?

[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:07.660]
Spell it out for you?

[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:08.220]
Could you?

[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:13.360]
A-S-S-H.

[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.340]
Yo pro auto is kicking ass again, man.

[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:17.160]
She is usually.

[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:17.840]
She's nasty.

[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.480]
She doesn't just have ugly breath.

[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.100]
She's just ugly from the top of the head to her tippy toes.

[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:22.880]
That's right.

[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.860]
In fact, John Lennon probably was relieved that he got put out of his misery.

[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.480]
Why would a guy with his, of course he was Noah look or either, man.

[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.380]
But in a generally speaking, when you're dealing with rock stars,

[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.300]
they can be as ugly as Sam's right and were like,

[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.280]
you're bringing everything that they whatever they want.

[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.040]
Guys, they're famous, they're a star.

[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:42.700]
I'm gonna be the rule.

[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.000]
If they see your face on something other than your head, they want you.

[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:50.780]
Check it out.

[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.240]
Do your own survey.

[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:53.680]
They see your head on anything but your neck.

[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.080]
They see your face on anything if it could be a one-way TV TV.

[00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.500]
You could be a new neighbor or anything.

[00:55:59.820 --> 00:55:59.860]
Right.

[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.220]
They see it somewhere other than on your face that they want you.

[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.700]
A lot of the poster they want you.

[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.080]
That's right.

[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:04.720]
Doesn't matter.

[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:08.580]
Sounds to me like you're not a woman.

[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:09.320]
Police sketch?

[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:09.800]
No, no.

[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.900]
I'm not going to women, yes, as often as I can.

[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.280]
You get a lot of dance.

[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:44.980]
Five, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six

[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.280]
We thought it was his dad.

[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.520]
It's my uncle, it's my uncle.

[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:48.380]
Yeah.

[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.900]
And what is uncle, I have to say for himself,

[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:55.280]
nothing, none of these people, apparently it's mutants, you know,

[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.740]
they usually come from a mutant family.

[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:58.360]
Yeah.

[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.200]
And so, I guess they're all mutants, just part of it.

[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.500]
Some are more mutated than others.

[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:04.940]
In other words, this is their life.

[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:05.700]
They have wet feet.

[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:06.900]
Drop-end words were still on,

[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.860]
they can put them on, this is your life.

[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:08.260]
That's right.

[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.100]
That would be,

[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:10.500]
I'm your friend.

[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:11.400]
I'm your friend.

[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.400]
Yeah, they obviously don't see a problem there.

[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:14.460]
I see.

[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.500]
Oh, I saw a problem, as soon as I saw that thing.

[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:17.900]
Sure.

[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:19.120]
Where am I?

[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:21.740]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:23.480]
Yeah, Neil, please.

[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.220]
You can do it, come on.

[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:28.720]
They're all.

[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:29.400]
Take a breath.

[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:30.540]
Oh, you can.

[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:30.920]
Yes.

[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.240]
Up from the island, Neil.

[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:35.600]
Yeah.

[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:36.580]
That's right.

[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:37.740]
Don't be close.

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:38.980]
Yeah.

[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.440]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.780]
George, good for you, Sam.

[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:47.020]
WDQYM, hello.

[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:49.980]
And you know, just want to say, I have an ice vacation.

[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:51.700]
Thanks.

[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.200]
He's going to Amsterdam.

[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.580]
I'm not going on vacation.

[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.220]
Oh, all right.

[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.400]
Have a good time in Amsterdam.

[00:57:57.980 --> 00:57:58.300]
OK.

[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.440]
And Amsterdam.

[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.140]
Not going to Amsterdam.

[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, but I'm sure that he's sitting there

[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.600]
also conjuring up all sorts of images as my.

[00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.320]
Some of which may have been true in the past,

[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.240]
but not at the moment.

[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:13.120]
It's become a really ponderous place.

[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.140]
I've seen enough Dutchmen to last a lifetime.

[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.700]
I've eaten enough really marginal food.

[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:18.760]
I've been forced to go to Mickey D's more than enough

[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.940]
to try to get an edible meal.

[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.680]
It's just, there ain't nothing there, no more.

[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:23.980]
And the Dutch.

[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:25.380]
Oh, my God.

[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.100]
But nevertheless, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8,

[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.340]
I'm going to just keep pumping the numbers

[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.240]
for the rest of the show.

[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:31.840]
How do you like that?

[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.560]
I'm out of practice on that anyway.

[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:34.060]
Yep.

[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.120]
Pound 5, 6, 10, the Verizon wireless

[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.240]
and Singular wireless line.

[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.280]
And 1-877-785-Neil.

[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.440]
Is that what I never even knew

[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.660]
that they had transposed a meal?

[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:43.440]
Sure you did.

[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.320]
You just got that.

[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.300]
Well, when we got that number,

[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:49.060]
you were, it was explaining to you what exactly it spelled out.

[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.420]
The first three spelled something out too

[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.300]
that we can't say anymore.

[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:52.880]
We can?

[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:53.540]
No.

[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:55.560]
Screw Neil?

[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:56.680]
No.

[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:57.280]
Close.

[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.480]
1-877-785-645.

[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:02.920]
That's for out of town.

[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.700]
Within about a 20-mile radius.

[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:06.620]
Anything more than that we don't want to pay for.

[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:08.420]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280]
It's the metronome.

[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:16.640]
Hey, that could be a great format.

[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:17.960]
I like that.

[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:18.700]
That's a good idea.

[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.820]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:21.620]
Be hypnotic.

[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:22.600]
Q-A-M.

[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:23.480]
Be hypnotic.

[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.440]
Hola.

[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.680]
I threw my pen.

[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:29.020]
Toto, toto, toto.

[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.000]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.100]
Hey, Vali.

[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:33.460]
Good morning.

[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.600]
Hey, all of you.

[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.320]
Does Philean pretty much have a hand tie

[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:39.880]
when it comes down to promoting your show?

[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:41.800]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.420]
I mean, I mean, there's no promotion for your show

[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.280]
as far as like billboards or contests.

[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.540]
He's got nothing to do with that.

[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:48.600]
Maybe about that.

[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.740]
Those things cost money.

[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:50.000]
That.

[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.420]
I hear stories laughing.

[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:53.520]
Billboards, that's good.

[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:54.080]
Yeah.

[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.600]
Those things cost money, you understand.

[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.180]
They're not spending any money to promote anybody's show.

[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:59.080]
Don't you understand it?

[00:59:59.080 --> 00:59:59.760]
It's the way it works.

[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.120]
It's an idea.

[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.280]
How about all prongs your guts with Neil Day

[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.600]
or have lunch with Neil Day?

[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.780]
I don't want to have lunch with any strangers.

[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:07.780]
OK, I'm sorry.

[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.860]
I'm just kidding.

[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.440]
No, you're not.

[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:10.940]
No, no, no.

[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.360]
I don't have lunch with any strangers.

[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.240]
No, this stalker.

[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.020]
You're a stalker.

[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.560]
I'm not a stalker.

[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.220]
Yeah, you are.

[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.780]
No, I don't want to be.

[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:18.620]
I don't want to.

[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:19.320]
Good.

[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.300]
5670560, pound 560 under Verizon and Singular wireless

[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.440]
line, a rare, dearth response today.

[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.020]
Week.

[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.240]
Week.

[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.420]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.020]
Dale?

[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:34.820]
Yes.

[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.460]
Do you still live in the best of TV?

[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:37.400]
No.

[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.500]
OK, and George, that email is about the botteroo webcast.

[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.580]
Starts from about an hour.

[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:42.140]
OK.

[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:42.900]
Love you.

[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:43.320]
Thanks.

[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.660]
What is it saying?

[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.440]
And you can just call it a second time, by the way.

[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:47.480]
Yeah, don't do that anymore.

[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:48.900]
Let's see.

[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.460]
Let's open the webcast for some music festival.

[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:51.440]
Oh.

[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:52.540]
Banneroo.

[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.180]
Not for you.

[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:55.740]
Great.

[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.220]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.120]
Neil.

[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:00.960]
Yes.

[01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.140]
Yeah.

[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.120]
Can't do it.

[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:06.980]
Couldn't cut the mustard.

[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.740]
Maybe cut the cheese, but it couldn't cut the mustard.

[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:11.860]
Very, very lame.

[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.040]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.440]
Good day, Neil.

[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:15.680]
Good day.

[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:16.380]
Yes.

[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.380]
I hear you always talking about woodbine and everything.

[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.480]
And I play the machines and everything.

[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.360]
And I was just really annoying Chinaman.

[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.100]
Chinaman ball is little jackpot.

[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.900]
I go in the smallest jackpot and he does the nodding of the head.

[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.140]
And I hear you always talking about how you can't stand people standing behind you when

[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:37.900]
you're playing or anything.

[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:38.440]
That is correct.

[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.340]
Do you have any suggestions in a polite way that I can get this guy in his wife away from?

[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.540]
I mean, I'm winning nothing.

[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.200]
Nothing.

[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.660]
And he's getting very angry.

[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.620]
You can see it on his face.

[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.060]
He's getting angry about what?

[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.560]
Yeah, I'm winning and he's not.

[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.060]
And I'm only winning back to money.

[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.580]
I've come in the day before or that same day.

[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.620]
Now, tell me you don't want an audience.

[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.300]
And number two, George, happy father.

[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.400]
Tell him, tell him you're like, thank you.

[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.400]
Oh, well, you don't want an audience.

[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:02.420]
Okay.

[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.200]
All right, well, the George, happy father.

[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:04.840]
Thank you.

[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.320]
Oh, happy father's day.

[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.400]
Don't you dad's out there.

[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.820]
And I'm sure that somebody somewhere in the world's got a good dad.

[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.980]
Although, not too many people I know.

[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:14.500]
Nope.

[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:15.960]
I sure sell them.

[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:16.800]
Yeah, other people.

[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.180]
What?

[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.700]
I know other people that have good dads.

[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.340]
I think we shouldn't.

[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.100]
I got a good dad.

[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.500]
Well, thank God for that.

[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.820]
Although, how come dad let you get so fat?

[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.600]
Well, you know, I got older and I was able to stay away from him sometimes.

[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.680]
Shame on you, dad.

[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.100]
All of you to chase you around more.

[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.880]
Let your son get big and tubby and fat.

[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.000]
Just gruesome.

[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.720]
Look at that, that's my boy.

[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.900]
WQQ, I hear him.

[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.180]
Hello.

[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:42.440]
Hey.

[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.400]
Hey, this is much just for George.

[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.860]
I was wondering if you're going to be changing your diapers in the next couple of years.

[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.340]
Yes, and my bag.

[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.000]
Getting your bag.

[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.480]
I have the more towel that's already.

[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.300]
Empty the bag.

[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.480]
Come on, man.

[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.400]
Get old.

[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.480]
What?

[01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.060]
Getting old.

[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:02.180]
You're getting old.

[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:02.800]
You're getting old.

[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:03.960]
You should be so old.

[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:04.480]
Who isn't?

[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.460]
Happens to the worst of us, okay, sir.

[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.200]
I'm getting old.

[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.440]
I don't, to me, sound a different.

[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:13.740]
I did 10, 15 years ago.

[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:13.980]
No.

[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.680]
So what's the deal?

[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.020]
Okay.

[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.460]
I'm really only 38.

[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:17.800]
Right.

[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:40.440]
I'm really 38.

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.380]

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:41.440]
I'm really 38.

[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:46.440]
I'm really 38.

[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:46.560]
You're so 44.

[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.100]
What are you, guys?

[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.020]
That was one day when you explained it to me.

[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:49.400]
That's okay.

[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.180]
I had to expand to a six times.

[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.480]
Just like this liner here.

[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.540]
This is a flea thing.

[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.140]
And George keeps taking it, he had no clue.

[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:58.080]
He was like, was he going to purse it?

[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:58.900]
I don't care who's doing it.

[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.180]
Just send me some correct information with the nice.

[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:01.720]
That's all.

[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.460]
You always wig with him for some reason.

[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.480]
No, I do not.

[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.700]
I don't get wiggling with the jigging.

[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.720]
Wiggling with a wiggling bag!

[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.020]
Maybe he really likes them.

[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:09.680]
I think so.

[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.320]
Yeah, I think I think you just got a lechon.

[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.160]
He was like, he was quite far!

[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.080]
He's got a big one.

[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.660]
Yeah, yeah, you would know that it judo's WDQAM.

[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.640]
Yeah, I'd be very careful about what.

[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.760]
I'd have a QAM.

[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:26.060]
Hello.

[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:28.720]
QAM.

[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.100]
Not there.

[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:31.740]
QAM.

[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.040]
Hello.

[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.000]
Hello.

[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:35.780]
Hello.

[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:36.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:37.900]
Dale?

[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:38.680]
Yes.

[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:39.520]
Dale.

[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.300]
I got it for that.

[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:42.840]
I was waiting.

[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:43.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:47.080]
Martin or Ruth Chris, and have you been to that?

[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.580]
Oh, you're back to that again, huh?

[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:48.820]
Yeah.

[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.720]
So in other words, here's another guy who every time he calls,

[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:52.940]
he's going to ask the same question.

[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.420]
No, I haven't called him a long time.

[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.480]
I really respect your opinion.

[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:57.900]
I wanted to know, and I wanted to know if you've been to the prime,

[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.780]
whatever the place is on the beach.

[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:01.020]
No.

[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:02.960]
Okay.

[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.920]
The guy called yesterday asked me the same thing.

[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:05.840]
He mortons a Ruth Chris.

[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.180]
I said, you can't go wrong with it.

[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.480]
No, I can't go wrong with either.

[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:09.520]
Let me say it again.

[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.900]
Can't go wrong with either one.

[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:11.880]
Okay.

[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.220]
Okay.

[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:15.500]
Okay.

[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:15.580]

[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.740]
Yeah, we're likely to story.

[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.540]
5, 6, and 5.

[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:20.980]
He probably heard the guy called yesterday, and that's where we got the material from.

[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:22.980]
The clones.

[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:23.880]
Yeah.

[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.520]
Go to the river house.

[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.440]
Go to the river house.

[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:28.960]
Go to the river house.

[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.540]
Go to Josephson, the water.

[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.400]
Go to one of our first camps.

[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.120]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.260]
Go to the Blue Moon.

[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.960]
Go to the Cockamoon.

[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.220]
Go to High Life Cafe.

[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.920]
Go to Low Life Cafe in your case.

[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.020]
That's right.

[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.780]
Oh, look at there is McCain who says unfortunately Senator Obama has not agreed to the joint town hall meeting.

[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.580]
It's going to be easy.

[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.960]
It's tough, my friends, when people have very tough questions.

[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.500]
Easy, easy, easy, easy, but it makes you think.

[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.460]
It makes you think.

[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.900]
It keeps tapping his head like he's looking for a brain.

[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:56.720]
It's looking fine.

[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.760]
Just remember, it's not important when the soldiers come back from Iraq.

[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.440]
That's not important.

[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.760]
It's not important to him because he doesn't give a flying class.

[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.480]
The biggest name of the best town.

[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.940]
I'm here for the great first sport meeting of my sending camp.

[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.000]
They force later.

[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.480]
You can play the Fathasatica.

[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.380]
You won't drive it in the board.

[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.160]
You might swear it in the movies.

[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.520]
Too many songs at the beach.

[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.480]
Everyone except Greg.

[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.500]
You should have been in the beach.

[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.860]
Father, written love.

[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.360]
You're like driving a car.

[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.260]
And you hate it in music.

[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.180]
It has a key to talk.

[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.940]
Father, written love.

[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.420]
Tell me I am a little creep.

[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:12.200]
But I ain't clippin' coupons every day of the movie.

[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.560]
I have nothing like you.

[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.440]
Don't notice the dog track.

[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.220]
And I don't drink my coffee.

[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.920]
But will it be easy for me?

[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.900]
Your daughter's my mother-wife.

[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.300]
I will not destroy her.

[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.300]
She just gonna have to get over it.

[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.820]
She didn't bury her lover.

[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.660]
I heard it.

[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.080]
I love that dance.

[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.360]
I've heard that a long time.

[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.900]
I'm digging her all the gold.

[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.840]
I'm digging for seeds.

[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.140]
I was dancing in the sea.

[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.120]
I'm having a happy Friday.

[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:46.840]
Happy Friday.

[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:52.500]
Now Jeff on my space is pretty peoed about Adrian Barbot.

[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.260]
I can agree with him.

[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.340]
Who they'll put her on wait.

[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.860]
I'm almost pissed off about that.

[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.560]
That was when Hillary announced he was running.

[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:04.720]
That is a wondrous, all-natural rack.

[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.420]
Maybe now that she's pushing seven days away.

[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.020]
But in order to do that, he's right.

[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.580]
I'll send pictures on there too.

[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.640]
I'll send you a picture of Adrian's badge.

[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.980]
I don't want to see Adrian Barbot.

[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.820]
Maybe it'll bring more fags to boobies if I keep doing that.

[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.440]
I don't want to see no boobies.

[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.980]
Maybe you haven't seen enough.

[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:27.940]
No, I see more than enough.

[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.520]
Next you'll be sending me Chris's boobies.

[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:31.700]
That's okay.

[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:32.840]
Oh god.

[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.200]
What a thought.

[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.380]
I think I'm going on a diet.

[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.720]
Which female celebrity has the ugliest breasts?

[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.320]
Yoko Ono 69.

[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.800]
Oh, she's kicking ass this time.

[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:44.240]
Oh yeah.

[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.800]
She does have a Bernard 29, Tera V 21.

[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.720]
Pam Anderson 21, Deborah Messing 12.

[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.920]
I wonder if it's Deborah Messing and her pantaloonies?

[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:52.740]
She has no breasts.

[01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.000]
Larfin Boyle 11, Annter Cole Smith 10,

[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.840]
Gwen of Paltrow 10, Courtney Love 10, a seven.

[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.400]
Eight.

[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.100]
Barbara Streisand 7.

[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.220]
Mariah Carey 6, Whitney Houston 6.

[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.700]
Sigourney Weaver 5, Goldie Han 5, Sugar Crow 4.

[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.940]
Adrian Barbot 3, and Jeff is really filming at the mouth about that.

[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:13.660]
He's PO.

[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.720]
He's absolutely right.

[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:18.100]
Renee Zellberger 3, Tina Turner 3, Glenn Close 3.

[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.020]
Dolores, are we ordained to?

[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:22.980]
Well, you're the one that said it though.

[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:23.660]
Why is that how you say it?

[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.060]
Yeah, whatever.

[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.520]
I don't know how to say it, but what she's doing over it.

[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.160]
We are whatever.

[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.040]
We're nobody's seen any any part of her breast.

[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.580]
I win carrot too.

[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.680]
Well, that's a great movie, fame.

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.800]
That's one of my favorite movies.

[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.400]
That's all right.

[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.760]
And we did see her breasts.

[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.280]
Who wants to go to an F&D school anyway, Leroy?

[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:41.480]
Obviously Leroy does.

[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:42.520]
I guess.

[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.380]
Penelope Cruz 2, Phara Fossett 2.

[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.480]
Leroy had a little bit of an altitude problem.

[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.820]
Well, but Meg Ryan, too, we need to go to anger management.

[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.860]
Terry, what's his name?

[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:53.520]
Joel Feinberg.

[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.280]
What do you call that?

[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:54.740]
Terry, Richard 2.

[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:55.980]
Long for many drivers.

[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.580]
Sean Young, Susan Day, and Jennifer Connelly.

[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.820]
Jennifer Connelly is a nothing wrong with her breast.

[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.340]
They're pristine and clean and just mine.

[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.320]
And Susan Day, why are they picking on poor Susan Day?

[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.560]
They're a little small and flat when she showed them.

[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.180]
Raisin X, they're not spectacular.

[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.280]
Still.

[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.600]
What about Luke Halpin?

[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:14.760]
What about them?

[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:20.720]
And no votes for Mira Sorvino, Glenn Jerry Hallowell, Gina Davis, or Drew

[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.560]
Barrymore, out of 255.

[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.380]
A new poll.

[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.600]
A new Friday poll on my last day before the summer schedule.

[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.760]
Why why is it so confusing for people?

[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.060]
Or are you going to be on vacation?

[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:31.460]

[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.800]
At some point in a couple of weeks, maybe two, three weeks, all that you know.

[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.080]
Right.

[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:35.580]
2000.

[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.680]
I'll be on vacation here.

[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:37.200]
2000.

[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.260]
So this will be the 8th.

[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:39.840]
2001.

[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.900]
Is when we started this summer substitution thing.

[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:43.560]
Really?

[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.820]
Yeah, you think by now, since we don't have any new audience,

[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.640]
you think by now that these people would be used to with their understand.

[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.260]
And in the summertime, I do Tuesday and Thursday, Georgia's on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.380]
And that's the way it works.

[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.620]
Okay. It's not like some rocket science.

[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.460]
It's very simple.

[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.440]
Like most of the audience, like most of the callers, very, very simple.

[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.040]
Christ.

[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.420]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.760]
Can you tell us your answer?

[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:09.480]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:10.540]
Neil.

[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:11.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.640]
I got one for the poll.

[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:13.400]
The movie poll.

[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.140]
Pot spice.

[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.280]
Pot spice.

[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.400]
Pot spice.

[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.320]
Oh, sorry.

[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:20.320]

[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:20.320]

[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:20.440]

[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:20.440]

[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.280]
Which one is she, though?

[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:25.980]
The clothes...

[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.660]
Okay. Thanks.

[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:27.520]
Pot spice.

[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.180]
What do you say?

[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:30.520]
No.

[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.440]
No, normal.

[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.880]
She's just a skinny bitch with normal looking boots.

[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.980]
She's a skinny bitch with normal looking boobies.

[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:37.260]
Okay.

[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.440]
That's what the panel says.

[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.400]
So the answer is...

[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.340]
No.

[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.640]
The answer is, no.

[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:44.580]
The spice girls.

[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.660]
Oh, my god.

[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.780]
Pot spice.

[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:49.620]
That whole thing it just leaves me kind of limp

[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.340]
But then again so do a lot of things at my age

[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.160]

We don't know that for a fact

[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.620]
Rosio Donald

[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.940]
Maybe she is a boot nobody is seen him. Why do you come up with such crap?

Some of these bits that they want to hear over and over again

[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.140]
I can understand if they were funny which we can't play me the really funny ones anymore

[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:40.560]
Anyhow, but if they were really funny, but that one is not funny

[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:47.400]
It is amusing. It's a chuckle, you know words. Yeah, that's right once upon a time in Dave County

[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.080]
And that goes way back. I mean way back to the old IOD days

[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.600]

[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.700]

I mean we started out with some people saying the stuff real and imaginary whatever

[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.340]
I don't want to hear about more boobies. Okay?

I mean if we had one or two of these something you know, but this pool building you can have it

You can have it. I don't want to you know, I mean put bill pools. Yeah

[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:23.220]
And that's because they have nothing to say so and I did not we say that back in a pool building days

[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:27.440]
It's a substitute for having to say so they just give you a name most of them

[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.100]
They would even say hello. It's a oh Joan Rivers right

[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:17.760]
They're all around, they're being around, they're all around.

[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.980]
I thought Mawd was a good selection by you.

[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:40.060]
Right.

[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:45.380]
Here's a fact from Frank, who's becoming a little bit chronic but nevertheless good to

[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.480]
the fact.

[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.320]
But the worst boobies ever, Kate Winslet.

[01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:00.780]
She showed them in some movie where she was cheating on her husband and they were doing these

[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:02.540]
hot and heavy sex scenes in the laundry room and what said.

[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:07.020]
Only the boobies were nasty ugly and Meg Ryan is a close second Frank says.

[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.160]
And you say, they're not great.

[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.720]
I mean Kate Winslet.

[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.280]
Oh, but she's fine.

[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:16.720]
I mean, they're way worse on this list.

[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.960]
But sure, put her on the boobies than Leo.

[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:21.880]
Then Leo?

[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:22.700]
Yeah.

[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.420]
Maybe not as well.

[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.220]
It's just a joke.

[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.020]
Wasn't that the, were they in the Titanic?

[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.240]
They were.

[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.520]
But they're not Titanic.

[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.300]
And Meg Ryan?

[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.600]
Meg Ryan's are a little flat.

[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.280]
I don't mean flat doesn't smell.

[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:35.620]
I mean, little.

[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.000]
Wasn't she in saving Ryan's private?

[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:37.840]
She flated no.

[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:38.640]
Oh.

[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:40.740]
Why didn't you put them on there?

[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:41.740]
Or not as a case maybe?

[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.420]
I really don't care.

[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.020]
There's a lot of bad boobies around believe me.

[01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.280]
By the way, this claimer, there's no such thing as a bad booby.

[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.000]
Just want to go on the record there.

[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:51.860]
I agree.

[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.980]
There's no such thing as a bad booby.

[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:56.920]
No, they're all good.

[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.020]
Thank you.

[01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:58.280]
Ah!

[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:02.900]
I'm sending many pullover to see you.

[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:03.160]
Okay.

[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.700]
I'll see what I can do with it.

[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:10.620]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.000]
Don't you like that sound?

[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.060]
Don't you like that sound?

[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:20.100]
Sounds like somebody is squeezing something so tight like in a vice.

[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:21.120]
Oh yeah.

[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:21.160]

[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:21.760]
A deer.

[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:22.480]
They're squeezing it.

[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.920]
Daddy's got a squeeze box.

[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.680]
I know we got that bit somewhere.

[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.680]
What does that thing call?

[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:29.860]
Maybe we don't have it anymore.

[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.180]
We just can't get the right name for it.

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:32.900]
I think it's that problem.

[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:39.420]
I knew it was that bad boobies around the world.

[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.000]
Well, and then we got...

[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.140]
Daddy, show me your monkey.

[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.480]
Oh, we got that.

[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.880]
Oh, boy.

[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:47.300]
Wait a minute.

[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.520]
I wanted to see what that bit was going.

[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:58.320]
Who wears shorts and flanks socks?

[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.660]
When he mows the lawn?

[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.700]
Falls asleep in the river, flying away,

[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:06.340]
And the baseball game is on, but Daddy man.

[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:07.280]
Oh yeah.

[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.180]
Boy, too bad about him being dead, you know what?

[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:10.660]
Not.

[01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.640]
He just bugged me.

[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:13.820]
I don't know if something about him.

[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:14.800]
Was it the glass eye?

[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.860]
No, he just bugged me.

[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:18.860]
Because you were an anti-submite.

[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.100]
Oh, that must be it.

[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:20.740]
Yeah, I forgot.

[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.040]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:24.820]
Hello, Neil.

[01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:25.520]
Yes?

[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.660]
I wanted to share a thought to talk to him with you.

[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:31.620]
What happened a while?

[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.720]
I shared something with Juju that happened a while back.

[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.060]
Uh-huh.

[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:44.640]
I thought the funniest thing was with your...

[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:45.220]
Yes, for sure.

[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.660]
He said that he said...

[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.160]
Yeah.

[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.280]
But he said...

[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:54.920]
Wait a minute.

[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:56.120]
Wait a minute.

[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:57.980]
What?

[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.220]
Do you have a minute?

[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:02.600]
No, I'd get for it, not for this.

[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:06.240]
So I can think of what George thought he said...

[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.500]
Did you read the...

[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.640]
...cooker edits on...

[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:08.920]
Uh-huh.

[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.220]
How many QAAM, hello?

[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.400]
Uncle Neil?

[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.160]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.320]
Uncle Neil, I was calling because I have a political question.

[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.240]
And I know that you know a lot more about it than I do.

[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.220]
And I'm a little confused about something.

[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.500]
So I was hoping you could have cleared up for me.

[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:25.900]
Yeah.

[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:37.560]
Um, my question is that I don't understand how the American people are willing to put up with this crap that's going on.

[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:43.000]
And what I mean is probably this time next year we're going to be paying $5 for gas.

[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.040]
I already am.

[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.860]
We're, yeah, exactly.

[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:50.700]
And we're paying trillions of dollars for wars, for whatever reason.

[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:50.940]
Yeah.

[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.260]
And what's the question?

[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:59.740]
The question is that when I watch Keith Overman and everybody else talking about the upcoming election,

[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:06.100]
they're saying that Barack Obama has to win state because I own Florida and all these swing states,

[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.460]
or else he's not going to beat McCain.

[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:13.360]
Now, I want to know which America do these people live in.

[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:18.040]
I mean, what is it going to take to get people upset and...

[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.320]
There's a one word answer to your question.

[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.320]
You want to know the other word?

[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.120]
Yes.

[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:23.240]
Stupid.

[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:23.820]
That's right.

[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.460]
Most people are stupid, huh?

[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.700]
It's just my mind.

[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.240]
America is stupid.

[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:30.880]
That's right.

[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.160]
Okay.

[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.800]
I'm just so fed up.

[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.260]
I just can't believe it.

[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.200]
Well, just take two and call us in the morning.

[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:39.460]
Calm down.

[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.120]
He's getting a little bit too agitated for his own good.

[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:43.460]
You know what I mean?

[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.900]
He's going to like have a fart attack.

[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:46.880]
Just calm down.

[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.560]
People aren't going to all of a sudden go to wake up tomorrow morning and be smart.

[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.180]
They're stupid.

[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:52.000]
They're brainwashed.

[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:52.760]
They're idiotic.

[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:55.420]
They'll confuse them with the facts.

[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:58.360]
And they're also bigoted, which of course goes hand in gland with the stupid.

[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.780]
Lots of openings in the vacancies in the motel.

[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.540]
Let me tell you right now.

[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.440]
It's been slim and grim.

[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.100]
On my last day before the summer schedule, no less.

[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.240]
That's really...

[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.160]
That's a slap in the mouth as what it is.

[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:12.040]
Ow!

[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.440]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:14.640]
Hello.

[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:17.620]
Q-A-M.

[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:19.940]
O-A.

[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:24.680]
Hey, Neil.

[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:25.380]
Yeah.

[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:26.580]
How are you?

[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.200]
How's everything?

[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:27.940]
How's our George?

[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:29.560]
Green.

[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:30.820]
All right.

[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:31.700]
You have a good vacation.

[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:33.260]
What was that?

[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:34.620]
Are you the one?

[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.360]
What?

[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.980]
Are you going to vacation?

[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:38.660]
No.

[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.320]
I have a good vacation.

[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.760]
Are you going to vacation?

[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:45.320]
No.

[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.440]
Have a good vacation.

[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.720]
And if you hear the bells in the background from a Bellevue, mental award.

[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.420]
Can you hear it?

[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:54.040]
I heard it.

[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.460]
Hospital bells ringing.

[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:00.060]
Maybe it's the preppin' him for the lobotomy.

[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:04.760]
Or maybe for shock therapy like in the cuckoo's nest.

[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:05.820]
Right.

[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:07.420]
Why should I ask him?

[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:07.900]
Juicy fruit?

[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:11.080]
You're fairy.

[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.340]
How many Q-A-M?

[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:12.580]
Hello.

[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:13.780]
Hello?

[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.760]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.260]
I see this one.

[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.040]
It's a good either.

[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.340]
Let me call you in the other one.

[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:18.940]
No, okay.

[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.220]
How about Q-A-M?

[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:20.440]
Hello.

[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.440]
How are you in there, Neil?

[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:23.020]
Okay.

[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:26.880]
Let's progress in on the George's...

[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.120]
Yeah.

[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:31.160]
The George's phony voice when Reverend Jones again for the 440th time today.

[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.460]
Just keep talking.

[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:33.340]
Just keep talking.

[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:34.680]
Just pretend you're on the air.

[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.920]
And George is this, and George, well, I tell you what they're...

[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.480]
They're as obsessed as they are with me, multiplied by $1 million.

[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.000]
And then you're getting close to how obsessed they are with you.

[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:45.020]
I mean, obsessed.

[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.140]
Very obsessed.

[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:46.980]
Woo!

[01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.480]
Heavy, heavy duty.

[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.980]
Blow up doll, posters, clothing.

[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.900]
Clothing Q-A-M, hello.

[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.200]
Neil, did anyone say a lorne be called?

[01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:55.880]
Not interested.

[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.000]
No more names for the poll.

[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:57.840]
The poll is closed.

[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.640]
I don't want to hear about any more boobies.

[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.580]
George, I already said there's no bad boobies.

[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.880]
And what's the deal with this vote?

[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:04.760]
Voting for people whose boobies no one's ever seen.

[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.460]
At least no one has any ability to vote.

[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:07.800]
It's a name.

[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:08.180]
Yeah.

[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.080]
A name, something of the day on boobies.

[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:10.620]
That's right.

[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:12.520]
Name somebody with the Tullies.

[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.320]
W-T-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:16.720]
Neil.

[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.300]
Yeah.

[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:18.400]
Hello.

[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:19.500]
Hello.

[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:20.600]
Neil.

[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:21.860]
Yeah.

[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.460]
The C-4's make you list yesterday.

[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:26.920]
What?

[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:28.840]
C-4's.

[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.600]
You've got a Trump Jr. who's on there.

[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.620]
What about Steve Jr.?

[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:36.980]
How about a poll we did five months ago?

[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.720]
You got one for that?

[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.060]
For the who?

[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.620]
Yeah, for the who?

[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:41.320]
Oh, yeah.

[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.620]
I know what it's full he's talking about.

[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.260]
Five-six-and-obvious lead singer.

[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:51.940]
Five-six-seven-oh-five-sixty-and-pond-five-sixty-and-the-varizon-and-singular wireless line.

[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.220]
W-T-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.420]
Yeah, I just want to tell you that you and George, you guys are breaking the charts once more.

[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.160]
But you guys are the best out of the idea.

[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:01.740]
I'll tell you that.

[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:02.420]
Yeah.

[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:03.880]
You guys make my day.

[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:10.860]
And that was my, that was my, uh, uh, uh, GPS talking it back down before.

[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.340]
Five-six-and-the-varizon-and-singular wireless line.

[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.640]
Oh, man.

[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:20.560]
Woo!

[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.820]
Is it too late to get on that space shuttle?

[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:31.540]
The best out of the few largest sports radio five-sixty-Q-A-M.

[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.280]
They're four-th-later.

[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:39.240]
Mystic Jamie, I'd like to relax by having Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour movie.

[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.620]
Hey, hello again.

[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.420]
I'm McKenna Fishnoke.

[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:47.180]
And now we finally present a very special episode out.

[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:49.300]
Rost a piece theater.

[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:58.300]
In this story, we take Margaret Mitchell's classic tale of the old South and transported to a Caribbean review.

[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:02.780]
It's a three-part series entitled, Gunga with the Wind.

[01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:15.520]
As we join episode one, Mum, our hero, a very aromatic Rost aferian named Reggae Jackson, is forced to choose between playing in a Jamaican steel drum band,

[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:19.800]
or, regrettably, spending another year on the bench of the California Angels.

[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.860]
Well, Mum, quite a dilemma for our Nobian friend, eh?

[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:26.040]
He with a woopy goldberg hair?

[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:34.220]
So won't you slice a mango and join us for Gunga with the Wind on Rost aferian theater?

[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.680]
I'm the White Devil, me cabbage to snow.

[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:42.380]
Okay, 12-1-5-60-WQ-A-M. Only an hour and fifty-and-a minutes to go.

[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.320]
What do you assume if I choke to that?

[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.340]
By the way, before I forget.

[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:48.060]
Yes?

[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.880]
And that reminded me of another one, an all-time favorite.

[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:51.360]
Yeah.

[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:52.360]
The Bummer Theater?

[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.480]
Oh, right now I'm not going to find that.

[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.500]
I don't know, I'm sure you do.

[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:56.000]
I'm on my theater.

[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.000]
I'll look it up if you want.

[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:57.720]
Is that good?

[01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.220]
I'll go right ahead.

[01:28:59.560 --> 01:28:59.700]
All right.

[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.260]
Now, if you got the discs there, do I have to...

[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.840]
I have the discs here and also the book, the index book.

[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.580]
So either way out.

[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.000]
I don't have any one to slice it.

[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:07.620]
No, do I want it.

[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:08.320]
I don't want it.

[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:09.920]
Too much work.

[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:11.400]
Bummer Theater?

[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.540]
There, oh, I got it.

[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.000]
I got it.

[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:14.660]
I got it.

[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.220]
But for what it's worth, they have the index on PDF now.

[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:18.100]
I don't care if you're on it.

[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:18.820]
I got it.

[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.560]
See how they need that.

[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.400]
What are there?

[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:22.620]
About 6,000 of these discs?

[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.560]
Yeah, I just...

[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.260]
It's my lucky day.

[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:25.600]
It's Friday the 13th I told you.

[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.800]
I got to go to Woodbine right now.

[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:28.240]
Find me a good machine month.

[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.180]
This is amazing shocking.

[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.000]
Hollywood's greatest movies take an unexpected turn for the worst.

[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:37.980]
All this week on Bummer Theater.

[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.700]
Monday night, it's Mary Boppen.

[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.020]
Mary Boppen!

[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:42.820]

[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.520]
Oh, Mary!

[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:45.820]
Mary Boppen!

[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.760]
Mary Boppen!

[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:46.780]

[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:46.780]

[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:46.780]

[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.240]
Mary Boppen!

[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.260]
You are enjoying me on the dark side.

[01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:56.140]
Hmm.

[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.040]
Okay.

[01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:01.240]
On Wednesday, it's Lassie as you've never seen her before.

[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:01.940]
Look, Mom!

[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.320]
Mom, it's Lassie!

[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.380]
She's come on!

[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.900]
Here is the hide its Bummer Theater's version of The Wizard of Oz.

[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.420]
There's no place like home.

[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:12.400]
Hey!

[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:13.740]
Nothing's happening!

[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:16.220]
Of course, not your little twig!

[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.880]
They're just shoes!

[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:21.700]
And Friday, usher in the holiday season,

[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:23.920]
with Miracle on 34th Street.

[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.300]
I am Santa Claus!

[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:25.980]
Yeah, yeah!

[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.540]
I am! I tell you!

[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:30.060]
I'm sure Poppin' I'm reenergized up bunny.

[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.200]
Now, how's the butter little shock there?

[01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:34.040]
It'd be the light up Santa's nose.

[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:34.940]
How here we go!

[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:38.120]
You'll have.

[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.780]
I know you won't.

[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.460]
When you tune in this week too,

[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.040]
Bummer Theater!

[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:44.140]
How do you like that?

[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.280]
I'll ask you to join George.

[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:46.040]
Thank you.

[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.020]
Then do it for you?

[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:47.780]
Yeah, you can leave now.

[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.100]
See ya.

[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.520]
Long shot!

[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:53.980]
I'm just going to scan these real quickly,

[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:56.460]
because we got so many great calls going to be coming in these last two hours.

[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.300]
To say, hey, have a great summer schedule, Neil.

[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:01.860]
Have a great limited work, whatever.

[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:03.640]
And a great vacation and whatever else you do.

[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.500]
And just make up all kinds of stuff in your heads.

[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.180]
Oh, Neil's a doin' Poco!

[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.880]
You know, oh, yeah.

[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:10.220]
Sure.

[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.680]
All these people in La La land in a dream world.

[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.440]
It's really scary.

[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.740]
And then you wonder how these people go off and wind up

[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.420]
killing a whole bunch of people or just going ballistic?

[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:22.520]
No.

[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.160]
That's not that difficult for me to understand,

[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:28.000]
because there's just a lot of people out there with way, way too much time in their hands

[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.580]
and way too little life to fill that time.

[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:31.040]
You know what I mean?

[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:31.500]
Oh, yeah.

[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:33.460]
Like with me,

[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:37.380]
two o'clock, I already have my shirt on right now.

[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:41.220]
And by two o'clock, I'll have my pantaloonies on and my shoes.

[01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:41.780]
Right.

[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.680]
And I'll be out the door.

[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:45.480]
I'll be in at my two-o-two.

[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.300]
I'll be in the vet.

[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:49.500]
I'll be driving through the parking garage on the way out.

[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:55.060]
By two-ten, maybe two-twelve, I'll be on the Gardner Expressway,

[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:58.800]
headed toward 427, headed toward 27, headed toward Woodbuy.

[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.880]
I mean, oh, so that's not for everybody, but I'm just sayin' I got stuff to do.

[01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:05.600]
You know what I'm sayin'?

[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.280]
I got machines to play and money to win.

[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:10.940]
You see what I'm sayin'?

[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:11.360]
I don't know.

[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:12.780]
You don't have to tell me.

[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:17.080]
But a lot of these people, oh, I have no life.

[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:20.080]
Yeah, see, to them, it's their life, to us, it's our job.

[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.100]
What, this?

[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:21.560]
This.

[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:22.460]
This?

[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:23.620]
This, it's this.

[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:25.200]
Oh, my, I just want my life, right?

[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:25.860]
I know.

[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.620]
Long shot White House hopeful Ron Paul formally abandoned his campaign

[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.700]
for the Republican presidential nomination yesterday,

[01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.440]
allowing to remain on the political scene,

[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.320]
at least on the internet.

[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.040]
He was gonna have like a separate convention,

[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.160]
but then again, everybody told him, hey, you're an idiot.

[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:41.000]
And they, oh, gee, well, just you're right.

[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:44.960]
And Democrats in the House yesterday scuttled the proposal

[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.440]
by Dennis Cassini as an activity to impeach President Bush

[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.540]
on a wide range of charges,

[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.160]
including line-to-the-American public

[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.600]
about weapons and mass destruction in Iraq,

[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.980]
torturing war captors, and misleading Congress

[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:55.420]
in an attempt to destroy Medicare.

[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:56.360]
All of these things.

[01:32:56.740 --> 01:33:00.700]
By 251 to 166 vote, the House sent a 35-count articles

[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:02.280]
of impeachment to the Judiciary Committee,

[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.080]
which will let it die without further action.

[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.240]
While the vote technically forces the measure

[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.360]
of the Committee for consideration,

[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.340]
it also means the full House will avoid having

[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.620]
to debate and vote on impeaching the 43rd President,

[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.680]
like I told you, and that guy, oh, but he's good,

[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.080]
so I'm on the record, they have to have a vote, blah, blah, blah.

[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:16.340]
Yeah.

[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.380]
Sure, whatever you say, just, yeah, go.

[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.120]
Don't confuse these people with the facts.

[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.700]
They want to live in a world as they would like it to be, okay?

[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.900]
And there's nothing wrong with that, except it's just fantasy.

[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.060]
If you want to live in a fantasy world, go right ahead.

[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:31.880]
Like we are here at QAAM.

[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:32.460]
That's right.

[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.040]
To weigh in, hello.

[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.260]
Hey, Neil.

[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.020]
Yes, sir.

[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.040]
I got one for your poll.

[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:36.980]
Too bad.

[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.020]
We're not building the poll.

[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.580]
There are no more boobies going on the poll, okay?

[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:43.700]
Do you understand?

[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:46.220]
Which word didn't you understand yet?

[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.680]
We've already got 4,000 names on there.

[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:54.120]
Every well-known and some marginally known Hollywood kind of person

[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.420]
with boobies, okay?

[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.780]
Even more I carry who's only got one big gigantic one.

[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.960]
And because it's so big, George thinks it's a pair.

[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.100]
She does have a big gigantic breast,

[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:05.400]
and another one just like it right now.

[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.200]
Well, there you go.

[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.640]
So she's got two gigantic breasts.

[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:08.780]
Only one must be on her back.

[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:10.380]
Let's compete.

[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:10.900]
Let's compete.

[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:12.380]
Maybe under her armpits.

[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.780]
Pop has got a squeeze box.

[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:16.580]
Yeah.

[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:18.420]
And Mama's got squeeze boobies.

[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:21.620]
WDQAAM, hello.

[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:22.940]
Hey.

[01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:23.640]
Yeah.

[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:27.240]
I think the bit that you were looking for about the squeeze box

[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:29.480]
was called Mama's Got a Squeeze Box.

[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:29.800]
No.

[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:30.380]
No.

[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.780]
Mama's got a squeeze box.

[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:33.800]
And that again, right?

[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:34.120]
Yeah.

[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:34.960]
Let me say it again.

[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:35.320]
No.

[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:37.060]
No?

[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.060]
No.

[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.260]
He's got it confused with the real song.

[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.880]
We're looking for a comedy bit.

[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.680]
We're looking for a pit in our DCS here, okay?

[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:46.500]
Sir, wish you have no idea what we're talking about.

[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.020]
He's trying to be very helpful, though, okay?

[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:48.860]
But he's just dumb.

[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:50.560]
We have squeeze box by the hood.

[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.640]
That's not what we're looking for.

[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:51.980]
No.

[01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:56.540]
We're looking for a squeeze box.

[01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.180]
And what do you mean?

[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.700]
I'm telling you a box is I like to squeeze, believe me.

[01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:05.680]
There isn't a day that goes by a woodbind that I don't see.

[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:06.980]
In fact, a lot of people have worked there.

[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:07.860]
My God.

[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:08.400]
Oh.

[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:09.620]
Oh.

[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:10.160]

[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:10.320]
Oh.

[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:10.320]

[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:10.640]

[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:10.980]
Oh.

[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:11.020]
Oh.

[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:11.180]

[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:11.520]
Oh.

[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:11.520]

[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:11.520]

[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:11.780]

[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:11.840]

[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:13.460]
Oh.

[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:13.560]
Oh.

[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:14.100]

[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:14.100]

[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:15.260]

[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:16.640]
Oh.

[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:22.140]
Oh.

[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:22.320]
I don't know.

[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.000]
I don't know.

[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.020]
A lot of these young people are like early 20s.

[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:29.440]
Maybe they're companies that they work for a sudden here like, you know what I mean?

[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:30.000]
And pay the rent?

[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:31.640]
Yeah.

[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:32.780]
That's what I've been told.

[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.100]
I don't know if that's true or not.

[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.700]
Because I don't know about a lot of young punks going to afford to live in this building.

[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:37.800]
But thank God they're here.

[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:39.060]
I mean, just to look at.

[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:42.880]
Although sometimes the elevator all alone, you know, you think, oh, who's going to know?

[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.920]
Who's going to know they got a knuckle sandwich?

[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:46.780]
Right.

[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:50.340]
You just can't grant people just because they look good and say, oh, can I, uh,

[01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:53.060]
I didn't allow it a little bit for a couple of hours.

[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.160]
A couple of weeks.

[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.560]
We've got a squeeze in to see if they were fresh.

[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.000]
Oh, yeah.

[01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.700]
WQAM, hello.

[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.320]
Hey, can George Pomo with him and Lucy are going to be doing all summer long, please?

[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:05.620]
WQAM, hello.

[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.300]
Papa's got a squeeze box.

[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.300]
WQAM, hello.

[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:16.280]
The two in and out over the last couple of days, he had been talking about this squeeze box.

[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.080]
Is that code for something?

[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:18.760]
Yeah.

[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:20.420]
What does that mean?

[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:21.100]
What is that?

[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:21.480]
A little bag.

[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.160]
Yeah, it means, uh, that's what it means.

[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5 is that code.

[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.000]
Yeah, oh, yeah, all the bags we speak in code.

[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:29.880]
You know, that's what I do.

[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:32.220]
Always out in the code, especially in the winter time.

[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:32.700]

[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:33.440]
More code.

[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:34.840]
Like, uh, Larry, what's his name?

[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:35.500]
Uh-huh.

[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.340]
Tapping it out.

[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.220]
Yeah.

[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.100]
Larry, who?

[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.380]
Oh, Larry, uh, what's the Craig?

[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:42.720]
Craig.

[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:42.960]

[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.420]
Oh, the towtapper.

[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:44.700]
Right.

[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:45.620]
That was more code.

[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:47.240]
Because you know, that's his code.

[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:47.640]
Mm-hmm.

[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:48.740]
He's got a squeeze box.

[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.620]
And there's toilet paper in it.

[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.040]
Yoko Oner's one to pull hands down your pants anyway.

[01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:56.380]
So just like she did the first time.

[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.060]
I mean, she is just so me, I mean, nasty.

[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:02.200]
Unbelievably nasty.

[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.980]
So maybe John Lennon saw something in her that didn't meet the eye, you know?

[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.320]
He, uh, he liked her tood.

[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:10.600]
He liked her toods?

[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:11.120]
Yeah.

[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:12.260]
I see.

[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:12.900]
Additus.

[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:14.760]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.180]
Now, what just happened?

[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:19.940]
Or did you see that?

[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:22.020]
I heard it a Q-A-M-Haw.

[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.020]
That's not strong.

[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:26.220]
Ah, WDQ-YM, hola.

[01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.740]
Yeah, Neal, would you be my bull bee?

[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:32.480]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.900]
Are you the great one?

[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:36.960]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:37.620]
The late one.

[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:38.780]
Not the great one.

[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.140]
We're all praying this weekend.

[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:41.280]
It's going to be the late one.

[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:43.720]
As in Dave, Dave, as in...

[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:44.860]
I'm dying over here.

[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:45.420]
Like that.

[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:47.480]
Somebody Q-A-M, hello.

[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:48.360]
Neal.

[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:49.000]
Yes.

[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:52.320]
Forget the squeeze box played at Hershey Candy Bar, son.

[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:53.820]
There you go.

[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:54.500]
Let's do that.

[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.000]
How did I before you go off here?

[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:56.840]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.620]
What was that song called?

[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:03.340]
Candy Bar?

[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:04.880]
The other Candy Rapper song.

[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:06.100]
Candy Rapper, that's what it's called.

[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:07.280]
He even remembers the right name.

[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:07.540]

[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.160]
I don't know what Hershey's, okay?

[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.600]
Hershey's is Erzatz.

[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.480]
People will think that Hershey's...

[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:15.480]
Although they do have that almonds and toffee.

[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:16.320]
That's...

[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:16.840]
Yeah.

[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:17.920]
That's special.

[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:18.600]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:19.540]
It's rich.

[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:20.340]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.180]
But boy, you think that's real candy?

[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.260]
This is a problem with people who haven't traveled very much.

[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.660]
I'll say that I do like Ethel Ems.

[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:30.300]
Mm-hmm.

[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.020]
Oh my god.

[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:32.840]
Do I like Ethel Ems?

[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.320]
Don't get me started with the candy now, because what I'll do is...

[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.900]
That guy, that guy's fault.

[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.280]
Yeah, it was the color of the Hershey.

[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:39.560]
Yeah.

[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.120]
He's got Hershey in the rectum.

[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:43.800]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:45.560]
You're a bubbler of clean abuse.

[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.600]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.920]
Q-A-M, yes.

[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:51.900]
Hey, how are you?

[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:52.460]
Good.

[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:58.280]
I've been at the airport take a little issue there with George when he says...

[01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.800]
This thing is a bad movie.

[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:00.800]
Mm-hmm.

[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:03.100]
I was...

[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:05.600]
No, that sounds like to me it's a massive desperation to me.

[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.660]
I just can't even begin to imagine that.

[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.020]
Some saggy, or...

[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:11.540]
There's a lot of women that can't help their boobs go...

[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.920]
You know, they don't need to feel bad about that.

[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.100]
I was a maid on a selling yacht.

[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.020]
I was a Charlie yacht.

[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:23.260]
And we had a couple of Charlie guests on and the ladies decided to go, you know, talk with...

[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:24.820]
And one of them...

[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:29.000]
She had boobs that looked like a couple of trim socks, smooth with sand.

[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:30.840]
All right.

[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.120]
I've seen those.

[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:32.780]
Yeah.

[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:33.980]
They were a lot of people.

[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.200]
But other than the new children, they were so hot by whatever they were, and...

[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:39.800]
In closing, Kakamoon.

[01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:40.680]
Okay.

[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:41.980]
Well said, sir.

[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:42.800]
He covered all the bases.

[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:43.760]
Kakamoon.

[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:53.160]
From it is afternoon at 5.60 grams of Kakamoon, 12 minutes after noon, in June, on L-13, the Friday the 13th.

[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.780]
Well, still...

[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.740]
May I have your attention, please?

[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.880]
May I have your attention, please?

[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.860]
Will the real-grank-granny please stand up?

[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:07.160]
I repeat.

[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.500]
Will the real-grank-granny please stand up?

[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.280]
We're gonna have to find here.

[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:14.600]
You're lacking like you never see a white dwarf before.

[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.180]
There's all the same floor with the three sisters separated by a bathroom floor.

[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:20.960]
And a bathroom with tile floor and soap water with the soap.

[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.440]
Sleeping in bunk beds, sitting on bunk beds.

[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.100]
He's too quick, something in the hood.

[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:25.920]
Oh, great.

[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:27.580]
Didn't just say the end word.

[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:28.580]
Of course I did.

[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.120]
Did he eat just a kid?

[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:32.240]
Little Peter Durage, he hit the high note.

[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.360]
The song I changed.

[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:33.900]
Great, great.

[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:34.780]
Y'all sick of me.

[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:35.600]
You all sick of me.

[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:37.480]
Would you rather have a watching family?

[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:38.820]
Then he would address me.

[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.440]
He's a little sick.

[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.700]
The kid don't play his guitar.

[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.220]
He's a little sick.

[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:42.220]

[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:42.520]
He's a little sick.

[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.780]
I also like to take a deep bite and serve my food.

[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.020]
He sometimes opens a junkage and just goes, but I can't because she's my sister.

[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:49.360]
And I'm a girl, so the...

[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.300]
This family is sick.

[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:51.420]
This family is sick.

[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:53.640]
No kid may have people with this little man you met.

[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.160]
My dad designs a house with three adults and six kids.

[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.360]
We'll only one bathroom for all of us to feed.

[01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:00.780]
I was only half the one who ruined what she'll live in.

[01:41:00.980 --> 01:41:03.860]
I like extra the kitchen, but I guess I'm only bitching cause my dad was finnish.

[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.980]
You know, little Cindy with a little licks make my eyes pop shaking into it.

[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.780]
Why can't you start saying, Monster, Monster, Monster, like a victim?

[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:12.140]
And if I wanna get to the dentist, who would take the fix?

[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:14.900]
I'm about to throw football hard and hit monsters nose.

[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.020]
I'm so mad, I'm like, oh I got it, I'm old.

[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:17.840]
So, he's great, great.

[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.000]
He gets up with a real beat.

[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.620]
He drinks over the other piece of dirt.

[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:21.380]
He's a bunch of things.

[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.620]
So, what's the real great, great, great, please stand up.

[01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:24.780]
Please stand up.

[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.020]
Please stand up.

[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:39.840]
Oh yeah, Monster, there's no playing ball in the heads house.

[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.960]
Monster, you look fine.

[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.180]
Come on, I teed at five sixty, but that was one of the worst shows in the history of television.

[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:50.700]
And they made movies about it and they brought it back four hundred times.

[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.980]
And the movies were actually funnier than the show.

[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:53.680]
We're doing.

[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:54.740]
Oh yeah, I didn't say much.

[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.000]
Oh, you'd get a kick out.

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.000]

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.000]

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.000]

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.000]

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.000]

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.000]

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.000]

[01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:59.000]
And they're making fun of the show in the movies.

[01:41:59.000 --> 01:41:59.820]
Good, part of the comment.

[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:00.400]
And well deserved.

[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.960]
I mean, besides Florence Henderson and her western oil, what was the deal with him?

[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:10.820]
There's a story about a man named Brady, who's, by the way, and also good.

[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:15.560]
Gorbidol, forgot it's dead, he's still writing pretty good.

[01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:16.920]
You know, I remember that guy a few weeks ago.

[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:19.980]
Oh yeah, dead, Gorbidol, he had a big ceremony and said,

[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:26.260]
Badricks Cathedral, he got Gorbidol mixed up with Norman Mailer, an active just in Lunacy.

[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.880]
Gorbidol's articles of impeachment on common dreams and truth dig dot com.

[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:36.460]
He says on June 9, 2008, a counter revolution began on the four of the House of Representatives

[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:40.320]
against the gas and oil crooks who had seized control of the federal government.

[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.280]
This counter revolution began in the exact place which had slumbered during the all-out of salt on their liberties

[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.820]
and the Constitution itself.

[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:51.940]
I wish to draw the attention of the blog world to represent of Dennis Cacinnan's articles of impeachment

[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:57.340]
presented to the House in order that two faithless public servants be removed from office for crimes against the American people.

[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.200]
As I listened to representative Cacinnan's invoke the great ancient of impeachment,

[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:04.420]
he listed some 35 crimes by these two faithless officials.

[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:05.820]
We heard like great bells tolling.

[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:11.100]
The voice of the Constitution itself speak out ringingly against those who had tried to destroy it.

[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.320]
Although this is the most important motion made in Congress in the 21st century,

[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:22.220]
it was also the most significant plea for a restoration of the republic which had been swept to one side by the mechanics of a president fed on great crime.

[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:28.020]
And as I listened with autocrosinage, I realized that no newspaper in the U.S., no broadcaster cable network,

[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:33.380]
would pay much notice to the fact that a highly respected member of Congress was acting for the president of vice president to be tried

[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:37.400]
for crimes which were carefully listed by Cacinnanage and his articles requesting impeachment.

[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:42.020]
But then I've known for a long time at the media of the U.S. and too many of its elected officials,

[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:49.400]
he had not a flying F for the welfare of this republic, and so I turn his off and do to the foreign press for a clear report of what's been going on in the Congress.

[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:54.940]
We all know how the self-described war hero Mr. John McCain likes to snigger at France,

[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:58.280]
while the notion that he's a hero of any kind is what we should be sniggering at.

[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:03.900]
It is Laman de France newspaper that told the story the next day hardly touched by the New York Times in the Washington Post,

[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:07.200]
or the Wall Street Journal, in fact by any other major American media outlet.

[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:14.100]
As for TV, well there wasn't much. You see, we do not be divisive because it upsets our masters in order to know that this is a perfect country,

[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:19.420]
and the fact that so many in it don't like it means that they've been terribly spoiled by the greatest healthcare service on earth,

[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:24.240]
the greatest justice system, the greatest number of occupied prisons, two and a half million Americans are prisoners,

[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.580]
but a great tribute to our penal passions.

[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:37.140]
Naturally, I don't want to sound hard, but let me point out that even a banana Republican would be distressed to discover how much of our nation's treasure has been siphoned off by our vice president.

[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:42.720]
In the interest of his co-senorster company, Halliburton, the lawless gang of mercenaries had loose by his administration in the Middle East.

[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:49.040]
But there it was on the first page of Laman de, the House of Representatives, which was intended to be the Democratic Chamber,

[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:55.100]
and last was alert to its function. And the bravest of its members said that emotion the articles of impeachment of the most dangerous president in our history,

[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:01.040]
represented Chris Inch listed some thirty odd articles describing impeachable offenses committed by the president and vice president,

[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.320]
neither whom had ever been the clear choice of our sleeping polity for any office.

[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:11.860]
Several some months ago, Chris Inch had made the case against Dick Taney. Now he had the principal male factor in his V1 of the title,

[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:17.740]
articles of impeachment for President George W. Bush, resolved that the president be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors,

[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:20.580]
and that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the U.S. Senate.

[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:25.780]
The purpose of the resolve is that he be duly tried by the Senate and found guilty, be removed from office.

[01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:34.440]
At this point, Representative Chris Inch presented his thirty-five articles detailing various high crimes and misdemeanors for which removal from office was demanded by the framers of the Constitution.

[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:43.360]
On Wednesday, the House voted 251 to 166, the Senate Representative Chris Inch's articles of impeachment to a committee which won't get the matter before Bush leaves office,

[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.080]
a strategy that's often used to kill a distillation as the associate press noted later that day.

[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:57.760]
Dorothy Johnson sends me an email here about erectile dysfunction and you really bothered with the Canadian pharmacy, eh?

[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:06.580]
Well Dorothy, take a walk Dorothy and take a big leaf eh? I get, I just, they never ends.

[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:13.040]
Look, this pharmacy and that pharmacy and this limpa thing and this limpa one over here, it's just, it's just amazing, it doesn't stop.

[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:18.500]
It's the curse of the Internet's which goes to sure that even Al Gore isn't perfect.

[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:23.880]
Which female celebrity has the ugliest breasts that are pulled question 322?

[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:30.300]
Now we could have put like another thousand names on there because once we got started with this, that they want to do the pull building yet.

[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:31.980]
Are you going to be doing that this summer, the pull building?

[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.600]
Oh, only one of desperate.

[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:35.700]
Someday?

[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:36.280]
Yes.

[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:49.380]
Yoko Ono 84, the ugliest breasts nasty, saggy, gross, Sarah Bernhard 34, 35, Terri 27, Pamela Anderson 25.

[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:57.560]
She is a skank, she's Canadian by the way.

[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.160]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:59.340]
And we're not too proud of it.

[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:00.120]
You can have her.

[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:13.420]
Debra Messing 20, Gwyneth Paltrow 15, Laura Lynn Boyle 14, Courtney Love 11, Annan Nicole Smith 11, Harbor Streisand 10, Crossed Eyes and Cross Boobies and Crossed Legs.

[01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:16.080]
How did what's his name ever married her? I just don't understand that.

[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.740]
James Brolin, isn't that who married her?

[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.840]
Yeah, she's got a lot of money and he's a man-whoer.

[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:20.400]
That's my guess.

[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:21.320]
Oh.

[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:30.000]
Mariah Carey 7, Goldie Han 7, Sigorni Weaver 6, Whitney Houston 6, Tina Turner 5, Cheryl Crow 4, Glenn Close 4.

[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:31.740]
I don't like her at all.

[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.040]
At all.

[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:34.220]
Is there a reason for that?

[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:34.920]
She's ugly.

[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.600]
And she always plays a psychotic bitch like that.

[01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:39.900]
And they're always making her out to be a good-looking person, you know.

[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:40.800]
Glenn Close?

[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:41.340]
Yeah.

[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:49.360]
She's always in these roles where she's supposed to be pretty, you know, that's the character, but, you know, that she's not.

[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.980]
But she's not, so you're not buying it.

[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.460]
Very miscannased all the time.

[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.340]
Adrian Barbow, a three in the Jeff is pretty peeled about that still.

[01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:58.560]
Renee Zellberger, three, Irene Cara, three.

[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.160]
Penelope Cruz, three.

[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:01.840]
Terry Hatcher's got three.

[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:04.760]
Kate Winslet's got a pair and four, you don't want to see him.

[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.660]
Dolores O'Reaarden, two.

[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:08.060]
Mini Driver, two.

[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:09.820]
Ferra Fawcett, two Meg Ryan, two.

[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:13.020]
Jennifer Kamey's got a pair in the rain of dancing while she's got two votes.

[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:16.760]
And we are just wild with anger over that.

[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:17.800]
Seathing.

[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.440]
Wonderful for Kathy Bates.

[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:29.680]
Kathy Bates, Mira Servina, Chaung Young, Gina Davis, and Susan Day, and no votes for Jerry Hallowell or Drew Barrymore.

[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.080]
Or Drew Barrymore should have been on it list about the nepotism like that.

[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.140]
The biggest name.

[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.220]
The best talent.

[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:39.940]
This is your last sport at your 5.62 AM.

[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.760]
The fourth leader.

[01:48:42.060 --> 01:48:44.760]
It's Fattwa Friday, you bastard.

[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.680]
Tonight on the Movie of the Week.

[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:51.400]
Just another day in Small Town, America.

[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:52.260]
O'Beat?

[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:54.440]
I've got fresh cherry pie.

[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:57.420]
I left it to cool on the window, Ledge.

[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.920]
Then it happened.

[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:00.380]
Oh, it's gone.

[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.080]
Something snapped in the old girl's brain.

[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.400]
What kind of scum would do this?

[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:09.980]
The cheese killer bee.

[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:11.880]
Hi Mary Bates.

[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.160]
Why gover?

[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.440]
Is that a cherry stain on your cover all?

[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:15.720]
Help.

[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.800]
Just fill in our train's nation, please.

[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.560]
She's a cold-blooded killer.

[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:23.020]
In sensible shoes.

[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.460]
She's killer bee.

[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.220]
Now, Floyd, I've got to ask you one question.

[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.680]
Did you cut my pie into six pieces or only five?

[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.220]
Hi, okay.

[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:36.480]
Miss Me Be.

[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:38.300]
Miss Me Be.

[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:39.440]
Oh.

[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.120]
Matter the nohorn.

[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:43.460]
He will matter beneath the hand-head.

[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.940]
Now I think we got to place rounded.

[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:50.240]
That's right, I got my bullet too.

[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:52.640]
Are you coming out of there with your hands up here?

[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:53.620]
Did you not?

[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.260]
Your life comes.

[01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.100]
The where the killer bee.

[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.560]
She just play very beautiful.

[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.480]
Don't miss Killer Bee.

[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.460]
Right after Charles Manson in charge.

[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:06.140]
Tonight on the Movie of the Week.

[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:07.740]
Oh, he's ill in by the way.

[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.620]
I didn't print the story out because who really cares?

[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.780]
Charles Manson, he's ill in.

[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:11.480]
Oh no.

[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.040]
He's got a little something, something.

[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:14.220]
What will we do without it?

[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:14.940]
I don't know.

[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.080]
It's being a killer bee.

[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.020]
Trump 31 at 560 WQM.

[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:19.560]
We got let's see.

[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:20.340]
90 less one.

[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.080]
89 minutes.

[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:21.900]
Nothing I'm counting.

[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.700]
And then the summer schedule goes into effect.

[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:26.680]
Then it's in Georgia's capable hands.

[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:29.220]
Don't you feel a tremendous sense of responsibility?

[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:30.560]
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:33.460]
What does that mean?

[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:35.780]
Well, see, once upon a time when we had numbers.

[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:36.380]
Right.

[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:37.800]
And I'd pass them along to you.

[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:39.280]
Then you had a, you know, then there was some pressure.

[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:39.940]
That's right.

[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.320]
No, no, that's right.

[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:42.840]
If you're a number starts with a,

[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.460]
Who cares?

[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.640]
I'm at the top of the management side of Sid.

[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:46.440]
That's right.

[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.260]
We don't care.

[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.160]
As a matter of fact, I might secure my future by just talking sports,

[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.660]
driving the numbers down to a point two, but then they'll like it.

[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:54.700]
Oh, point.

[01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:55.540]
Oh, oh.

[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.140]
Right.

[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:58.540]
And now that we got that new Spanish language sports station.

[01:50:58.840 --> 01:50:59.860]
That's the OCR.

[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:00.800]
That's all over.

[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.860]
AM-1450.

[01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:02.900]
It's history now, baby.

[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:03.480]
We're done.

[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:08.140]
If we can just get 75,000 sports stations and divide that pie here.

[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:15.320]
How, if you take one slice of cake, for example, cake, cake, how many different,

[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:20.420]
if you, if you took a really not a knife, but like an instrument,

[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:22.520]
I'm trying to think of what kind of instrument they're cutting instrument.

[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:24.340]
Like one of those deli slices.

[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:27.160]
You know, they cut really thin.

[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:28.760]
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm thinking of.

[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:32.620]
How many slices could you make out of one piece?

[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:33.800]
I'm trying to make a cake.

[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.060]
And then that's what we're doing with the numbers.

[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.980]
We could have a radio station for each individual sports talk fan.

[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:39.860]
Right.

[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:40.940]
That would be good.

[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.220]
Yeah, we'd always eat forks in our age 20s own station.

[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:44.440]
That's already been a radio station.

[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:44.640]

[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:44.740]
Yeah.

[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.300]
I like it.

[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:47.340]
Deputy Qion, hello.

[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:48.820]
Is that a penny?

[01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:50.080]
It's a reverend.

[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:51.120]
It will be a lot of money.

[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:51.260]
Right.

[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:51.980]
The reverend.

[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:53.720]
B-U-A-U-E-U.

[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:55.720]
Deputy Qion, hello.

[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.860]
I said there's going to be a loss.

[01:51:58.340 --> 01:51:59.460]
Deputy Qion, hello.

[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:00.980]
I'm trying to get my measures.

[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:03.060]
Qion, hello.

[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:04.300]
Hey, Neil Howard is there.

[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:04.780]
Okay.

[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:08.080]
I hear you say sometimes you eat raw hot dogs.

[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:11.080]
And I'm just letting you know they have these organic,

[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:15.380]
certified organic hot dogs with no nitrates or nitrite in them.

[01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:19.060]
And that would be much better for you, especially if you're not eating them.

[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.660]
And you can get them in any of the stores.

[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:23.380]
So just keep an eye out for that.

[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:24.660]
I'll keep my eye out.

[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:24.940]
Okay.

[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.600]
And one of the things was, you know what I missed?

[01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:28.480]
They promote.

[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:30.900]
I never hear your voice like, you know,

[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:32.620]
little snippets used to do on the show.

[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.280]
You know, other people shows, you know, promoting your show.

[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:37.540]
No, they don't want to do that.

[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:40.540]
And when I miss those, because those are always like a little funny.

[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:41.640]
Yeah, but you understand this,

[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:42.880]
back when we could do funny stuff.

[01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.800]
We can't do that anymore.

[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:46.260]
So what the other we do want to show now that they're going to play on other shows.

[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:48.620]
But we still love you and listen to all of them.

[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:50.120]
Well, thank you so much.

[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:50.600]
Thank you.

[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.720]
We all of us, all right.

[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:54.400]
All of us remaining people.

[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.860]
Believe you me, it's a sad and sorry situation.

[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.080]
And you know what, I'm not going to worry about it no more.

[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.800]
I'm just, it is what it is, you know.

[01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:02.780]
Yep.

[01:53:02.940 --> 01:53:04.600]
I would have had a much more philosophical round to it.

[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:08.340]
I'm going to make it to another five and a half years with these great robbing bastards.

[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:10.960]
I just have to like, you know, like what I'm right now.

[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:12.120]
What?

[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.920]
When C. Kovsa, whatever, whatever will be, will be like Doris Day said.

[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.020]
Doris Day.

[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:21.900]
Okay, Sarah, Sarah, now what will we, was that from to be fair?

[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:23.160]
Whatever.

[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.500]
It was just a little girl.

[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:25.780]
Yeah.

[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:28.220]
After his car movie, we already looked it up.

[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:29.060]
I know, I forgot.

[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:29.820]
We'll find it worth West.

[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:30.200]
Okay.

[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:30.560]
Sure.

[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:30.940]
I don't know.

[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:31.520]
No.

[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:32.440]
Something.

[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:33.780]
WDQAM Hello.

[01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:37.060]
No, not the turds.

[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.220]
WDQAM Hello.

[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:40.020]
Hey Neil.

[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:40.660]
Yes.

[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:44.140]
I just want to thank George Bush for our gaspices.

[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:44.800]
Uh-huh.

[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.460]
Okay, you're welcome.

[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.260]
Yeah, he's a good call because I forgot to do that today.

[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:53.200]
Thank you again, Mr. President, for all the dead people in Iraq, for lying to the public

[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.040]
about this unnecessary war and all the trillions of dollars we're pushing down the toilet, for

[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:00.640]
destroying the world economy, and for those great gas prices too.

[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.220]
You bastard, you butcher, you murderer, you lunatic.

[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:06.140]
And Pete's men isn't even good enough, but nevertheless.

[01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:11.620]
The Groove and All Thing, as usual, was, you know, brilliant, but it's an exercise.

[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:13.200]
It's what we're going to do.

[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:16.800]
I better look up the financial situation right now, you think?

[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:19.820]
If it was good enough to get Rick Riley off here, it might work for me.

[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:20.800]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.920]
Fair value, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad, the bad.

[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:25.260]
What was he thinking about?

[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:26.600]
He was selling.

[01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:28.040]
You see, you're getting these, is that it?

[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:28.440]
Yeah.

[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:29.940]
Why?

[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:30.700]
Because he was in the TN.

[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:32.360]
He got a hold of a little bit of money.

[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:35.100]
Well, it was down to $134.76 of Bill.

[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.060]
He got some money?

[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:37.940]
Yeah, you remember that.

[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:38.720]
No, I don't.

[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:42.300]
When he found out how much money he was making as opposed to suds, because he would negotiate,

[01:54:42.300 --> 01:54:43.360]
you know, for gold.

[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:44.120]
He didn't even lose his money.

[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.080]
He was down to $97.97 and James thanked God.

[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:47.780]
Go ahead.

[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:48.940]
So he was getting all the money.

[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.860]
Yeah, and so he decided to go investing it, because, you know, that's what people do when

[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:54.880]
they get a lot of money sometimes.

[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:57.480]
And that took over his life.

[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:01.500]
He started doing research and reading books and things and decided to take that on the

[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:02.740]
air with him.

[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:05.100]
And then they...

[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:05.880]
You know what that would be like?

[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:10.380]
Like, making a little, loosely, no book to work with.

[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:10.960]
Yeah.

[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:15.960]
And writing down every time I pulled an example of what all the plays were in order to

[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.080]
work on it.

[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.020]
Yeah, two chickens instead of three.

[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:19.980]
Yeah.

[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.880]
I got six quick hits, baby.

[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:23.260]
Yeah.

[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.800]
I think I'm going to go take a quick hit.

[01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:28.160]
Oh, I left a letter on.

[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:30.240]
I don't think so.

[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:31.300]
I think everything is just...

[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.000]
Everything is beautiful.

[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:33.980]
And look at the way the clock is tick, tick, ticking along.

[01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:34.840]
It's a beautiful thing.

[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:37.440]
Before you know, it will be two and...

[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:38.000]
Come at you!

[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.060]
That, that, the business will be on here.

[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:41.320]
I, you know, I...

[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.700]
I'm not joking when I say this.

[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:45.920]
I don't understand what he's thinking.

[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:48.960]
Don't you?

[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:50.100]
I try to understand what I'm saying.

[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.120]
Yeah, no, I understand.

[01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.580]
I don't understand what you don't understand.

[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:53.520]
I understand it.

[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:55.280]
Can you explain it?

[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:59.280]
Have you heard the beginnings of other people's shows not necessarily on this radio station

[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:00.480]
although...

[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:04.580]
In the way that other shows begin, you know, he's trying to get some attention right

[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:05.580]
there at the beginning of the show.

[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:07.040]
That's obvious that's what he's going for.

[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.560]
Trying to get attention?

[01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:12.380]
Sure.

[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:13.400]
To what?

[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:14.480]
To himself.

[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:16.920]
WDQIN, hello.

[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.240]
Hello, for the other exit.

[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.540]
QIN, hello.

[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:22.980]
Hello.

[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:23.840]
Hello.

[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:24.740]
Here's to me.

[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:26.320]
You're having a very controversial shift.

[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:27.880]
WDQIN, hello.

[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:29.580]
Any help?

[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:30.220]
Yes.

[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:31.100]
Fire to your mother.

[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:31.940]
Okay.

[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.620]
I think we should get fat-hank and crisp on the pole.

[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:36.540]
Yeah.

[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:36.900]
Okay.

[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:37.760]
Thanks.

[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:38.800]
You're welcome.

[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.680]
That was just hysterical, wasn't it?

[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:44.040]
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.000]
I'm starting to feel like Johnny Joe.

[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:51.000]
But I'm jovial because it's again really close to one o'clock and then after that it'll come to a clock.

[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.160]
And then the balls will be in Georgia's hand for a really hot, swattering, nifty summer.

[01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:59.240]
5, 6, 7, we got a million open lines on it.

[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.480]
We haven't had one lady today.

[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:03.280]
I made that pretty yesterday and we got about three or four, remember that?

[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:03.900]
Mm-hmm.

[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:05.000]
Which is pretty unusual.

[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:06.640]
Well, look at that.

[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:09.640]
There's like little pieces of the space shuttle trailing it in the year flying around.

[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:12.200]
Looks like the toilet came loose.

[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:15.580]
And something that was in it too is floating around up there, boy.

[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.600]
First, we're messing up the planet.

[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:19.060]
Now we're messing up outer space too.

[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:20.260]
All that space debris.

[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:24.140]
Can you imagine what the universe is going to be like by the time we get done with it?

[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:24.640]
That's right.

[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:29.180]
The whole universe is going to be loaded wall to wall with-

[01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:29.760]
Right.

[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:32.220]
WDQIN, hello.

[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:33.860]
Get up and run up.

[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:36.140]
WDQIN, hello.

[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:39.040]
I wanted a lighter collar.

[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:41.360]
Yes, I did, but a real one would be nice.

[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:43.040]
A real one was real boobies.

[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.120]
Not you, sweetie.

[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.040]
What's the biggest name?

[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:48.400]
The best tower ever.

[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:51.220]
The real largest 40-5, 59-am.

[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:53.640]
The fourth leader.

[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:56.120]
Friday, you bastard.

[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:09.500]
When she once was the attorney general, you ferry.

[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:13.220]
When she was in charge, it was business as usual.

[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:15.160]
You ferry.

[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:19.960]
When she's once a woman and a limiter, that's no more.

[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:21.440]
Or maybe she is.

[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:25.700]
Well, now all of the Democrats love in her.

[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:31.240]
Ever since she said she might run from governor.

[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:37.260]
Well, the answer to us one question I'd like to ask her.

[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.740]
Why do you say, January know?

[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.640]
Why do you say, January know?

[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:47.520]
Why do you say, January know?

[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.460]
Why do you say, January know?

[01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:54.800]
Where do you got a neck of a ship you want to take control?

[01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:01.080]
1244-16-1-5-60 WDQ-Aimbo.

[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:02.820]
I'm looking at that clock more and more.

[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:03.480]
You know what I mean?

[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:05.780]
I'm looking at the phone right now.

[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:06.720]
There's not a call on it.

[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:07.980]
That is really the disgrace.

[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.980]
Here we are at the crossroads of the summertime.

[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:16.080]
I'm the Friday the 13th.

[01:59:16.140 --> 01:59:19.140]
And I'm pumping these numbers out there and I'm puking and pushing in person.

[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.540]
Ask not what your tell-cose can do for you.

[01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:24.720]
That's what I'm suggesting.

[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:25.360]
Ask not.

[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.480]
Ask what you can do for South Florida, for the universe, for mankind.

[01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.140]
By calling and giving you some bit of brilliance.

[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:36.560]
Zimfarth holiday is passing wind.

[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:38.120]
I listen to that in cue.

[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:41.720]
Not only is it not very good, but it doesn't have any heart sounds.

[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:44.740]
Net depressing?

[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:50.780]
560-560-560 on the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:51.780]
WDQ-Aimbo.

[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:51.900]
Hello.

[01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:55.400]
Q-A-M.

[01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:56.640]
Nail?

[01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:57.400]
Yes?

[01:59:57.900 --> 01:59:58.700]
Oh man, I got right on.

[01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:01.360]
Hey, Rick, I'm trying to be a real caller.

[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:05.440]
I was like, your bedtime stories that you've been reading?

[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:10.800]
Are there any about the United States not being a financial world power anymore?

[02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:13.100]
Is there...

[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:13.980]
Is that...

[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:15.160]
I'm trying to be serious.

[02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:16.220]
Yeah.

[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:17.080]
Yeah, I can tell.

[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:18.500]
No, I am.

[02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:19.300]
Okay.

[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:22.920]
Is China...

[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:23.760]
Is it that...

[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.020]
Is this that so much money now?

[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:26.340]
Is China got all of our money?

[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:26.980]
Yes, huh?

[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:31.060]
That they're considered still world power because this dollar isn't worth anything.

[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.200]
We have a world power because we have a lot of bombs.

[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:34.840]
And because we go and invade other countries.

[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:36.220]
That's right.

[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:40.240]
I've only been paying attention to the politics for like last four years.

[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:41.900]
And the bush has been messing it all up.

[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:44.280]
And it's like interesting now.

[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.040]
And the suicide inducing.

[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:49.220]
It's ridiculous.

[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:55.100]
But yeah, I guess that's what I was just kind of wondering if there's any articles that

[02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:57.660]
I'm sorry about China's money.

[02:00:58.420 --> 02:00:59.240]
God forbidding.

[02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:00.320]
And how to get some.

[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.220]
Have a great life, pal.

[02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:03.040]
All right.

[02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:04.460]
I'm going to kill myself now.

[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.760]
Okay, good luck.

[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:07.180]
Have a good job.

[02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:08.260]
Wow.

[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:09.040]
Oh, do a good job.

[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:09.820]
Don't do a half-hand job.

[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:10.440]
Don't kill yourself.

[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:11.400]
There's nothing worse than that.

[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:13.340]
Call up and try to win some cure tickets.

[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:15.140]
Oh, I'm speaking of that.

[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:16.160]
And I'm glad you reminded me.

[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:17.980]
It's the Lotto tomorrow, 22 million.

[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.100]
22 million tax free, of course, because it's candidate in 100 counties.

[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:24.980]
Huh?

[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:27.800]
You're going to play depending on how I do this afternoon.

[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:28.960]
I'm going to play a couple hundred bucks.

[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:30.540]
I'm the Lotto.

[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.760]
And if I win the 22 million, I'll send you guys a check.

[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:34.140]
You and even Chris, fat Chris.

[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:35.520]
Well, thank you very much.

[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:38.080]
Few cents.

[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.220]
About 30, man.

[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:39.700]
Few bucks.

[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:40.780]
About 30, man.

[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:43.620]
Don't tell me we got a facts.

[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:45.480]
Oh, contest thing.

[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:46.240]
We can do it right now.

[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:51.040]
WDQM welcomes the cure to the bank Atlantic Center tonight at 7 p.m.

[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:54.340]
Plenty of great seats are available at LiveNation.com.

[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:56.680]
The caller number five right now is going for free.

[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.460]
1-800-227-0560 to see the cure.

[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:01.680]
Where to get the cure.

[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:06.360]
And last guy, he wants to get the cure because he got involved in politics just at the wrong time.

[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:10.020]
Just when Bush, my student, all these neo-connanzis came in a bar.

[02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:12.240]
But he stole two elections in a row.

[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:15.000]
See, that's the real thing.

[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:18.240]
They stole two back-to-back Florida, Anohio, and the public.

[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:21.100]
You're all so paranoid.

[02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:22.460]
I'm like that.

[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:26.700]
And I'm sure they're working fever-stay right now to plan on how they're going to do it again.

[02:02:28.020 --> 02:02:29.540]
They're going to have to work a lot harder this time.

[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:30.280]
I'll guarantee you that.

[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:32.180]
WDQM, hello.

[02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:33.320]
Not there.

[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:33.860]
What is shame?

[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:34.680]
QAM, hello.

[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.360]
Hey, New York, what's up?

[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:37.420]
Good afternoon, sir.

[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:38.780]
Is George on?

[02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:40.380]
Is George on?

[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:41.520]
Yeah, I'm on fire.

[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:42.420]
He's on drugs.

[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.020]
I love George, man.

[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:46.380]
I enjoy the greatest thing the radio has, bro.

[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:47.240]
Just want to let you know.

[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:48.940]
Mama, do it!

[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:53.680]
How did we know?

[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:54.480]
Oh, yeah.

[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:55.280]
When he or is?

[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:58.220]
When you're probably a big fan.

[02:02:58.400 --> 02:02:58.940]
Probably a Mexican.

[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:01.620]
I'm not talking about his ethnic background.

[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:03.540]
I'm talking about the fact that he's a big fan of yours.

[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.700]
He says, you're the greatest things in sliced halibut.

[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:06.020]

[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.440]
Since upside down, catch up.

[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:09.480]
WDQM, hello.

[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:10.740]
He's on drugs.

[02:03:11.180 --> 02:03:11.400]
Meal?

[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:11.840]
I love you.

[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:12.080]
Yes.

[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:14.520]
How about radio officer?

[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:16.380]
Hello.

[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:17.560]
Speak to me, yeah?

[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:18.020]
Yes.

[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:20.140]
How about them cubbies?

[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:21.440]
What about them?

[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:22.800]
I swept the brave.

[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:23.540]
Who cares?

[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:24.640]
I don't care about the cubs.

[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:25.420]
I don't care about baseball.

[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:25.920]
It's boring.

[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:28.260]
Ryan Fembre is not Jewish.

[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:29.580]
Yeah, who cares?

[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:31.620]
He's circumspect, though.

[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:32.660]
He's circumspect.

[02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:33.460]
Yeah.

[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.300]
Go back to Chicago, sir.

[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:40.140]
Okay, get out of our face with your damn cubs.

[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:41.440]
I'm already went through all that grief.

[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:45.220]
Every few years, they have one of these deals.

[02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:47.360]
They wouldn't get real hot for a while, like last year.

[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:47.840]
Same thing.

[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:49.040]
Didn't they have that last year?

[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:50.080]
I think so.

[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:50.680]
Yeah.

[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.740]
And then when it comes to the last couple months of the season,

[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:53.920]
they go into a coma.

[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:55.020]
Coma.

[02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:59.820]
Where the hell is that thing about Neorodges?

[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:00.720]
Where is that?

[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:02.640]
I find it.

[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:02.640]

[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:02.640]

[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:02.640]

[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:02.640]

[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:03.520]
Did you enjoy Reynolds one?

[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:05.060]
No, the Harry Carey one.

[02:04:05.220 --> 02:04:05.420]
Oh.

[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.400]
Oh, there's this one.

[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:08.500]
I'm a cubs fan.

[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.380]
I'm a buttoned man.

[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:11.800]
And I trust you are too.

[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:13.080]
And then there's that rear.

[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:15.060]
Flushing my ass a little bit.

[02:04:16.100 --> 02:04:16.980]
Holy cow.

[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:18.540]
That's the real one.

[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:20.440]
Wow.

[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:23.920]
I can't find it.

[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:26.360]
Isn't that a shame?

[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:28.580]
But it was actually some good time to keep looking.

[02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:29.740]
It's not worth it.

[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:32.400]
The one where he says Neorodges is right to cubs suck.

[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:32.620]

[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:32.620]

[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:32.620]

[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:32.620]

[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:32.620]

[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:32.620]

[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:32.960]
And they do.

[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:34.780]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:36.520]
Hey Neorodges.

[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:38.700]
Where was that number to call into the cure tickets?

[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:39.640]
Because I missed it.

[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:40.220]
They're gone.

[02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:41.420]
They're gone now.

[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:45.540]
You think that you're still hanging out there now when we're giving away something for free like that?

[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:46.680]
I know.

[02:04:46.900 --> 02:04:49.920]
Even with our greatly diminished audience now, we still have enough people out there.

[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:50.560]
Enough free loavers.

[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:51.060]
Believe me.

[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:52.060]
Once they're gone.

[02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:53.800]
Hey, enclosing.

[02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:55.220]
Get the honor to you.

[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:57.080]
WDQYM.

[02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:57.920]
Oh, my cow.

[02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:00.100]
Neorodges is right.

[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:01.700]
The cubs suck.

[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:02.680]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:07.660]
Well, I'm almost a set of soda, but I think I'm about to hit the end of the QAM signal.

[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:09.360]
Unfortunate.

[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:11.720]
I think it's the only country music from here on in.

[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:12.340]
It's a bad.

[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:18.760]
I just wanted to say, isn't it funny how in order to be present in this country, you have to have like a big ceremony and swear your allegiance to Israel?

[02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:19.840]
Yeah.

[02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:23.700]
I mean, do we have any people over there affecting their policy?

[02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:25.600]
Like some kind of a first two Lieberman?

[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:26.360]
No.

[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:28.600]
Like a Goy Wilson or something?

[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:31.180]
No, we don't have any Goyim over there.

[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:32.080]
All right.

[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:33.360]
All the Goyim aren't here.

[02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:36.380]
Am I missing the best part of the show in the last hour when I was...

[02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:38.740]
Yes, we're saving a good stuff when you're out of listing range.

[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:39.540]
Too bad, Palli.

[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:40.520]
Thanks a lot, Ness.

[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:41.380]
Listen to any archives.

[02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:41.920]
Good luck to you.

[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:42.260]
That's right.

[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:43.220]
We were going to say all the words.

[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:44.340]
And don't go north.

[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:45.540]
Don't go up to Tampa, man.

[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:46.100]
You'll regret it.

[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:47.880]
You'll live to regret that and maybe not.

[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:50.040]
Specifically, here you're talking about Israel.

[02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:50.840]
That'll be the end.

[02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:51.540]
And you.

[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:52.000]
You.

[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.120]
How many QAM?

[02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:54.420]
Hello.

[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:57.780]
Neorodges, maybe 50% on your home war is insurance.

[02:05:57.780 --> 02:05:59.060]
You okay, queen?

[02:05:59.460 --> 02:05:59.680]
Uh-huh.

[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:00.520]
Equate?

[02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:01.160]
Yeah, okay.

[02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:01.420]
Good.

[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:03.520]
70 AF, I told her.

[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:04.280]
70 AF, fire.

[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:05.400]
Put in a bow.

[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:11.900]
5.670, 5.60, 5.60 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:13.600]
How we doing on the booby pool?

[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.680]
I'm not giving a result to all of them because it's boring.

[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:19.560]
I mean, you know, it's already a GeoCo-O, no one is even close to that bitch.

[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:20.160]
I mean, 53.

[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:21.720]
353.

[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:25.520]
We're going for 400 today on a Friday in the middle of June.

[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.300]
You have to admit, these are the door days already, right?

[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:28.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:30.860]
These are definitely the door days.

[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:34.620]
And then they have that bark in the park thing where you bring your dog to the ballpark.

[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:35.240]
You ever see that?

[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:35.720]
Yeah.

[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:36.220]
They already have.

[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.300]
I know that.

[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.180]
I was just going to say they just had a couple of weeks ago.

[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:42.260]
Bark in the park.

[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.900]
Well, they got to get something alive in there.

[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:46.640]
You know, it's certainly can't get too many people unless they're given something away.

[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:51.560]
They give away cowbells or something a couple of weeks ago and the place was packed.

[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.180]
Give away something for free, man.

[02:06:53.420 --> 02:06:53.520]
What?

[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:54.240]

[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:56.440]
All the snores are there.

[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:58.120]
Oh, they're giving away a freebie.

[02:06:58.300 --> 02:06:59.620]
They've got a bobblehead dog.

[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:02.580]
We got a David Sampson bobblehead dog.

[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:06.980]
By the way, David, we still hate you like poison, by the way, and your organization.

[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:08.840]
Let me do QAM.

[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:09.160]
Hello.

[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:12.860]
QAM.

[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:13.160]
Hello.

[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:15.760]
And now what do you call a one-legged Polish?

[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:18.060]
Let me do QAM.

[02:07:18.260 --> 02:07:18.400]
Hello.

[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:20.180]
Hello.

[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:21.460]

[02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:22.960]
Is that a Nealer?

[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:23.820]
Speaking.

[02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:25.560]
Hey, what's up, Neal?

[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:25.940]
How are you?

[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:26.960]
Okay.

[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:27.640]
How are you?

[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:29.160]
Quick question for George.

[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:31.020]
Wait a minute.

[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:32.860]
What's your favorite word Monday?

[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:34.120]
I'm going to need this on Monday.

[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.020]
Is George second size or what?

[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:36.720]
No.

[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:37.720]
Yes.

[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:39.100]
No.

[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:40.940]
No.

[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:41.400]

[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:43.580]
I'm queried.

[02:07:43.700 --> 02:07:44.040]
Mine's one.

[02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:45.000]
No, I guess he's one.

[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.380]
Why would he argue about a thing like that?

[02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:52.240]
I mean, you've already told us that and of course I find that to be one-legged devil, but nevertheless.

[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.200]
Well, whatever.

[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:54.340]
He's making the most of it.

[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:54.820]
Okay, sir.

[02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:57.220]
Whatever he's got there, he's making it the best he can.

[02:07:57.360 --> 02:07:58.140]
I've had no complaints.

[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:02.280]
They're ever on WQAM.

[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:02.600]
Hello.

[02:08:03.220 --> 02:08:03.820]
Hey, Neil.

[02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:04.660]
Yes, sir.

[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:10.200]
First, you're complaining about no calls, no calls that I call and it rings for 20 hours.

[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:10.820]
Yeah.

[02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:12.840]
Okay, well, now that you're on, let's hear your material.

[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:14.640]
Hey, I'm on myself, one man.

[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:16.680]
You have no consideration, you two bastard.

[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:17.880]
Yes, who are you?

[02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:18.700]
Joobostard.

[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:19.380]
Yeah.

[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:21.080]
Right, Tom, like for you stirring.

[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:23.540]
72 AM, hello.

[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:25.720]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:26.680]
Okay, sir.

[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:31.260]
Yeah, listen, I just want to know if you ever smell warballs, how'd you get their little legs open?

[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:32.760]
What?

[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:34.500]
Let it go.

[02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:35.740]
What would he say?

[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.020]
You don't want to know.

[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:39.900]
I couldn't understand if Dan thinks if I haven't.

[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:43.180]
If you've ever smelled mothballs, how did you get their little legs open?

[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:44.780]
It's so old from an old movie.

[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:47.040]
Oh my God.

[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.840]
Just when you think they can't get any worse material, when you think it can't possibly

[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:58.740]
get any more embarrassing, dehumanizing, degrading, pathetic, sad, tragic, I mean archaeologists

[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:00.640]
haven't found the tale that old.

[02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:03.700]
Even mothuzla would be embarrassed.

[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:06.900]
Thank God, I couldn't understand them.

[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:07.520]
Deal, God.

[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:08.880]
Really, that was one of the worst phones.

[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:11.480]
Maybe his phone is that old too, as old as a material.

[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:14.300]
From another age.

[02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:19.520]
From Mato-Sabetsky's urine.

[02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:21.200]
I don't have any idea.

[02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:22.820]
I know that means from a long time ago.

[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:27.040]
And I don't know who Mato-Sabetsky was, but that means from days long gone by.

[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:28.400]
Here's a little Yutish for you.

[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:31.340]
Not even the Jews won't know what they'll like this most of them.

[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:33.740]
It's one thing about my family, man.

[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:35.140]
They had some creative ju-talk.

[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:36.800]
Which?

[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:41.720]
Which female celebrities got the ugliest breasts, boobies?

[02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:45.220]
Yoko almost got 94, and nobody's even close.

[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:46.740]
Nobody is touching that bitch.

[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:48.880]
I need a club.

[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.920]
How much power do I have?

[02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:53.360]
I'm 40, 50, QAM.

[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.180]
And the fourth leader.

[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:56.720]
I listen very quickly.

[02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:59.060]
I like to shave my legs, arms, and buns.

[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.820]
By listening to the Neil Rogers, one in two hours.

[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:04.140]
Red Hamster.

[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.060]
Hey there, rodent lovers.

[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:09.300]
March is all you're gonna eat Weasel month at Red Hamster.

[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:11.560]
Red Hamster for the rodent.

[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:13.880]
With three tasty new rodent flatters.

[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:16.800]
There's Deep Fried Field Mice, Peel and Eat Muscrap.

[02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:19.500]
And of course our world famous hamster melts.

[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:22.620]
I'm like a bacon double cheese Weasel, please, and hold the hair.

[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.760]
And our flatters are always fresh.

[02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:26.800]
Not like those other rodent places,

[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:30.620]
because we keep them still and on the wheel, light up until they hit the fat.

[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:33.860]
Try our tasty roadside pizza.

[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.860]
Fresh from the highway to your table in minutes.

[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:37.800]
It's full.

[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:38.520]
Good.

[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:40.120]
And don't forget dessert.

[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:42.520]
We have some chocolate chip on cookie.

[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.880]
Yeah, and I will have a hot apple pie.

[02:10:45.080 --> 02:10:45.640]
I will mold.

[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:46.280]
Coming up.

[02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:49.600]
Red Hamster for the rodent lover.

[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:53.480]
Red Hamster on Main Street across from Jerbal Kid.

[02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:56.040]
One o'clock at 5.60 WDQM.

[02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:57.520]
We have one hour to go on this Friday.

[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:00.480]
And why is that significant Manishana Halalahaze?

[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:01.060]
Right.

[02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.620]
Why is this day different from any other day?

[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:04.800]
Because it's my last Friday to the middle of September.

[02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:09.160]
And we're already had the last Monday and the last Wednesday and the last supper.

[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:12.480]
I think I'm going to be in the kitchen get a raw weenie.

[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:13.300]
Just not one of that kind.

[02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:13.800]
I was giving you a song.

[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:14.160]
There you go.

[02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:15.800]
Dance about those no-night trice.

[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:16.460]
And how is it going to be?

[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:18.120]
I'm 65 years old.

[02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:19.860]
I got dyed babies and high blood pressure.

[02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:21.740]
And yet somehow I'm still here.

[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:22.400]
I'm still alive.

[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:23.120]
I feel pretty good.

[02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:24.440]
I don't have any aches and pains.

[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:25.280]
I get around.

[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:26.280]
I don't have a walker.

[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:27.840]
I don't have any oxygen tanks.

[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:28.900]
So thanks a lot.

[02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:33.960]
For being so concerned about my welfare and about how many weenies I'm chewing on raw.

[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:36.340]
I don't know why that's a revolutionary.

[02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:38.780]
I think it was Christic at all bent out of shape about that.

[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:39.120]
Aren't you?

[02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:40.520]
I never got bent out of shape.

[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:42.160]
I just said I've never had a raw weener.

[02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:43.980]
Have you had cold cuts?

[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:44.980]
Yeah.

[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:45.860]
What's the difference?

[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:48.100]
Uncooked meat.

[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:51.060]
I'm saying is I've just never had an uncooked meat.

[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:53.060]
In addition to which weeners are have been cooked.

[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:54.860]
Aren't they pre-cooked?

[02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:57.080]
Okay. I've never had a warm or how to cold-tot.

[02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.200]
Have you ever had a warm weener?

[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:02.040]
I have a cooked hot dogs, warm hot dogs, whatever.

[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:04.260]
Never had a cold one like you eat.

[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:06.320]
I'm going to go get one right now.

[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.060]
You enjoy.

[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:09.780]
I'll be back.

[02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:10.440]
All right.

[02:12:12.220 --> 02:12:13.960]
I'm right on top of the CD over here.

[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:14.520]
I can't be bothered.

[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:16.300]
Do you eat cold hot dogs?

[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:19.280]
I have when I was a child, sometimes your desperate.

[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.780]
You just grab the hot dog out of the fridge.

[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:24.220]
But it's not something that you do when you have an option.

[02:12:24.540 --> 02:12:24.800]
Exactly.

[02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:25.140]
I'm not a bad person.

[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:27.460]
If there's a microwave, there's a microwave at the very least.

[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:28.500]
All the fried is best.

[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:29.300]
Is there any kind of...

[02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:29.480]
Of course.

[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:30.320]
You fry them up.

[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:30.760]
Nice.

[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.060]
Get them all charred.

[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.160]
Of course, barbecue is best.

[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:35.340]
Or anything over.

[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:35.940]
I'm a real quick revire.

[02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:38.420]
Made to be put on a stick and, you know...

[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:39.040]
You know what I just said?

[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:39.300]
Come on.

[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:39.960]
You want your weener.

[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:41.420]
A stick, I said.

[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:42.740]
Stick it.

[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:43.820]
Stick it.

[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:44.320]
Stick it.

[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:48.260]
Isn't it possible that you could ask somebody there?

[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:50.120]
What's that it is?

[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:56.180]
I don't want to have conversations with these people about radio unless it's absolutely necessary.

[02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:56.840]
Because it's frustrating...

[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.240]
What about what does that have to do with radio?

[02:12:58.520 --> 02:12:59.120]
It gets me insulted.

[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:02.760]
You're asking about the logic of something that they're doing on the air.

[02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:03.420]
Yeah.

[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:06.300]
You want me to ask someone to make sense of something that they're doing in the air.

[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:07.540]
No, I guess what you do is...

[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:08.760]
Nothing that they do.

[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:09.520]
Nothing that they do.

[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:09.640]
Nothing that they do.

[02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:11.760]
What the hell is the purpose of that is supposed to be?

[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:12.560]
Why?

[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:13.240]
Why?

[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:14.600]
See if I started with there.

[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:15.380]
Why would I stop it?

[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.520]
It's so stupid, man.

[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:17.580]
It's just pathetic.

[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:22.460]
I'm eating my raw Schneider's Weir.

[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.540]
I'm still alive.

[02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:25.280]
I'm pretty good.

[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:25.760]
It's my lunch.

[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:29.380]
Is that okay?

[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:30.100]
A tart.

[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:31.400]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:32.820]
Most of the food I'm really blows.

[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:35.420]
I get to eat free there of course because I got my players card.

[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:37.200]
And you know what?

[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:38.580]
What?

[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:39.680]
I don't want to.

[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:40.880]
What eat free?

[02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:42.380]
They're food socks.

[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:43.960]
Wow, that's a good reason.

[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:45.320]
I mean, the officers did cafeteria.

[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:46.860]
They got the good macaroni and cheese.

[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:49.000]
And they got some pretty decent pizza.

[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.500]
But the food in their willows restaurant, man.

[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:54.420]
I wouldn't feed it to Tiny, even at this point.

[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:56.000]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:58.160]
Hello.

[02:13:58.580 --> 02:13:59.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:00.640]
Does it feel?

[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:01.940]
Sounds like me, yeah.

[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:04.700]
I used to make hot dogs in a factory.

[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:06.760]
And Bologna.

[02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:09.760]
It's the exact same thing with just a little bit different spices.

[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:10.680]
There you go.

[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:12.200]
That's all it is.

[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:15.020]
Well, I'm eating them chewing on a raw weiner right now.

[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:15.720]
Oh.

[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:16.760]
It's good.

[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.640]
Hey, have a nice day, Casey.

[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:19.340]
Thanks.

[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:21.000]
See, there you go.

[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:21.380]
Yeah.

[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.560]
There's some more experience.

[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:23.840]
I haven't had Bologna in years.

[02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:26.620]
I've had your crisis out of plenty of Bologna.

[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:27.060]
Nope.

[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:27.940]
No?

[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:28.480]
Why not?

[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:31.900]
I think the whole time I've liked Bologna is when I've fried it.

[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:34.380]
I don't know.

[02:14:35.180 --> 02:14:35.860]
Fried Bologna?

[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:36.540]
Fried Bologna?

[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:36.860]
Sure.

[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:41.100]
Yeah, you know, you drop it in the pan and heat it up.

[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:42.380]
It makes it less bad.

[02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:44.560]
I want it to go so far as to say it's good.

[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:45.840]
It makes it less bad.

[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:46.180]
Correct.

[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:47.300]
Get out of here.

[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:48.560]
Are you guys knocking Bologna?

[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:48.980]
Yeah.

[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:51.900]
Now, what about that sandwich loaf that's got like the little,

[02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:53.040]
little, little, little cheese in it?

[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:53.440]
Oh, the whole cheese in it.

[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:54.900]
The whole cheese in it.

[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:55.300]
The whole cheese.

[02:14:56.600 --> 02:14:56.960]
Whatever.

[02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:57.660]
Not for me.

[02:14:58.380 --> 02:14:59.040]
You can have mine.

[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:00.040]
Okay.

[02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:04.660]
Oh, I'll find a way to plant shooting in North Carolina.

[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:05.420]
It's available.

[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:07.020]
Wow.

[02:15:07.660 --> 02:15:08.220]
Yeah, no worry.

[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:08.660]
North Carolina.

[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:09.900]
Right up the road from Georgia side.

[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:10.580]
No, we're near me.

[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:11.840]
You know how I know that?

[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:12.560]
Why?

[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.320]
Because nothing is anywhere near me.

[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:14.720]
Good.

[02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:16.060]
WQA in, hello.

[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:17.400]
You?

[02:15:17.980 --> 02:15:18.380]
Yes?

[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:20.780]
This is Paco, I'm sorry.

[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:21.980]
Can't hear you, can't hear you.

[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:23.200]
This is just as well, I'm sure.

[02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:27.400]
Baga, baga, baga, baga, baga, baga, baga, baga.

[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:30.940]
It's always a good idea to talk into the thing with the holes in it, you know,

[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:34.860]
that phone or,

[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.740]
welcome WQA in line nine, hello.

[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:38.780]
I see the job.

[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:41.620]
WQA in, hello.

[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:43.320]
Wheel.

[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:44.000]
Yes.

[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:45.760]
Hi, how are you?

[02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:46.580]
I'm good.

[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:47.220]
How are you, sir?

[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:49.060]
Good, good, thank you.

[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:51.860]
I, uh, I, uh, I could,

[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:54.600]
give a show deal just a fast, man.

[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:56.620]
I just want to have a great,

[02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:57.840]
the occasion, have a great summer.

[02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:58.500]
I love you, bro.

[02:15:58.840 --> 02:15:59.560]
Thank you so much.

[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:00.340]
Later, man.

[02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:00.940]
Bye.

[02:16:01.420 --> 02:16:02.160]
Well, there you go.

[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:03.220]
There's a real guy.

[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:04.980]
Sure.

[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:07.560]
There's a few of them out there,

[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:08.180]
a few people,

[02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:09.860]
and then we got a bunch of people.

[02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:10.200]
You are a bar.

[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:10.480]
Right.

[02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:11.100]
What?

[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:11.800]
Few and far.

[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:12.540]
Come on.

[02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:15.260]
Be more positive starting Monday.

[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:15.940]
I'm positive.

[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:16.600]
Begin calls.

[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:19.380]
You're not going to be sitting there reading bedtime stories.

[02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:20.000]
Nope.

[02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:21.380]
And you're supposed to be.

[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:22.540]
I hardly read any, right?

[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:25.400]
I had to go over it all in column and I had a couple of other things,

[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:27.220]
Barry Jackass with his up there in Eddie Kay.

[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:31.200]
I could tell you what happened with Eddie Kay, but it would be so embarrassing that I just

[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.100]
didn't even want to tell it.

[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:36.520]
Should I tell it?

[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:37.200]
Okay.

[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:38.020]
No.

[02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:38.620]
All right.

[02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:39.580]
No.

[02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:45.360]
All I can say is that he got F'd by Jolly Joe.

[02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:46.460]
Screwed.

[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:47.780]
Tattooed and screwed.

[02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:50.860]
Then Eddie, as you know, is a good guy.

[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:51.440]
Yep.

[02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:52.500]
I mean, yeah.

[02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:55.280]
So his show was boring, but nevertheless, good guy.

[02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:56.560]
He had a loyal following.

[02:16:57.440 --> 02:17:00.180]
And he certainly never had a number that started with a, oh, like that.

[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.280]
Like we got a night now, thanks to that horrible golf and infomercial thing,

[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:06.760]
that Barry is so enamored with.

[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:08.120]
You're not following us, Barry.

[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:10.400]
It's a rush limbaugh bait and switch.

[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:13.740]
Rushed-tonned everybody to vote for his swillery because they didn't want Obama to get it.

[02:17:13.820 --> 02:17:14.660]
Too bad rush you lose.

[02:17:15.640 --> 02:17:17.040]
And same thing with you, Jolly.

[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:17.720]
Joe, you lose.

[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:18.780]
We all lose.

[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:25.340]
We all lose because you have abused this place, the workplace.

[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:28.340]
WDQ-AM, hello.

[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:29.460]
How's the meal?

[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:30.200]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:31.240]
How are you doing?

[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:32.100]
Okay.

[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:35.880]
Speaking of raw hot dogs, I just shuckled up my rectum.

[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:36.220]
Good.

[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:37.760]
I hope you enjoyed it.

[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.020]
I hope it comes out the same shade of a pink that went in and a hot dog too.

[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:45.400]
Hmm.

[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:47.440]
I don't know why this is so.

[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:49.640]
I mean, sure, it's better when it's heated.

[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:52.540]
Maybe I could take the last half of it here and put it in the, uh, luket.

[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:53.860]
You could.

[02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:55.420]
Well, why not?

[02:17:56.380 --> 02:17:57.020]
I don't know.

[02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:01.200]
If you get a one, I'm going to put it in a small piece of paper towel.

[02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:01.760]
I'll be right back.

[02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:03.560]
Again with this?

[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:05.440]
Did he just want me to get it?

[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:08.120]
No, I'm not.

[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:09.600]
This is research.

[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:12.560]
You got less than a hour to go on a show.

[02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:16.220]
Last real show that you're going to have to do before your slikey summer schedule and

[02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:16.240]
you can eat it.

[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:17.560]
Why won't he just take a minute?

[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:18.240]
We're a few seconds.

[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.240]
One for show as a row.

[02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:20.200]
I'm going to play tunes.

[02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:20.560]
God.

[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:22.680]
You're going to do it.

[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:23.960]
I've been burning a CD.

[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:24.980]
I'm going to play the team teams.

[02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:30.440]
I had to do this anyway.

[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:31.800]
I had to audition the CD that I just burned.

[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:32.860]
For Lucy.

[02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:34.540]
Come in here and get your CD.

[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:46.440]
I made another copy for you, Susie.

[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:48.660]
I had to bribe her with things like this.

[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:49.820]
CD.

[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:51.100]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:52.200]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:53.200]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:54.720]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:55.480]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:55.920]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:56.780]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:56.780 --> 02:18:57.160]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:57.220 --> 02:18:58.020]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:58.020 --> 02:18:58.360]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:58.360]

[02:18:58.360 --> 02:18:58.720]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:58.720 --> 02:18:59.600]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:00.580]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:19:01.540 --> 02:19:04.520]
I'm going to put it in a second.

[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:09.520]
The next time you won't get my lips, now shut up and let me go.

[02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:13.880]
Your chance won't work so clean, I bet you'd change your wardrobe 15.

[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:17.300]
Oh, no, I can't believe I've been down in this country.

[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:18.500]
I could put some price on the box.

[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:19.100]
I'm not going to throw it on the box.

[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:22.440]
One thing about raw weeners, you don't put a mouse to it on them when you're eating them raw.

[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:23.400]
You have to eat it first.

[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:24.140]
Okay.

[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:25.800]
No, I'm just going to eat this.

[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.080]
I just see a lot of crunch better.

[02:19:28.620 --> 02:19:29.120]
Much better.

[02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:32.260]
I guess it's just being lazy.

[02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:32.960]
Is that it?

[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:35.040]
mm-hmm. Chris would know about being fat and lazy.

[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:35.640]
mm-hmm.

[02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:39.220]
I'm going to go ahead and get up my hot dogs.

[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:40.040]
What?

[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:42.100]
If I'm not so lazy I don't heat up my hot dogs.

[02:19:42.460 --> 02:20:02.940]
Well I'm doing a radio show here in Georgia's

[02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:03.820]
Georgia's Court.

[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:04.700]
This is the next week.

[02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:05.100]
Yeah.

[02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:07.960]
Hope you ain't busy.

[02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:11.040]
Now what's the story?

[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:13.320]
Who's going to be working next week with you guys?

[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:13.820]
Chris.

[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:15.400]
And that's it.

[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:15.920]
Is you two?

[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:16.820]
Just us two.

[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:20.960]
I'll be dragging every part person out of the hallway that I can in here.

[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:24.300]
And tell him to crawl in and what to say.

[02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:24.920]
That's right.

[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:26.440]
I'll bring a radio.

[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:26.960]
Hello.

[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:27.140]
Hello.

[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:29.880]
Hey, two questions.

[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:30.460]
Yes.

[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:32.180]
Well, let me have sex.

[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:34.200]
And I've never had sex with Georgia.

[02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:35.180]
No.

[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:38.440]
Well, why did they have this fantasy?

[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:40.580]
Well, what are they thinking about?

[02:20:40.820 --> 02:20:41.940]
It's a switch for thinking.

[02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.620]
Is the term I learned?

[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:46.340]
Because you've been on a show for a long time.

[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:48.660]
Therefore you must be gay and you and I must be a duteline.

[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.400]
Well, well, what are they thinking about?

[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:51.320]
Are these people crazy?

[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:52.400]
People who are gay?

[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:54.040]
They only hang out with the gay people, you know.

[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.420]
How many QAM?

[02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:55.860]

[02:20:56.600 --> 02:20:57.000]
Georgia.

[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:57.640]
Luna, they were.

[02:20:57.840 --> 02:20:58.780]
How are you doing, sir?

[02:20:58.780 --> 02:20:59.100]
QAM?

[02:20:59.280 --> 02:20:59.380]
Hello.

[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:00.460]
Hey, Neil.

[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:01.040]
How are you doing, sir?

[02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:01.640]
Okay, sir.

[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.260]
Do you remember that studio you used to work at on I-95 and I believe Griffin Road?

[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:07.880]
No.

[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:09.720]
Because they never worked on I-95 in Griffin Road.

[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:11.020]
So, about the...

[02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:11.280]
The...

[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:13.520]
Paxton was on Griffin Road.

[02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:15.120]
It was on Sheridan's office Sheridan Street.

[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:15.800]
Oh, okay.

[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:16.420]
I'm sorry, sir.

[02:21:16.500 --> 02:21:22.040]
Well, I remember around that time that there was a guy that's going to the meat processing machine.

[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:23.940]
I've been dutched.

[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:24.660]
Do you remember that?

[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:25.520]
Long time ago, yeah.

[02:21:25.740 --> 02:21:29.600]
That's why I always look at a hamburger a different way now.

[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:31.540]
That enclosed in sir.

[02:21:32.380 --> 02:21:33.460]
You're going to get it all.

[02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:34.460]
You're going to get it all.

[02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:38.420]
Thank you, buddy.

[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:39.000]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:39.580]
Good to see you.

[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:40.100]
I forgot.

[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:41.260]
It was a matter of fact that's a good reminder.

[02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:43.680]
We were supposed to be doing the show, you know, bilingual.

[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:45.040]
Every other word in Spanish now.

[02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:45.520]
Oh, really?

[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:46.540]
To get the ratings back up.

[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:49.760]
How about Pendejo, can we say that?

[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:52.120]
Yeah, we have to translate everything.

[02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:53.660]
We're going to do closed captions.

[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:57.520]
For the calling impaired.

[02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:58.060]
Right.

[02:21:58.380 --> 02:22:00.040]
That's what we have on the phone calling impaired.

[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:01.200]
We're going to do the show in Spanish.

[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:01.860]
How many seconds do we have?

[02:22:02.060 --> 02:22:03.860]
That means we only got 40 minutes still to a clock.

[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:04.640]
Not that I'm counting.

[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.120]
I'm asking what we're starting with.

[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:08.700]
The best tower to keep up with in the garage.

[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:11.040]
Forty-two five, sixty-two-eighth.

[02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:11.640]
I think.

[02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:12.960]
Forty-two-eighth.

[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:15.180]
Grab my junior, honey.

[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:16.640]
I'm going to cross the timeline.

[02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:18.100]
Ashes on to the top of the key.

[02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:19.000]
Take it by Julius.

[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:19.480]
Drive!

[02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:20.080]
Stop!

[02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:22.960]
I want to go in and find one in it.

[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:23.780]
We're not dead.

[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:25.100]
It's not dead.

[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:25.580]
Ah!

[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.020]
This is the doctor.

[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.000]
And when I want a fast break from the usual breakfast routine,

[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:31.740]
there's only one place for me.

[02:22:32.180 --> 02:22:33.440]
Slam dunking donut.

[02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:35.760]
Check out the Al-Star Liner.

[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:38.320]
They got Dale Dawkins, Chakras Thunder donuts,

[02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:40.360]
Will's Chandler and Finger Rolls,

[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.700]
and even Moses Malone.

[02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:43.880]
One handed jam feels donut.

[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:45.260]
Mmm-hmm.

[02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:45.920]
Hand off.

[02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:47.700]
How about a box and one to go?

[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:48.420]
Yeah, baby.

[02:22:48.680 --> 02:22:49.660]
And give me a cup of coffee.

[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:50.600]
Small one.

[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:51.600]
Medium one.

[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:52.140]
Ah.

[02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:53.380]
A larger one.

[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:54.360]
A larger one.

[02:22:54.740 --> 02:22:55.940]
But no Korean, please.

[02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:56.620]
Ah!

[02:22:56.900 --> 02:22:57.420]
That's bad.

[02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:00.580]
To make your best move to slam dunking donuts.

[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:03.140]
We stop our food in your face.

[02:23:04.660 --> 02:23:05.440]
That's bad.

[02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:06.060]
I like it.

[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:06.880]
That's so kind of cute.

[02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:08.120]
Remember that?

[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:08.880]
Yep.

[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:10.080]
You don't like it?

[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:10.800]
I like it.

[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:11.340]
Fine.

[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:12.160]
Oh.

[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:14.240]
Oh, what I meant to say was,

[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:15.280]
Do you like it?

[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:17.980]
But I didn't want to make the effort.

[02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:18.680]
We got to work.

[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:19.440]
What I meant to say was,

[02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:20.220]
Baby, I do.

[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:22.820]
43 minutes till, uh, till,

[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:23.880]
Cup of that, girl.

[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:27.340]
I never really...

[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:31.400]
I don't think you didn't add a quick jab or explain that to me,

[02:23:31.480 --> 02:23:32.000]
but that's okay.

[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:34.320]
So, all right.

[02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:36.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, you know.

[02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:38.180]
We only got 43 minutes to go.

[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:39.780]
You think that in these last 43 minutes

[02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:41.360]
since this show I said such significance today,

[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:41.920]
at least to me.

[02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:43.940]
I guess I'm the only one who's excited about it.

[02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:45.040]
About what?

[02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:47.420]
About the fact that it's my last show

[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:49.000]
and that full time exactly right here.

[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:50.620]
The only one that's excited about it.

[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.300]
You're the only one that's happy about it.

[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:53.100]
That's absolutely...

[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:54.000]
Get outta here.

[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:54.660]
Meg.

[02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:55.580]
I'm bummed.

[02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:56.880]
Chris and Paul Meg.

[02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:58.100]
Everybody else is bummed.

[02:23:58.500 --> 02:23:59.300]
What do you mean by that?

[02:23:59.620 --> 02:24:02.020]
Except for Reverend Jones and those people.

[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:02.560]
They're...

[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:05.280]
They can't wait until they love the one-on-one with me.

[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:05.780]
Is they really?

[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:06.480]
They want that.

[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:07.800]
They want one with you?

[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:08.300]
Oh, yeah.

[02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:09.220]
Or two-on-one.

[02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:12.480]
That one day on their case, they want to make a one-on-one sandwich.

[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:13.480]
One day on your circumstance back,

[02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:14.580]
they want to be the stale bread.

[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:16.540]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:18.100]
George.

[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:19.740]
What does he have to give you a play?

[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:20.360]
Is that new music?

[02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:21.040]
What's the name?

[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:21.340]
Yeah.

[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:22.460]
Call George on Monday.

[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:23.520]
What they have to need us for.

[02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:23.820]
Okay.

[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:27.120]
Talk to George about his horseball music on Monday.

[02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:30.540]
You knew that some of these train monkeys on here,

[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:31.300]
like Moe would say.

[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:32.460]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:35.120]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:36.860]
George Abee Lee is hot.

[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:38.920]
No kidding.

[02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:40.100]
Wow.

[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:41.540]
What a bulletin.

[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:44.520]
And this guy's got to be 180 years old, okay?

[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.800]
She must really be something if he's got him aroused.

[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:49.760]
What about Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:51.540]
Hey, Neil.

[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:52.060]
Yeah.

[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:55.080]
Hey, go out and get a smoothie on your vacation.

[02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:55.720]
All right, man.

[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:56.400]
Yeah, I'm sorry.

[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:57.440]
I'm sorry.

[02:24:57.440 --> 02:24:58.120]
I don't know.

[02:24:58.300 --> 02:24:58.700]
Okay.

[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:01.940]
See, you started something new now.

[02:25:02.380 --> 02:25:03.820]
I didn't know what they were talking about.

[02:25:03.900 --> 02:25:04.960]
It was so...

[02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:06.820]
That's so terrific.

[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.880]
We were having smoothies yesterday, during lunch.

[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:10.740]
Yeah, I know that.

[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:11.820]
You have to repeat it.

[02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:13.260]
I really wasn't that good, you know.

[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:15.720]
You have to rehash the whole thing.

[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:17.340]
5,6,7,0,5.

[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:20.120]
So you'd expect these lines of the exploding outies last...

[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:21.100]
This last star, wouldn't you?

[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:22.720]
If we had an audience.

[02:25:23.540 --> 02:25:25.520]
And did we ever get to Lady Colors that I was searching for?

[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:25.720]
No.

[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:26.040]
No.

[02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:27.860]
Who don't care enough to send their very best?

[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:28.540]
Their very breast?

[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:31.740]
And then when we're talking about saggy breasts?

[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:35.400]
5,6,7,0,5,60.

[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:36.640]
Are we going too fast for it?

[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:39.740]
There's pound 5,60 in the horizon in singular wireless line.

[02:25:41.180 --> 02:25:42.100]
WDQA M, hello.

[02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:44.020]
Check out the front of the shot.

[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:47.240]
WDQA M, hello.

[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:49.360]
I remember running around,

[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:50.920]
all the things I was just about to say.

[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:54.120]
Thank you for bringing up tiny, tiny died parts since.

[02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:57.880]
Well...

[02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:02.000]
WDQA M, hello.

[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:04.300]
Oh, no, no, no, let me tell one minute.

[02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:06.880]
WDQA M, hello.

[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.380]
Hey, are you going...

[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:10.600]
I just got your glasses.

[02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:14.580]
Oh, my God, you're really desperate now with the voices, aren't you?

[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:16.140]
Gas is free desperate, yeah.

[02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:17.900]
WDQA M, hello.

[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:21.300]
Hey, usually don't throw them on the Friday for a father's day.

[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:23.600]
Usually we're in the poll on TV fathers.

[02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:26.200]
What do you mean by that?

[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:27.560]
Like, uh...

[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.300]
Like, my condolences.

[02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:30.460]
We're going to do the same poll every year at the same time.

[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:32.540]
Oh, well, you repeat polls sometimes.

[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:33.660]
Yeah, no, we don't.

[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:34.500]
We don't usually do.

[02:26:34.520 --> 02:26:35.340]
We did it maybe once.

[02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:37.680]
Sorry.

[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:38.960]
Me too.

[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:40.300]
Sorry, I took the call.

[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:41.220]
Sorry.

[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:45.400]
There's a guy who wants to program the polls.

[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:46.100]
I'm like that.

[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:47.460]
You see how you are?

[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:48.000]
Huh?

[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:48.760]
You see how you are.

[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:50.500]
This guy calls to program the radio show.

[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:51.060]
Yeah.

[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:52.380]
Oh, well.

[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:54.640]
I should even be in the heat of light anybody else.

[02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:54.980]
I'll turn it.

[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:55.680]
That's right.

[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:56.800]
I want to treat the call as well.

[02:26:56.940 --> 02:26:57.320]
That's correct.

[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:00.000]
You don't mean that the caller is...

[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.840]
He hangs up by them too soon and he's so right here, right?

[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.300]
I would challenge any of you morons out there to come and sit in this chair

[02:27:07.300 --> 02:27:09.560]
and deal with these idiots for hours every day.

[02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:12.600]
Nothing to bothers me at least, but I'm going to pay a lot of money to do it.

[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:15.600]
And you know what's on my mind right now?

[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:16.440]
What?

[02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:17.340]
They keep the clock.

[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:17.900]
They can show.

[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:19.180]
No, I'm not going out.

[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:20.840]
I don't think he keeps saying.

[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:23.440]
Everybody's saying, hey, have a nice vacation.

[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:27.460]
In fact, this week is the week I was going to be on vacation right.

[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.680]
And because Paco finally got his papers and crap

[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:35.260]
and he's getting his permanent...

[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:37.800]
Pastaporto and permanent resident card.

[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:39.080]
So I'm putting it off a little bit.

[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:40.860]
He wants to see the world, you know?

[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:43.740]
Which means it's going to cost me a fortune again.

[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:45.320]
But that's okay because that's me, you know.

[02:27:45.700 --> 02:27:47.320]
I'm always schlepping everybody all over the world.

[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:48.100]
Mm-hmm.

[02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:49.260]
Not you though.

[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:50.100]
Sorry.

[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:51.120]
And not Chris.

[02:27:52.020 --> 02:27:52.260]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:54.680]
And by the way, once in a day, tell courtesys check

[02:27:54.680 --> 02:27:56.040]
I'll be in the mail out in two o'clock.

[02:27:56.260 --> 02:27:56.480]
Okay.

[02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:57.460]
Hey John, mail.

[02:27:58.700 --> 02:27:59.980]
Hey, John, your check I'll be in the mail.

[02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:03.680]
I'm going to walk down to the mailbox down to the park and go out and get...

[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:06.700]
Oh, in between those two things, I'm going to go across to the Chinese market.

[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:09.200]
And maybe give me that Snickers on and borrow you know the big one.

[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:09.620]
Mm-hmm.

[02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:11.400]
If you had those Snickers with almonds?

[02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:13.380]
No, sounds good though.

[02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:14.220]
I love almonds.

[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:15.420]
And chocolate.

[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:16.920]
So incredibly good.

[02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:18.080]
Great, you're trying to make me fat.

[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:18.600]
Good.

[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:19.360]
That's how you fat.

[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:21.280]
And I'm going to go with Georgia.

[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:22.340]
Think of a challenge.

[02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:23.560]
How many QAM?

[02:28:23.620 --> 02:28:23.780]
Hello.

[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:27.600]
Georgia's satisfied because he wants to take...

[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:28.520]
How many QAM?

[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:28.740]
Hello.

[02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:32.120]
I don't mean to question your work ethic, but...

[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:32.300]
Yeah.

[02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:34.380]
Vacations are a little...

[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:39.860]
I work ethic.

[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:40.180]
Yeah.

[02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:42.640]
In other words, he's jealous as hell.

[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:42.980]
Okay.

[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:43.380]
Too bad.

[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:45.160]
Too bad I got a sweet deal.

[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:46.740]
Okay, at least until the end of this week.

[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:47.720]
I think I got a good deal.

[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:48.660]
A sour deal.

[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.200]
There's sour dough and then there's a sour deal.

[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:53.860]
I'm going to be getting some sour dough too.

[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:54.220]
Right.

[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:56.600]
And that's because Joe Bell is a...

[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:58.420]
Oh, fat ass bastard.

[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:01.500]
I can't say a great read at least would be a little bit human

[02:29:01.500 --> 02:29:02.180]
away with deal.

[02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:03.620]
Maybe give away a little bit too much.

[02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:04.120]
That's okay.

[02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:05.080]
I'll take it.

[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:07.620]
Let's call it going from one extreme to the other.

[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:08.800]
No tickets.

[02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:10.000]
No perks.

[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:10.840]
No, no nothing.

[02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:12.580]
No signing bonus.

[02:29:12.980 --> 02:29:13.280]
Nothing.

[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:15.900]
And make it make the cover it as bare as he possibly could.

[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:19.140]
Just to prove that he hates me like poison and believe me, the feeling is mutual.

[02:29:21.460 --> 02:29:23.980]
I'm trying to think if I ever worked for anybody in my life.

[02:29:24.020 --> 02:29:26.720]
And I work for some nice people and for some real a-holes.

[02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:31.720]
But I'm trying to think if I ever worked for anybody in my life who I truly despised

[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:32.960]
as much as this man.

[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:33.860]
I don't think so.

[02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:34.840]
Not even close.

[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:35.640]

[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:37.780]
How many QA& Hello?

[02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:42.360]
Neil, I do try to listen to the other shows on QA&M through the years.

[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:43.780]
But it is hard work.

[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:45.560]
Can I give a rebate check?

[02:29:46.220 --> 02:29:46.360]
Yeah.

[02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:46.800]
Okay.

[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:48.480]
To recall Joe, how can you do that?

[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:48.960]
Yeah.

[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:52.580]
Joe's had a cash like water from the faucet.

[02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:55.420]
Well, by the way, let me tell you about one of the greatest products ever invented.

[02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:57.180]
And it's not like I discovered anything.

[02:29:57.220 --> 02:29:58.080]
Everybody knows this.

[02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:02.600]
I just luckily haven't had the need to use it much over the years.

[02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:04.880]
Liquid plumber.

[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:05.700]
Okay.

[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:08.460]
There are a few things worse.

[02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:12.080]
Now my bathroom sink, year or so ago, was plung up a little bit.

[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:14.160]
And so I got some liquid plumber and did a wonderful job.

[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:14.520]
Right.

[02:30:14.740 --> 02:30:15.360]
I use it all the time.

[02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:22.060]
And now come to find out that my kitchen sink, what I've had is every now and then there'll be like water in the pipe underneath.

[02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:23.020]
I'm just too lazy.

[02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:24.700]
I'm not one of those people is always running to maintenance.

[02:30:25.080 --> 02:30:26.120]
Oh gee, this is broken.

[02:30:26.400 --> 02:30:27.600]
I just, you know, go with the flow.

[02:30:27.900 --> 02:30:28.040]
Right.

[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:36.740]
So every now and then, so I have a big plastic tub that I put underneath of the pipes so that if a little water pushes out,

[02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:38.720]
that it catches the water.

[02:30:40.100 --> 02:30:45.200]
But yesterday, and I guess this is an accumulation, my meatloaf shoving the stuff down the sink, you know.

[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:45.960]
Who does it?

[02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:47.980]
Well, it's not a good idea.

[02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:55.540]
And I realized that the reason that the water is being forced out through the pipes is because there's too much clog in there.

[02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:56.920]
And now now the water was sitting there.

[02:30:58.080 --> 02:30:58.380]
Sitting.

[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:03.540]
And so I realized I still have another half bottle of liquid plumber from the other incident.

[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:05.540]
And that's exactly what you need, half a bottle.

[02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:10.460]
You pour it in there and I waited the 20 minutes, half an hour, and now I got a nice open sink.

[02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:11.080]
Oh yeah.

[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:13.300]
And no more pressure to the water underneath and stuff like that.

[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:17.340]
But whoever invented that, I thank you so much.

[02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:17.640]
Yeah.

[02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:18.200]
Acid.

[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:20.300]
That's what I wanted to answer.

[02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:21.460]
I'm going to go after the show.

[02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:22.600]
I'm going to go drink the rest of it.

[02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:23.080]
I think it's a base.

[02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:24.620]
It's a what?

[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:25.240]
A base.

[02:31:25.860 --> 02:31:25.980]
Base.

[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:28.020]
Right.

[02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:30.580]
What does that mean?

[02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:32.420]
Acid is a base.

[02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:33.080]
Right.

[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:35.460]
What baking soda is a base?

[02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:36.380]
Milk.

[02:31:36.740 --> 02:31:37.360]
Opposite acid.

[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:38.540]
Still be honest.

[02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:39.480]
You're going to make your 400 votes.

[02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:40.920]
I think crazy you got 378.

[02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:41.500]
All right.

[02:31:41.940 --> 02:31:42.760]
We need 22 more.

[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:43.280]
That would be nice.

[02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:44.900]
Nice feather of my cat, cat, cat.

[02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:45.860]
A little send off.

[02:31:46.580 --> 02:31:47.880]
Nice send off from the audience.

[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:49.240]
Make 400 on our second pull.

[02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:49.760]
3.79.

[02:31:49.960 --> 02:31:50.600]
We need only 21.

[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:52.360]
We got 35 minutes to do it.

[02:31:52.660 --> 02:31:54.620]
35 minutes seems like an activity man.

[02:31:54.920 --> 02:31:55.820]
Get your name.

[02:31:56.180 --> 02:31:56.980]
The best talent.

[02:31:57.260 --> 02:31:58.260]
You're the new rider.

[02:31:58.600 --> 02:31:59.220]
It's 4.50.

[02:31:59.820 --> 02:32:00.660]
5.62 AM.

[02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:02.500]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:03.640]
Actually a lesbian.

[02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:04.500]
Or congratulations.

[02:32:04.700 --> 02:32:05.300]
Get a life.

[02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:07.780]
It can start with a tiny mistake.

[02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:10.820]
Wait, can you put all my hands on bagware?

[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:11.440]
A cow.

[02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:13.200]
It can jeopardize a career.

[02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:15.820]
It can go on a back end right now.

[02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:17.740]
They did the boss leave it.

[02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:18.360]
It's cold.

[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:21.440]
Elf's timers sign here are the warning signs.

[02:32:22.260 --> 02:32:23.100]
Forgetting names.

[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:25.140]
I'm here to congratulate them.

[02:32:26.900 --> 02:32:28.160]
I'm here to congratulate them.

[02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:28.620]
Lost.

[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:29.400]
A bluerick.

[02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:30.940]
High bowing.

[02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:33.300]
High bowing.

[02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:33.860]
High bowing.

[02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:36.340]
And finally, a disorientation.

[02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:38.120]
Hey, you guys want to go for a swim?

[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:39.280]
A little pole.

[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:40.100]
Don't you think?

[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:40.720]
Thank you.

[02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:42.880]
If you or an Elf you know,

[02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:44.520]
suffers any of these symptoms,

[02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:47.340]
please call our Elf Hellpont Line and

[02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:49.780]

[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:51.200]
Elf Hellp.

[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:52.760]
You can be short with us.

[02:32:53.620 --> 02:32:53.980]
Alright.

[02:32:54.500 --> 02:32:55.240]
Nice got a cube.

[02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:56.500]
And that funny but it's cute.

[02:32:58.260 --> 02:32:58.980]
It was cute.

[02:32:59.040 --> 02:32:59.040]

[02:32:59.120 --> 02:32:59.120]

[02:32:59.500 --> 02:32:59.780]
Cutsie.

[02:33:01.340 --> 02:33:01.860]
Kind of cute.

[02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:02.060]
Cutsie.

[02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:04.060]
131 and 560 WQ.

[02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:05.260]
We got less than a half hour to go.

[02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:05.720]
What is shame?

[02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:07.940]
I think I'm going to show up Monday just for the hell of it.

[02:33:08.020 --> 02:33:08.120]
Good.

[02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:08.920]
No.

[02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:10.340]
I knew you wouldn't.

[02:33:11.580 --> 02:33:12.220]
567, come on.

[02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:13.620]
We got a half hour to kill here, man.

[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:15.380]
And this phone ought to be smoking right now.

[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:16.220]
It ought to be on fire.

[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:17.700]
It ought to be...

[02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:18.520]
That's it.

[02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:20.640]
But it's not.

[02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:24.100]
But you'll see, once that 75 minute delay cancels up,

[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:25.060]
we get into the jerk show.

[02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:26.780]
Come back, y'all.

[02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:28.000]
Oh, yeah.

[02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:30.860]
I am... I'm sorry.

[02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:32.840]
I'm so sorry.

[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:35.720]
567-0560,

[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.120]
pound 560 and the horizon singular wireless line.

[02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:40.520]
WQAM, hello.

[02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:42.140]
Dale?

[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:43.040]
Yes, sir.

[02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:43.980]
Hey, buddy.

[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:46.360]
I hope you have a good summer schedule.

[02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:47.240]
That'd be good.

[02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:47.500]
Thanks.

[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.620]
Time off. That'd be great.

[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:52.040]
Hey, you know the biggest problem with George is, remember that...

[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:53.140]
That thing he talks about.

[02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:53.780]
He only got four.

[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:53.780]

[02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:54.560]
He only got four.

[02:33:55.720 --> 02:33:56.640]
You know what, Neil?

[02:33:57.260 --> 02:33:58.160]
Neil, what are you saying?

[02:33:58.680 --> 02:33:59.200]
What are you saying?

[02:33:59.200 --> 02:33:59.200]

[02:33:59.480 --> 02:33:59.880]
Well, you know what?

[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:01.300]
If you don't like it, don't listen when he's out.

[02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:03.580]
If you don't like me, don't listen when I'm out.

[02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:05.060]
If you don't like it, the one of us?

[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:06.400]
Uh, screw you.

[02:34:08.740 --> 02:34:09.320]
WQAM, hello.

[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:11.560]
WQAM, that's smoothie.

[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:12.920]
Yeah.

[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:16.260]
WQAM, hello.

[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:18.960]
Neil Rogers, hello everybody.

[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:19.860]
Okay.

[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:21.740]
You ready to have a good vacation?

[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:21.860]
What about the vacation?

[02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:22.760]
I'm ready.

[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:23.640]
I'm not going on vacation.

[02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:24.320]
But go ahead.

[02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:27.380]
Hey, uh, George, ready for me on Monday?

[02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:28.780]
I'm coming for you, George, Monday.

[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:29.500]
Uh-huh.

[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:31.200]
Hey, what do I go on the toilet D?

[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:31.740]
Uh-huh.

[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:32.620]
Woohoo!

[02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:33.880]
Oh, man.

[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:36.820]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:40.040]
Anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor...

[02:34:40.040 --> 02:34:40.420]
Hey, man.

[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:41.180]
Amen.

[02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:41.340]

[02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:41.460]
Da.

[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:43.040]
27-mill, too, already.

[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:43.600]
Look at that.

[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:45.500]
I guess something.

[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:46.300]
I'm sorry, I said it.

[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:48.220]
I've already got the 40-break crossoft.

[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:59.060]
off. We didn't do it, did we? No. Oh, maybe we'll play it twice. How many QIM? Hello? Hello,

[02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:08.500]
Neil. Yes? Who's Paco? Paco? Yeah, you mentioned him a lot. Yeah, friend of mine. Is

[02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:17.700]
it your voice toy? No. He's not. No. Why not? He don't want to. You sound like you're

[02:35:17.700 --> 02:35:22.820]
fond of him. He's a friend of mine. Do you have any friends that you don't have sex with?

[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:29.800]
Yeah, I get that deal. There you go. God. Now, now, he must be his boy toy. He must be

[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:37.500]
you. Listen, sit there and just work yourself into a frenzy, conjuring up all sorts of wild

[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:42.480]
images in your mind. And whatever you decide, that's fine. Whatever you think. If it works

[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:48.420]
for you, great. And I'm using part of it is that he lives upstairs in an apartment that

[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:55.960]
I pay for with his real boyfriend, with his boyfriend. Is that okay? Do you approve of that?

[02:35:56.960 --> 02:36:01.460]
Nothing. They're married or anything like that. Yet. No, you don't approve of that. That's

[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:05.520]
right. Because you're, you're, I forgot. You're talking to me? Yeah. Oh, it's none of my

[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.500]
business. Exactly. I praise you. I praise you. You do. And stay very well soon.

[02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:20.080]
None of my business at all. That's correct. Somebody Q.A.M. Hello? Q.A.M. Hello? Q.A.M.

[02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:25.520]
Penny, how are you doing? Okay. Okay. You have the poll today on really ugly

[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:35.280]
breath. Yeah. And then the poll is closed. It's all done. Okay. No, that's fine. Yes. There's

[02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:50.600]
a lot of things that I can't do. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything.

[02:36:50.600 --> 02:37:04.920]
I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything.

[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:34.560]
I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything.

[02:37:42.400 --> 02:38:04.120]
I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything. I can't do anything.

[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:14.720]
Even if he's saying a good song poorly, I would have a different opinion, but he sings bad songs bad.

[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.700]
He sings bad songs bad. 5.6.7.05.60.

[02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:28.380]
0.5.60 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line. WDQ.A.M. Hello? Hello, Neil. Yes.

[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:32.860]
You just got a replacement. WDQ.A.M. Hello?

[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:40.840]
Neil, I have a turbo store. No, OK, great. Stick them back home. WDQ.A.M. Hello?

[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:54.960]
QA.A.M. Hi, Neil. Yes. It's David from the sweatshops and video store. How you doing? OK.

[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:59.860]
George left some stuff here like me. Yeah, buddy did.

[02:39:00.220 --> 02:39:07.000]
I'm fine. Yeah, I'll tell you his voices. I mean, just the original voices isn't bad enough, but his other voices are so bad.

[02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:12.400]
So pathetic. His obsession is like nothing else in history.

[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:18.760]
Yeah, I would agree with that. You know, we haven't heard from even once today.

[02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:29.080]
Get my friend. We're from his boyfriend 400 times, right? Am I right? Maybe. I don't know. That's right. Line 9. I'm sorry. I apologize.

[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:41.420]
I'm line 9. Maybe he's maybe he's just going to stick to line 9 would be good. Nope. WDQ.A.M. Hello? Neil. Yes, sir. How long you been down here? 30 to two years.

[02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:53.380]
Did you ever frequent restaurants down in or a 400 or a 1. I should say? Like which one? Do you remember like the bread bowl and and ranch houses and all that stuff back there?

[02:39:53.380 --> 02:40:00.140]
Yeah. I didn't know if you've seen that. I used to love this place. Well, I have anything like that now. It's all commercialized crap. Yeah.

[02:40:00.540 --> 02:40:06.020]
Oh, I'm just some different. Instead of calling up a jerk off. I just want to say that. OK, great. All right.

[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:16.120]
I like them better the other way. Yeah. Well, he don't want to sound like some Johnny Jerk off. Don't you understand? Right.

[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:26.500]
He'd rather sound like Eddie. OK, 104 votes for Yoko Ono. Female celebrity with the ugly as press. How many votes we got? 391. You only need nine votes and we got 22 minutes.

[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:38.280]
The longest 22 minutes in my life guarantee you that. You know, I'm starting to envision now the absolute last show. You know, in four and a half, five and a half years, whatever that is.

[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:46.840]
Assuming I don't quote first or assuming we don't have a parting of the ways or assuming they don't sell a place and pay me off. Oh, God. Wouldn't that be sweet? Sweet.

[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:59.440]
That's one of my real fantasies is for them to sell a place to somebody who's going to pay off the balance of the deal. Oh, I said you guys a few bucks. Thanks. Not me. I look.

[02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:04.760]
If I George, I'd send him eight bucks. Well, come on.

[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:32.580]
Oh, no.

[02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:20.820]
No

[02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:27.960]
Oh, God, said none of our는 is what they got you to me.

[02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:35.720]
Can't get any double, but a world called a color to be

[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:41.520]
You believe, you believe, what they say

[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:47.720]
Like they call the purple fool as they use

[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:55.020]
The scary and scary so they call it true

[02:42:55.020 --> 02:43:02.120]
Of the election, we don't push it's got it came

[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:08.020]
We don't, it's on your knees, we don't

[02:43:10.020 --> 02:43:16.500]
We got a baby and he's dead now

[02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:18.460]
We put a rope around his neck and he's dead

[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.120]
So that's 20 60 rees, what is that?

[02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:24.120]
That's like 79

[02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:27.600]
Let me look at my converter over here

[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:28.080]
81

[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:32.740]
Well 24 is 75, 25 is 77

[02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:34.320]
26 is about 79

[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:35.920]
79, what's about right?

[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:37.720]
That's about right, like I say

[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:39.060]
And it's going to be 30 today

[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:40.800]
And maybe a little drip here in there

[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:42.320]
A little like you ever have a little drip?

[02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:48.440]
Just this morning

[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:49.380]
And I'm going to show you guys in Singular White House line

[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:52.200]
We got 13 minutes and 39 seconds to kill here

[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:54.520]
And this phone should be exploding now

[02:43:56.220 --> 02:43:57.520]
70 QA and hello

[02:43:57.520 --> 02:43:58.820]
Yeah, Neil

[02:43:58.820 --> 02:43:59.700]
Yes sir

[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:03.740]
Neil, I remember when that long ago when the post came out

[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:07.820]
And you were all down and just mad about the promotions and all that

[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:11.040]
Well I'm like a promoter of your show

[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:12.800]
And I've never gotten a check or anything

[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:16.460]
Yeah, okay, all right

[02:44:16.460 --> 02:44:18.060]
I'm going to check, I'll send you a big fat one

[02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:19.460]
And a check too

[02:44:21.980 --> 02:44:23.300]
5670560, pound 560

[02:44:23.300 --> 02:44:25.420]
And he Verizon Singular wireless line

[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:26.300]
He never got a check

[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:27.600]
Call him Joe Dodgeola

[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:28.620]
Get a check

[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:30.600]
Joe Dodgeola

[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:31.400]
Boy, you know something?

[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:34.220]
He represented everything that was wrong with America then

[02:44:34.220 --> 02:44:36.460]
And he still represents everything that's wrong now

[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:39.980]
Joe Dodgeola, I wonder, he must still be alive, you think?

[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:41.380]
Chris, I do believe so

[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:43.460]
Oh God, how'd he press it?

[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:47.900]
And you know that one word keeps coming back to mind

[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:49.180]
Stupid, that's it

[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:52.460]
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid

[02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:54.000]
You know what I mean?

[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:54.620]
Yep

[02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:56.640]
Nobody QA in, hello

[02:44:57.400 --> 02:44:58.540]
Hello, Neil, good afternoon

[02:44:58.540 --> 02:44:59.900]
Yes sir, good afternoon

[02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:02.740]
Long, long, long time listen

[02:45:02.740 --> 02:45:04.420]
I first of all I love George number two

[02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:07.140]
What's going to happen one day when you're no longer on the air?

[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:09.540]
This town is really going to stuck. I love you, goodbye

[02:45:09.980 --> 02:45:10.380]
Okay

[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:15.580]
Wow, I think the town even with me on air still sucks

[02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:16.900]
But that's just my personal opinion

[02:45:17.300 --> 02:45:18.260]
I think it blows

[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:20.540]
I think it's an abortion

[02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.100]
Of course now that's a building that new stadium for the Martins

[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:25.540]
That should really put people over the top, huh?

[02:45:25.820 --> 02:45:27.580]
Over the roof, drop them in by helicopter

[02:45:30.060 --> 02:45:32.880]
Keep doing the same things over and over again

[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:34.260]
Going against the will of the public

[02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:36.640]
Taking public money and just stealing it from them

[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:39.120]
F-P-N-L wants to loot more money from the public

[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:40.180]
It just never ends

[02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:45.380]
See and it's one thing if you get looted and stole and you get something and be turned for it

[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:46.660]
But basically the people get nothing

[02:45:47.740 --> 02:45:49.080]
They just get hosed

[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.380]
Nobody QA in, hello

[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:53.380]
Yeah, Neil

[02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:56.580]
What happened to the tree lady? She dead?

[02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:57.500]
Yes

[02:45:58.260 --> 02:45:59.080]
Cockamoon dead?

[02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:00.120]
Yes

[02:46:00.740 --> 02:46:01.880]
They're all dead, Neil

[02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:03.920]
Yeah, I know, the audience is dead

[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:04.920]
WELL MINE

[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:06.420]
Not bad

[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.220]
Oh, I wonder what scruandix about that?

[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:15.620]
Those are the days, baby, when he had that big black dildo that he got a hold of

[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:16.020]
Wow

[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:17.500]
Mm-hmm

[02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:20.180]
Miley said he liked it because it was a lot like him

[02:46:20.180 --> 02:46:21.100]
Big and we still have it

[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:22.720]
We still have it around there?

[02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:23.180]
Yeah, still

[02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:25.160]
Oh, don't get too close to it

[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:27.040]
Our guarantee has got kudis

[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:30.360]
A gigantic black dildo

[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:32.500]
And boy, Roy Foster was just obsessed with that

[02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:34.860]
I got to have it, I got to have it

[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:39.400]
And then as soon as we let him have it then the scruand went running out of the building in the parking lot and hop into her a jaguar

[02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:41.620]
Remember, are they still doing that?

[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:45.680]
All the, um, the underling executives driving jaguars?

[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:47.100]
Right, under the building

[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:49.120]
What is that all about?

[02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:52.260]
It's as a chart of the social club, the sports fraternity people

[02:46:52.260 --> 02:46:52.880]
Oh, is that what it is?

[02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:53.060]

[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:55.340]
Now his parents also driving a jaguar?

[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:57.940]
He drives something, uh, it is a nice femur I think

[02:46:57.940 --> 02:46:58.520]
A company car

[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:00.180]
All the execs have company cars

[02:47:00.180 --> 02:47:01.280]
A real lot of money

[02:47:01.920 --> 02:47:02.680]
Get all out of money

[02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:05.040]
Park under the building

[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:06.300]
Uh-huh

[02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:09.380]
WDQAM, hello

[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:11.520]
WDQAM

[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:12.020]
QAM

[02:47:13.140 --> 02:47:14.260]
Yeah, Neil Rodgers

[02:47:14.260 --> 02:47:14.940]
Speaking

[02:47:16.140 --> 02:47:17.400]
Neil Rodgers, the sport

[02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:19.600]
How long have you been up in Toronto?

[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:21.340]
Six and a half years

[02:47:21.340 --> 02:47:23.640]
Six and a half years, how do you like it up there?

[02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:24.760]
I love it

[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.700]
Yeah, there is much censorship up there, the radio is there is down here

[02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:30.080]
Yes, yes

[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:31.760]
It's just a bad, eh?

[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:34.880]
I used to live up there, I thought it was a little better but

[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:35.600]
You know

[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:35.900]
No

[02:47:37.560 --> 02:47:39.420]
Okay, well, where's the universe this day?

[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:40.680]
Okay, see you around, eh?

[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:41.620]
Okay

[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:42.760]
Thank you

[02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:49.280]
Look at that, 150 and 15 seconds, that means we got two minutes and 44 seconds of shallot last break

[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:52.440]
Assuming it's four minutes long, let me take a look, it is

[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:53.360]
It is!

[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:54.460]
Let's hear it

[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:55.900]
It is!

[02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:56.300]
Oh!

[02:47:58.100 --> 02:48:01.060]
Now probably a lot of these people are wondering what is he sound so excited about?

[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:04.600]
I got my pants on, my pantaloons, my shirt, my shoes

[02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:08.300]
And the cure of gold, so I'll be

[02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:08.720]
What?

[02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:10.140]
See, you think you're a gold somewhere?

[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:10.920]
I am

[02:48:11.540 --> 02:48:15.040]
I'm going to the mailbox to me, I'll have a couple of checks, one of the IRS for a lot of money

[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:17.560]
Which I have to do quarterly all the time

[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:20.480]
I'll tell you if we didn't have to pay taxes, some of us would have a lot of money

[02:48:21.180 --> 02:48:23.600]
A lot of money, I mean a whole lot of a ton of money

[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:27.540]
I didn't even say I've got a lot of money, I've got to understand it to you guys and to understand it to the government

[02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:28.780]
So they can keep killing people

[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:31.020]
But you don't have any choice

[02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:36.180]
And all those people who said, oh, don't pay your taxes, you know, stay out of jail, you know where they all are?

[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:37.780]
Jail, that's right

[02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:39.300]
Femini QAM, hello

[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:41.000]
Femini QAM, hello

[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.140]
We don't care, Femini QAM, hello

[02:48:43.140 --> 02:48:43.840]
Really?

[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:44.720]
Yes sir

[02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:45.360]
How's it going today?

[02:48:45.660 --> 02:48:47.060]
Great, almost done baby

[02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:51.460]
I hear that in my friend, I just wanted to give you a quick call and say, you'll be missed over the summer

[02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:54.780]
It was very nice meeting you, I enjoyed over at the call stream

[02:48:55.220 --> 02:49:00.160]
I came a little late, like 15, 4 or 5 or so and took a picture

[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:04.160]
But those were nice, I had to have a chance to call and I'm just checking in with you and I hear you that you're leaving

[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:06.000]
So you will be missed my friend

[02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:09.300]
I'm not leaving, I'll be here Tuesdays and Thursdays, don't say I'll leave

[02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:10.980]
Oh, I'm sorry, that's your one of occasion

[02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:12.720]
I wish, the whole summer?

[02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:15.720]
You know, I actually had that deal a couple of years, the whole summer, remember that?

[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:17.440]
Yeah, that's right

[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:21.140]
I think I'll just do it and tell them it's an old age, I forgot, I'm supposed to work

[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:22.120]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pali

[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:24.740]
Yeah, that's a good idea, that guy just planted a great seed in my mind

[02:49:24.740 --> 02:49:26.140]
I just won't be here all summer

[02:49:26.140 --> 02:49:29.900]
Probably, Jolly Jo will have a far to take, if you ever even, probably don't even know about that

[02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:32.640]
Yeah, since he likes the tape idea so much, we can do tape songs too

[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:35.160]
Oh, yeah, but if a tape were a mon there, oh yeah tape songs

[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:39.380]
I want to hear your voice, which is just his way of saying that he hates you like poison even in his eyes

[02:49:39.380 --> 02:49:42.920]
And keeps saying, oh, I really like Georgia, and he tells you that, how much he likes you

[02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:44.100]
Something like that

[02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:47.760]
He doesn't have any money for you, but he likes you

[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:50.020]
He didn't say as what though, maybe he likes me as a door stop

[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:52.420]
You know, maybe he likes me as a car washer

[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:55.260]
And that's something to think about

[02:49:55.260 --> 02:49:58.080]
I betcha, he's got a big corporate vehicle sitting out there

[02:49:59.040 --> 02:49:59.980]
What does he drive?

[02:50:00.900 --> 02:50:03.380]
I don't know, a corporate car, and sure

[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:07.140]
Yeah, of course, and John Juris still driving a Jaguar

[02:50:08.540 --> 02:50:09.260]
Far as I know

[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:13.040]
And that's probably because he thinks it's made by Nazis or something like that in Austria

[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.440]
He's a good guy, but boy, I'd be real nervous

[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:22.640]
Next time he sends me candy, man, I'm gonna have somebody, I'm gonna have taco tasted, taco, taco, taco, taco

[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:23.800]
The food, the taste tested

[02:50:24.300 --> 02:50:25.100]
You know what I mean?

[02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:25.760]
Mm-hmm

[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:27.980]
Well, have a great time, be nice to George

[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:30.880]
Or the best town

[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:34.780]
Not a sportly of 5.60 Q.A.M

[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:38.680]
It's day you've ferried Miami town

[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:44.440]
A shooter at 5.60 WQ.A.M

[02:50:49.420 --> 02:50:50.620]
A finnature

[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:53.600]
What?

[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:56.020]
Mr. Dolder

[02:50:56.020 --> 02:50:56.700]
Brother

[02:50:57.440 --> 02:50:59.660]
They called him Mr. Dolder, baby

[02:51:01.020 --> 02:51:03.840]
Yo, we're not Miami-Kill that open wood

[02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:06.260]
That just fires another 10 minutes anyway

[02:51:06.260 --> 02:51:12.260]
For about 100 and 3 minutes of elaborate the round-end, it goes towards Berversion

[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:15.800]
So go on out of here, you're just a me and me, and get a brain donut

[02:51:15.800 --> 02:51:17.960]
Adam, Mr. Dolder

[02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:19.800]
In President's Marga

[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:23.440]
He's unified on the corner at 4.41 in Margae Boulevard

[02:51:23.440 --> 02:51:25.580]
Right across from the Lakeshore Drive-In

[02:51:25.580 --> 02:51:28.420]
The nearest trips that are here are view doors out from it, Roy

[02:51:28.420 --> 02:51:31.420]
Hey, I said Strip, where's my truck?

[02:51:31.900 --> 02:51:34.080]
I can't, I forgot the equipment

[02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:35.480]
You ain't got no equipment

[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:35.960]
No

[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:38.180]
Are very hailable Vrograva records

[02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:39.720]
Flarens, ladies and gentlemen

[02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:44.540]
You know, you got mad, but you don't got no drugs

[02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:45.680]
Sorry, I...

[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:50.240]
Well use your handlers of them, drum on the table, do something, I need my drums

[02:51:50.820 --> 02:51:52.500]
Okay, I'll try

[02:51:56.840 --> 02:51:57.640]
Hey, Larry

[02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.160]
Yes

[02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:01.540]
I wanted you to take off your bands and run up and down 4.41

[02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:04.480]
I'm not gonna do that, I'll have you now

[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:05.500]
Horts, huh?

[02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:06.940]
I said, sports

[02:52:08.420 --> 02:52:09.920]
Give me a butt, I can't

[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:14.400]
Here we go, sports, beats, sports

[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:15.480]
Okay

[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:23.620]
Larry goes, I'm gonna have a stupid gop

[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:25.820]
He's actually doing it ladies and gentlemen

[02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:27.480]
I'm gonna run it up and down, I think

[02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:27.900]
What?

[02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:32.700]
That ever

[02:52:32.700 --> 02:52:34.360]
Bye, bye, bye
