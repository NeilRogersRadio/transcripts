[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]
New push in this taboom with a deeper taste of the green and baby for my life.

[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.760]
W-Q-A-M, B-E-F-R-T-S-Q-B, and quadrary.

[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.160]
We're keen enough.

[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.360]
The biggest name is the best talent.

[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.180]
You're listening to sports radio 560WQ-A-M.

[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.620]
I am a Ford Lutterdale.

[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.880]
Oh my god.

[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.300]
13 to zip.

[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.640]
Wow, how embarrassing.

[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.540]
You're a Ford Lutterdale.

[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.700]
You're a Ford Lutterdale.

[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.140]
You're a Ford Lutterdale.

[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.980]
Good morning, Americans.

[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.280]
It's Paul Harfay.

[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.660]
Standby for news.

[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.040]
Ray, Willie, and Billy are three friends who are all injured while fishing at a lake

[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.640]
one day.

[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.080]
Suddenly, Jesus walks across the water and joins them in their boat.

[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:59.300]
When the three astonished men had settled down enough to speak, Ray humbly asks, Jesus,

[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.420]
I've suffered from back pain ever since I took shrapnel in the war, could you help me?

[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.520]
Of course my son, Jesus, replies, and when he touches the man's back, he instantly

[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.500]
feels relief for the first time.

[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.420]
In years?

[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.280]
The second man will eat, who wore very thick glasses and had a hard time reading and

[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.560]
driving us, Jesus, if he could do anything about his eyesight.

[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.460]
Jesus smiled, removed the man's glasses, and tosses them in the lake.

[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.740]
When they hit the water, the man's eyes clear, and he can see perfectly.

[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.240]
Jesus then turns to Billy, and tries to heal him.

[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.360]
Billy, a union worker, put his hands up and cried, don't touch me.

[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.700]
I'm on long-term disability.

[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.960]
Paul Harvey?

[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.940]
Good day.

[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.200]
Good day?

[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.880]
Hey, it's 10.02 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.400]
It's April turd.

[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.880]
April huh?

[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.460]
April turd, and it's a Thursday, so that means we got our two for one deal today, and we

[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.240]
actually had a great place that's still in business.

[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.060]
Let's share it.

[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.560]
We sold a few more deals for Joe Rosia yesterday.

[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.080]
All right.

[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.840]
He's down to 55 left on that deal of his.

[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.640]
Now what time's that coming in about 11.30?

[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.300]
I'll probably be here about 10 minutes, five minutes, eight minutes, who knows.

[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.540]
Oh, they have another post game show, are they?

[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.360]
Well, I'm not sure because I think they might have a promotions meeting right now, so there

[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.820]
might not be a post game show.

[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.000]
They're having a what?

[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.100]
Did you hear that?

[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.760]
Did I hear what?

[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.880]
Does that just yield post show meeting right now?

[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.520]
Oh.

[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.740]
Well, I know it couldn't be a promotions meeting because I got a my space message from

[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.180]
Flea, who's our promotion friend.

[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.660]
Let me ask you this because he's a good guy of an L.A.

[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.400]
He does a lot of good stuff for George, and now we got to do a thing for me.

[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.340]
But I do want to ask you this.

[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.620]
Don't you think it would have been a lot easier for him to come in the studio since I'm

[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.260]
always here, like by 8.30 at the very, very latest all the time that he sent a message?

[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.240]
What terms does that make?

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.580]
Maybe he's afraid of you.

[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.860]
So what it is?

[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.480]
Yeah, he gets scared of me when I hear you.

[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.480]
He gets scared of me when I hear you.

[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.160]
Lots to know if I'll do an appearance at Gulfstream, and he would arrange for the limo to take me

[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.660]
there, and for the potato lakas, for the deli, I didn't know they had a deli, I know they

[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.760]
got that one at the pomponom.

[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.680]
Well, if they got a deli at Gulfstream, they got me one over, and especially if they got

[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.960]
those ducks and chickens, you know, that the he-ha, he-ha, I won't do great at woodbying

[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.060]
last night, not that I want to go on here and brag about it, but I just did it.

[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.440]
I had it.

[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.380]
I'm a dollar wheel of fortune, maybe, and then after that I kind of like didn't want to

[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.760]
give any back, and I didn't, but I wandered around and played like two scent machines and

[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.100]
nickel machines, and did okay.

[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.700]
And I'd went a couple hundred on one of them, and I'd give a couple hundred back on another

[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.860]
one, and you know, it diddled around.

[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.160]
No lucky ducks are screaming he-ha chickens that would buy them.

[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.960]
Damn it.

[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.660]
Astrid's.

[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.800]
Any flaming chickens?

[00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.640]
Yeah, they have a few-

[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.760]
FINGING!

[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.280]
Queens.

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.580]
Oh, and I have to tell you this, even though nobody knows who this is.

[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.100]
So there's this old frog, this French guy, I say old, he's about my age.

[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.300]
Nice guy, the terrible breath.

[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.560]
Maurice is his name, and he's been going there about as long as I have about three and

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.520]
half years, and loses his ass just, and he started out on the dollar wheel of fortune,

[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.240]
and had no idea what he's doing, and a lot of times won't play the full tree, so the

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.420]
spindle come up, he doesn't get the spin, because unless you play the full amount, you

[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.820]
don't get it.

[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.000]
Then he graduated the five dollar wheel of fortune.

[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.260]
Well, this guy, every time I see him, losing four or five grand, I mean, he must be loaded,

[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.140]
but still losing his ass.

[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.860]
So about ten days ago, I saw him there, and he said to me, I said, how are you doing,

[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.100]
Maurice?

[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.900]
And you'll never see me again.

[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.280]
You'll never see this face again.

[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.980]
Look at my face, you'll never see me again.

[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.920]
That's like two weeks ago, right?

[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.460]
Why?

[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.000]
That's like two weeks ago, so I'm going to reach it.

[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.600]
Yeah, I mentioned it out in there, remember?

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.960]
Yep.

[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.320]
Well, last night I won my two grand, I'm diddling around, and I walked to go take a

[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.760]
leak, and as I'm walking back through the main part of the casino, I walked by the five

[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.460]
dollar wheel of fortune machines, and guess who's standing there?

[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.080]
Maurice, and I said, boy, you must have a twin brother.

[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.420]
Expecting maybe I get a chuckle or a laugh, he looked at me like with a look of terror,

[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.580]
a look of terror on his face, saying, oh, I have to do something, I have to let them

[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.260]
take my picture and prevent me from coming in there, or I'm going to move.

[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.940]
He lost seven grand last night and when I left he was still there.

[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.280]
He was still there sitting down another five dollar machine.

[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.500]
This is a crazy person.

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.140]
I mean, I know that there are people who have gambling problems, but I mean, Jesus, God,

[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.820]
every time it's six grand, four grand, seven grand.

[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.280]
Now, yeah, if he's a multi-millionaire, which he sure don't look to part, but if he is

[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.200]
a more power to him, it's his money.

[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.720]
Cool.

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.900]
But I don't think so.

[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.780]
And if he is, he won't be for long.

[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.780]
I mean, you know your desperate when you get to the point where you say, I don't want

[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.780]
them to let me in here anymore.

[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.780]
They have to take my picture.

[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.900]
You know, they have a deal.

[00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.220]
They'll do that for you.

[00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.760]
Really?

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.740]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.980]
Wow.

[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.940]
And they also, also people who create problems, they have a picture.

[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.720]
Yeah, well, that one, yeah.

[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.580]
And they banned them.

[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.540]
They don't let them anymore.

[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.500]
I never thought that, you know, hey, can you do me favor and take my picture so you won't

[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.620]
let them go?

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.880]
Yeah, never know that.

[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.260]
He needs assistance.

[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.120]
He needs help.

[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.220]
And so I just kind of like, I didn't know what I just almost wanted to cry and I wanted

[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.720]
it out of there.

[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.360]
And I didn't tell him I wanted to grant on the dollar machine.

[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.480]
He would have had a nervous breakdown.

[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.380]
That would have been just rubbing it in.

[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.200]
Like today, he lost his ass on one of the five dollar machines and he said, I just

[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.460]
him walked in and he said, I put four thousand in that machine and I got nothing.

[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.800]
So he wanted off to another machine.

[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.480]
I sat out at the one where he had been playing.

[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.040]
And within two minutes, I got a spin for five grand.

[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.620]
Nice.

[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.460]
He was needless to say, a little PO.

[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.100]
This is the same guy that was playing the machine and put in three grand and walked away

[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.600]
and they're getting up.

[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.180]
The Indian guy came and played the machine and put in about a hundred bucks.

[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.220]
And like a few seconds later, he got the jackpot, 366 grand.

[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.880]
Wow.

[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.040]
While he was saying they're watching.

[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.240]
And he still came back.

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.980]
Wow.

[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.980]
Yeah.

[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.220]
I think I was just broken down and cried right there.

[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.540]
Yeah.

[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.860]
And never come back.

[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.360]
I mean, how could you possibly come back after an experience like that?

[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.780]
Okay.

[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.040]
That's enough of our slots talk.

[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.440]

[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.780]
I think that would be a good show.

[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.420]
We're going to do the near Roger's slots show.

[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.720]
I sat in all my can't and email this morning asking, what's the story, counselor?

[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.760]
And you know, nothing.

[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.700]
I just, I have never in my life seen anybody that just kind of lollies, gags around through

[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.380]
life and but I be but I boop.

[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.200]
There's no sense of anything with this queen.

[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.540]
But nevertheless, at least the good news was I didn't have to see her this weekend when

[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.780]
I was down there because it would have been, I don't know.

[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.820]
I wouldn't say unpleasant but just strained, unplaced drained because he talks a lot of crap

[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.740]
and nothing ever happens.

[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.720]
You know, that's normal.

[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.540]
New filings run employment claims rose in the latest week to the highest level since

[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.660]
October 2005, a quandary report released today.

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.100]
The labor department said applications run employment benefits rose to 407,000 in the

[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.360]
week a.

[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.720]
March 29, up to may revise 369,000 claims the old previous week.

[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.480]
The last time claims exceeded the 400,000 level was in September 2005.

[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.760]
Well, I do like that.

[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.900]
A lot of people out there without work.

[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.840]
So Chris was saying before the show today that as little as their pain in there, how many

[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.300]
sent an hour?

[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.580]
Three sent an hour.

[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.560]
At least he's got a job.

[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.080]
Exactly.

[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.700]
As opposed to a lot of these poor bastards who ain't got no job, it can't find a job.

[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.360]
Thank you, Mr. President, for those low gas prices and for the great economy and for

[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.940]
that horse-ball American dollar.

[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.140]
You bastard, you butcher, you lunatic.

[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.520]
Take a look at today's poll.

[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.640]
You got your thousand licked.

[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.200]
It's in the bag.

[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.860]
No sweat today.

[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.380]
No pressure.

[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:44.900]
I like that.

[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.860]
And have already sent a new poll and Eric's already got it up there.

[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.480]
I don't think it's going to get many votes, but it's the last one in my pile.

[00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:00.000]
Everybody's other than Sean from Hollywood whom we admire and love dearly because he's

[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.380]
the only guy that still cares about us.

[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.000]
Everybody else is giving it up on the polls.

[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.940]
Maybe Brandon will come up with a poll.

[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.020]
I got one for tomorrow.

[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.880]
But as of starting next week, I mean, I can go back into the history there and come up

[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.860]
with all the old ones again.

[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.700]
But isn't that kind of cheating?

[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.820]
Do we really want to do that?

[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:15.920]
We don't cheat here.

[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.860]
Sonny and 52 here today later on.

[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.240]
Can you believe that?

[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.040]
Spring has sprung, baby.

[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.840]
Finally, finally, no more snow, no more ice, no more sleep, no more freezing rain.

[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.260]
Oh, God, I get so old when we actually have it.

[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.020]
It doesn't pay to be cheap when it comes to blank.

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.700]
That's our poll.

[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.460]
We have 750 votes already.

[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.460]
Toilet paper wins hands down your ass.

[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.080]
202 say toilet paper.

[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.180]
Get the good stuff for the allo.

[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.040]
I learned that yesterday.

[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.400]
Exactly.

[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.980]
Exactly with the allo.

[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.820]
Sherman, plug.

[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.940]
Maybe we won't get the hemorrhoids anymore.

[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.080]
I don't have any hemorrhoids now.

[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.360]
K. Mr. Smarty pants, Mr. Wise ass.

[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.100]
I have had them though.

[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.760]
Boy, talk about it.

[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.020]
Pay me.

[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.520]
I'll toilet paper 202 prostitutes 94 ought to be a lot, I don't know, doesn't pay to

[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:07.900]
be cheap.

[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.420]
Oh yeah.

[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:20.000]
Employees 89, stake 79, shoe 78, mechanics 34, cars 30, scots 28, catcher 26.

[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.400]
What's that even doing on there?

[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.440]
Doesn't pay to be cheap when it comes to catcher.

[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.380]
Catcher pulls a little bit of sugar, by the way.

[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.600]
Just thought I would mention that in passing.

[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:38.860]
Accountants 24, concert seats 18, underwear 18, cigars 10, bicycle 7, MP3 player 7, and

[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.720]
cutlery 6, Colory.

[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.220]
Oh.

[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.020]
I guess that was one of Sean's polls.

[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.920]
Nice anyway Sean.

[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.180]
It was good attempt.

[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.080]
I mean, it's a good poll.

[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:56.980]
It's that some of the things on there are a little bit strange, a little bit peculiar.

[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.900]
You know what's not on here?

[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.060]
What's that?

[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.520]
Agents slash lawyers.

[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.020]
That's a good one.

[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.920]
Add that on there right away.

[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.720]
It doesn't pay to be cheap when it comes to agents.

[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.420]
Oh my God.

[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.320]
You got a bad agent.

[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.880]
He just leaves you hanging and just dangling in the wind.

[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.380]
Just nothing happens.

[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.100]
Nothing happens.

[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:17.860]
Bapapapa.

[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.840]
A lot of talk, a lot of BS, a lot of, you know, a factory.

[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.420]
Nothing happens.

[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.380]
Ever.

[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.480]
I mean, just do.

[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.720]
You know, once upon a time back in the day, you know, he was, he was with it, but I think

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.720]
I think he's losing it if he ever had it.

[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.240]
Norma, you know, Norma.

[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.500]
All those sporting events he's hanging out with.

[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.760]
And I must be at all those.

[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.820]
And of course, he's still all whipped up about those tickets.

[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.360]
Oh, I want the club seats and I want this.

[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.900]
So I, my parking pass is not, yeah, see, it's not about me.

[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.920]
It's about Norma.

[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.760]
It's all about Norma.

[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.140]
Marlon tickets and dolphin seats and, you know, runaway.

[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.840]
He also has in the contract.

[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.500]
How many runaways can sit next to him with the sporting events?

[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.200]
How many?

[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.120]
About third, man.

[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.600]
12 minutes after 10, Zach will be joining us in a little bit.

[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.020]
Then today is Thursday.

[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.920]
So we got our two from Indyla noon tomorrow morning.

[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.920]
We got the Josh Cordis back with us, much to Brandon's this man.

[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.200]
I'm sure.

[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.120]
And we'll have the trends come out at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.240]
Some more numbers to a Pajki runaway for that numbers guy.

[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.480]
His night is named.

[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.000]
The numbers guy.

[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.880]
We got the quarter-shot guy and they wanted to have a doodoo to you, Neal Guy and those guys.

[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.500]
The guy who had the parents at Gulf Stream, I'm sure that those two misfits will show up again.

[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.480]
And we can beat them and brutalize them.

[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:31.980]
That would be good.

[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:32.680]
You know what?

[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.500]
We'll have the beast come out to be here on security.

[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.240]
Yeah, that should make me feel safe.

[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.660]
And feel Rogers God.

[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.080]
Who could we number back 10 years?

[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.900]
Little old 40 in America.

[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.540]
We can't remember what happened last Tuesday.

[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.460]
From the producer who brought you the box office, we make flop all the kings met.

[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.340]
James Carnell, teams up with Garl Road.

[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.400]
We write history again with the Vietnam drama.

[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.340]
Amber Grille, Marie.

[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.360]
Farge, what is it, the florist?

[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.320]
It's a crazy blind in the crossfire.

[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.060]
The games?

[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.560]
Yeah, I don't know what.

[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.120]
Well, she's dressed like a giant bumblebee.

[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.560]
We gotta take that hill.

[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.020]
What the hell, she's doing out there?

[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.040]
They're in crazy things like this.

[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.340]
Let's get unified.

[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.180]
The sky will open.

[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.140]
The light will come down.

[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.240]
And the artillery fans.

[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.860]
The last year, choirs will be singing.

[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.200]
She had a husband on a cell and put him on the bullhorn.

[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:24.960]
But the song?

[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:25.400]
What?

[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.420]
It's 1968.

[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.140]
We won't have cell phones yet.

[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.240]
What we do now?

[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.080]
Right side.

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.100]
Everyone will know we should do the right thing.

[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.920]
And the world will be perfect.

[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.940]
Hillary, get your badass out there now.

[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.140]
Let's eat spelled and lose their lives.

[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.900]
And if other beating was complex.

[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.240]
I have illusions.

[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.200]
Get your badass out there.

[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.760]
Wave a magic wand.

[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.520]
It's disappear.

[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.820]
There you go.

[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.460]
You fellas, remember what I did for you?

[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.520]
40 years from now, you could look for my wand.

[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.160]
It's a 1018 at 560 WQ.

[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.620]
Here's our award-winning lineup today.

[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.520]
Uh-oh, look at that.

[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:04.600]
What the?

[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:05.640]
Two to four.

[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.340]
It's the D.A. show at Sony Ericsson.

[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.060]
Oh, Jerks today.

[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.500]
Oh, the Afer Jerks is back tomorrow or what?

[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.600]
Maybe the heater playing again.

[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.000]
Maybe they're going to get their asses want again.

[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.540]
You might be traveling to the...

[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.520]
Beerusing, humiliating into the grading way.

[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.760]
Hurricane, my dog, 4-7 followed by Hurricane Hotline, 78, only one hour.

[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.760]
Because we got 8-9 John Lunder.

[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.800]
I don't understand any of this.

[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.780]
Thursday is like an abortion.

[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.340]
9-10, it's the high school Gretaian report.

[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:29.820]
Wow.

[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.380]
With the, uh, who is it?

[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.760]
The Beast?

[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.940]
No, the In-Ware Bluestein, I think.

[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.200]
Well, it says here, the Beast.

[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.100]
Oh, then I guess it's the...

[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:37.860]
I don't understand.

[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.200]
And 10 to midnight, the Beast.

[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.700]
So that's it.

[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:41.980]
Take it or leave it.

[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.180]
I know, they'll leave it.

[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.800]
You know, this article that you fact me, it's a day that somebody sent to us about, uh,

[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.200]
swallery.

[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:47.840]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.000]
And I said it was too long.

[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.200]
I think it's too important just to pass on it.

[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.200]
Well, let's give it a go.

[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.420]
Let's give it a shot.

[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.180]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.360]
I noticed that.

[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.980]
That must be in a very prolonged post-game meeting this morning.

[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.300]
Yeah, it's, uh, you know, taking a little while to get here.

[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.260]
It's a story with that.

[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.820]
See, see, the thing that the whole deal about that is these pre-these post-game, post-mortem

[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.700]
I'll give them.

[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.660]
They've been doing this on a morning show as long as I've been on the station like 11

[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.160]
years plus.

[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.760]
And for the most part, the ratings on a morning show have really sucked until Joe got

[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.200]
back here.

[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.860]
But I mean, most of the show is the ratings have blown in the morning.

[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.180]
That's been the weak link for a long time.

[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.440]
So all these meetings they're having, evidently, aren't getting the job done, you know what I mean?

[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.880]
Well, I think the point is...

[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.700]
What would be the post-game meetings?

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.860]
I don't think anybody should have any post-game meetings.

[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.900]
I think the whole concept of that is so juvenile and so pathetic.

[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.540]
It's just the way for whoever the PD happens to be.

[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.880]
The PD do is your to sit around and play butch boss.

[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.200]
Well, if you guys would have taken a couple of more calls or...

[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.020]
Yeah, you know how that goes.

[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.160]
Like that.

[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.360]
Isn't that how it goes?

[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.320]
I guess I've never been in one so...

[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.840]
Well, believe me, you're not missing anything.

[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.180]
Just a lot of stupid banter.

[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.240]
Like most of our morning shows have been a lot of stupid banter.

[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.500]
Like that Kenyan vote morning show.

[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.700]
I wonder how those post-game shows went.

[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.900]
Those post-game meetings.

[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.060]
No idea.

[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.760]
Oh, great job there, Toast.

[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.420]
Anyway, here's the article by Tan Calabrese.

[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.740]
North Star Writers Group is the site that's on.

[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.040]
Cindicated commentary, opinion, etc.

[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.160]
Tan Calabrese.

[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.180]
It's a headline, Watergate, Eradjudishia, or Echefa staff says, Hillary Clinton fired

[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.060]
for lies on ethical behavior.

[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.040]
As Hillary Clinton came under increasing scrutiny for her story about facing sniper

[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.120]
fire in Bosnia, one question that arose as well as she's engaged in a pattern of lying.

[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]
The not-retired general counsel in Cepha Staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised

[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.880]
Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary's history of lies and

[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.620]
on ethical behavior goes back farther and goes much deeper than anyone realizes.

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.900]
Jeffrey Zipeman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 2070-year-old Hillary Rodham on

[00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.040]
the committee, Hillary got a job working on the investigation to be hast of a fight.

[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.100]
Former law professor Burke Marshall was also Senator Ted Kennedy's chief counsel in

[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.380]
the Chapequeuetic Affair.

[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.140]
When the investigation was over, Zipeman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused

[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.680]
to give her a letter of recommendation, one of only three people who earned that dubious

[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.580]
distinction Zipeman's 17-year career.

[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.000]
Why?

[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.760]
Because she was a liar Zipeman sent in if he were last week.

[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.220]
She was an unethical dishonest lawyer.

[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.380]
She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee,

[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.740]
and the rules of confidentiality.

[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.660]
How could a 2070-year-old House staff member do all that?

[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.100]
She couldn't do it by herself, but Zipeman sent you as one of several individuals including

[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.120]
Marshall, special counsel John Deane, a John Doer, and senior associate special counsel

[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.020]
of future Clinton White House counsel Bernard Musbombe, who engaged in a seemingly implausible

[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.320]
scheme to deny Richard Nixon the right to counsel during the investigation.

[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.000]
Why would they do that?

[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.340]
Because according to Zipeman, they feared putting Watergate break-in mastermind E Howard

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.380]
Holland to stand to be cross-examined by counsel to the president.

[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.360]
Hans Zipeman said had the goods on the Ference activities in the Kennedy administration

[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.640]
that would have made Watergate look like a day at the beach, include Kennedy's purported

[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.440]
complicity in the attempt to disassass nation of Fidel Castro.

[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.580]
The actions of Hillary and her cohorts went directly against the judgment of top Democrats

[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.460]
up to and including that House Majority Leader Tick O'Neill that Nixon clearly had the

[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.080]
right to counsel.

[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.940]
Zipeman says that Hillary along with Marshall, Nispom, and Doerr, was determined to gain

[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.800]
enough votes on the judiciary committee to change House rules and deny counsel Nixon.

[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.240]
In order to pull this wrong off, Zipeman says Hillary wrote a fraudulent legal brief and

[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.540]
confiscated public documents to hide her dissension.

[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.540]
The brief involved precedent for representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding

[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.140]
when Hillary endeavored to write a legal brief arguing there's no right to representation

[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.720]
by counsel during an impeachment proceedings, Zipeman says he told Hillary about the cases

[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.700]
of Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas who faced an impeachment attempt in 1970.

[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.860]
As soon as the impeachment resolution were introduced by then-Houseman, O'Neill leader Gerald

[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.780]
Ford, and they were referred to the House Judiciary Committee, the first thing that

[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.020]
Congress did was hire himself a lawyer, Zipeman said.

[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.140]
The Judiciary Committee allowed Douglas to keep counsel us establishing the precedent.

[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.980]
Zipeman says he told Hillary that all the documents establishing this fact when the Judiciary

[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.000]
Committee files so what did Hillary do?

[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.200]
Hillary then removed all the Douglas files to the offices where she was located which at

[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.160]
that time was secured and inaccessible to the public's Zipeman said.

[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.640]
Hillary then proceeded to write a legal brief arguing there was no precedent for the right

[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.420]
to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding as if the Douglas case had never

[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:20.720]
occurred.

[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.020]
The brief was so fraudulent and ridiculous, Zipeman believes Hillary would have been

[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.920]
disbarred as she'd submitted it to a judge.

[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.240]
Zipeman says that if Hillary Marshall Nistbaum and Doorhead succeeded, members of the House Judiciary

[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.700]
Committee would have also been denied the right to cross-examine witnesses and denied the

[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.920]
opportunity to even participate in the drafting of articles of impeachment against Nixon.

[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.660]
Of course, Nixon's resignation rendered the entire issue moved, ending Hillary's career

[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.980]
on the Judiciary Committee's stampony most un-distinguished manner.

[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.300]
Zipeman says he was urged by top committee members to keep a diary of everything that

[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.900]
was happening he did so and still has to diary if anyone wants to check the veracity

[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.560]
of his story.

[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:00.020]
Certainly, it could have not have known in 1974 that diary entries about a young lawyer

[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.880]
named Hillary Rotten would be of interest to anybody 34 years later.

[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.400]
But they showed that the pattern of lies, deceit, fabrication, and unethical behavior

[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.180]
was established long ago, long before the Bosnian lie and indeed even before cattle futures.

[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.840]
Travelgate and whitewater for the women who is still asking us to make her president of the USA.

[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.760]
Liar liar, your pantaloonies, your pantsuit is on fire.

[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:24.900]
Swoolery.

[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.020]
And anyway, she's all done.

[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.660]
I mean, I just immediately just wants to keep it going forever because otherwise,

[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.900]
how boring would that be?

[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.520]
It's only the April the turd.

[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:35.340]
Yep.

[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.620]
So they got to have something to keep chewing and look at how chewing it's cudd,

[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.620]
chewing it and spitting it and chewing it and spitting it.

[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.580]
778 votes on your poll, man.

[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.160]
You are really kicking ass and are you telling me that Zach still isn't with us?

[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:49.940]
Not yet.

[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.980]
Holy moly must be one hell of a post-game meeting today.

[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.920]
The biggest name.

[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.040]
The best talent.

[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.660]
You're his real rejects.

[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.580]
Fortress you are 5.60 km.

[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.520]
The sports leader.

[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.800]
Man, do I like rap?

[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.300]
Hey, welcome to the show.

[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.840]
My guests today say their relationships are in turmoil and they're here to reveal their shocking

[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.300]
secrets.

[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.480]
I know Hillary said that she would like to sleep with men for money.

[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.200]
Well, it's easy to say yes.

[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.280]
Literally for years.

[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.800]
And you find out that she's been sleeping around that year.

[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.460]
All across America.

[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.180]
I mean, I had the same position for years.

[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.920]
Upside down and backwards.

[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.780]
Well, why do you suddenly start sleeping with your sister?

[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.680]
It didn't happen.

[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.180]
We asked you if you've ever had sex with women.

[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.140]
You said no.

[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.440]
The lie detector test determined that was a lie.

[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.500]
Well, I'm amazed.

[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.860]
A lot of Americans say good for you.

[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.560]
You go, girl.

[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.140]
I'm glad it's her instead of me.

[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.400]
You can't have just discovered that you were gay.

[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:46.980]
Certainly.

[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.740]
I have said that.

[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.200]
Do you have a wild shocking secret for a loved one?

[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.920]
You want to tell them on our show?

[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.920]
Indeed, I did have 200 sexual relationships.

[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.580]
10.30 at 5.60 WQAM.

[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.640]
Happy Thursday to April Turard.

[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.720]
What a marlins took it up the nose last night.

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.320]
13 zip holiday people were there.

[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:05.660]
Do we know?

[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.700]
Oh, look it up, Arna.

[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.840]
Look it up for me.

[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.020]
Azac is still alive with us?

[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.860]
Not yet.

[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.580]
I think that parents is probably just prolonging

[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.780]
this just to epist me off.

[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.660]
That's what it's all about.

[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.820]
Well, maybe you have the meeting.

[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.840]
And now it's taking a choice to cleanse himself with everything.

[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:22.380]

[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.420]
Oh, that's a very perspicuous observation in your part.

[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.900]
So how many people at this game last night?

[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.360]
I'm going on.

[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:30.820]
Hold on.

[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:30.880]
Hold on.

[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.140]
What was it raining yesterday?

[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.660]
Often on early in the day.

[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.460]
I don't think it really rained at night.

[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:36.520]
Well, yeah.

[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.900]
But if it rained sometime during the day,

[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.820]
it's always a good excuse.

[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.680]
It doesn't take much of an excuse to keep people away.

[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.300]
Oh, if it's overcast, it's an excuse.

[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.200]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.120]
If there's a pigeon farting up in the sky somewhere.

[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.760]
So what's the deal?

[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:48.620]
You can't find it?

[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.860]
No, no, I think it's the text a little bit for, you know,

[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.580]
it's a load and everything.

[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.760]
In other words, you don't have like a real newspaper there.

[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.300]
I know.

[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.300]
I don't have any stuff going on online.

[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.980]
Because trying to find that stuff online,

[00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.760]
for what it means, not that they want to make it a secret

[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.200]
or anything like that or that's embarrassing.

[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.920]
13, 720 or 3780, which means a real count

[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.860]
of about eight or nine thousand and probably a six,

[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.140]
seven thousand metz fans.

[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.320]
It was a seven hundred degrees and partly cloudy.

[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.420]
Well, beautiful night for a ballgame.

[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.660]
12 mile per hour win, so you know, night for a win.

[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.060]
Absolutely a perfecto.

[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:18.940]
Couldn't ask for any better.

[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.100]
But, Swiko's opening day, they all look all

[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.900]
the front running phony.

[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.660]
Show up at least.

[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.460]
Joggandah crowds everywhere opening day.

[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.000]
And then on the second day, I went,

[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.160]
you know, that was okay.

[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.780]
But we'll come back some other time.

[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.120]
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton seem to be

[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.080]
lining up behind plans to see Florida's delegates

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.100]
at the Democratic Convention this summer, Denver.

[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.560]
National committee chairman Howard Dean announced today

[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.080]
that the party is committed to including the delegation

[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.640]
as long as both candidates agree

[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.620]
with whatever proposal is adopted.

[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.680]
Specifically, the plan have not been made public.

[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.820]
However, Dean's plan is very consistent with what we'd like

[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.160]
to see happen said Robert Gibbs,

[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.060]
Obama's campaign spokesman, the conference colleague of reporters,

[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.200]
Clinton's can't didn't comment on a specific plan,

[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.800]
but said to see,

[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.640]
Seating the delegation is crucial.

[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:03.940]
It's crucial, baby.

[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.340]
We can't go on without Florida.

[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.240]
We've long maintained that pretending the voters of Florida

[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.260]
Michigan don't exist is not fair and principle

[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.300]
on wise and practice at Phil Singer campaign spokesman.

[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:16.660]
Chairman Dean is clearly committed to

[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.580]
seeking the Florida delegation.

[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.940]
We urge Senator Obama to join us and calling on the rules

[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.140]
and bylaws committee to make this a reality.

[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.360]
Dean at Wednesday with party officials and

[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.900]
Florida lawmakers to discuss options for allocating delegates

[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.640]
between the two party candidates were committed to making sure

[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.920]
we do everything in our power to see the delegation from Florida.

[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.280]
Dean said we believe we'll see the delegation from Florida.

[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.260]
Well, you can't get much more profound than that.

[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.600]
It was critical that Obama and Clinton were comfortable

[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.280]
with the compromises that had to be worked out.

[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.220]
Dean said neither of the campaigns said any

[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.600]
representatives they are allowed to meeting.

[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.680]
That would have made too much sense.

[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.900]
Talks also continue with Michigan Democrats who've also been barred

[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.940]
from the convention.

[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.700]
Not a bit about well anyway.

[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.540]
They'll see them but they just still won't have any votes.

[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.360]
There's something like that.

[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.180]
It'll be fun dog and pony show.

[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.320]
Because if Michigan and Florida wouldn't have been so stupid in the first place

[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.500]
if they would have invited by the DNC rules and held the

[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.380]
primers when they should have been held and if they would allow the people to come

[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.580]
in states and campaign,

[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.020]
there would have been fair primaries and they would have had delegates awarded

[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.320]
and life would go on.

[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.020]
But no, that's because it has to be confusing and it has to be an

[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.360]
attempt to screw the will of the public.

[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.260]
That's what it's all about.

[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.420]
Whatever the people want, we'll do something else.

[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.420]
Kind of like here at QAM.

[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.600]
Whatever you want will put something else on.

[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.140]
All we got DA for jerks today.

[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.180]
And two or five.

[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:31.680]
Wow.

[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.320]
Well he sure misses a lot, you know what?

[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.600]
Mm-hmm.

[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.600]
Our travel season's almost over and he's going to go out.

[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.960]
He has to travel with a team.

[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.080]
What is that all about?

[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.620]
What purpose does he serve?

[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.740]
What is he, he is the sideline entertainment.

[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.640]
What do you mean the sideline entertainment?

[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.160]
What is that?

[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.620]
During the broadcast like when they have a timeout or something like that.

[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.240]
You know, he's the one that goes over and talks to the celebrities or

[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.900]
talks to like, you know, some of their athletes or you know,

[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.660]
tells you what's going on in the bench and everything.

[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.520]
So he's kind of like, you know, the uh,

[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.300]
intermission fill.

[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.140]
What do we need that for?

[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.560]
Just like Joe was saying yesterday,

[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.440]
what do we need all the noise at the baseball games?

[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.960]
What do we need at all the sporting events?

[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.580]
All the damn loud music and screaming and carrying on.

[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.360]
Well, how about a little bit of peace and quiet so the people in the stands

[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.980]
who paid their money can sit there and chat a little bit, you know?

[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.080]
Come on, that's boring.

[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.740]
Oh, Zach is with us.

[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.260]
The boringer.

[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.120]
The boringer.

[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:22.780]
With that Zach.

[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.620]
This was quite a long post show meeting this morning.

[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.360]
What the hell was that all about?

[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:27.860]
Interesting.

[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:33.520]
On Thursdays, we meet with Chris Jones with Lee Feldman and with Josh

[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.800]
for like weekly big meeting.

[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.560]
Jai Hu.

[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.200]
Deerol?

[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:37.900]
Clarence, yes.

[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.840]
Clarence, well, yeah,

[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.780]
Josh Cordish's just to us.

[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.760]
Clarence is Clarence.

[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.720]
They get Clarence.

[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.300]
Clarence, Chris Jones, Lee Feldman and the Morning Crew.

[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.000]
Yeah.

[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.360]
And we discuss promotional stuff.

[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.260]
We discuss sales stuff with Joe and we discuss,

[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.940]
discuss programming stuff with Clarence.

[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.500]
Sales stuff with Joe?

[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.340]
Well, Joe, yeah, all those things going on in Joe's sales life.

[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.800]
You know, all those life spots.

[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:01.900]
Oh Joe Rose.

[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:02.740]
Yeah, sorry.

[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.780]
I think it meant Joe Bell.

[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.740]
No, Joe Bell was not in the meeting this morning.

[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.000]
Well, thank God for that.

[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.700]
Maybe he's busy negotiating with Norma Kent to get me signed

[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.300]
up for the next 500 years or something.

[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:12.820]
We all know.

[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:13.860]
So we all know.

[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.260]
Certainly doubt it.

[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:14.800]
I doubt that.

[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.440]
Hey, Norma, doesn't, Norma doesn't make anything happen.

[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.060]
He just talks a lot on the phone on those rare occasions, you know?

[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.200]
He should do radio.

[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.920]
He has made a feeble attempt.

[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.860]
So these meetings are every day after the show?

[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.160]
No, no.

[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.400]
Thursdays are the big ones.

[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.760]
The normal ones between me, Greg, Jesse, and Joe are daily.

[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.400]
And what do you discuss in those meetings?

[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.800]
What we're doing tomorrow on the show and how bad Joe's wife is going to rip him

[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.860]
after the show for what he said.

[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.580]
If he said anything personal on there.

[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.640]
And what new things to sing, I think also they talk about.

[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.000]
Yes, new singing stuff too, yes.

[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.500]
Oh, new singing spots, okay.

[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.640]
You'll feel like you've gone from the factory.

[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.720]
I like, I just, I don't even know what to say about that.

[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.080]
I'm about to love that.

[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.580]
You gotta love that.

[00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.580]
Around the clock one, too.

[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.860]
That's a little chippy.

[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.040]
Remember chippy, but yeah, I almost forgot about it.

[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.420]
Well, chippy.

[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:04.720]
Yeah.

[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.960]
I think she's starting in your life spots.

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.480]
No, I'm not gonna, well, I don't have any, okay?

[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.440]
I don't have any.

[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.320]
You can say you want to.

[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.340]
That's the one thing that this sales department under the leadership

[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.260]
of greatly touted and awarded Chris Jones has accomplished.

[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.280]
They've blown away virtually every account that was ever on the show.

[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.740]
In fact, we didn't have the two from one restaurant deal.

[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.660]
We wouldn't have anything.

[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.500]
We have nobody.

[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.600]
No, we have my friend Steve from alternative to my management.

[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.260]
That's it.

[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360]
That's the melody of my spot.

[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.780]
Zach has got as many sponsors as I've got.

[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.160]
That's the fabulous job that our sales department has done

[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.000]
in the last couple of years.

[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.140]
They've blown everybody away.

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.220]
Remember the days, even Chris can remember when you used to have a lot of people.

[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.700]
Oh, yeah, it was like last but every break.

[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.340]
Not no more.

[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.080]
We ain't got nothing.

[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.880]
Which this year doesn't make a whole lot of difference.

[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.460]
Starting next year, it could make a lot of difference.

[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.620]
It could really frost my ass and create a lot of animosity.

[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.760]
I'm saying a lot of hostility.

[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.260]
But we'll see.

[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:57.940]
What do you mean?

[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.840]
Because I'm sure with our great sales staff, like, you know,

[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.060]
Todd Dreck and Muff.

[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.080]
Muff was like a house on fire.

[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.700]
Now it's kind of like we've got left with the ashes.

[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.700]
Everything is burned to the ground.

[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.600]
Here's the a poll right now.

[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.660]
It doesn't pay to be cheap when it comes to blank.

[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.860]
We have 803 vote already.

[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.380]
Why, but you Chris is all puffed up like a like a parakeet or a cockatoo.

[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.400]
Is he?

[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.040]
Yeah, because you know you're going to get your thousand EZ.

[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.680]
Oh, yeah, easy.

[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.480]
Maybe 1100.

[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.780]
I told you why.

[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.020]
Why?

[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:32.780]
Because you there?

[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.280]
Because I'm here.

[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.320]
For a crap.

[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.260]
You're only there because there's food coming in and you're going to cheat on that diet.

[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:37.720]
I'm not.

[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:38.580]
I got a grilled chicken.

[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.300]
What are they doing now?

[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.180]
You got what?

[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.780]
A grilled chicken sees your salad.

[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.000]
With no dressing.

[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.280]
Coming from, uh,

[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:44.900]
Mm-hmm.

[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.080]
Blue seals, yeah.

[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:47.920]
Come on.

[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.000]
I'm telling you in other words, they already took you guys order.

[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.420]
Well, uh, Duff asked for some suggestions yesterday.

[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.360]
I look at Brian Schmutz by the way.

[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.300]
I want to give the run down to the great job of the sales department.

[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.420]
So a nice job there, Brian.

[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.140]
You're doing it.

[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.120]
12 of paper 223 prostitutes 100.

[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.940]
Don't be cheap when it comes to employees.

[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.020]
93.

[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.000]
Tell that to the beesleys.

[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.020]
Please.

[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.560]
Stakes 83.

[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.520]
Shoes 82.

[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.740]
Mechanics 34.

[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.600]
Cars 30.

[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.640]
Scots 30.

[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.460]
And for that, I mean, you know, I mean, when you get to ketchup, then what's the point?

[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.000]
I guess the lawyers already has four of them.

[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.620]
I mean, have you ever had cheap ketchup?

[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:25.420]
Yes.

[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:25.960]
Yes, just the thing.

[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:27.420]
I only know two kinds of ketchup.

[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.700]
There's, uh, Delmani and other street kinds.

[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.140]
Hines, Delmani and Hunts.

[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.280]
I'm always known any other kind of ketchup.

[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.020]
Publix.

[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.960]
Publix makes their own ketchup.

[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.720]
Well, they have their own, their own brand.

[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.100]
Brand, but if I remember correctly, it's actually, I think it's Hines or something.

[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.640]
For whatever, all those deals.

[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.460]
Like the drugsters, you know, Walgreens, vitamins, it's all made by, you know,

[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.460]
like a real vitamin company.

[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.800]
And they put their brand name on it.

[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.320]
Yeah, now there are some bad ketchup.

[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.560]
It's like some really cheap, like watery ketchup's out there.

[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.420]
Such as, I don't remember the name.

[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:03.720]
Yeah.

[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.320]
It was that bad.

[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.700]
No name ketchup, generic ketchup.

[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.120]
Because that's always a bad sound.

[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.860]
It is like no label on the bottle and it looks like real runny, you know?

[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.720]
Like, you think it's ketchup, but it's not.

[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.120]
Like that.

[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:14.900]
At least it's not green.

[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:15.780]
It's not green.

[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.720]
Don't be eaten ketchup.

[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.900]
It's loaded with sugar, okay?

[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.980]
It's got the, and anything that needs ketchup on it,

[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.060]
it shouldn't be eating the first place.

[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:22.100]
Hamburgers?

[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.280]
Yeah.

[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.640]
Hot dog burgers.

[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.820]
Cheeseburgers don't need ketchup.

[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:27.640]
Why not?

[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.380]
Of course they do.

[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:28.820]
What do you talk about?

[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.580]
Of course they don't.

[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.220]
No, they do not.

[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:30.520]

[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.720]
No, they don't.

[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.280]
They need bacon in the slice of tomato.

[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.500]
They're in a slice of onion.

[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.780]
And a little double to you.

[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.740]
No, a little bit.

[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.740]
They don't need mayonnaise.

[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.600]
mayonnaise is for the mayo.

[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.080]
Oh, mayonnaise.

[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:39.780]
Look.

[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.060]
The biggest name.

[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.640]
That's a heeftenchure fetight to your new year wheelchair,

[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.760]
Chem tag sports or staying avec the unbe attached sports leader.

[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.220]
Stop saying the new Roger show!

[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.240]
Softly are the Stay Chanard

[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.980]
Turbo, starting right now on Daddy bird's nest.

[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.880]
Double into it!

[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:17.260]
From England, Asia, with heat and hoops and hoops and hoops and heaps

[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.180]
Which Martin Madden is all the way to the long and I'm a one-note Charlie David.

[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:28.840]
Heat and hoops and hoops and hoops and heaps and hoops and heaps and hoops and heaps

[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.180]
That's the only go I know there.

[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.200]
That's why I can't get laid and do the log.

[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.660]
I'm joining the day, the O'Losses are in Lagubri as a bow-hower, David.

[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.560]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.460]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:41.880]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.740]
You guys see, I brought Nieldi with you.

[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.720]
Yeah, unfortunately, he lost the power of speech from all the handling at the birthday game.

[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.380]
Yeah!

[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.560]
Yeah!

[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.040]
Yeah!

[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.160]
Yeah!

[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:53.580]
Yeah!

[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.220]
Yeah!

[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:54.980]

[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.220]
What?

[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.020]
What did he say?

[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.500]
Yeah, he said he lost the power of speech from all the handling at the birthday game.

[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.520]
Oh, you know, but that ain't the worst part.

[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.560]
Now, he'll never attain his dream.

[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:06.640]
And what's that?

[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.060]
To be a big dancing girl.

[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:08.660]
Oh?

[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.520]
So, uh, it was the real reason you're here.

[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.720]
To get you fired, and get my whole job back.

[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.560]
I'm just out you're gonna do that through the joggle down under.

[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.060]
It's a little enough.

[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.480]
Say, uh, to the log.

[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.240]
Just one more time.

[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.080]
Okay.

[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.460]
To the log.

[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.820]
Oh, best thing that happened in the log and a log time.

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.100]
14, 4, 11, and 5, 60, W.

[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:33.640]
It comes to me.

[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.700]
I have a sack with us again today.

[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.380]
He's here to eat.

[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:36.320]
Absolutely.

[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.560]
Over an hour we'll do our two for one thing with loose seals.

[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.420]
So, Joe is down to 55 last time I checked.

[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.540]
I noticed yesterday afternoon late that we had got him down to 57 left on that thing in his

[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:46.720]
memory.

[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:46.940]
Yes.

[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.720]
That way, uh, whatever.

[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.840]
He'll get on the cafe, yeah.

[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.260]
So, we did a fine job for him.

[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.740]
I'm sure I hope that he kissed my ass and my feet and my armpits profusely over that.

[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.200]
He did.

[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.520]
He told me to tell you thank you very much for your...

[00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:58.960]
No, he didn't.

[00:33:59.120 --> 00:33:59.560]
Yes, he did.

[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.240]
He said if you were here, he would wash your feet for you.

[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:02.860]
Did he?

[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:03.600]
With his tongue.

[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:04.160]
No.

[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.380]
Here's a good fact.

[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.100]
This is a good idea.

[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.580]
From our friends that were really dived.

[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.280]
How do you like that?

[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.420]
There are friends now that boat campers over that other place.

[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.020]
Now, is he officially gone or gone?

[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.660]
Um, I think he's still here.

[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.480]
Is just not many opportunities at the moment.

[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.020]
Please add to the poll, TV said.

[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.620]
That's a great one.

[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.360]
It doesn't pay to be cheap when it comes to buying a TV set.

[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.740]
That's absolutely correct.

[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.680]
Who wants a cheap TV for Christ's sake?

[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.040]
Especially now, you know, all the big screen TVs,

[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.580]
flash screen, big screen, wide screen.

[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.740]
How about electronics in general?

[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:40.340]
No.

[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:40.980]
Okay.

[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.900]
I mean, if you want to, what do I care?

[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.600]
You've already got an MP3 player on there, which is part of electronics.

[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.600]
I'll put TVs.

[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.140]
TV said.

[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.320]
Do I can get you a nice, uh, like I got, Samsung.

[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.260]
Man, that's a great set.

[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.740]
I'm telling you right now, do whatever you want.

[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.680]
But go out and get a Samsung.

[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.400]
It's my suggestion.

[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.520]
That's what I have.

[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:01.640]
Do you?

[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.060]
I have a 47-inch Samsung.

[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:04.980]
Yes, no, you don't.

[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.700]
Because they don't make it.

[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.300]
It's 46.

[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:06.880]
That's 46.

[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.240]
You just want to pretend that yours is bigger than mine.

[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.300]
Yes.

[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.240]
That's what you don't think there's any doubt about that.

[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.260]
But that's beside the point.

[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.140]
You have 46 Samsung.

[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.320]
It's a primo, baby.

[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.060]
And if you've got a really big room to put it in, you can get a bigger one now, like 50, whatever.

[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.160]
52.

[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.360]
Great set.

[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:30.420]
The Florida House yesterday amounted to what critics called a two-prongous sold-on abortion rights

[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.820]
passing legislation that would require pregnant women to undergo ultrasound exams before

[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.240]
getting abortion that effectively defining life at conception for criminal prosecutions.

[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.340]
The reason I paused there is because we had a couple of polls coming in now.

[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.780]
Brandon came up with a pretty good one and somebody else sent him one.

[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.780]
Thank you.

[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.280]
Charlie B abandoned us.

[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.880]
God, what a, you know, hard ass.

[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.500]
Just because George made fun of a couple of his really bad polls, embarrassingly bad polls

[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.740]
right away, he just vanished.

[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.600]
He don't communicate at all with me anymore.

[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.780]
Charlie B, he's run away.

[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.000]
Oh, gee, they're picking on me just because I'm an overgrown baby.

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.200]
Like that, you know, too bad.

[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.640]
Anybody that sends me a poll, what's your favorite sandwich filling?

[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.780]
Even Tutsi over there in Iowa D, even he would laugh at that.

[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.440]
I bet you he's still doing is what's the best burger thing, you know?

[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:17.820]
Probably.

[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.700]
Anyway, getting back to this sticking there knows in your private thing.

[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.240]
Any woman seeking a terminated pregnancy would be required to pay for an ultrasound procedure.

[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.500]
And view the results unless she signed a waiver before having the abortion under a bill passed

[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.700]
by the House largely at large party lines.

[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.100]
The Republican led chamber also endorsed a fetal homicide bill that would create a separate

[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:44.200]
murder charge for anyone who caused a pregnancy to be terminated through an act of violence against

[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:44.940]
a pregnant woman.

[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.820]
It defines an unborn child as a fetus at any stage of development beginning a conception.

[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:54.940]
I can't imagine any man having a surgical procedure without prior test representative

[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.600]
Marty Cooley, Republican of Panama City said during debate over the ultrasound bill,

[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:03.440]
as a woman as a mother, I ask you to support this bill not to invade privacy but to ensure

[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.240]
that all women are offered safe healthcare.

[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:05.860]
Right.

[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.560]
Now because you want to stick your nose on you right wingers, stick your nose in everybody's

[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.920]
a private and everybody's business.

[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.160]
That's what it's all about.

[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.220]
For this state, this Florida man, it is so near your thought, just it's amazing.

[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:23.280]
2008 and these people are like Busha Mugwams, peace of award days.

[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.060]
The House measures facing unfair future in the center which in past years has killed similar

[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.640]
measures as hasn't yet set time aside the debate issue this year.

[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.120]
Governor Charlie Gaye, who signature would be required to the bill's become law's been

[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.280]
silent on the matter.

[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:37.840]
He's been mom.

[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.140]
Democrats argue that Borscht measures will a little more than government invasion into

[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.020]
a private health matter.

[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.340]
This isn't about protecting the rights of women representative Joyce Q. Sack, Democrat

[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.940]
of the land said, it's about eroding the rights of women.

[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.220]
I'm so disappointed we spend this kind of time on something that's really none of our

[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:53.540]
business.

[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.020]
There you go, none of our business.

[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.980]
That's what it's all about.

[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.360]
Into people's bedrooms, into people's bodies, into people's act of asses.

[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.820]
Everywhere they can stick their nose, these right wingers.

[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.880]
And they talk about, oh, they don't want big government.

[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.960]
They don't believe in giving, no, they believe in big brother government is what they believe

[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:08.260]
in.

[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.920]
Big brother, George Earl will be so proud of their tapping your phones, their reading

[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.700]
your damn emails.

[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.700]
Anything they can get their hands on, finding out what books you're checking out of the

[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.040]
library.

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.220]
Just double checking your porn out tapes, all of these things, bastards, lunatics.

[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.380]
This is what happens when you put a bunch of Nazis in power.

[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:28.840]
All right.

[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.180]
So, your meeting had nothing to do with the show, is that what you're saying?

[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.340]
No, we talked a little bit about the show and what about the show?

[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.800]
What we're going to have tomorrow, what appearances Joe's going to have.

[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.420]
I think Joe's going to have appearance next week.

[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.620]
And he's going to be on with hopefully the mad dog on next Friday or two Friday's from

[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:45.740]
now.

[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:45.960]
Yeah.

[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.960]
And guess, it's coming up and the beast is the beast going to be on?

[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:51.380]
No.

[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.040]
To defend himself.

[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:52.660]
I have.

[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.560]
Why not?

[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.020]
I think that's the least since Clarence has so upset about that the least they can do is

[00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.120]
let the beast come on and defend himself against Joe's ripping him a fat ass.

[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.720]
I've made the, I'm going to the fat part.

[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.700]
I've made the executive decision to X-N-A on all the beast stuff on the show for now.

[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.380]
Well, what do you mean?

[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.360]
What the, wait a minute.

[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.080]
Wait a minute.

[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.740]
I want to go.

[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.380]
I just, I want to slow down a second because you know, as short as I keep my hair, it's

[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.900]
a little bit, I have to, I have to shave it again here next year or two.

[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.200]
It's got a little bit longer than I like it.

[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.080]
It's not long, but it's, it needs to be shaved back.

[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.900]
And it just stood up on end, which is a miracle for hair this short.

[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.620]
You made an executive decision as to what Joe's going to talk about?

[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.500]
No, just that, the content from the beast stuff.

[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.660]
Isn't that what he just said, Chris?

[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.080]
Yeah.

[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.960]
We're not, I don't want to talk about the beast stuff anymore.

[00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.840]
I don't think we should as a show.

[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.700]
We shouldn't do it anymore.

[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.780]
So, in other words, you're making decisions for what the subject matter is going to be

[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.280]
on the show.

[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.700]
Sometimes, I help out with that.

[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.000]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.820]
I thought Joe was a big macho guy.

[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.240]
Old number 80 dolphins, baby.

[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.420]
I thought he used to take those naked showers in a lot of room with all the real, the real

[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:53.700]
men.

[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.580]
And he's such a worst that he's letting you make it.

[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.960]
Can you imagine George telling me what I'm going to talk about on the show, Chris?

[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.440]
Can you, can you, can you, can you begin to believe that that could ever happen?

[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.020]
I don't know if it's going to happen or not, but I just said that we shouldn't do it

[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.260]
anymore.

[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.380]
That's not what you said.

[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:12.220]
You said you made an executive decision.

[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:12.440]

[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.440]
I'm excited for the show.

[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.640]
The man with ego is wanting to have a man with poopic.

[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.660]
Because your poopic is declining in size.

[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.840]
Your ego is becoming inflated, my god.

[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.160]
Who and how are you to tell Joe Rose what to do on the air?

[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.920]
I could just suggest things.

[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:26.600]
That's all I could do.

[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.560]
That's not what you said.

[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:28.340]
You said you made it.

[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.080]
We could play it back for if you want.

[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.100]
Well, I made this decision.

[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:31.980]
You said you made it.

[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:32.180]

[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.460]
The executive decision that we are going to be talking about the beast anymore about being

[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.000]
a big fat slaw was going to die soon.

[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]
We shouldn't do it anymore.

[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.080]
It's just not good content.

[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.720]
I'm not debating that.

[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.020]
So I just told him that we shouldn't do it and he agreed.

[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.100]
It's like it's on the air tomorrow.

[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.320]
Yeah, if you get on the air and start talking about smart, you see how far my executive role plays on the Joe Rose show.

[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:53.840]
Yeah.

[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.280]
From here to the wall.

[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:56.360]
More than likely.

[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:00.700]
But you better calm yourself down.

[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.000]
You're getting really carried away with it.

[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.620]
No wonder.

[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.420]
You know something?

[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.800]
I'm not getting you understand a little bit about that one.

[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:13.620]
There's no understanding that there was no role played in that show except for what do you want and I can't help you with that.

[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.340]
The real audience.

[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.080]
That's what he wanted.

[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.060]
It was a big audience and nobody could help him with that.

[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.300]
I answered that with like I can't help you with that.

[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:22.840]
Yeah.

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.320]
A real number.

[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:32.600]
Well, I still have no response to my email to Norma Kent and I'm sure I'm not going to get one because she's, you know, she's busy defending other people.

[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.420]
She's a regular degenerate species.

[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.340]
I thought maybe he was at the ballpark.

[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:43.900]
He's probably at the ballpark watching practice watching, uh, maybe he's at the scrimmage watching the guys grab each other's private or something like that.

[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.980]
One thing about her though, I'll say you know it's one thing to be a professional queen.

[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.660]
It's another thing to be a full time professional queen.

[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:51.400]
You know what I mean by that?

[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:51.840]
Norma?

[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:52.100]
What do you mean?

[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.800]
Maybe he's out cruising right now for some runaways.

[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:55.680]
I don't know what he's doing.

[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.120]
Or is that a half 30 or whatever you said?

[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.000]
You get any spirit sent him up here, okay?

[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.720]
On Chris's pool, we got a 27, man.

[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.240]
I don't know what that means.

[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.320]
Well, I know what it means.

[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.600]
We started during the show yesterday.

[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.800]
If we get to a thousand early, we'll do the same thing again.

[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.040]
You want to hear what tomorrow's pool is?

[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.220]
You won't be happy with it.

[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:13.700]
Oh boy.

[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.340]
I might have to change it.

[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.880]
It was one from our good friend Sean from Hollywood, who means well.

[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.740]
What's the worst performance to still win an Oscar?

[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:33.660]
And there's a list here of two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, fifteen, including Tom Hanks and Forest Dump.

[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.700]
Oh, that was an opportunity.

[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.160]
El Pacino is set of a woman.

[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.240]
I'm going to tell you, I don't have to look down the list very far.

[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.920]
You know what my vote is going to be.

[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.060]
I didn't even want to see that set of a woman.

[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.060]
No, I did.

[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.000]
You did?

[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:46.520]
I did?

[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.580]
I thought it was a pretty good movie.

[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.160]
Oh my God.

[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.640]
He should have gotten 20 years for overacting in a movie, Pacino.

[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.780]
That was just beyond description.

[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.600]
And apply it in a play of blind dates.

[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.060]
Oh my God.

[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.020]
So you had to get over it.

[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.160]
Have you know how a blind man acts?

[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.700]
How do you know that?

[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.840]
So you had to go when he was driving the vet around the streets of New York.

[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:12.580]
That was funny.

[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:12.900]
Yes.

[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.440]
That was good.

[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.340]
So Zach liked that and he also doesn't want Joe talking about the beat.

[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.040]
Anything else you'd want him discussing on the show?

[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.860]
No, everything else is about square table and round table and gay or not gay.

[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.420]
Can we do that?

[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:26.600]
Gay.

[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.080]
No, no.

[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:28.600]
No, no.

[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.020]
Maybe toast ought to be producing that show.

[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:32.520]
No.

[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.560]
And then you guys can get numbers like, no, like Kenny and Bo God.

[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:38.700]
Woo!

[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.380]
We're never doing a number of what I can still smell it.

[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.300]
We're striving for that as the best talent.

[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.560]
Peter is now a judge.

[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.540]
Sport ready to 5.60 km.

[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.740]
We're the sports leader.

[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.880]
This is the Neil Roger Show.

[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.980]
What's all it is?

[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.660]
This is your brain.

[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.620]
Who could think that would be any question?

[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.820]
We thought of it all and tried to say,

[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:20.240]
but we were not doing it all.

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.240]

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.240]

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.240]

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.240]

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.240]

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:20.240]

[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.860]
We were not doing it all.

[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.060]
We were not doing it all.

[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.000]
We were not doing it all.

[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:25.280]
We were not doing it all.

[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.780]
We were not doing it all.

[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:34.460]
We were not doing it all.

[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.800]
We were not doing it all.

[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.540]
And is the normish cheek?

[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.360]
I want to know what John McHanky?

[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.880]
And is the normish cheek?

[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.560]
Is he story-needing us by the power?

[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.060]
I'm little, thin and sharp, thin and has been a foul.

[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:00.560]
Woo!

[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.680]
We're watching the hiding.

[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:12.920]
Many things are deciding who else is he defining?

[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.800]
Always lunch is his secret, doesn't swallow what he eats.

[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.160]
I want to know what John McHanky is?

[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.180]
And is the normish cheek?

[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.720]
I want to know what John McHanky is?

[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.400]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:38.020]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:38.140]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:38.140]

[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:38.140]

[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.340]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.000]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.260]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.140]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.720]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.840]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.480]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.180]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.560]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.380]
It is the normish cheek.

[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:26.960]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:27.580]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.120]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.220]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:31.680]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:31.840]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.120]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:32.120]

[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:32.120]

[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:32.120]

[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:32.120]

[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:32.240]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:32.320]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:32.360]
I would tell you that.

[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:32.540]
What?

[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.320]
Philippine.

[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.680]
You know, it used to be Ryan Philippe, okay?

[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.180]
I think it is Philippine now.

[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.640]
And now it is Philippine.

[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.520]
I know what it is now.

[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.360]
I know my Ryan Philippe, okay?

[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.180]
Believe me.

[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.660]
Real close and personal.

[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.280]
I sure.

[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.600]
I would like to.

[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.920]
Anyway, during a chat with Ryan Philippe,

[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.880]
that word then criticized by gay activists

[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.580]
and other people magazine says.

[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.080]
In talking about Ryan's first rule,

[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.880]
I realized what I said came out wrong.

[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.360]
Jay Leno said,

[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.100]
I certainly didn't mean any malice.

[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.420]
I agree it was something to say and I apologize.

[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.960]
Philippe's first rule was as a gay teenager

[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.460]
on the soap,

[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.520]
one life to live.

[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:07.920]
While talking with Philippe

[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.440]
as appearance aired March 19,

[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.740]
it was key to his new movie,

[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:11.600]
Stop Lost,

[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.640]
Leno 57 said to the actor,

[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:14.920]
can you give me, like, say,

[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.060]
say that your camera is your gay lover?

[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.640]
Despite Philippe's instant discomfort,

[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:21.500]
Leno went on to say,

[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.940]
can you give me your gayest look?

[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.740]
Wow, reply Philippe 33.

[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.000]
That's something I don't want to do.

[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.820]
Can you give me your gayest look?

[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.620]
Yesterday the gay rights group GLAAD

[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:33.440]
condemned the remarks.

[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.120]
They're also GLAAD that he said it.

[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.620]
We're proud of Ryan for refusing to participate

[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.180]
in Leno's thoughtless attempted humor

[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.780]
said, GLAAD President Neil G. Juliano.

[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.720]
Under the guise of comedy

[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.700]
the talk show host is demonstrating a lack of respect

[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.460]
for the gay community

[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.380]
and in sense, the activity devoted to his co-workers

[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.960]
and the audience toomios and apology.

[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.940]
And he apologized because he's a wimp.

[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.080]
If you took away his chin,

[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.060]
he wouldn't be making 40.

[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.260]
He'd be on the street corner here.

[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.540]
Sperson change, mister!

[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.460]
That's what he'd be doing.

[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.620]
Jay Leno, he's about as funny as a broken leg.

[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.080]
Sonia, what?

[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.560]
Can you give us your gayest look?

[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.260]
You're looking at it right now.

[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:10.660]
Wow!

[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:11.900]
BAAAING!

[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:12.700]
That's it.

[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.140]
Much you do about nothing.

[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.380]
You know, but a stupid thing to say.

[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.000]
And that's just, that's America for you.

[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:20.200]
Stupid.

[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.500]
The Reverend Robert, how do you say this?

[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.800]
Your gay 43 was taken into the coffee by you.

[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.440]
Your gay?

[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.320]
Oh, you are not.

[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:28.700]
You are.

[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.420]
That's not an eye.

[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.660]
Well, you shot up.

[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.400]
All of a sudden he's doing stick now.

[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.700]
You know, since Zach has been on the show last couple days,

[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.000]
now Chris is doing stick.

[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.400]
Well, there's no George, so.

[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.360]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.160]
Nothing George learned over the years.

[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:41.880]
Not number one.

[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.220]
He doesn't tell me what to talk about or what to say on the year,

[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.800]
which I, I don't think I'm ever going to recover from that.

[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.240]
There is Zach Crance sitting there on his fat ass,

[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.300]
telling us he made an executive decision

[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.620]
that we should not talk about these studies.

[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.680]
You don't make executive decisions.

[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.740]
I never produce it.

[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.540]
It doesn't make any executive.

[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.160]
What kind of executive are you?

[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:01.820]
Straw boss?

[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:02.860]
Maybe.

[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.060]
He made an executive decision.

[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.160]
I'm actually the audience who were people driving off the road

[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:08.880]
when you said that.

[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:09.980]
Maybe.

[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.700]
And if it is true, and if Joe Rose has let you play Butch Boss,

[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.600]
man, he's a bigger Winf-Hen ever dreamed he was.

[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:17.260]
I don't think so.

[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.540]
He's not letting me play Boss.

[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.680]
He just takes my pick.

[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:20.940]
Because I remember way back in the beginning

[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.760]
when we first came to the station, me and George,

[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.860]
and we went in, and he was wild about the,

[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.100]
about the format on the worst team show,

[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.660]
screaming and carrying on.

[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:31.280]
Because they had like 80-billion spot.

[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.840]
Of course, now they've got 80-billion spots too,

[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.000]
and he's not screaming and carrying on.

[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.060]
Because he, you know, he's happy to have the job.

[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.100]
Well, now he has all the spots instead of sharing them

[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:38.700]
with two other people.

[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.320]
No, that's right.

[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.880]
You know, if you have all the spots in your pocket like the judges

[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.700]
like Don Corleone, you must share.

[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.040]
You can send us a bill for your services

[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.960]
because after all, we are not communists.

[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.980]
Whatever that line was from Barzini.

[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.880]
Well, he was a great actor.

[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.280]
Who know, was that the played by Zini?

[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.360]
Richard Coney.

[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.460]
That guy.

[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.180]
He was in Clovonis.

[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.000]
Who is a great actor?

[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.560]
Anyway, the Reverend Robert Yergl, 43,

[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.200]
was taken into custody by US Marshals

[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.860]
in Pasek, New Jersey, where he lives,

[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:08.980]
will be extra-led into Charlotte, North Carolina,

[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.040]
arrested after having charges of having sex in Charlotte

[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.880]
with a 14-year-old boy in 1999.

[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.700]
Another isolated incident.

[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.020]
Mechland Berger, assistant V.A. Kelly Miller,

[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.680]
who authorized the Wants Charging Yerglow,

[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.960]
said the boy and his family were members of St. Matthew.

[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.220]
Now, the largest Catholic church in the 46th County,

[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.920]
dies he's of Charlotte at the time of the alleged sex crimes.

[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.000]
Yerglow, remember, the order of

[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.460]
Capuchin Franciscan Friars?

[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.500]
Well, Vichyinos Friar Tuck.

[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.100]
Was wanted on five counts of taking indecent liberties

[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.460]
with a child in two counts of statutory sex offense.

[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.320]
The alleged victim now in his early 20s

[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.480]
recently reported the matter to Charlotte Mechland Berger,

[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.700]
detectives, Poli, said.

[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.200]
Both Miller and Charlotte dies he's spokesman David Haines

[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.500]
said Yerglow's case is the first involving a Catholic priest

[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.740]
in which the alleged incidents happened in Charlotte.

[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.420]
With other accusations involving Catholic priest in Charlotte,

[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.040]
the alleged misconduct to her and other cities.

[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.780]
As far as I can ask her to ascertain,

[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.580]
this is the first time we have a situation involving

[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.420]
a priest and a victim both in the city's Charlotte Haines,

[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.000]
as if.

[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.980]
He said that I see he didn't know about the accusations against Yerglow

[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:10.820]
until Wednesday afternoon.

[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:11.880]
We were caught a little off-guard.

[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.500]
He said, we know nothing about this.

[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.940]
Haines said a check of Yerglow's personal file

[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.380]
didn't turn up questions regarding sexual misconduct involving young people.

[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.660]
He declined to discuss any other aspect of Yerglow's personal file.

[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.800]
Because of a shortage of priests in the Charlotte Dices,

[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.580]
Catholic Order, oh, there's the sirens going to come in again and be heard.

[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:30.940]
Yep.

[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.760]
Oh, they're coming to get your father.

[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.220]
Because of a shortage of priests in the Charlotte Dices,

[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.240]
Catholic Order is a priest-based elsewhere,

[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.300]
ever viewed over the years, to staff some parishes.

[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.620]
You know why there's a shortage of priests in the Charlotte Dices?

[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:43.700]
Why's that?

[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.380]
Because there's a shortage of altar boys.

[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.120]
That would do it.

[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:50.180]
Yerglow's order currently provides the priest at St. Thomas Aquinas

[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.640]
in our Lady of Constellation of parishes in Charlotte.

[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.240]
In the late 90s, it's staffed St. Matthew, a 26,000-member church,

[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.840]
and the Valentiner is, it's now run by local diocesan priests.

[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.260]
And it goes on and on about he did this, he did that,

[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:05.720]
and they're surprised and they're shocked.

[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.360]
He's well-liked, he's loved, and et cetera.

[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.420]
Miller said she didn't know why the alleged victim waited nearly 10 years

[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.220]
to report them all the stations that said it's not unusual for children to wait years

[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.640]
before disclosing sexual conduct with adults.

[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.560]
That's often been the case with widespread allegations of child sex abuse involving priests.

[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.320]
They've come to like only in recent years,

[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.160]
plunging the US Catholic Church into scandal,

[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.220]
but most of the crimes happened decades ago.

[00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.440]
The ones we know about now, the ones that are happening now,

[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.640]
will find out in 20-30 years.

[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.340]
Some of us will be long since dead, which of course is what they're hoping.

[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.620]
That's why we know nothing about the JFK assassination,

[00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.760]
the Martin Luther King assassination, the Bobby Kennedy assassination.

[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.200]
Who'd I leave out?

[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:42.540]
Anybody?

[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]
All of these things.

[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.240]
Oh my God.

[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:47.020]
All of these things.

[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.140]
We don't know the truth, and never will in our lifetime,

[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.400]
because they make up all the stories.

[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.980]
Everybody's got stories to pacify the public.

[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.300]
Oh, gee, that's interesting, and what a shame, and life goes on.

[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:57.860]
They lie a lot,

[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:02.180]
because the people around the world have a vested interest in making danger.

[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.020]
We don't know the truth about anything, including 9-11, for example,

[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.640]
including who killed Cock Robyn,

[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.760]
including who's the real executive producer of the Joe Rosho.

[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.240]
That would be me.

[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.960]
Made an executive decision.

[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.340]
It's just the words just keep like a claw.

[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.280]
Clong at my brain.

[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:27.020]
Zack made an executive decision that it's bad radio to keep,

[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.480]
and of course Zack was influenced no doubt by our program director.

[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.480]
No, I was not.

[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.840]
Who was fuming, forming at the mouth at his fat little boyfriend

[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.720]
was being picked on too much by a good old Jolly on Jolly Joe.

[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.140]
On Holy Joe.

[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.920]
Years ago we had Holy Joe, now we got on Holy Joe.

[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.600]
Quick picking on the bass, Joe.

[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.240]
Quick picking on the defenseless, okay?

[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.060]
Oh, he's got his own time on it.

[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.540]
Yeah, he's doing his own shows.

[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:56.820]
I doubt the bitch right now.

[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.540]
I bet you would.

[00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.660]
He's got his own time.

[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:00.920]
He's on there tonight from 10 to midnight.

[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.920]
He can rip Joe and ask.

[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:02.440]
There you go.

[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.300]
Well, is he taking it personal?

[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.800]
Is he upset or is it the...

[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.120]
I don't know.

[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.260]
I haven't spoken to him in his behalf.

[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.640]
I have not spoke to Beast, nor did I speak to really Josh on the matter

[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.460]
besides what I said to Joe.

[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:16.820]
I just said, you know what, it was funny to hear from a couple of days ago.

[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.620]
It's not the end of his sports, first of all.

[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.120]
He's supposed to be a sport show?

[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:19.460]
Yes.

[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:21.660]
But what about a beast after it was sports?

[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.440]
I thought that's a little bit of a pain to be.

[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.600]
It's your more interesting than the heat, I'll tell you that.

[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:26.120]
Oh yeah.

[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:26.480]

[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.140]
Freaking Marlon's losing 13 to Zip right there at home.

[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.620]
Yeah, it's gonna be 8,000 fans including 6,000 myth fans.

[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:33.420]
It's just getting old.

[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.480]
The whole beast thing.

[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:39.400]
It is getting old just like he is getting old if you want to look if he wants to kill himself with food

[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.560]
Isn't that his prerangative? Absolutely.

[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:40.640]
Absolutely.

[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.480]
I'm a big believer in that whole deal

[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.920]
This business about well it's against a law to commit suicide

[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.220]
Who the hell are you gonna tell me if I'm gonna blow my brains out?

[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:55.500]
I'll do it if I want to eat myself to death if I'm gonna go to a dime at a coma because I eat like 10 course of rocky road

[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.300]
I'll do it

[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:01.720]
That's big brother government again. Oh, now don't start. Mmm. Now if they bring you a banana split today

[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.800]
You better not eat it. I'm not gonna eat it because

[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.580]
You're gonna lose your executive powers if you don't

[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:13.500]
Later

[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:29.960]
Started out a regular guy who joined the directory and made me ultimate

[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:33.080]
Sacrifice and racing celebration

[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.280]
Amen

[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:51.960]
As time went by his earthly needs compromise his choice

[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:58.440]
It found the way to get really by altering young boys

[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.180]
Father oh

[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:03.180]

[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:16.100]
It was happy to get till he got caught by some title

[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:23.740]
Then the Vatican paid everyone up and he didn't have to go to jail father

[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:24.100]
Oh

[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.000]
Oh

[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:41.400]
Sent into a priest retreat where they genuinely fled and pray

[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:47.620]
If it was you or it was made it lock us up and throw the keys away

[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:48.520]
Oh

[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:04.740]
Oh

[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:15.280]
There you go machines mission reassuring the wife and they're not too happy the family research council in James

[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.640]
Dobson all those other religious Nazis man. They're not too pleased and

[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:24.220]
So they try to pacify them his choice for VP is gonna be here. I'm gearing. They've got to do it now

[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.160]
There's a food area or what? No, no

[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:34.940]
Sure, let me know what it is when they bring the banana spoon and don't let the Zachary where not not gonna touch it

[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.780]
I'm gonna tell duct to put it right in front of him good excellent

[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:42.240]
I hope you do just to get even with that business about executive decision that was just

[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.820]
It was indescribable. What do you mean? Well, he's the executive producer

[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:51.280]
He's supposed to make the decision for jail because from what I hear Joe had a little too many concussions on his playing

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.360]
Yeah, too much football without a helmet like Jerry Ford

[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.760]
That there are two words

[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:06.320]
They come to mind that describe the way you said that and let me give you the initials, okay, yeah, P.A

[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.120]
Public announcer pompous ass

[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:14.940]
Why you sounded like and of course we know that Zach isn't a pump. We don't think he is

[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.720]
We thought it was a very good. I'm not a pompous us. I

[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.360]
Just thought that's what it sounded like I'm just trying to cure you of

[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:25.400]
Prevent you from doing that again, but let me rephrase that I sing I made an executive

[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:29.660]
Talk about that. I'm the Joe Rose showing that the people out there

[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:33.140]
In fact, I've actually managed if somebody told a man would probably come in here and sock you in the head

[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.980]
Well, you know what whether someone's gonna sock me in the head or not

[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:41.620]
I just I want the show to be good and I think that it was getting to a bad level when we talk about the beach

[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:47.620]
Every five minutes. So no, that's what he's been doing. Well, it was coming up every break every course

[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.020]
Because college we're talking about it too. It was just you know

[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.720]
I'm with those stupid collars now we could take calls now Chris could point him up if you're mom

[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.640]
But we're not gonna do it if we talk about the beast not

[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:02.640]
And George will call from home saying he made an executive decision. We're not gonna talk about the beast

[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.700]
Oh, then that would be the right thing to do probably

[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.800]
I'm gonna tell you something the day when George tells me he made any executive decision

[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.980]
What we're gonna do on the show will be the day that hell froze over you he doesn't do that at all?

[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:21.120]
No, he does not we don't have post show meetings and pre show meetings the show spontaneous baby. It's a shoe from the hip and the lip

[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:22.740]
That's why you're good

[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:30.300]
That's what all these shows are that's supposed to be prefabricated you sit down and that's what killed a Kenyan

[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.840]
Bosch or all of it well beside the fact that they sucked but all those prefabricated segments man

[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.800]
We don't have prefabricated segments

[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.460]
I think that was a killer from the Miller that was just the oh well today on the square table

[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:47.420]
We've got any on the phone from Miami Lakes and we've got the Joyce on the phone from Naples. We don't do that

[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:53.620]
Oh my god, I just probably show from a hell. How'd you like to have to follow that crap every day? I'm sorry

[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.120]
Yes, so am I

[00:59:55.700 --> 01:00:00.260]
I still have no message from Norma on average. Of course he's gonna tell me well if anything happens

[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:05.380]
I'll let you know and I did this and I did hey you did squat you squat it on it and

[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.960]
From what I'm hearing it wouldn't be the first time

[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.220]
And speaking of that story about Jay Leno and Ryan Phillips P

[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:17.660]
The streets are teeing with homosexual sex educator author and lesbian porn reviewer violet blue rights

[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.040]
As San Francisco's Castro district today

[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.820]
It's just like in those horror movie fundamentalist videos

[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:28.620]
Everyone's in leather with their bits and butts on display murderous baby Jane drag queens run a mock day in night

[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:31.040]
Gay sex is happening in the streets at all hours

[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.200]
There's a huge lube slide at the corner of 18th and Castro by the Bank of America

[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.540]
Where of course virgin straight men are sacrificed should they wander haplessly into our own little Sodom by the bay

[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:46.640]
And because I'm a heathen too every once in a while I allure and toss a straight boy into the fray just for kicks

[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.580]
It's like a zombie movie but gayer

[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.020]
Jay Leno set off a firestorm in the blogosphere Wednesday when he asked actor Ryan philippine

[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:59.520]
He gave him his gayest look noting that his start and acting was a gay as a gay teen on the soap opera one life to live

[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.780]
While talking with philippine who his appearance aired March 19 and was key to his new movie stop lost

[01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.920]
Leno 57 said the actor can you give me like say that cameras your gay lover?

[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.560]
Can you give me your gayest look despite philippines instant discomfort? He asked that

[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.880]
Wow replied philippine 33. This is something I don't want to do

[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.200]
Give you a gay look

[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.040]
Leno apologized after the up for her about a meanwhile we read that the other story

[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:32.260]
Sex educator violet blue has a message for Leno homophobic tendencies are linked with home or erotic ones according to a 96 study by the journal of a normal psychology

[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.360]
There's the phone. I better go get it. Oh

[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.300]
All right

[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:41.560]
So this is the time when we have to talk now see I think I think he kind of missed took how you're trying to say

[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.560]
I know you just you know you were just kind of made a suggestion

[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.720]
You know what maybe we shouldn't talk content was boring. I love you beast the beast is a nice guy

[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.060]
The content is boring

[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:55.560]
Yeah every five minutes on the show we're talking about beast and a pizza box. It was that bad

[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:59.720]
It just wasn't good radio. It was good the first day and then it got old and then Joe understood

[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.860]
said Joe it's just not worth us

[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.780]
Wasting our time on that anymore because we are trying to help the beast but in the case he's got to help himself

[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:11.920]
For what I hear kind of beast has some remarks against the weekend or something. Yeah, he said something. Oh well

[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.940]
He said why he said something on the air during the hurricane

[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:16.760]
Scrimmage scrimmage

[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.440]
That he he had some guy from the police athletic league

[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.160]
I believe and they he made the comment well

[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.680]
I'm gonna get a pizza box sign it with Joe Rose. No auction it off since he talks about my pizza eating so much

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.380]
And I just said you know what it's getting to a point where it's now maybe because

[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.100]
I'm scared about the beast okay

[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:37.120]
We like him a lot nobody cares. We hope he doesn't die. That's it. There's nothing else to say. That's it

[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.660]
There's nothing else to say no you're right. That's what I basically do. I make an executive decision to have Joe cut the crap

[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:45.560]
I didn't want to talk about the beast anymore. It's getting old

[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.380]
That's a good way to get back to Ryan philope please and rather talk about him and the beast thank you

[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:56.400]
The author is investigating the role of homosexual arousal and exclusively heterosexual men who have admitted negative effect to her homosexual individuals

[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:04.000]
The men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual male homosexual and lesbian videotapes and changes in

[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.400]
Penal circumference were monitored

[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.820]
They also completed an aggression questionnaire both groups exhibited increases in penal circumference to the

[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:15.280]
heterosexual and female homosexual videos only the homophobic men showed an increase in

[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.780]
Penal erection to male homosexual stimuli

[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.500]
The groups did not differ in aggression

[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:25.280]
Homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individuals either on a where-of-or denies

[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:25.820]
Oh, yes

[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:31.020]
The website my GS look now host a video and provides contact information at MSNBC

[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:35.960]
People all over the world are taking pictures of themselves posting their GS look for Leno blue rights

[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.340]
I'm not saying that Leno is in the closet

[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:44.160]
But I'll point out that there's something about Mary that gives Leno enough of a woodedist spout jokes that are insensitive beyond poor taste

[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.980]
And just making him look out a step of the rest of culture and apical who do an ever-thinning audience blue rights

[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:54.540]
An audience that even on its most conservative has a gay family member somewhere and likely has more tolerance than he does

[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.560]
On the other hand she continues that people like Leno want to claim that they're ridiculing and homophobic want to imagine that

[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.200]
Collegula lives down the street for me. That's kind of okay with me

[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:08.180]
I put Leno in the same categories the San Francisco cat driver who picked me up and started going off about the filthy homos in the

[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:08.540]
Castro

[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.520]
I asked him to pull over and went safely out of his cab. I told him don't ever pick me up again

[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:18.560]
And the same categories those few people who when I travel and I tell him I'm from San Francisco express pittier crack jokes

[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.360]
Or ask if it's hard to find guys to date because of all the gays

[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.260]
Or Lechimera would say Thane Francisco. Does nobody says? Yeah

[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.800]
According to San Francisco chronicle where her outfit appeared violet blue is author editor of nearly two dozen

[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.420]
Social health folks and erotic collections

[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:36.860]
She's a professional sex educator lecturer podcast or blogger

[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.760]
Flogger porn erotic reviewer and machine artist. I wonder what kind of machine

[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:49.860]
She's written for us ranging from Forbes to oh the Oprah magazine. Oh my god. We were doing so well until we got to oh the Oprah magazine

[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:53.420]
I

[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.020]
Everybody wants a good machine, but nobody wants a bad magazine

[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:02.260]
If people really read magazines anymore other than like women and young girls maybe look for pictures

[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.360]
I'm not talking about

[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.620]
You know like that like hustler and

[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.060]
Oh boy. I'm a self-luber

[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.420]
Wonder how Don Mbinder is doing. I'm sure he's still dead

[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.340]
871 votes were kind of slowing down on air. Chris if you want to get to that 4000

[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.700]
Let's go people although. We've always got Eric waiting in the wings. We're gonna get to 20 million votes today

[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.720]
We can do it

[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.840]
You can kiss my rear end

[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.380]
I'm going into the

[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:56.040]
big of a million there like J.F.K.

[01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:59.000]
Could afford a better play

[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:08.060]
If J.F.K. at four times five he would have known a fiber cup of cheap and crappy play that flows

[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.280]
I'm burning up my head to copy only way

[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.160]
Oh

[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:17.160]

[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:23.740]
Today from what they call the Kennedy curse

[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.720]
If you're a thinkin' galley close alive

[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.820]
Here up it's only gonna get worse

[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.980]
Listen to this sound you've got just a holiday

[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:48.480]
I

[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:48.480]

[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:54.540]
If you look up in the dictionary somebody who was watching you about nothing John John will be their J.F.K. Junior man his picture will be their big

[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.040]
Big push

[01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:03.220]
I still think he was a Aristotle on ancises on not the J.F.K. but nevertheless. Well, she was screwing around everybody because she was a

[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.480]
She was a high priced whole Jackie

[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:07.860]
Hello

[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.360]
Never not her

[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:16.000]
What do you know about Jackie Kimby you would know you would know her if she walked into the room right now

[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.900]
They brought her dead body if she or corpse was laid right there in the counter and said to your lunch Kennedy on asses

[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.600]
Which house the lunch coming by the way? Oh, we were just told it should be here soon. It's all right

[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.280]
Actually, don't forget we got like 28 minutes to go till noon, which means it's half of the hour

[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.800]
We do our neildial. Let's see if we do well. We got a hundred of them a cell their 50s for 25 bucks

[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.380]
Now you think we're missalow yes

[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:47.780]
Why do I ask those questions because we can have like 98 left at two minutes to two and crystal say don't worry

[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.440]
They're all gonna go. I don't worry. Just that's right. We're two of his crap

[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.520]
That's because Chris is the executive director of the neo-Rodger show correct

[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.260]
I make the big decisions

[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.140]
Georgie to have you like and he makes the big decision which hand to eat with and which hand to wipe with

[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.540]
Hopefully not at the same time. No

[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.620]
I could make a confession to you about a candy bar that I ate

[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.220]
Let's go isn't I was in a big hurry. I forget what there was

[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:16.680]
I was in a big hurry. I had to meet Paco down in the lobby for we're going to dinner or something and I had

[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.540]
You know, I had the candy bar

[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:23.180]
That I had just unwrapped. I shouldn't have been eating a candy bar especially right before dinner, right?

[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:30.300]
And they put an air bar. No, it was not an arrow bar. Oh my god. I said a candy bar not that a real one

[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:34.400]
And anyway, and I I don't want to go into the whole thing

[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.260]
But I finished eating it sitting on the throne. I was there. That's disgusting. Isn't it? Yeah, that's pretty gross

[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:45.760]
In other words, you've never done anything like that coming from a guy who would bag up his dirty drawers and bring him to a dry cleaning place

[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.540]
That's pretty gross

[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:51.700]
I can never eat them thrown. No, no

[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:56.500]
But you could take a bunch of soil pantalouties and and hand them to the dry cleaning lady

[01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:01.520]
Oh, he had these for me tomorrow nice and sparkling now clean and new absolutely bitch

[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.520]
Jaguar's cornerback Brian Williams hasn't yet made headlines on the football field

[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.420]
But he had made news off the field accused of making some offensive comments

[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.160]
To a police officer netty was arrested on suspicion of DUI

[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.300]
According to Jacksonville police Williams went on a racist profanity-laced rant

[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.840]
The September 2006 netty was charged with DUI

[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.460]
Channel four in Jacksonville is obtained court documents dealing with him out

[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:32.640]
So says William said to him that night the officer involved wrote in his notes that William called him a honky mother effort

[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.180]
The statement that goes on to say that William said I F your mama I F your wife twice

[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.880]
It got worse when the court of the office is notes William's thread to do something the officer's daughter

[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:48.820]
At radio station 1010 XL a good amount of talk on the events. They was about the comments police say Williams made

[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:52.800]
See they were talking about the beast they were talking about this racist mother's scratcher. Oh

[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.800]
There's something you can tell us since you the executive director tell him about whatever

[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.600]
Talk about something meaningful like that

[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.840]
You got it if you read what I just read it's more than making a mistake

[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.100]
It's there's some hate words in there said former Jaguar atomic manus or is that make me anus

[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.440]
In 2006 Williams pretty guilty to do you want to apologize for his actions?

[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.960]
However, Williams recently changed his mind and withdrew his plea

[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:23.480]
That decision allowed the notes to the arresting officer with the time say didn't know Williams had recently signed a multi-million dollar deal to play for the Jaguars to be made public

[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:29.440]
The officer said Williams told him you think I'm a drug dealing effort looking for a gun mother reference. Excuse me

[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:36.860]
Before it goes on to say that when Williams realized his car was gonna be towed and police asked if he wanted his date to drive it home

[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.780]
He yelled I'm not letting that bitch take my car

[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.400]
It just is exploded, but I'm sure that's what he said right the word was ho

[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:48.420]
Was it yeah, Mack? I'm reading it on a football website right now really yes

[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:50.860]
I'm not letting that hold take my car. I thought it was bitch

[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.720]
Will the officer I am letting that hard cost more than the officer will ever make

[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.920]
Channel 4 try to get comments from Williams's attorney the Jaguars regarding the comments allegedly made by Williams

[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.520]
But none would comment however at the radio station they said this is something Jaguar's own away

[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:11.360]
Weaver needs to address if they haven't seen this yet when they do Brian Williams has some major explaining to his sports radio host Rick Baloo

[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.020]
I wonder if he's keen to cat

[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:14.800]
Stevens

[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:21.380]
Other groups like the end of lacp said if what the officer says is true that Williams went too far no kidding

[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:28.200]
The president of local chamber the end of lacp i.c. I.e. a. Romulan said the incident shows what police face every day from all kinds of people

[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.060]
We can't tolerate this type of hatred racial type language in this community. It just divides. It's all it does

[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.800]
Romulan said

[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.420]
Since Williams arrested 2006 eight-hubber Jaguar plays a feather on run-ins with the law those Jaguars man

[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:44.980]
Got some real tourists up there in Jacksonville. Of course if you live up there you have tourists too

[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:53.000]
It also says Williams also reportedly offered to allow the officer to have sex with Williams date if the officer released them

[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.820]
Those net's classy in it. Yes that hole while she's a hole. Yes. I ain't letting that ho take my car

[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:05.400]
That's sweet. That's nice classy guy. Jacksonville Jaguar is able to observe whatever bad things come their way

[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.420]
And you notice that I don't know where to how did you find that story

[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.940]
Pro football talk.com

[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.660]
Because it sure didn't get a lot of publicity. That's the first where I just

[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.060]
Tossed it already, but where have I found it? That's the first time I've ever seen of it

[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:24.180]
There's now the white football player would have made a bunch of racist anti-black comments

[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.820]
You can be dangerous. What a gun like gigantic. It would have been all over the place

[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:32.520]
They'd be out of 24-7 on CNN ESPN news. They'd be all over like stink on a Greg

[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.920]
Like stink on Joyce

[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.180]
Am I right? Yes

[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.920]
If this double standard man and then when black people do racist stuff that's one thing

[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:50.020]
But when white people do it wow, but to be put a boot put a pop you can't do that. You're a racist honky son of a in like that mother's scratcher

[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:56.200]
If it doesn't pay to be cheap when it comes to toilet paper 244

[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:59.620]
prostitutes hose 109

[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:09.120]
Employees 98 states 94 shoes 83 mechanics 37 scotch 34 cars 32 and ketchup 29

[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.860]
I'm going to keep going down as far as ketchup because there's too many things on the list

[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.020]
agents and lawyers five

[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.760]
Ask me if I've had an email response from normally yet today. Have you?

[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:19.680]
I'll ask

[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.740]
879 vote which means by noon will have 900 you ordinarily we go for 800 by the top of the hour

[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:30.180]
And then we can switch to that really nifty poll about which of these you know

[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:37.500]
In movies did you never see and the which one like that so exactly like that movie yes sent to the woman was okay

[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.320]
Not I particularly love it, but it was a good movie

[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.560]
Man you know what is a good movie what's that crash saw last night

[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.380]

[01:13:55.860 --> 01:14:00.220]
It looks pretty good to me in that movie of course he always looks good. He was also in 54 a while ago

[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.940]
When he was younger and hunger

[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:05.040]
That was a good movie. Yeah, it was an excellent movie

[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.120]
There's a lot of flesh in there for everybody baby. That was something in there for all and of course the movie that really

[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.980]
Just knocks everybody's socks off covenant with Stephen straight nobody ever heard of it nobody ever saw it. Nope

[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.700]
No, you wouldn't want to see it. I know he called me a lot of guys in a locker room man

[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:23.980]
A lot of naked guy a lot of guys just snapping a towel if they're asked stuff like that. No, thank you

[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.860]
I don't that kind of stuff that goes on with real man in a locker room with real macho man

[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:32.000]
Or you watch on the oxygen channel or something? I don't know what oxygen channel

[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.060]
Isn't that Oprah's network? I don't know that's one of those women networks

[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.940]
I think I'm gonna verge of making an executive decision

[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.780]
The biggest name

[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.380]
Forts later

[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:01.700]
So Hillary I wouldn't have I

[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:02.560]
Be good

[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.760]
And I'll behave like I should

[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:12.500]
I'll seriously so good so good. I swear to you

[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:19.220]
Wow, I'll be nice and I'll control my voice

[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.640]
Truly I'll be nice

[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.880]
Hillary won't tell me twice

[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:32.100]
Hey, so nice so nice I swear to you

[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.720]
Well, daddy they will love me play my horn

[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.280]
Please say I'm too horny as it is

[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:47.320]
I know sometimes in my life I've done some things that were wrong

[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:56.320]
But when I campaign for my wife I promise I won't do any harm and I'll be good

[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.680]
Told Hillary I would

[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.300]
I'll be good

[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.240]
At least I think that I could

[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.740]
So good

[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.420]
I swear to you

[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.160]
But of course my pickers across

[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.980]
I'm 45 at 560 W.A. I'm looking at 888 down the pole. That's what it's gonna be 888

[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:29.280]
That's what these guys are gonna have done is the food area or not. It'll be the day minute

[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.120]
Any second now trust me. I just move seal

[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:37.360]
So we got 15 minutes until we put that deal on there at neildial on wqm.com

[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:43.040]
Get yourself ready and voice because you know what they say once again they go their uh history

[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:47.280]
888 for us an angry thing to do many times

[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.640]
Many times we've had the 666 and it reminds me of that anti-Christ lady

[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.480]
You know what I'm talking about? I don't know. I want to take you a question

[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.440]
My son was watching your program on

[01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.620]
Where me on my Emmy the date was

[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:13.740]
The 15 and I would like to know it's just some kind of anti-Christ or something

[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:18.240]
I said once to worship the devil because he thinks he's cool

[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:27.740]
And he also wants to just as ladies and then solicit on now. I don't know if the whole 10 or 69 is the anti-Christ channel

[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:35.160]
Um, please. I'm really concerned and I would like to know if you're the anti-Christ. Yes. Thank you and please

[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:43.480]
I see you somewhere. I wouldn't even stop in TV water because you know you turn my son into a baguette and you made my son

[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.220]
You have an anti-Christ. Thank you

[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.920]
Have a nice day. Yeah

[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:53.260]
You bastard you bet you piece of crap and have a nice day. That was interesting

[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.080]
You never heard that before I never have no oh we got some great voicemails

[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:02.260]
Let's see one of my favorites is that there was a the disgusted guy really hope you use this on the air

[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.500]
I've been listening to a m now for maybe 20 years

[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:11.940]
At least I've been living here for 40 years. I've never heard anything as disgusting as the neurologist program

[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:17.300]
I've heard of me for it's pornographic and the sort of my granddaughter or one of my kids listening to his guitar

[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:21.720]
I was gonna tell you frankly. I am done listening to your station

[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:26.640]
This is the grossest thing I have ever heard and as far as I'm concerned

[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.380]
You're up my book good

[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:32.280]
Okay, I'm still here. That was years ago all of these voicemails years and years ago

[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.160]
And I'm still here and probably some of them are pushing up these these made in the anti-Christ lady is pushing them

[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:44.100]
The one I like is the guy where you can clearly tell he's clearly reading it and everything so the rectum guy

[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.160]
Yeah, oh, yeah, we can play that again

[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.200]
Neil Rogers, I think it's the perfect example of queer

[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.260]
What is this purposefully shown or his ugly show?

[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:55.740]
He uses that one rectum every five minutes

[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.200]
Rectum

[01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:03.600]
He's never gonna get past his self-sort of audience because that the town and the people that he's always complaining about

[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.980]
As the only fools that would give him any time of day

[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.780]
Eventually his rainfall drops so low you have to read justice rectum

[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:12.920]
Quick

[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.440]
Yeah, he was reading it he wrote it all the time and have a nice day

[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:22.060]
Hey, I know forget have a nice day and we hope you have a real pretty rectum and it sounds good too

[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:25.340]
And they're nice when they leave the voicemail the end. It's like okay. Thank you very much. Have a nice day

[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.600]
Nothing not always nice. Sometimes a little bit on the crazy crazy side like

[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.140]
And the best part about Eddie is that we you know

[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.000]
We had the number you know off the your phone

[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:51.160]
We found out who he was and we put his name on your Steve somebody I forget it then he's like a business guy

[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:56.100]
He runs a business in town and he's loaded on me. What Steve's low? No, not Steve's slow

[01:19:56.100 --> 01:20:02.000]
But anyway, and it didn't make any difference. He doesn't care. He doesn't care. He's probably happy

[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.640]
I mean some people you know that that's why the end and the number of the phone makes people very brave

[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:12.080]
Or the fax machine either one

[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:17.820]
You know how many of the faxes we get have no name on him? Of course, of course. I'm done by America fax with no name

[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.400]
I mean, they're so stupid they can't even make up a name. You know what?

[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:25.120]
Listen to my other put a made-up name like that phone. He won from a Moe the other day about

[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.340]
Something in rotten test you remember that one?

[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:35.460]
Yep, but I'm jealous of Moe that that was the reason why Rogers was so jealous of Moe because of his success and they play by play field

[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:35.740]
Yeah

[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:39.900]
Yeah, we all want to be just like Moe when we grow up just like that

[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:44.280]
I despised and reviled by everywhere even by little animals by insects

[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:51.280]
Even mosquitoes won't bite Moe because they can get anywhere near him. Oh fat and they run away. They fly away

[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.300]
the moment

[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.240]
If you and if the ground that you walk on and though you better not this the poop of the toilet

[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.580]
Oh boy, I miss him

[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:06.400]
You got to admit back during those days and I see there was another element

[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.200]
To the station that that for the most part is missing now even some of it on the show

[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:17.640]
Well, clearly you know, that's right entertainment element forget about comedy even just entertaining

[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:26.540]
It was the diversion from just oh the beast this and the ball game that in the marlins is the tennis that oh my god

[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:33.700]
See I this may come as a great shock to the jocqueocracy. I don't give a flying crap about Tiger

[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:40.360]
Okay, I don't give a crap if he if he aces every hole and every of course that he plays. I don't care

[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:46.180]
It's golf. It's not even a real sport. It's golf. It's a game. It's like checkers

[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:53.180]
It's like checkers and chess only requires a slightly greater amount of physical exertion

[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:57.300]
I am certainly less mental acuity king me. Yeah

[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:08.300]
Sounds like somebody already did since you're the executive producer come on. Yeah, they invited him somebody queen to me

[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:12.920]
Nine hundred on the pole and I heard even boy. I'm telling you we're doing very well on that

[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.080]
Not tomorrow morning. I don't know what to think. I don't know

[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:21.300]
We're dropping off a huge november and this is gonna be just December January and February

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:27.640]
Okay, did my January was squatsky man. It was bad. So we sure hope that all our people out there come through for us

[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:30.460]
The ones with those arbitrarian diaries all five of you

[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:35.260]
Because if you don't man, we're and if norma don't hurry up and get that damn deal done

[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:37.960]
You know this guy it's just it's just amazing to me

[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:45.700]
There are some people that have no sense of urgency with anything all they do is dawdle along and dawdle along and well

[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:51.400]
I talked to jolly jolt and I did this and I stuck my finger up my ass and I you know

[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:55.420]
And no matter what you say to him, you might as well talk to the wall because it's like

[01:22:55.420 --> 01:23:00.540]
I should have saved the ashes for my dogs when I had them cremated somebody said that to me. They're there

[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:02.100]
I can't believe you didn't save the ashes

[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.500]
I'm trying to remember who said that

[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.560]
They were serious. They were serious. Why?

[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:14.260]
I would keep doing it. At least then I'd have them like an a canister and I could talk to them. Oh

[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:22.240]
You know, I mean yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't expect a response and I wouldn't get one but at least when you're talking to a dead person or animal or something

[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:28.120]
You know you're not gonna get a response when you're talking to somebody who claims to be alive. You expect something, you know, I got you

[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:34.180]
She's just like it's got to be more than just going to fantasy baseball and training baseball cards and

[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:39.600]
Cruising around picking up runaways. It's got to be something more life than that really? I don't know

[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.440]
I don't know if you're right on that one

[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.440]
Barack Obama raised $40 million last month his campaign announced today

[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.100]
The average contribution it said was 96 bucks more than

[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:54.480]
442,000 people donated to the campaign last month nearly half of them were first time contributors man

[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.900]
He is on a roll. He's smoking it

[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:03.480]
Senator Obama's always said that this campaign would rise or fall on the wilderness of the American people to become partners in

[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:07.980]
The effort to change our politics and start a new chapter in the history campaign manager David Pooff

[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:13.320]
Said in the email statement today. We're seeing the American people's extraordinary desire to change Washington as

[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:18.760]
tens of thousands of new contributors joined it more than a million Americans who already taken ownership of the campaign for change

[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.360]
Obama's opponent swole away is not your release to march fundraising numbers

[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:27.960]
But her campaign says it doesn't expect the match that at all and she can't pay her bills man pay your bills pay your bills

[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.520]
You silly as the twit

[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:30.700]
God

[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:36.700]
Hey, you want to see her twits? Oh, that was no no no I know twits. I said

[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.820]
See you guys always think in dirty

[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:44.900]
Famous pits like our armpits. Oh my god. I can smell those all the way over here

[01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:49.280]
I know one on the pool and I think I'm going to change it now

[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.240]
No, no you can wait a little longer. No, I can't not no tuna

[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.440]
Well, like I said, I'm changing it. I don't like it

[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.800]
And the one for tomorrow I like even less

[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:06.320]
Sorry, Sean don't take it personally. I appreciate your efforts very very much

[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:10.940]
Especially when you went to Gulfstream and scared away he stared them off. He stared away

[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.720]
Chamba and

[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.960]
His buddy, project her that was too lunatics

[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:23.520]
What's the worst performance to still want an Oscar and the answer easily is alphagina instead of a woman

[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.120]
No way spider what you say way

[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.940]
Come on. Way way

[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.720]
horrible flick

[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.980]
Even with Chris O'Donnell who I thought that wasn't too bad. He he is

[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.600]
He's not bad looking, but he's kind of boring. You know, I mean he's got no personality

[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.960]
He was Robin wasn't he in the Batman or Robin's yeah, he had he was wearing those tights

[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:45.260]
And

[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:48.100]
Anyway, here's the deal it doesn't pay to be cheap when this is the final deal

[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.120]
901

[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:55.220]
toilet paper 252 prostitutes 110 employees 98 states 98 and after that who cared

[01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:00.660]
Now this pool the worst performance to still win an Oscar here's the list that

[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.700]
Sean put together a lengthy list

[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:07.320]
Judy holiday in Borne yesterday list Taylor who's afraid of her genuine wolf

[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:12.880]
There's still persons in Bonnie and Clyde Helen Hayes in airport Merrill Streep and Creamer versus Creamer

[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.680]
Gina Davis in the accidental tourist alphagina in the Senate of a woman

[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.680]
Nicholas Cage leaving Las Vegas keep a good in junior and Jerry McGuire

[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:25.880]
When if Calcio Shakespeare in love Dustin Hoffman Creamer versus Creamer Robert Teneuro and raging bull

[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:30.500]
Tom Hanks and Forrest dump Susan Sarandon dead man walking in Kevin Spacey in American beauty

[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:34.340]
And there's a lot of people on there that I like a lot, you know a lot of good actors and actresses

[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.740]
Just really bad movies or bad performances

[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:42.120]
Like that one movie that's act like so much where he kept going

[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.140]
like that

[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.380]
The performance that when he when he showed up for free

[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:48.160]
Thanksgiving at the dinner table

[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.660]
That was especially horrendous that that whole scene

[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:55.160]
You know, I'm talking about we just showed up uninvited. Yes

[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.980]
And they they're kept thinking well, what does he keep saying whoah whoah like that

[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:05.540]
One 56 wine of verge of getting with our Lucille deal and I bet your food is almost there I could smell it

[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:12.580]
Can you smell it now? That's Chris. Oh, yeah, this mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M

[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.660]
Today on Dr. Phil

[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.100]
I'm glad you're here great to be here. What happened? I remember landing under sniper fire

[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:26.280]
What there was no greeting ceremony what and we basically were told to run to our cars now that is what happened

[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:32.040]
Are you kidding me? Well one thing you know about me is that I've been taking that incoming fire for 16 years

[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:39.260]
She is crazy and ridiculous. Yeah, and some other things that I'm not gonna mention you need serious help

[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:44.200]
There isn't any doubt, but I'm a little busy right now. I hardly have time to sleep

[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.000]
Are you drunk? Yes

[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.640]
We need a good shot. You have an alcohol problem

[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.040]
What in the world is going on?

[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:56.780]
sniper fire

[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.040]
Wow

[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:05.560]
What was that last time there sounded like a raspberry for Dr. Phil wasn't yes, so sniper fire what are you talking about? Oh, okay

[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.660]
12.01

[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:15.120]
Sometimes when he least expected it comes from the most amazing sources like that so the food's here the food is there

[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.460]
That's a part of the world even better news is that El Pacino instead of woman is taking it really lead on our new car

[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:24.720]
That's because you're biased. Oh, so I have a question. Is this just for like you know

[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.320]
Leading or is it supporting also?

[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.220]
The question is who what was the worst performance to still win an ice here?

[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:38.320]
So supporting actors and actresses would work of course because I'm a friend who suggested a Marissa Tome and my cousin Vinnie

[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.040]
Get it on there and

[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.640]

Washington, the North Cavalry.

[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.080]
Zach's here to stay for Grand Fist in Michigan.

[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:25.580]
Washington, you see a lift and took me flying.

[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:27.860]
Sweet, Zach's here.

[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:29.760]
Hey, bro.

[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:37.420]
He's here to stay for Grand Fist in Michigan.

[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:40.160]
From New Fuller, Tennessee, town.

[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:48.280]
1217 and 560 WQ AM.

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.820]
Why does this thing a little bit slow back here?

[01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.280]
Here it is.

[01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:54.200]
What's the worst performance to still win an Oscar?

[01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:54.940]
That's our new poll.

[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:56.880]
56 votes as in Q56.

[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:57.900]
How do you like that?

[01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:58.480]
Mm-hmm.

[01:39:58.720 --> 01:39:58.920]
Nice.

[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:00.920]
Now, what are you eating now?

[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:02.360]
Same thing.

[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:05.840]
He's got the pulled pork and I'm about to dig into the grilled chicken sear.

[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:16.980]
I hate to admit this, but if I happen to have been there to do the show down there and I had the chance to order them to bring the food in, I would have gotten that baked macaroni and the big banana split.

[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:18.140]
Really?

[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.480]
And you've all been running around and say, oh, you're going to die.

[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.360]
Like George always says, you're going to die, yeah.

[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:23.120]
It was so real.

[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:27.280]
You know, someday you're all going to say, I'm dying out of here.

[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:27.740]
Like that.

[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.440]
But that's what I would have gotten.

[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:32.400]
I wouldn't have put on this act like you guys are doing.

[01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:34.240]
But you're not going to have to do that.

[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:34.600]
What act?

[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:37.240]
For saying that you don't want that stuff.

[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.160]
Oh, I wanted.

[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.580]
I just, I can't have it.

[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:39.960]
Yeah.

[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.800]
That's the difference.

[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:46.820]
You asked me what I want to order or what I can order.

[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:48.640]
Those are the two questions.

[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:50.520]
Ever see Ryan Philip P?

[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:51.440]
No.

[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:52.300]
No.

[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:52.580]
No.

[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:54.760]
I'd like to.

[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.480]
I'm just looking at this thing and seeing how we're doing.

[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.100]
We're down to five.

[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.380]
We sold 95 of minutes, only 12, 18.

[01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.000]
I got holy, holy rat, man.

[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:07.920]
Holy rat, man.

[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:08.000]
I got the holy rat, man.

[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.080]

[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:08.460]
I got the holy rat.

[01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:09.220]
I got the holy rat.

[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:09.540]
Yeah.

[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.040]
We have, we have down to three here.

[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:12.780]
You're down to three?

[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.040]
Yeah.

[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:13.840]
All three left, yeah.

[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.240]
But you better hurry now.

[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.660]
You folks that are like going nuts over, listen to this great food that the guys are eating

[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:23.160]
because once again, you know how that goes, how that went.

[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.640]
So there's only three left.

[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.540]
So we don't even have to get all excited about it.

[01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.200]
We're working very hard.

[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:28.180]
Not even work up a sweat.

[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:28.800]
No.

[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:30.060]
That's great.

[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.020]
Excellent job, Neil.

[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:31.340]
Okay.

[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.940]
Too bad the sales department isn't paying any attention because they don't know.

[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.160]
This is not a sports show.

[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:36.480]
You know, we can't be bothered with that.

[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.040]
Too bad you don't get to sit in those sales meetings since you're in the promotion meeting.

[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:43.240]
I look at your letters.

[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:43.920]
What?

[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.640]
I can go and sit in there if you want me to.

[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.600]
Yes, sit in the sales meeting.

[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:47.460]
Give us a spy report.

[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.400]
See how many times my name comes up in there.

[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.060]
As in.

[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:50.540]
Oh.

[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:50.860]
None.

[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:54.600]
That's because we got that Yehu sales man.

[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:55.960]
He's got all these awards though.

[01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:59.600]
He's the sales manager of the year in the building and you know, in that room.

[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:02.860]
But they sure sell no one over that.

[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:03.360]
That's okay.

[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:05.620]
It's only the third of April.

[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:06.220]
Then we got along.

[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.840]
We got nine months left this year.

[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:11.480]
A lot of spots they're going to be paying somebody for that aren't going to get on here.

[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:11.920]
It's all right.

[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:12.760]
It's a good deal.

[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.800]
What's the worth performance to still want to ask for the question is, Al Pacino said a woman is winning 13 votes.

[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:19.800]
Are you ready to?

[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.220]
No, I did not.

[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.000]
They don't vote what I tell him to hold.

[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:23.620]
Are you crazy?

[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:23.860]
I see a way.

[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:24.340]
Yeah, it is.

[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.700]
No, they do not.

[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.500]
They love to vote for you.

[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:27.640]
You're full of crap.

[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.680]
I still got five under.

[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:33.520]
You say you got three.

[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:33.960]
Yep.

[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:36.760]
Oh, and three.

[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:37.660]
I'm looking in the wrong place.

[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:39.180]
Only three.

[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.900]
Well, I'm getting off of that now.

[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:42.220]
You're what?

[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:43.820]
Let me know when they're sold out.

[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:44.580]
Okay.

[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:46.480]
Well, the two were getting junior year, Jeremy.

[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.560]
And I never saw that.

[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:48.660]
It's serious?

[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:50.080]
That was a pretty good movie.

[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:51.360]
So many of you.

[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:52.960]
Somebody isn't town cruising that movie?

[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:53.360]
Yes.

[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.820]
I won't see it.

[01:42:56.180 --> 01:43:00.180]
Although he wasn't a couple of good movies, but that's way, way, way back then.

[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:00.900]
Way back when.

[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:01.380]
Top Gun.

[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.300]
You good man was good.

[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:03.420]
No, not Top Gun.

[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.920]
Are you a crazy person or whatever?

[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.780]
I never saw that, by the way.

[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.700]
You're tasted in your tockless mischievous.

[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:08.560]
You never saw Top Gun.

[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:09.360]
I never saw Top Gun.

[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:09.440]

[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:10.160]
Are you serious?

[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:11.040]
You're the bottom gun.

[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.620]
That's the movie that Tom Cruise likes best bottom gun.

[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:14.640]
What about naked gun?

[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:15.900]
Yeah.

[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:16.960]
Now that's a good movie.

[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:17.380]
It's fun.

[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:17.940]
That was funny.

[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:21.600]
I'll tell you if there's anybody in the world, if there's anybody funnier than him

[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.640]
and I can't listen to Neilson.

[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:26.020]
He's the funniest person on the face of the earth.

[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:30.960]
Either that or they just write great scripts for him, but he just makes me P and I pants.

[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:34.340]
That's why it's funny like now, because I knew him as naked dog in those things.

[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.500]
Then you see his older movies, or he's more of like serious?

[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.020]
Right.

[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:39.940]
Like that can't be Leslie Neilson.

[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:41.140]
It is.

[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:41.580]
Yep.

[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:42.640]
He's a good actor.

[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:43.560]
Yes, he is.

[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:44.340]
And very funny.

[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:48.140]
He's the one that brought the first part machine on the carcin' on tonight show.

[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:54.280]
Remember we were listening to that Marlon Brando thing, the biography of the story.

[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:54.960]
Yeah, he's got it.

[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.660]
Johnny Depp was talking about how he had that fart thing, you know, the squeeze, mixed it in his fart sounds and Brando just cracked up.

[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:04.600]
Well, anyway, Leslie Neilson brought one right on live TV on tonight show years ago.

[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:05.220]
Oh, right.

[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:06.100]
It was great.

[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:09.080]
They could fart on that tonight show, but we can't fart on the earth.

[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:13.980]
And that was a zed in years ago, but that was back in the day when we had freedom of speech and freedom of fart sounds.

[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.000]
Freedom of a lot of things.

[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:16.880]
But they could fart on Nickelodeon, but we can't.

[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:17.620]
That's right.

[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.220]
We can't fart because Joyce don't like it.

[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:20.340]
Joyce don't like farting.

[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:25.460]
And Joyce has a problem with penis and with vagina and with all, you know, Joyce's got a lot of problems.

[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:25.840]
You know what?

[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.260]
You know what? I think the biggest problem is?

[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:27.860]
I have no life.

[01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:28.500]
That's the one.

[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.780]
Nicholas Cage's leaving Las Vegas six votes.

[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:33.500]
The newer, Raging Bull five.

[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:36.100]
Talk about an overrated movie and overrated piece of Drek.

[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:37.160]
Oh, you didn't like that, were you?

[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:38.180]
No, I saw it.

[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:38.760]
I don't like it.

[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:41.840]
Oh, it's the greatest movie of all time.

[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:42.580]
I got a news for you.

[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.920]
If that's the greatest movie of all time, they should stop making movies.

[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.500]
No, the greatest movie of all time.

[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:48.220]
I think we're in consensus on that one.

[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:49.800]
Got another.

[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:51.980]
No kidding.

[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.460]
Or two, either one.

[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:54.660]
You're gonna have to like a man.

[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:56.600]
No, not not or two.

[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.120]
Okay, not or two.

[01:44:58.260 --> 01:44:58.560]
You're good.

[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:01.980]
Two is good, but two don't have lines like.

[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:02.560]
It leaves it good.

[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:04.620]
I think it only.

[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:04.960]
It's funny.

[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:05.260]
I can't write.

[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:05.860]
It's funny.

[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:09.940]
And see, I had forgotten because I, you know, a lot of times, eight minutes times a week,

[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.320]
they're on Bravo and whatever else.

[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:16.300]
And I had forgotten that the very, I said, I've got five or two is the only time in the movie

[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.460]
that certain people appear in it.

[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.380]
Like you see, um, sunny is in there.

[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.240]
And it's the birthday party there.

[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:22.720]
The surprise party for Don Corleone.

[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:23.100]
That's right.

[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:24.800]
And they're all sitting around and table.

[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.260]
There's Carlo, who's there and Connie.

[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.520]
And, um, Rob, and what's in there?

[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.560]
Robert DuVal, Tom Hagen.

[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:35.760]
And you see, um, let's see one time you see him in the movie too, because they don't want to pay him the money.

[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:37.220]
And Santina was there.

[01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:39.580]
And, uh, and Tesio.

[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:47.140]
And you don't see Don Corleone, but you hear him when he comes in the door, because he's, you know, he's busy dying.

[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:47.760]
Hey, guess what?

[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:48.440]
What?

[01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:49.020]
One.

[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.540]
We're down to one on Lucille.

[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.180]
Oh, my freaking God.

[01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:54.140]
Baby, there's only one left.

[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:54.900]
Solonite de Uno.

[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.140]
Solonite de Uno.

[01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:56.280]
Solonite de Uno.

[01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:58.180]
You better grab a light of can because once it's gone.

[01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.120]
It's gone.

[01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.640]
Robert DuVal, Tom Hagen's in force, dumb four.

[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:03.860]
He gives me the willies, man.

[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:05.380]
I'm talking about that the other day.

[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:05.980]
I don't know what it is.

[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.080]
I just can't stand him.

[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:08.260]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.860]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:14.940]

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:14.940]

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:14.940]

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:14.940]

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:14.940]

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:14.940]

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:14.940]

[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:15.060]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:15.920]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.020]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:16.240]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:17.880]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:18.660 --> 01:46:23.320]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:24.060]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:24.920]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.880]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:34.400]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:36.380]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.240]
You don't like the force, girl.

[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:38.720]
Yes.

[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:42.260]
Richard Burton and Lissabler didn't have to act at all.

[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:43.560]
It was just a rungs.

[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:46.680]
Just a couple of rungs brawling and screaming and bitching and carrying on.

[01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:49.400]
And talking about the son that never really existed in the first place.

[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:52.640]
And this young couple sitting there like, oh gee, what did we get ourselves into?

[01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:54.560]
But they didn't want to leave, you know?

[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:56.920]
That's what I don't understand.

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:04.260]
If you invited to somebody's house who were apparently strangers and they were like brawling and drunken, you know what I mean?

[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:05.220]
What do you mean?

[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:06.260]
Would you stick around?

[01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:06.980]
No.

[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:07.940]
Yeah, maybe.

[01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:12.060]
Well, I feel popcorn that you can watch it, but...

[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.580]
Judy Holiday born yesterday, too.

[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.180]
Marissa Tohme, my cousin's anyone.

[01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:18.840]
Kevin Spacey, American Beauty, one.

[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.260]
Dustin Hoffman and Merrill Streep, both in cream versus bread, cream or one of peace.

[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.380]
How many books do you have total?

[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:25.400]
56.

[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:26.860]
Oh, you need to refresh, brother.

[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:27.320]
We got 75.

[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.180]
Well, I'm more interested in the Neal deal.

[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:33.640]
Is it gone or is it not gone?

[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:34.580]
Nope, it's the guy one left.

[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.060]
Let's go people.

[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:35.940]
We got one left.

[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.780]
Well, here we got only 1225 for Christ's sakes, what do you want?

[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.100]
Like there's some drama involved there?

[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:42.160]
For your mama?

[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.400]
I'm glad Zaskin, the channel's fake.

[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.540]
Next time you have one of your post-show meetings, you are a Rob Joe's nosiness, okay?

[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:48.420]
Oh, no.

[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:49.500]
He's a little little fat.

[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:51.920]
He sells this stuff out and we don't always, you know?

[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:52.920]
Sometimes it takes a while.

[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.260]
Well, I think it's a real eye-opener.

[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:56.800]
And you know why?

[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.220]
Because we don't talk about the damn beast.

[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:01.540]
We don't take our whole show talking about, what are we going to do to save the beast?

[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:06.120]
I can't believe Zaskin is coming on here and spending so much time ripping Joe today, can you?

[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:06.940]
Who ripped Joe?

[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:07.860]
You did.

[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:08.440]
Come on.

[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:12.640]
You're the executive director, producer and maschkiyachanetsu or whatever that means.

[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:13.780]
From the R2?

[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:14.140]
Yeah.

[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:15.220]
Well, this guy looks like Geldy.

[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.600]
Turn on CNN right now.

[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.860]
That's Geldy in about 20 years.

[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:19.440]
Look at that.

[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.440]
Geldy's on CNN.

[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:24.080]
Oh, wow, yeah.

[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:25.200]
Am I right?

[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.120]
Let me turn the audio on.

[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.060]
I told you.

[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:30.180]
Geldy's on TV.

[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.320]
The best out.

[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:34.860]
You know, Geldy's on TV.

[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:35.840]
I just swear to the fives.

[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.700]
You ain't have to think for it's later.

[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:39.940]
I like the weenies.

[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.520]
I've got to call here.

[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.060]
The number one rated divin' in Mo'Hawaiian, they've been in his house.

[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.280]
At least according to my aspirations.

[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:47.980]
They're your way from here.

[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.540]
I don't even know how you have children.

[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:50.640]
Birabah, hello.

[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.500]
Yes, I want to take on J. Bieber.

[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:57.900]
Oh, well, J. Bieber is a great quarterback and a good joke.

[01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:59.600]
I like J. Bieber.

[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.420]
Well, not the mention.

[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:04.600]
He's got extraordinary, never-lease smooth beatboxes.

[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.120]
Oh, yeah.

[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:07.780]
Maybe you've got to be careful with what you say here.

[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.380]
Oh, giggle.

[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:09.500]
Thank you, ma'am.

[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:10.480]
No, no, wait a minute.

[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:11.020]
It's all gold.

[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:13.180]
But I have nothing else to say.

[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:14.440]
How about this?

[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.520]
I was the weather down there in the mirror, ma'am.

[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.180]
I'm right down the street from you.

[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.820]
I have to go.

[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:20.100]
Oh, wait.

[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:21.020]
By the way, something.

[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.340]
No, no, I have to go.

[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:24.240]
Okay, tell you what.

[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.600]
I'll hold you over in a break.

[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:26.080]
How's that?

[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:28.740]
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts.

[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:29.340]
Just that.

[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:30.940]
No, wait.

[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.180]
That was the only color we had.

[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.720]
The things on your nose is blowing again.

[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.440]
It's blowing, it's blowing, it's blowing.

[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:40.580]
So loud.

[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.180]
It doesn't sound like blowing.

[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:44.960]
It's blowing, it's blowing.

[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:45.920]
It's blowing, it's blowing.

[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:46.380]
Wow.

[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:49.740]
You got thick, with a face.

[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:53.580]
On your nose and on your face.

[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:57.400]
And around those losing pimples.

[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.460]
You've lost my eye.

[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:08.500]
If you go up in the mirror, you'll be a road map of YSL and C.

[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.100]
You got your heavy sun.

[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:15.320]
Way to say, I ain't got one.

[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.480]
My nose glows when something stays.

[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.860]
Almost every day I think.

[01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:25.600]
And my veins is when they start to tickle.

[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.260]
I had to noise, the door to door is yours.

[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:33.740]
Yeah, I'd fall back on the floor of the bed.

[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.920]
And after a couple of cramping old bars.

[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:41.420]
Oh, when I know it's next to the pickle base.

[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:47.720]
And if you have to slide back to the watch the scene.

[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:51.700]
And I can stand up and stand there with you.

[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.120]
Oh, you know, I had a feeling.

[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.240]
I was like, I'm going to die.

[01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:58.860]
I'm going to die.

[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.300]
I'm going to die.

[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.980]
I'm going to die.

[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:08.900]
1232, that's Gully.

[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:11.200]
It was just an international TV on CNN.

[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.300]
It's pretty famous.

[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:14.460]
I always end up in the Panther games, but we don't hear them at all.

[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:16.400]
Because the knees pop band don't ever shut up.

[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:19.140]
Just a motor mouth dumb fraud.

[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:23.120]
Somebody says the good bye girl, Richard Rackfus for our poll.

[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:24.420]

[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:25.980]
And you know something?

[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.540]
I never, I don't think I saw that movie.

[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:31.980]
But I would buy that because anything with Richard Rackfus had to be really bad.

[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.360]
Oh, but he was in jaws.

[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:35.340]
Yeah, okay, great.

[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:37.480]
You know what else he was in?

[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.600]
That really creep me.

[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.880]
I think this was the movie that really turned me against him.

[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.320]
Was, what was the outer space, the, yeah, awesome.

[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:46.540]
The third encounter.

[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:48.040]
Close encounters with the third encounter.

[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:48.460]
Close encounters with the third encounter.

[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:49.060]
The worst kind, yeah.

[01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:54.960]
Close encounters with the worst kind, like being in the elevator with the uncle Neal after he crept his pants like that.

[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:55.880]
That would be a bad encounter.

[01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:59.060]
But anyway, he's just awful.

[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.420]
I'll let you with a bag of milk.

[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:01.900]
You like him?

[01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:02.640]
You like him?

[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:03.380]
Dryface?

[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:04.060]
Yeah.

[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:05.240]
I've got a problem with him.

[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.620]
I have a big problem.

[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:07.380]
I don't want to see him.

[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:08.120]
I don't want to smell him.

[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.680]
He was also in Mr. Opus penis, whatever that movie was.

[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.320]
Yes, he was.

[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:12.640]
Mr. Holland Opus?

[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:13.200]
Yeah.

[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.760]
Now, we have none.

[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:15.360]
Is that official?

[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:16.660]
Is the official light up on the road?

[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:17.060]
Yes, officially.

[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:17.760]
It's $20,000.

[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:18.600]
It's official, yeah.

[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:22.460]
In a half hour or less, we sold it at all 100 certificates.

[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:23.400]
$29 minutes.

[01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:25.780]
Put that in your piece, pipe and smoke it, Zach.

[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:26.880]
Okay.

[01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:29.540]
That was pretty good though.

[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:29.800]
You think?

[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.060]
Oh, air, air, transomers, whatever that is.

[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:33.060]
ATA shuts down.

[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:33.520]
It's official.

[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:37.940]
If you have any flights book that ATA, good luck to you.

[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.160]
And also that Hawaiian air, did you, Aloha?

[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:42.160]
Did you see that the other day?

[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:42.720]
Yes, I was.

[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:43.820]
Aloha.

[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:44.960]
Bye, Dewego.

[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:45.780]
Yeah.

[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:47.620]
So we have Dewego.

[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:50.800]
We had an in-house suggestion of...

[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.180]
Crow, Russell Crowe for Gladiator.

[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:55.860]
Crowe in Gladiator?

[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:56.440]
Yeah.

[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:58.320]
I hate Russell Crowe.

[01:52:58.440 --> 01:52:59.040]
Although he's good now.

[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:00.380]
Well, let's have one movies and it's good.

[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.540]
You don't like anybody, New York.

[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:04.560]
Hey, Richard, drivers.

[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:04.960]
Yeah.

[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:06.540]
I'm waiting for that facts to come in.

[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:10.780]
What's the great movie?

[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:11.940]
The one where...

[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:12.840]
Not Gladiator.

[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:13.300]
No.

[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:16.140]
The one where he's like retarded or something.

[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:17.640]
Yeah, a beautiful mind.

[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:18.760]
Beautiful mind.

[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:19.580]
That's a great movie.

[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:20.860]
It's really slow.

[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:21.920]
You have to stick with it.

[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:24.860]
And then when you finally find out the ending, which have been and not sported on the air,

[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:26.140]
you don't do that.

[01:53:26.980 --> 01:53:27.700]
I can't do that.

[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:29.720]
I mean, nobody will watch it if I...

[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:33.980]
It's one of those movies that a spoiler is to say anything about it.

[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:35.240]
Russell Crowe.

[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:35.880]
It's pretty...

[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:35.980]
What?

[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:36.500]
Interesting.

[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.580]
Well, there's all kinds of stuff.

[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:41.060]
Man, the facts are coming.

[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.480]
It's like a wild day here today.

[01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:43.140]
What's going on?

[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.080]
What's going on here?

[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:46.220]
Like, our hell broke loose.

[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:46.920]
We're back.

[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:48.100]
We got an audience out here.

[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.560]
Maybe they came back because Futsi Tutsi drove away.

[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:53.560]
With that eight millionth pull on, what's the best burger in town?

[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:54.280]
You know something?

[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:54.660]
Seriously.

[01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:57.080]
He got to just go on to your tomorrow and say goodbye.

[01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:58.140]
And not even anything else.

[01:53:58.200 --> 01:53:59.340]
Just goodbye and just walk out.

[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.820]
That's what I would do if I was you, Futsi.

[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:05.380]
God.

[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.680]
Everybody's a talk show host.

[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:10.920]
Here's one that says, if you got to God father-son,

[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:14.080]
bites it was Tessio that said, no, it was not Tessio, okay?

[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.240]
Hate to break the news, do we already been through this?

[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.400]
Yeah, we looked it up and everything.

[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.480]
We looked it up in the script for crying out loud.

[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:22.300]
It wasn't Tessio that said, look, a Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:23.700]
Listen to it again.

[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:24.540]
It's very clearly.

[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:25.160]
You can tell that.

[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:25.980]
You can tell.

[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:27.860]
It's a commenza.

[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:29.700]
Look, a Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.040]
Christ almighty.

[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.600]
Who did we go all through that?

[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:37.620]
Yeah, where's the company?

[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:37.820]
Yeah, where's the company?

[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:38.860]
It's something else that was Tessio.

[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:39.820]
Listen to it.

[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.480]
Look, a Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:45.300]
Hey, admit, I thought it was the fish at first also, but fish?

[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.120]
You got your fish confused.

[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:49.560]
Now, if you want Tessio,

[01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:53.180]
time can you give me off the whole time?

[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:54.040]
Pro-type-sake.

[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:55.400]
You can't do it, Sally.

[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.280]
Can't do it, Sally.

[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:57.660]
And he said, don't call me Sally.

[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:00.540]
And it was an accident and somebody got hurt.

[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:01.020]
Yeah.

[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:04.020]
It was an accident and nobody got hurt.

[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:07.300]
Poor Kay.

[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:10.560]
You know, she just wouldn't go along with the program, that bitch.

[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:12.800]
I'll let you know.

[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:13.980]
It's rooms up above my range, what?

[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:15.580]
See, there's Tessio.

[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:17.400]
It's rooms up above my range, what?

[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.540]
Listen to the voice, okay?

[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.260]
Listen to the voice.

[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.000]
Let's play it 50,000 times, okay?

[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:22.000]
Listen to the voice.

[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:26.060]
And then listen to commenza say,

[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.780]
Look, a Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.400]
See the difference?

[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:32.940]
No, right here is different.

[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:33.820]
Yeah, a little bit deeper.

[01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:35.620]
It leaves it good.

[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:37.820]
Take a look at all of it.

[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:40.520]
Now, if somebody were to say that was Tessio, they should be shot.

[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:41.400]
Just like Paulie.

[01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:42.700]
Oh, Paulie won't see him no more.

[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:44.540]
I bet you we got that line too.

[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:46.400]
How do you guys do that, that magic trick?

[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:48.160]
Oh, Paulie won't see him no more.

[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:51.980]
Just stop it.

[01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:53.080]
Who did that?

[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:55.480]
Look out with the facts, whose full of crap it is.

[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:56.140]
Not Tessio.

[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:56.920]
It's commenza.

[01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:57.380]
Look it up.

[01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:58.460]
Go a little online, okay?

[01:55:58.740 --> 01:55:59.340]
Go to the script.

[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:01.400]
They got the whole script right out of the line.

[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:03.280]
Commenza says,

[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:05.600]
Look up Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:08.580]
It's an old-sister's message.

[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:15.960]
Former President Jimmy Carter came close to endorsing Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential

[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.580]
nomination, leaving little doubt,

[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.220]
who the Georgian native will back as a party super delegate.

[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:24.160]
Speaking tonight, Jerry and reporter yesterday in the town of Abuja,

[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:28.060]
Carter responded to a question about the prolonged race for the Democratic nomination.

[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:31.400]
We're very interested in the primary as Carter said,

[01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:33.300]
according to the United Jewry newspaper this day,

[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.920]
no forget that Obama won in my state of Georgia.

[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.940]
My town, which is home to 625 people, is for Obama.

[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:40.940]
My children and their spouses are pro-Obama.

[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:42.680]
My grandchildren are also pro-Obama.

[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.880]
As a super delegate, I wouldn't disclose who I'm rooting for,

[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:46.120]
but I'll leave you to make that guess.

[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:51.720]
In other words, you said I give you 85 choices in the first 84, don't count.

[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.060]
Carter spokeswoman Diana Cungilio confirmed the former president's remarks

[01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:58.680]
to the Atlanta Ural Constitution today.

[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:02.820]
Carter was in Nigeria for a ceremony to celebrate the reduction of cases of guinea-worm disease

[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.380]
if you were then 10,000.

[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:07.000]
Oh, that didn't even sound good, isn't it?

[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:07.640]
Worm disease?

[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.100]
Oh, go.

[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:13.020]
The former president won the 13 Georgia super delegates,

[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:16.060]
those party leaders elected officials who are free to support whomever.

[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:19.040]
Of those 13, Obama currently has got to support a 7,

[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.120]
three are supporting swelery and three are uncommitted.

[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:25.180]
Carter, you asked Representative Jim Marshall and DNC member

[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:27.200]
and leader Richard Ray have yet to announce their choice.

[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.480]
But it looks to me like Obama's got at least 8.

[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.660]
Sounds to me, based on Jimma.

[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:35.160]
Whose brother is still even though he's dead, he's still peeing on the side of buildings out there.

[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.600]
That was a classy president, man.

[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:37.860]
Would that brother with his billy beer?

[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.900]
Used to pee outside all the time.

[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:41.500]
Maybe he thought he was an Amsterdam, you know?

[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.100]
I'm sure Zach, you saw that, an Amsterdam.

[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.340]
It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life.

[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:48.220]
Would they have those that have the urinals in the middle of the street?

[01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:49.100]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:50.140]
Well, not in every street.

[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:50.540]
Don't make me know.

[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:52.940]
I saw like guys are peeing all over the street while they are.

[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.340]
But it was weird.

[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:56.840]
I went into a place to go to the bathroom and they're like the bathrooms.

[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:57.520]
Well, that's good though.

[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:59.460]
Wasn't it because they're drinking a lot of beer there, man?

[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.560]
They're drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking.

[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.560]
Gallons and gallons and gallons of beer.

[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:04.960]
So they got to have somewhere to pee.

[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:07.160]
It's better than just peeing on the side of building like you're like Carter.

[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:07.920]
That's a good point.

[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:09.900]
But it was weird.

[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:12.940]
And no, I did not hang around outside those pee holes, believe me.

[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:19.940]
When you're in Amsterdam, there are more delicate places to find people to pee.

[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:26.840]
You get in Greek and treat and greet the neat.

[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:30.160]
104 votes on the new pool, man.

[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:31.160]
Something's going on.

[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:32.760]
Maybe we're going to have a good trend tomorrow, do you think?

[01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:33.720]
Yes.

[01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:35.280]
I'll tell you one thing right now.

[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:38.060]
Either we're going to have a great trend tomorrow or it's going to suck real bad.

[01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:40.020]
What biggest names?

[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:41.160]
The best talent.

[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.420]
You know, there's no logic.

[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:44.060]
425-60-QAM.

[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.060]
The sports leader.

[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:58.060]
This is the moment we learned something new.

[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:04.800]
Before American Idol, you danced in the nude.

[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:11.320]
You worked at a place that is called Dance.

[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.060]
And you didn't dance for any chicks.

[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:18.840]
Now see, Crest bikes you with annoyed.

[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:25.540]
Performing on idol is your biggest dream.

[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:32.140]
Danny Murray ain't, it's not the only queen.

[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:38.560]
You say that you didn't just forecast.

[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:42.420]
Show your junk and sugar ass.

[01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:46.200]
When you get kicked right out the door.

[01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:49.360]
Cause you dance for some gays.

[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:50.980]
You strip yourself down.

[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:54.080]
You stand on the left and you wiggle around.

[01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:55.960]
You hope we wouldn't know.

[01:59:56.420 --> 01:59:57.740]
But teachers don't lie.

[01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:01.060]
You grab them some gold and you win for the ride.

[02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:02.120]
You dance and you get kicked right out the door.

[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:02.960]
You dance and gays.

[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:04.380]
It's all in the news.

[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:07.580]
You say you love music but you fall for love.

[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.460]
You dance for some gays.

[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:14.200]
You dance for some gays.

[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.300]
Now I got to script right here but I can't find that part.

[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:19.800]
I'm worth a lot so I was like, yeah, I'll worry about Luca.

[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:22.400]
When you after your, let's Tom Hagen go, remember that?

[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:23.520]
Yeah, I'll look for it.

[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:26.360]
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.

[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:29.100]
I'll worry about Luca.

[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:31.780]
You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.

[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:38.760]
Good.

[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:39.780]
Then you can go.

[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:41.640]
I don't like violence.

[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.840]
I'm a businessman and blood is a big expense.

[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:45.520]
Sis Salotto.

[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:47.820]
Try the Veal.

[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.260]
McCloskey, try the Veal.

[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:52.260]
It's the best thing to say.

[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:52.940]
Sterling Hayden.

[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:56.760]
All his unsung heroes in the movie who were overshadowed by the

[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:56.760]

[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.500]
Longer and greater performances by the big name actress.

[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:01.860]
But these were big name actress too.

[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:04.260]
Like I said, like Richard Coney.

[02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:06.060]
Bazzini.

[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.480]
What are we going to do about that Bazzini business?

[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:10.780]
How do we get back into this again?

[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.360]
Is it exact fault, isn't it?

[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:13.040]
Always is.

[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:13.940]
We keep getting facts.

[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:14.560]

[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.220]
Keep getting facts as the same.

[02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:18.360]
All they got to do is, and the guy was wrong.

[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:19.560]
Now you search for her.

[02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:20.160]
You want to dialogue?

[02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:20.800]
Did you find it?

[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:22.340]
I'm looking in the quotes on IMDB.

[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:24.360]
Well, you've got to wait to see the next facts.

[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:27.940]
I said the Sicilian message is later sent to the Corleone family, a fish wrapped in

[02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:29.520]
Broughtse's flack jacket.

[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.700]
Meaning is made clear to the Corleones.

[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:35.300]
Broughtse is now at the bottom of the ocean, or as an SEO puts it in the film,

[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:37.060]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.320]
Salotto has Broughtse killed as is the best way of ensuring Vito Corleones of

[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.020]
vulnerability.

[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:48.240]
When Tom Hagen's kidnapped by Salotto, Hagen warns of reprisals from Lucobroughtse.

[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:49.540]
He says that he sleeps with the fishes.

[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:53.300]
He says that he sleeps with the fishes.

[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:54.320]
It's from the website.

[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:56.580]
It was Tessio Broughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:58.700]
But we've been through this already.

[02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:01.140]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.920]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:06.580]
Now I believe it's Tessio.

[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:08.400]
He was always the smarter one.

[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:09.760]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the smartest.

[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:13.980]
I thought we had it straightened out.

[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:15.120]
Now I'm listening to it.

[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:16.240]
I'm not even hearing it.

[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.120]
I think somebody has playing tricks with me.

[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:19.760]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:21.640]
So I put it in the middle of the video again.

[02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:22.600]
What?

[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:23.840]
We think it's Tessio.

[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:25.260]
You think.

[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:27.580]
Yes, I think.

[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:30.860]
And we think it's...

[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:32.140]
A civilian message.

[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:33.020]
Here it is again.

[02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:33.960]
It was Tessio.

[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:34.620]
You're wrong.

[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:35.900]
You are wrong.

[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:38.520]
We've been through this before.

[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:42.060]
As Tessio puts it in the film, Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:02:43.220 --> 02:02:46.460]
Salotto is Broughtse killed as it's the best way of censoring

[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.520]
Vito Corleones vulnerability.

[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.920]
Boy, if this print was any smaller.

[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:52.900]
Yeah, I thought you might like that.

[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.140]
Here it is again from the website.

[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:56.100]
It was Tessio, then.

[02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:59.380]
Some militants bastard out there who just won't take no for an answer.

[02:02:59.620 --> 02:02:59.820]
Listen.

[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.640]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:03.020]
Now I don't know.

[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:04.560]
We've been through this week.

[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.140]
Now have you got the dialogue?

[02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:07.880]
Yeah, I'm looking through things.

[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:11.160]
I think you should continue with the show you too.

[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:12.340]
I scroll to...

[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:12.960]
I'm on it.

[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:14.700]
It's got to be close to there.

[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:16.320]
The website?

[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:20.800]
Tessio brings a Lucobroughtse's bulletproof vest delivered with a fishing site.

[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.400]
So what the hell is this?

[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:23.020]
Clamenza.

[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:24.400]
It's a civilian message.

[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.020]
It means Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:03:26.540 --> 02:03:27.020]
Clamenza!

[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:28.160]
Clamenza!

[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:29.960]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:30.460]
Folia!

[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:31.160]
Arrive!

[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:33.320]
Arrive!

[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:35.480]

[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:35.780]
Arrive!

[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:36.540]
Arrive!

[02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:38.540]
It's on IMDb.com.

[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:38.960]
Right.

[02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:40.680]
I know my godfather, damn it.

[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:40.960]
I don't know.

[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:44.780]
There's nothing else in the world I know except my fattening food and my hot young guys.

[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:47.240]
But other than that, I have nothing I know except...

[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:48.340]
I know my godfather.

[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:49.040]
All right?

[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:51.020]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:53.820]
Anybody who don't know that's Clamenza don't know no godfather.

[02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:56.500]
In fact, let me...

[02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:56.720]
Let me...

[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.060]
Let me...

[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:57.800]
What the hell is that?

[02:03:58.380 --> 02:03:58.840]
What is this?

[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:00.080]
This is legitimate.

[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:01.760]
I swear.

[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:02.660]
This is legitimate.

[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:03.620]
Hahaha!

[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:07.000]
Yeah, just like you're rolling at horrible movie.

[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:08.400]
Huha!

[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:11.960]
Okay, let's get Tessio and Clamenza back to back, okay?

[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:15.280]
Listen.

[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:17.740]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:19.640]
It's rose up on my arrangement.

[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:21.200]
Two different people?

[02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:22.740]
Yeah, there's two different people there.

[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:23.400]
Right, exactly.

[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:26.400]
One of them is a big fat Clamenza and the other one is big tall a fish.

[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:27.340]
Tessio.

[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:28.920]
Tessio is the second one, yes.

[02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:29.900]
Right.

[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:32.000]
There's no way that Tessio will be the first one.

[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:33.340]
See you're stepping on it.

[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:34.780]
Oh, he's like...

[02:04:34.780 --> 02:04:36.060]
Tell Mike it was only a business.

[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:38.820]
I always liked him.

[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:40.920]
See he had more of a craggy voice.

[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:44.780]
Or as Clamenza, you can hear the fat in his voice.

[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:46.160]
You know what I mean?

[02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:47.860]
Well, you should know something about that both of you.

[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:48.260]
Oh, yeah.

[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:49.360]
I can hear the fat.

[02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:50.120]
He's a guy.

[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.260]
I can't take it all in.

[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:56.760]
Look, he could barely speak because he was so fat he was choking on his own fat.

[02:04:58.380 --> 02:04:59.620]
Lucobroughtse sleeps with the fishes.

[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:01.200]
Do you know who I am?

[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.560]
I'm Low Greed.

[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:05.400]
I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.

[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:05.780]
Yeah.

[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:10.340]
At any rate, here's another long thing from Sean and Hollywood.

[02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:12.320]
Boy Sean is just out of control, but that's okay.

[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:12.920]
We love you, Sean.

[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:14.460]
We need more people like you.

[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:17.840]
Sean, unlike Charlie B, who ran away with this thing behind him between his legs.

[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:22.360]
Durantle Neo, at the risk of being chronic, I heard you lamenting the death of decent polls

[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:23.280]
and trying to whip one.

[02:05:24.080 --> 02:05:26.180]
Way to go to Libby yesterday, that makes me think of something.

[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:28.880]
It says, yeah, one, two grand of what I was going to say on the dollar machine, man.

[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:33.420]
I was even Stephen and I got wheel of fortune five times, purple seven, two grand, and I went,

[02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:33.880]
all right.

[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.940]
And all these other losers, oh, he got it, he got it, yeah, you, and then I saw Maurice

[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:40.540]
later on.

[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.180]
Maurice lost seven grand.

[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:46.760]
It agrees, very sad.

[02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:48.220]
And again, I don't know anything about him.

[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:51.140]
I don't know what his, if he's like a multi-millionaire, I don't know.

[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:51.960]
I know he's a frog.

[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:54.880]
I could say dumb frog, but that would be redundant.

[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:59.580]
I think Slotser, second one, DeKino has been the worst odds for the gamer.

[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:01.960]
Crafts have some of the best odds and definitely the most action.

[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:05.180]
I'm not a particular degenerate heaven into a casino with table games in years, but

[02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:07.740]
when I do, the craft table is awesome and fun as hell.

[02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:10.160]
The best can be a simpler complex than the player wants.

[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:12.680]
In fact, the simple bets have the smallest house advantage.

[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:19.500]
See, this to me, smacks of like Sean, who doesn't know anything about gambling, which

[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.800]
he says himself, is trying to tell me what I should play.

[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:24.600]
I like the Slots, okay?

[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.060]
I like the Slots.

[02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:29.360]
I was in Montreal with the Slots, don't even pay.

[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:32.980]
I think I got all the table games I played the Slots and lost my ass, but that's what I

[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:33.260]
enjoy.

[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:35.080]
Do you know what things you do?

[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:35.800]
What?

[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:36.600]
Play the Slots.

[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:38.100]
That's what I'm going to do.

[02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:41.740]
I'm not going to let any, see, I don't even know how to put it.

[02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:42.740]
It's annoying.

[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:47.000]
Even from a close personal friend like Sean, who we don't know, now you were an out there.

[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.260]
What did George say about him?

[02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:51.220]
I said he was a nice guy because he scared away the freaks.

[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:51.940]
We're good.

[02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:54.280]
We like you Sean, but don't tell me how to live my life, okay?

[02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:57.100]
Don't ever take sides with the family again.

[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:04.560]
Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again.

[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:05.280]
Right, ever.

[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:06.820]
Ever.

[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:07.280]
Ever.

[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:10.340]
Here's somebody, somebody bears it out.

[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:11.240]
They printed this out.

[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:14.820]
Tessio brings in Lowe's Races, but it will be a protest delivered with a fish inside.

[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:16.940]
Sonny says, what the hell is this?

[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:19.540]
Clemenza says it's a Sicilian message.

[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:21.760]
It means look up, Rossi sleeps with the fishes.

[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:22.820]
Clemenza.

[02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:26.280]
Big fat disgusting, wonderful Clemenza.

[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.960]
I pulled that right off the IMDV incident.

[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:29.140]
Thank you so much.

[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:31.880]
I have the whole script on there.

[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:35.280]
I can't believe the script from the whole movie is on there.

[02:07:35.580 --> 02:07:37.400]
You know something that's we could take parts.

[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.060]
Let's do it.

[02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:40.220]
Hey, yeah, we can do that hard though.

[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:41.540]
Now, maybe tomorrow.

[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:44.680]
Come on, we have our post show meeting.

[02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:46.360]
I will figure out who will do what.

[02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:48.120]
Let's set that up for a future show.

[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:49.080]
Who's going to read which part?

[02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:51.360]
I think we should do it next week when we get the boards.

[02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:54.160]
We can have another, we can have like, George can be free on here.

[02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:58.840]
I'll be Al Martino because he's been in too many lines.

[02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:00.640]
I want to be a look at what am I going to do?

[02:08:00.980 --> 02:08:01.840]
What am I going to do?

[02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:04.960]
And then you get slapped in the face, you know.

[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:06.760]
Like you can act like a man.

[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.120]
Where the hell is that?

[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:08.820]
Can I be gone?

[02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:09.540]
Coralio.

[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:10.980]
You can act like a man.

[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:12.740]
What the hell is going on?

[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:14.460]
Now that's Mama Coralio, isn't it?

[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:17.060]
Tells you, duck can be K.

[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:18.480]
Why do we have to, what?

[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:19.520]
Duck can be K.

[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.540]
Yeah, duck can be K.

[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:22.080]
That's right.

[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:24.880]
Hey, duck, you're fair.

[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:26.140]
Is he there with the food or what?

[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:28.260]
No, he's very, very happy that they sold so well.

[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:29.880]
And he ought to be 29 minutes.

[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:30.720]
I see it's official.

[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:31.820]
It's on the board, baby.

[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:32.600]
Put it on the board.

[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:33.740]
29 freaking minutes.

[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:36.380]
I believe he's over in these sales side of the building.

[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:37.700]
Good, maybe like the last time he left.

[02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:39.220]
I think everybody's showing what I can do.

[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:41.500]
Just let's see.

[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:43.500]
It says for old times, say could you play the voice mail from that

[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:45.600]
pretentious old bastard who complains about the station

[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:48.300]
and claims that that's not an earlier, so yeah it is.

[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:49.040]
Robion.

[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:51.480]
See, Sean has no doubt to remember.

[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:55.280]
Robion once, he was on WABC in New York for crying out loud.

[02:08:56.180 --> 02:08:58.880]
He was on, I'm sure, I don't know if he was ever on QA.

[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:00.360]
Obviously he was on IOD.

[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:01.940]
Now, you say give it away.

[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.280]
So, do you have to be more up by that bandage caption?

[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:09.040]
But if I wanted to buy some time on your station,

[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:10.080]
I couldn't.

[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:13.260]
You don't have real people in 75, for it.

[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.860]
You don't have it on your regular number.

[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:18.760]
I was asked to be a guest on one of your co-shows or an

[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:19.500]
IOD.

[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:22.480]
They won't even throw me back to tell me what the name of the show is.

[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:25.460]
My work on your station is in 1964.

[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.260]
I'm a sort of prominent guy in Miami.

[02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:31.440]
And by time, and I influence people by time.

[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:34.520]
If you people can't get it together to be a better radio station,

[02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:38.040]
and if you were to honor as stationer in B.S. station,

[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.620]
as if you take a damn frequency,

[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:44.520]
which my grandmother's friend, Jesse J, put on here in 1926,

[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:47.640]
is turning the damn thing off and get out of the business.

[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:49.760]
You people ought to be ashamed to yourself.

[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:51.240]
My name is Robbie Young.

[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:55.520]
And telephone number is a motel in Miami, room 13.

[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:58.020]
You people ought to be ashamed.

[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:00.320]
You shouldn't even be running that facility.

[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:03.760]
And I used to be the boss of the damn thing in 1926.

[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.920]
I ran the damn thing off my land.

[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:08.500]
You are terrible.

[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:11.080]
You have no credibility in radio.

[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:14.440]
Now, a damn old bitch, before I get on the phone to pension,

[02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:15.940]
you get on the phone to me.

[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:17.760]
You can take this back.

[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:19.420]
I'm telling a lot more.

[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:22.720]
It's the same goes through, but it will be because you're doomed anyhow.

[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.000]
Little, I tell you.

[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:25.780]
You're good luck to YouTube, Robbie, you're dead.

[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:26.960]
You're good luck to y'all.

[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:30.100]
So I suggest you to help infectious neural roger Sherrilia says,

[02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:32.040]
Sean, I once called a metal supplier of mine,

[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:33.860]
asked for these real salesman, nice guy named Eddie,

[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:34.560]
and he go in my Gomez.

[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.260]
Well, on whole waiting for him, I was saying out loud to myself,

[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:41.480]
Eddie, this is Eddie, complete with the boom, boom, boom,

[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:43.400]
as it turned out, I wasn't really on hold.

[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.440]
The secretary just laid down the receiving of her

[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.260]
credit office, needless to say, my future purchases from them were done by a facts.

[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:49.940]
That's awesome.

[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:51.000]
That's cute.

[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.580]
Sean's got the disease, man.

[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:53.600]
He's got any orrogynous disease.

[02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:55.440]
Here's the point, since, see if you like it.

[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:58.120]
If I had the time, I would learn, blank.

[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:00.640]
Another language, sign language, for plain instrument,

[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:03.080]
carpentry, scuba diving, to play golf, to play crafts,

[02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:04.920]
more about investing, to do my own taxes,

[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.900]
to sing, to write a motorcycle, how to program my cell phone,

[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.340]
to drive a stick shift, more about history, to rollerblade,

[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:12.500]
to corane, to manage my anger, and more about Jesus.

[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:14.260]
Good pull, Sean, up and.

[02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:16.440]
On the reason I won the 2 grand, by the way,

[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:19.040]
is because I was very perspricated, so I wasn't just blind luck.

[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:22.440]
I walled in in a machine, I was blind luck, I got the machine,

[02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:24.920]
it gave me a spin from 500 almost right away, about 100 bucks.

[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:28.420]
And then it got cold, and so I moved off that machine,

[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:31.500]
and a woman came, and the short time later she got 600 bucks on the line

[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:34.100]
on the same machine, I just left, and I thought to myself,

[02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:36.880]
that's the jackpot machine, baby, that's the one that's paying.

[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:39.120]
And so I got back on there within like three, four minutes,

[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:40.400]
there's two grand on the line.

[02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:41.020]
How do you like that?

[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:41.400]
Wow.

[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.080]
That's just blind luck, Sean, but great perspricity,

[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:45.180]
and it was Flamengo.

[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:46.220]
Flamengo!

[02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:47.280]
Get it right!

[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:49.420]
Best out of two, there's no objects,

[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:51.780]
4.560 QAM.

[02:11:52.020 --> 02:11:53.020]
The exports later.

[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:58.800]
Both this is on, this is not a tumor, it's the one for two hours.

[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:01.580]
It's new, and it's at Burger King.

[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:05.460]
Godfather Trilogy Action Figures, they're fun for the whole family.

[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:09.640]
Collect all 10 mob action figures with each whopper fries and superlice drink,

[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:12.920]
and that's a superlice drink, no exceptions.

[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:14.820]
Get Sunny in his favorite garbage can,

[02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:18.340]
so you can beat the crap out of Carlo after he punches out Sunny's sister,

[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:22.680]
or hit the bullet-rattle body of Sunny after he gets it at the Jersey toll booth.

[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:24.620]
Wow, isn't that great?

[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:27.360]
And press all your friends with the Don himself.

[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:29.620]
I'll make him an offer, he can't refuse.

[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:33.380]
So start organizing your neighborhood now, and get the Godfather Action Figures.

[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:36.880]
Remember, it's only business, and it's at Burger King.

[02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:41.240]
And you're taking a very personal 102.560 WQAM,

[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:42.960]
but I'm sure that I forgot that resolved.

[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:44.600]
Thanks to Fat Chris.

[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:45.620]
I feel better now.

[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:45.940]
You're welcome.

[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:50.880]
Oh my God, that was for just one, for a fraction of a second there,

[02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:52.060]
that Fax your head, make him in.

[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:53.960]
You're wrong, Neil, you're wrong.

[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:55.300]
I like, yeah, like big deal.

[02:12:55.740 --> 02:12:59.140]
That should be my worst, my worst mistake in life is that I made a mistake on the Godfather,

[02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:01.240]
but I didn't.

[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.080]
I got one right, just one time, just this one time.

[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:06.060]
I got one right.

[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:07.880]
Right?

[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:09.100]
Yes.

[02:13:09.460 --> 02:13:10.340]
Oh my God.

[02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:10.580]
Right.

[02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:11.640]
Right.

[02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:13.580]
Look at Brassie's sleeps with the fishes.

[02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:18.260]
It doesn't even sound like Tessu, right?

[02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:19.200]
Even like a little bit.

[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:20.440]
No, it doesn't.

[02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:22.040]
It sounds like...

[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:23.600]
Look at Brassie's sleeps with the fishes.

[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:24.620]
Fat Clemenza.

[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:27.240]
And that's the other thing you whoever sent those,

[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.780]
and I don't see any apology coming on the Fax, by the way.

[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:33.140]
I don't see any of the facts coming from me,

[02:13:33.140 --> 02:13:36.860]
like I went out of his way twice to give me misinformation, okay?

[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.000]
You can call me Miss, but don't call me Miss Information.

[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:41.500]
Bastard.

[02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:43.240]
Look at Brassie's sleeps with the fishes.

[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:48.240]
Smok, Schmendrick, Schmigeggi, Schmiro, Thai Manko, all of these...

[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:48.920]
All of these things.

[02:13:50.740 --> 02:13:53.560]
Anyway, I guess you're not going to get the 360 back, come before Monday,

[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:55.000]
till George decides to bring it back.

[02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:55.700]
Yeah, hold it on.

[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:56.760]
Maybe he sold it.

[02:13:58.060 --> 02:13:59.480]
Maybe, maybe that's what he's doing this week.

[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.080]
He's out there selling some equipment from the remote at the Gulf Stream.

[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:05.120]
Maybe he and Sean went around to selling crap.

[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:10.060]
See, now, I don't know, maybe I'm sensitive, which I don't think I am.

[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:11.560]
I'm very thick skinned.

[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:11.720]
Yeah.

[02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:13.340]
No foreskin, but thick skin.

[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:16.980]
But where somebody says to me, I think slots are a second-order,

[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.600]
and the Kino has been the worst odds for the gamer.

[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:20.980]
I know the odds are not good.

[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:22.900]
I enjoy it, okay?

[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:23.780]
I like it.

[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:24.620]
It's my hobby.

[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:25.680]
It's my pastime.

[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:26.560]
I love it.

[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.560]
It's fun.

[02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:30.260]
It's an expensive hobby.

[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:30.820]
I'll be great to you.

[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:31.540]
I'll say that.

[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:34.140]
And over the long haul, you're going to lose your asset.

[02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:35.840]
But maybe once in a while you get lucky, who knows?

[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:37.920]
Maybe one time you win a jackpot, like the Lotto.

[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:39.120]
Who knows?

[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.940]
Life is full of risks, right?

[02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:43.900]
Like when you work at WQIM, it's full of risks.

[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.220]
Every day when you come in, you never know.

[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:45.860]
Exactly.

[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:47.400]
They might say, oh, guess what?

[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:48.640]
We eliminate your position.

[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.280]
You no longer work here or something like that.

[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:56.400]
On a spring day at a speedway in the South John McCain posed with his wife, Cindy,

[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:58.260]
and racing star, Dale Earnhardt, Jr.,

[02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:02.100]
highlighting the couple's political and business interests in a single snapshot.

[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.680]
McCain served as honorary starter of the NASCAR race that weekend in Charlotte.

[02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:09.900]
Earnhardt drove the Budweiser car, painted military camouflage,

[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:12.440]
rather than its trademark red to one of the troops.

[02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:17.480]
Budweiser then NASCAR's official beer is brewed by Anaheiser Bush Company's Inc,

[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:20.420]
whose products have made Cindy McCain and her family a fortune.

[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:26.080]
The brewer sold to Africa's of its race car to aid the Special Operations Warrior Foundation,

[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:33.520]
and publicized its support for the group on whose board John McCain served and whose chairman later endorsed him.

[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:38.980]
The speedway appearance helped McCain coordinate NASCAR voters and his campaign circulated a video of the event over the Internet's.

[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:43.040]
The McCain's marriage has mixed business and politics from the beginning,

[02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:47.700]
and cornered with an expense of review by the AP of thousands of pages of campaign personal finance,

[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:49.660]
real estate and property records nationwide.

[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:55.640]
The paperwork chronicles the McCain's descent from Arizona newlyweds to political power couple on the national stage,

[02:15:56.460 --> 02:16:03.340]
as he was arrested for a father's stake in the hands of the company of Phoenix Cindy McCain as an executive whose worth may be an excess of $100 million,

[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:05.240]
$100-fri-can-million-dollar.

[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:06.160]
Oh my god!

[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:08.920]
That's more than even we make on this station, all of us put together.

[02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:09.920]
Just barely, yeah.

[02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:11.280]
Except for Muff.

[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:18.040]
Her beer earnings have afforded the GOP presidential nominee, a wealthy lifestyle with a private jet and vacation homes it is disposal,

[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:22.360]
and her connections helped him launch his political career, even if the millions remain in her name alone.

[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:29.200]
Yet the arms-like distance between the McCain and his wife's assets also helped him shield him from conflict of interest problems.

[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:36.080]
Nearly 30 years before John McCain became the Republican presidential nominee, he worked in public relations of his wife's family company.

[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:41.480]
Within a few years of marrying Cindy Henson, the daughter of a multi-millionaire anhyzer-bushed distributor, John.

[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:42.980]
Do you hear that?

[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:44.140]
What is that?

[02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:45.580]
A power supply for a second began.

[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:52.540]
John McCain won his first election, he was new to Arizona politics in front of raising an 82 house race, and his campaign quickly fell into death.

[02:16:53.740 --> 02:17:00.000]
Personal money, tens of thousands of loans in to his campaign from McCain bank accounts helped him survive, and it goes on and on.

[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:05.280]
Just like the Saudis who bailed out W.A. for all his failed, his oil business, all his other businesses in Texas.

[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:07.240]
How about a go on plug that while you guys have a tomb?

[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:09.040]
Hey, why not?

[02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:09.900]
Yeah, you know, so.

[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:12.080]
So how's that, uh, see this out?

[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:13.320]
It's actually very good.

[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:14.520]
So you're heading there to Madagher?

[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:16.300]
I am going to Lucille's daughter tonight.

[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:17.020]
Oh, right.

[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:18.500]
Taken my fiancee.

[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:19.200]
She was jealous.

[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:19.920]
Washing?

[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:21.180]
If you can make her happy now.

[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:22.360]
I'm going to make her happy tonight.

[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:23.920]
That's paying here to the diner.

[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:25.120]
Very good, very good.

[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:25.780]
That's about it.

[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:29.980]
So when did you guys have the discussion about the Godfather bit?

[02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:31.540]
A couple of months.

[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:32.680]
No, no, no, no, a couple of months ago.

[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:35.220]
It comes up every couple of months because we always play the Godfather drops.

[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:39.260]
So, you know, someone always complains, but all that's not that person, that's his person, you know all those things.

[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:42.140]
So it's like, well, no, you know, that's not what it is.

[02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:43.000]
It's actually this.

[02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:47.120]
And, you know, then I have to go there and I find the line again and I fast to him and say,

[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:48.060]
see, this is a truth.

[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:48.720]
It's unbelievable.

[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:50.200]
I think Neil's going to be okay.

[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:52.080]
Yeah, I hope you okay.

[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:53.420]
I was like someone's heart monitor.

[02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:56.040]
Yeah, it's one of those battery backup things for the computer.

[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:57.840]
So it was going off the other day, too, wasn't it?

[02:17:57.840 --> 02:17:59.620]
Yeah, I could open up this other mic, I was sad.

[02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:01.060]
Oh, there's Neil.

[02:18:01.820 --> 02:18:03.260]
Can you give us a blow-by-blow down there?

[02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:03.880]
It's still deep in.

[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:06.340]
It's still something, it's still deep in.

[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:09.460]
Your fire alarm going off?

[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:09.880]
Yeah.

[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.080]
Are they evacuating the building?

[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:15.420]
That is a weird beep.

[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.940]
What kind of power source is that?

[02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:19.460]
You know, it's one of those big ones.

[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:23.980]
You know, those big, huge things, I guess, the APC, UPC, whatever it is.

[02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:26.080]
Doesn't seem to be working so very far.

[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:26.540]
Yeah.

[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:27.760]
The beeping noise.

[02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:28.540]
Maybe it's gotten old.

[02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:29.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:30.640]
It needs to be replaced.

[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:31.140]
It needs to be replaced.

[02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:31.220]

[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:31.680]
It needs to be replaced.

[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:31.740]
Yeah.

[02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:33.100]
Something's wrong with it.

[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:34.060]
I think we lost Neil.

[02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:34.520]
He's done.

[02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:35.800]
Uh-oh.

[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:37.620]
Yeah, we're just going to have to do the rest of the show.

[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:38.380]
That can be interesting.

[02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:41.480]
Well, as executive producer of the show, I will...

[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:42.640]
Oh, now you're executive producer.

[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:43.320]
Are they still too?

[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:45.800]
If he's just walking around your house over there?

[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:46.900]
I'll try my best.

[02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:47.960]
I'll try my best.

[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:48.900]
I'll try my best.

[02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:50.260]
Uh-oh.

[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:50.800]
Hello.

[02:18:50.940 --> 02:18:51.520]
I'm going back.

[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:52.220]
Oh, there you are.

[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:53.460]
Woo!

[02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:54.800]
Scared of hell out of me.

[02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:55.620]
What is that happening?

[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.360]
Because I'm putt something else and all of a sudden everything got disconnected.

[02:18:58.660 --> 02:18:59.320]
Nothing to see it.

[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:01.880]
It's re-rebooting.

[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:02.920]
Rebooting.

[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:04.040]
Rebooting, which that takes like hours.

[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:04.560]
Nice.

[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:06.620]
What about my computer?

[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:07.240]
All that stuff?

[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:09.260]
I hear all kinds of stuff in the background there.

[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:11.080]
All kinds of stuff.

[02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:12.620]
No, you don't hear all kinds of stuff.

[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.060]
You just hear B, C, P, B.

[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:16.040]
What was going faster before?

[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:17.040]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:18.580]
Now it's slowly going to be.

[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:19.920]
Now what do I do now?

[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:23.200]
I'm not that far as before.

[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:25.540]
As far as getting that beeping of stuff.

[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:26.640]
Is that driving you nuts?

[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:28.680]
I mean, we can hear it.

[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:29.220]
I can hear it.

[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:30.360]
First driving you nuts.

[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.560]
Oh, that's because I got the other mic on.

[02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:33.420]
I shut that one off.

[02:19:33.460 --> 02:19:33.820]
Is that better?

[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:35.720]
Yeah, that's a little bit lower.

[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:36.400]
A little bit better.

[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:38.760]
I got it both my sun because I was on the other side of the board.

[02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:41.780]
Now that's the power supply, I guess.

[02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:46.060]
I hope that's what it is.

[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:47.880]
It's fading away.

[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:49.600]
It's not fading.

[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:50.560]
What are you talking about?

[02:19:50.660 --> 02:19:51.760]
We can hardly hear it.

[02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:53.840]
I know you can hear it.

[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:54.820]
We can hardly hear it.

[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.180]
Just throw a towel over it.

[02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:58.380]
Oh, maybe unplugged something again.

[02:19:58.380 --> 02:19:59.140]
When it's gone, it's gone.

[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:01.720]
I don't hear the hiss of his open line.

[02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:01.940]
No.

[02:20:02.620 --> 02:20:02.980]
Uh oh.

[02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:05.300]
Did I do the last 50 minutes of the show?

[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:05.900]
I'm excited.

[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:07.180]
That's what we want to talk about now.

[02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:08.840]
Let's talk about the gunfire movie.

[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:13.480]
Well, what's going on with that power source up there?

[02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:13.940]
I don't know.

[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:15.620]
It needs to get some batteries or something.

[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.960]
Well, usually that thing is good as long as it's plugged in.

[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:20.600]
You know, it only kicks on when there's no power in the place.

[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:22.140]
Who knows what that means?

[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:22.960]
It's a cheap Canadian one.

[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:25.420]
I can only imagine that it is up there.

[02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:27.320]
So now he's just going to be gone.

[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.260]
So now we'll...

[02:20:28.260 --> 02:20:29.660]
This is the Neil Rogers show, folks.

[02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:33.720]
We had Chris and Zach in here waiting for Neil to come back with us.

[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:37.060]
Something did happen to the power source up there in Toronto.

[02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:41.460]
I hear very little...

[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:43.420]
If anything from Neil right now.

[02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:45.900]
Yeah, usually we can kind of hear like a little bit of that hiss.

[02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:46.800]
You ever have an open?

[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:47.920]
I got it. I'm just not having.

[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:49.480]
So we're...

[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:50.520]
You guys are always going to break in a second.

[02:20:50.900 --> 02:20:51.200]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:52.140]
It's always break time anyway.

[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:54.340]
Maybe we'll get back with Neil before that.

[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:56.360]
But if not for the next 50 minutes,

[02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:59.440]
we'll entertain you as much as possible in the Neil Rogers show.

[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:03.260]
So now, Dita, how do I turn the lines on if he has a call in line 12?

[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:04.440]
Sure.

[02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:06.660]
All right, well, it's this little box over there.

[02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:07.440]
I see...

[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:08.560]
I see he's got the numbers on it.

[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:08.760]
Uh-huh.

[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:09.560]
This should be next.

[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:11.300]
He's a best.

[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:12.240]
Oh, hey, there you are.

[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.380]
Neil Rogers is back.

[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:13.700]
He's back.

[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:15.180]
Oh my god.

[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:15.800]
If you could...

[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:18.060]
I just had to plug the thing back in and now stop beeping.

[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:19.140]
I think I just saw everything.

[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:19.900]
Oh, right.

[02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:21.560]
What the hell is that?

[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:25.840]
All right, so Eric says...

[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:27.560]
Is he over the beer up there?

[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.080]
What's going on?

[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:28.760]
No.

[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:33.260]
The 360, every time a nervous breakdown.

[02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:35.660]
What was that last noise?

[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:36.560]
There we go.

[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:39.040]
It's in the...

[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:40.080]
I can't go through the whole thing.

[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:40.580]
It's in the...

[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:41.100]
It's not me.

[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:42.420]
Yeah, I'm over the beer.

[02:21:42.800 --> 02:21:43.920]
So I'm like...

[02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:44.160]
Oh.

[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:46.900]
Are you able to see the front of your battery backup thing?

[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.700]
Listen, everything now is fine.

[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:51.020]
Okay.

[02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:53.920]
All right, well, Eric says if there's an amber or red light on the front,

[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:57.760]
there's probably a problem and you need to replace the internal battery in it.

[02:21:58.960 --> 02:21:59.960]
The internal battery?

[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:01.160]
I guess there's like a rental battery.

[02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:02.220]
Big old battery inside it.

[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:03.780]
Now, let me take...

[02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:04.420]
You want me to take a look?

[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.200]
If you want to look down, you want me to take a look.

[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:06.460]
You want me to take a look?

[02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:08.560]
I'm not going to be able to play the cue anyway, so I'll just...

[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:09.740]
I got a little bit up.

[02:22:10.020 --> 02:22:10.400]
Let's see.

[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:10.820]
Let me look.

[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:13.060]
You got that crazy music?

[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:14.760]
I got some...

[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:15.340]
I got some myself.

[02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:16.700]
There's a green light on the front.

[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:17.180]
I don't see...

[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:18.440]
There's an amber or what light?

[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:21.900]
He said if there's an amber or red light on the front, there's a problem.

[02:22:23.580 --> 02:22:24.640]
Well, let me take a puke.

[02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:26.040]
Let me go around behind the thing again.

[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:26.980]
It's very exciting.

[02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:28.780]
It's making you do it yourself radio.

[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:29.500]
I like that.

[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:30.860]
We got some back-art music for the whole day.

[02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:32.820]
Well, I was gone or everything went off.

[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:33.880]
Everything just went dark.

[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.740]
Then the electric design, here's not like we had a power radio.

[02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:37.920]
Everything went off.

[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.060]
Yeah, we lost you totally.

[02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:42.480]
Go, go, go, go, go.

[02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:44.640]
I'll just play Howard Bites.

[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:45.140]
I like that.

[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:48.120]
Holy wait for...

[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.020]
You know, I'm just gonna come back and...

[02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:50.480]
I'm here.

[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:51.280]
How there is?

[02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:52.600]
Did you all see your one go?

[02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:54.500]
A couple of days ago.

[02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:57.060]
Well, that's not...

[02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:58.940]
There's just a green light on the front.

[02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:00.360]
I will, the hopefully it's okay then.

[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:03.940]
All right, let's do the breaking and maybe we'll come back or not.

[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:05.400]
All right, we're gonna go down.

[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:09.120]
All right, down, down.

[02:23:09.800 --> 02:23:11.980]
Oh, it's tight.

[02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:16.340]
I can't spend no, no, no.

[02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:20.600]
Oh, no.

[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:24.540]
All right, you're the tight.

[02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:27.060]
The daughter is alone.

[02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:29.240]
Oh, no, no.

[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:34.380]
I don't know why you're in this eye and the daughter's bone.

[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:36.660]
Hello, hello.

[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:38.380]
Look at the grassy station, the lady.

[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:41.700]
Don't know why they tell me guys who's in control.

[02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:44.100]
Look at the grassy station, the lady.

[02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:45.360]
Yes, I guess.

[02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:47.600]
What's my snow?

[02:23:49.060 --> 02:23:50.440]
It's about time.

[02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:52.720]
Oh, yeah, I'm too young to go.

[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:53.900]
Go, go, go.

[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:56.240]
Look at the grassy station, the lady.

[02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:58.920]
Oh, no.

[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:02.980]
Oh, you're the tight.

[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:05.540]
The daughter is alone.

[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:12.880]
I don't know why you're in this eye and the daughter's bone.

[02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:15.540]
Hello, hello.

[02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:18.620]
Look at the grassy station, the lady.

[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:26.220]
Look at the grassy station, the lady.

[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.040]
Wow, everything's back to a normal copacitor.

[02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:32.720]
So the power supply is evidently, I guess, the battery is battery pack inside.

[02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:38.520]
Yeah, Eric says he kind of had to replace a whole bunch of battery packs recently and having the same problem as you're having now.

[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:39.700]
So how do I do that?

[02:24:40.900 --> 02:24:41.380]
I don't know.

[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:44.480]
Maybe I have to get the engineer up here.

[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:45.820]
Oh, no, we don't have to do that.

[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:46.720]
Cost is money.

[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:53.220]
And I hear...

[02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:57.380]
I don't know how you can hear those sounds or two, but they're like inside, inside one of the computers on the floor.

[02:24:57.900 --> 02:24:59.980]
It's going like that, you know?

[02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:01.140]
Like what?

[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:03.600]
Like that.

[02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:04.400]
Okay.

[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:06.240]
Yeah, just like that.

[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:07.620]
It's making like a clicking sound?

[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:09.980]
It'll stop.

[02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:10.620]
It'll stop.

[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:10.680]

[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:11.080]
It'll stop.

[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:13.980]
I wonder if that's your fans or your hard drive, maybe.

[02:25:16.220 --> 02:25:18.240]
Craig, maybe it's the DCS on the floor.

[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:20.200]
Wouldn't that be something that would have been...

[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:25.440]
Yeah, but that thing doesn't really get a lot of a wear and tear because it's just...

[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:27.740]
You know, it's MS-DOS.

[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:29.340]
What's DOS?

[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:30.280]
MS-DOS.

[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:30.960]
Or whatever it is.

[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:31.360]
I don't know.

[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:32.380]
But it works.

[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:34.200]
And you should have seen this 360, man.

[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:36.460]
It looks like a pinball machine, speaking of machines.

[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:39.100]
It's always coming back on.

[02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:39.540]
What?

[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:42.580]
Sounded like you were drinking it, you opened up a beer, you want to hear that again?

[02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:43.280]
Yes.

[02:25:43.620 --> 02:25:44.020]
Okay.

[02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:54.680]
See, when the power went out, the 360 went back to the first bank of buttons.

[02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:55.640]
Album.

[02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:58.540]
And so, in the first bank, it sound effects.

[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:02.800]
The white zone is for immediate loading.

[02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:03.900]
Like that.

[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:05.920]
I like that.

[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:09.340]
Or like that.

[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:10.760]
Now be careful.

[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:15.740]
No, there are no park signs on the ablue anymore.

[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:15.980]
Any more?

[02:26:20.220 --> 02:26:20.860]
AHHHHH!

[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:34.380]
You have an apartment there?

[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:35.280]
Yeah.

[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:40.020]
Is that outside or a sound effect?

[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:55.900]
Oh, there's the beast.

[02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:56.540]
I'm sorry.

[02:26:57.500 --> 02:26:58.700]
Oh, there's the lucky duck.

[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.660]
And a rooster or a bird?

[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:05.240]
Oh, what?

[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:06.560]
You heard what I said.

[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:10.020]
Okay, so then I get back in the right bank and I'll go like that.

[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:12.920]
I don't know what's on bank three.

[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:14.640]
I never use it.

[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:16.200]
I've been trying to really get it.

[02:27:18.940 --> 02:27:19.780]
All right.

[02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:21.160]
It's me again.

[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:22.860]
Dush, when you're done.

[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:24.320]
Oh, no wonder I never played number three.

[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:26.600]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:29.820]
Time is mad and hell, but I look better than this anymore.

[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:30.240]
Oh!

[02:27:30.820 --> 02:27:32.100]
I don't think so.

[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:34.420]
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.

[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:36.420]
Just lick them.

[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:38.360]
Okay, that's thanks for your feedback.

[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:38.460]
I like that.

[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.260]
There is no bank four, I'm sure of that, I don't think.

[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:42.580]
Uh-oh.

[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:44.360]
Yeah, no s***.

[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:44.720]
Oh.

[02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:46.520]
Oh my god.

[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:49.960]
There is a bank four.

[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:51.320]
For this day.

[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:55.140]
I don't know all these things that I thought I only George had and I didn't have.

[02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:57.140]
Oh, jeez, I just f***ing care, mate.

[02:27:57.220 --> 02:27:57.480]
Wow.

[02:27:58.400 --> 02:27:59.140]
I like that.

[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:05.260]
Anyway, I apologize for a few things for this technical display, but it's just one of those things, you know.

[02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:05.860]
Crap happens.

[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:06.820]
So what do I have to do?

[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:08.740]
I have to replace the batteries and the...

[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.120]
Well, he says that with the kind that he has, you can just get a new battery pack.

[02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:15.100]
But what kind of battery pack?

[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:15.880]
I don't know.

[02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:17.440]
I've never had to replace one of those.

[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:22.620]
Maybe he can send me an email and give me instructions on how I do it and what I do it.

[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:23.660]
You don't want to do it over there?

[02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:26.140]
I can't do it now in the middle of the way.

[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:26.400]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:27.220]
Okay, I'll see.

[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:28.780]
I'm going to go out and get a battery pack.

[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:29.180]
All right.

[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:29.840]
200 nil.

[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:30.660]
See you in a couple of hours.

[02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:31.340]
Bye-bye.

[02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:34.740]
Wow.

[02:28:35.020 --> 02:28:37.760]
But see what I had done was unplug the...

[02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:40.920]
evidently, the plug that connects the power to this whole...

[02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:42.780]
Everything here, the board and everything underneath.

[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:45.200]
It's connected into that computer.

[02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:46.380]
Ah.

[02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:48.220]
And that's where it draws its juice from.

[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:51.840]
So when I unplugged that and it's time to cut that beeping out, it just...

[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:52.260]
Everything was...

[02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:53.080]
Like that.

[02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:57.940]
And the 360, which I started to say before we got into the beer, the lights are...

[02:28:57.940 --> 02:28:59.300]
It's zimping all around like a...

[02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:01.100]
like a pinball machine.

[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.780]
Like a wild light show, man.

[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:05.720]
It was... I felt like I was on acid or something.

[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:06.420]
Really?

[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:07.240]
It's so cute.

[02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:09.560]
Well, this sweltery, she's on acid.

[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:11.940]
Well, she don't know where her next $4 is that coming from.

[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:13.560]
Somebody sent some money to sweltery.

[02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:14.260]
Okay, she's broke.

[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:15.520]
She can't pay her bills.

[02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:16.720]
Pay your bills.

[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:17.820]
Pay your bills, dammit.

[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:21.780]
Computer went out, I had to like read it all with that thing.

[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:23.640]
Oh my god, everything was like...

[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:27.060]
And you'll notice though, the good news is that this thing...

[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:28.180]
NEOGOT!

[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:30.900]
Got back on there, didn't take as long as I thought it was gun.

[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:34.080]
Because that has to go through all the damn files and...

[02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:36.180]
A whole bunch of crap you watch it rebooting and like...

[02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:37.640]
Look, a brassy swoop with the fissure.

[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:39.900]
We're gonna play that for a hundred times, we're gonna have the DCS.

[02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:44.960]
Now I'm listening and all of a sudden that thing that was clattering...

[02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:45.940]
It's quiet.

[02:29:46.420 --> 02:29:46.820]
Well, that's good.

[02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:48.360]
Is it like we're setting?

[02:29:49.140 --> 02:29:49.640]
You can hear me.

[02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:51.280]
It's what?

[02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:52.400]
I think you fixed it.

[02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:53.500]
I think you fixed it.

[02:29:53.620 --> 02:29:54.120]
I fixed everything.

[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:55.320]
But it isn't gonna stay like this.

[02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:56.820]
Did this happen yesterday or on...

[02:29:57.500 --> 02:29:57.820]
Thing was Tuesday.

[02:29:59.200 --> 02:29:59.200]

[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:01.460]
Probably Tuesday, I think.

[02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:05.360]
And I'm talking about one plug from the wall and I plugged it back in and it was quiet.

[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:07.560]
And there's no red light on there, just a green light.

[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:08.300]
Okay.

[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:11.160]
Maybe Eric will figure what that means.

[02:30:12.300 --> 02:30:12.720]
Not sure.

[02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:14.900]
Okay, here's the poll.

[02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:17.680]
What's the worst performance and to still win an Oscar?

[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:20.280]
Al Pacino said a woman is winning, baby.

[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.960]
Hands down your pants, 31 to 18.

[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:23.580]
You rigged it.

[02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:25.940]
Overcubicated, good and junior and junior require.

[02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:28.540]
Nicholas Kays leaving Las Vegas 18.

[02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:30.700]
Tom Hanks for his dump 13.

[02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:32.840]
Life is like a box of chocolates.

[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:37.560]
Now maybe it wasn't a good movie, but he's in it number one and number two after seeing that clip.

[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.460]
You couldn't give me a watch set for his... a lot of money.

[02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:42.460]
Ten thousand bucks.

[02:30:42.980 --> 02:30:43.560]
How about twenty?

[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:44.700]
Maybe.

[02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:45.200]

[02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:48.220]
Helen Hayes Airport 13.

[02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:49.600]
What is pal, a pal for which?

[02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:50.460]
Shakespeare in number 12.

[02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:51.860]
And that's all I'm going to read.

[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:53.760]
Out of 176.

[02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:54.800]
This is our second poll.

[02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:55.700]
What we have in the first one?

[02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:56.500]
Nine something.

[02:30:57.540 --> 02:31:00.780]
Like 901 909101 902 I think.

[02:31:00.800 --> 02:31:01.580]
Because I said there.

[02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:02.560]
903 903.

[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:04.100]
Hold your.

[02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:07.540]
And 176 will almost to 111.

[02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:08.920]
Right?

[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:10.020]
Yes.

[02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:13.040]
Which will make easily because we have 35 minutes to go.

[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:14.480]
Damn it.

[02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:16.180]
What the hell is his name?

[02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:19.040]
The best out here is your rejects.

[02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:21.020]
Order your 560 KAM.

[02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:22.840]
The fourth leader.

[02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:23.760]
They cheese.

[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:28.280]
And now the League of Recharging citizens will perform their rendition of Greenery.

[02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:28.880]
And do it.

[02:31:28.980 --> 02:31:29.660]
Don't make fun.

[02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:31.600]
They were very hard for this.

[02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:33.220]
Do it.

[02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:34.040]
Do it.

[02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:34.520]
Do it.

[02:31:35.320 --> 02:31:35.880]
Do it.

[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:36.480]

[02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:38.140]
Do it.

[02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:38.700]
Do it.

[02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:39.120]
Do it.

[02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:39.700]
Do it.

[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.960]
Do it.

[02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:43.320]
Do it.

[02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:44.960]
Do it.

[02:31:46.660 --> 02:31:47.420]
Do it.

[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:48.060]
Do it.

[02:31:48.940 --> 02:31:49.340]
Do it.

[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:49.340]

[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:49.960]
Do it.

[02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:51.120]
Do it.

[02:31:51.460 --> 02:31:52.100]
Do it.

[02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:54.100]
Do it.

[02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:54.680]
Do it.

[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:55.280]
Do it.

[02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:55.460]
Do it.

[02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:57.420]
Do it.

[02:31:57.420 --> 02:31:57.420]

[02:31:57.420 --> 02:31:57.800]
Do it.

[02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.720]
Do it.

[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:01.420]
Do it.

[02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:03.220]
Do it.

[02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:04.320]
Do it.

[02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:06.620]
Do it.

[02:32:06.620 --> 02:32:06.660]
Do it.

[02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:06.660]

[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:09.540]
Do it.

[02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:09.920]
Do it.

[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:10.240]
Do it.

[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:11.800]
Do it.

[02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:12.320]
Do it.

[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:12.900]
Do it.

[02:32:12.900 --> 02:32:14.480]
It's it.

[02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:19.240]
It's the bottom.

[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:42.880]
Well, I'm W accounts firm, valuable, I've been recognizing a lot of that, a lot of that.

[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:51.060]
Remember Godfather 3 where George Hamilton is getting really nervous that the deal is going

[02:32:51.060 --> 02:32:52.760]
to fall apart with the immobiliari?

[02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:53.240]
Yes.

[02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:59.740]
And he goes to see the bishop that really nerdy old queen bishop with the glasses and the

[02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:02.360]
bishop extends his hand and says we have an understanding.

[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:05.300]
Well that's what we've got here at QAIM according to normal.

[02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:10.480]
We've got to adopt the eyes and cross the teeth and stuff like that but we have an understanding.

[02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:11.280]
Oh right.

[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:12.020]
That's a good thing.

[02:33:12.020 --> 02:33:12.060]
Yeah.

[02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:14.300]
Well I'm going to be here until I croak on the ears.

[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:15.060]
Oh right.

[02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:16.780]
What?

[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:18.580]
That's a very good thing.

[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:18.900]
Yeah.

[02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:20.000]
Well it's good things.

[02:33:20.020 --> 02:33:21.460]
That's a breaking news for the job.

[02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:24.360]
Unless I decide to see and of course there would be those people saying oh well if you

[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:28.220]
do come back down here and do the show from the studio you would have any technical problems

[02:33:28.220 --> 02:33:28.840]
like that Neal.

[02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:29.840]
Oh yeah.

[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:33.020]
I guess those people have not had been listening very long right?

[02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:33.020]

[02:33:36.580 --> 02:33:37.300]
I will.

[02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:47.340]
See technical problems are probably a program.

[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:49.320]
In fact, don't you discuss those when you have your meetings?

[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:49.900]
Yes.

[02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:50.460]
Every day.

[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:53.720]
As executive director I want you to say Oh about 830 tomorrow let's have a technical

[02:33:53.720 --> 02:33:56.160]
problem like lose the line and whatever.

[02:33:57.580 --> 02:33:59.800]
In fact, member of the George was out of Gulfstream the other day Chris.

[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:00.780]
Yep.

[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:07.480]
We lost him for a little bit there. We lost the line. Yeah, it's just it's part of the abundance man. It's rocked broadcasting

[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:13.560]
And just goes with the territory and of course me being the old pro that I am I don't panic

[02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:17.320]
I just run around here like oh geez. What do I do now? You know like that crap

[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:23.820]
And then the funny part of it is when I plug the thing in and then the lights are coming back on and then it still takes

[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:27.720]
It takes a few seconds before it reestablishes the connection you know

[02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:34.380]
Yeah, and so I'm standing here in the lights are all coming back on the 360 though the lights are just rolling all around and

[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:39.300]
Puking and screaming and then all of a sudden I hear you like I hear crisp like that

[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:40.720]
They like that

[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:46.840]
We've had a couple of those days where the whole show is like that by the way exactly where the audio would break up

[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:52.160]
And it would be and it's especially good when I was taking calls in those days another good reason out today calls

[02:34:55.040 --> 02:34:55.760]
Like that

[02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:00.800]
Even more spancet than usual. What's when you say that about our callers now?

[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:04.160]
How's that guy here's another thing when you when you want to play butch boss with Joe

[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:08.960]
I don't want to start interfering in your show. Yes, even though I do give you some really good advice about that Joe deal

[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:13.320]
I'm taking it we're gonna run and you see we're the experts on it now you see in 29 minutes

[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:19.380]
We sold a hundred of them to them. I'm taking those we've been doing a long time now. What's that chronic caller that they got Chris?

[02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:20.560]
Steve

[02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:22.660]
No, oh

[02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:23.120]
Oh

[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:25.120]
Storm can

[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:34.020]
I don't want to start interfering but let me make a very very urgent suggestion each the storm cat. You know, I mean shoot him

[02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:39.380]
Stick him in the desert and don't give him a map something like that you got it

[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:45.880]
Storming now is doing joy and now you guys start talking to Richie from Boardshead and the other Indian mark the Jet's fan

[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:49.280]
They normally call majority of the time during football season although

[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.080]
Richie does call Richie did call this week

[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:57.120]
We did hear from he's actually gonna bring food in on Friday or he feels left out

[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:03.580]
John Gray right I'm not touching any of that okay. It's your show. You have a good time. Thank you

[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:07.380]
You're the executive producer and director and responsible for everything that happens. Yes

[02:36:07.380 --> 02:36:11.340]
John Gray in the Guardian writes those to control oil and water will control the world

[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:15.400]
I better do the break early because this is it's not real long, but I don't want to interrupt it's important story

[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.420]
It might save it save us from ourselves

[02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:20.460]
So Eric says I got to go out and buy a battery pack

[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:23.020]
Well, he says if you can get the

[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:27.780]
The number the model number you have to help him know what you might need to do

[02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:32.900]
The model number of what the bad the battery pack of your yeah your battery pack thing

[02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:38.060]
That whole thing. It should look like a number someplace on it. Oh, I know a good number when I see one

[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:42.880]
Let me tell you like it would buy in yesterday. Oh brother. There were some good numbers in that place, but guys

[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:43.480]
sorry

[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:44.640]
Uh

[02:36:46.820 --> 02:36:49.800]
Did you fall down or something? No, I think he's checking the

[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:54.480]
Number I figured maybe like doing the breaking would have sex like you know ABC back-ups pro

[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:59.580]
It's like a model no matter where there is under somewhere. I'm not listen

[02:36:59.580 --> 02:37:03.700]
I've already been off-mic than after in the show and crawling around on the floor without doing a while

[02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:06.520]
We're on the air. You know, I'm seeing now that everything works again at least till two o'clock

[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:12.280]
I think we can probably string along chill too. That's all we need yeah, he said pro what?

[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:15.600]
So I guess there should be a number someplace Zach

[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:18.700]
Rosac Ron

[02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:23.020]
All right, did he checking her?

[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:24.300]
Yeah, he fell down

[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:28.880]
14 hundred 14 hundred okay, does that make sense?

[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:31.760]
Sure news that's gonna pose a 1250 so that you know

[02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:34.340]
1400 is in that same thing. He said okay

[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:39.240]
Okay, what I don't know he said okay, so he's gonna send me directions. We're gonna have to do now

[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:41.320]
We're not listening. I know what you need

[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:45.140]
Does everybody said yes, and I know he needs I know what I need

[02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:53.420]
I know what I need and what I want about a check for ten million. We're doing and what's his name?

[02:37:55.140 --> 02:38:02.900]
Something straight whatever oh, yes, Stephen straight. Yeah, I forgot about him. I was thinking about what's his name Ryan Philippi

[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:08.720]
Since he's in the news these days him and Jay Lino is boyfriend with a stupid chin

[02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:15.900]
You think his chin is in the Chinese phone book Jay it might be one 91 on the pole an Al Pacino

[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:20.380]
A set of woman is winning with 35 so I don't need to crawl around anymore during the break. I'm not right now now

[02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:22.800]
Oh, please please pretty please

[02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:26.400]
But the one good thing is we got well, we had several good things happen today

[02:38:27.180 --> 02:38:32.320]
One is that we sold out our thing in 29 minutes number two is that we got a zid in votes on the pole number three

[02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:36.740]
As we got back on the air, which is a miracle number four is local brassy sleeves with the fish

[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:42.840]
I was right about that for once in my life. I don't see any apology facts though from the gothic was chewing me out

[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:48.300]
You know what's that? No, he's lost now. He has no idea. Yeah, you forgot that stuff. What you forgot number five?

[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:50.640]
What's that we sold a couple of good roads with them?

[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:59.380]
Okay, here's PR Ralph. I don't even have to look at I know it's him just from the facts

[02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:04.840]
It is part of you can rail congratulations, but coming from Norma gene when it's in writing and sign that it's official

[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:10.660]
It's everything is fine PR Ralph. Okay, see that's it even a good friend of ours negative negative

[02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:14.020]
Don't be negative be like me be positive positively obnoxious

[02:39:14.020 --> 02:39:16.040]
You're listening grotesque and pull a crap

[02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:20.140]
Christ almighty don't be negative everything's great

[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:22.440]
Really?

[02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:27.500]
Probably maybe possibly or possibly not who the hell knows I could croak

[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:33.260]
I can get up and trip on to dam four here off of this chair and I'd even get to the convenience store to get my candy to a flat

[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:38.260]
Can you wait till two? Yeah, thanks. Yeah, you know the new Snickers with almonds have you had those no?

[02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:41.560]
I think the old Snickers have peanuts don't think what are the old

[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:46.840]
I believe so yes with a brown wrapper, but the new ones with the kind of light tan wrapper you see those I've seen them

[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:52.080]
I haven't had them. Oh, don't do it. I can't and they also make them in the king size man

[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:56.860]
And one for me the queen size good God those make the old Snickers pale in one significance

[02:39:59.240 --> 02:39:59.560]
I

[02:39:59.560 --> 02:40:04.280]
Am not trying to like get you to cheat on your diet. No, not you but Chris the course who can eat whatever he wants

[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:06.360]
I mean he's he's down to his slim 440

[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:08.300]
No, a little bit less than that

[02:40:08.300 --> 02:40:11.080]
So he's going to email you

[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:18.240]
He's a you think you need an RBC 7 battery pack and he found a place in Toronto he will email you the stuff really?

[02:40:18.640 --> 02:40:25.160]
Yes, and how do I stick it in there? I mean well, I guess either he'll tell you in the email or when you go buy it

[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:26.860]
They'll show you dig an ask your daughter

[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:28.940]
You're gonna be the first

[02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:30.840]
I'm the biggest name

[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:31.380]
The best

[02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:35.600]
440, 560, QAM

[02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:37.420]
The fourth leader

[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:38.800]
Stop right now

[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:40.720]
Oh, right

[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:44.480]
I was a one-nated rinkin' when I left the pub

[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:47.900]
It louder it was egg and just the good a field of pub

[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:51.460]
I wondered for the gas station but the dog on thing was closed

[02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:54.780]
On the next corner and with dog me I wish holes

[02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:57.720]
Public urination on all type of things

[02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:01.220]
Public urination is why I'm in jail today

[02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:04.480]
Oh, public urination I'll not do it again

[02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:08.180]
Because in jail you have to do it in front of a hundred men

[02:41:08.180 --> 02:41:11.520]
I told the judge, sorry I was the B and dirty and lured

[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:13.500]
He probably discovered this evidence had to be

[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:14.760]
So I think he's screwed

[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:18.340]
Public urination makes everybody blanche

[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:24.060]
The same you got to go that bad you've been peeing your ass

[02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:26.340]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:27.820]
All right

[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:30.760]
That's an honor of what we were talking about before about those

[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:32.320]
Outdoor urinals in Amsterdam

[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:35.400]
I'm still shocked when I saw the other street I was shocked

[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:38.420]
Well I will say and taste say this and that is in like Berlin

[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:41.700]
They're not outdoors but they have like public restrooms

[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:43.880]
Like in the middle of the city

[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:46.680]
Yeah, but this was in the middle of the street

[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:50.220]
Right, I know you're telling me like I've only been there 400 times

[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:50.600]
I know

[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:50.800]
I know

[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:53.840]
I was there once though and that's what I saw

[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:56.100]
That was my impression of where you go to the bathroom

[02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:58.300]
You find the urinal in the middle of the street

[02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:01.500]
That's what you did you peed there?

[02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:02.520]
I sure did

[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:03.780]
I was having a good bathroom

[02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:06.280]
Well there you go, so what are you bitching about?

[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:07.820]
I'm not bitching I just was shocked

[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:10.480]
And you got three other guys maybe peeing there at the same time

[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:13.240]
And you can't see each other because it's like all blocked off

[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:16.240]
You know it's like on it's like a how would you describe it?

[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:19.520]
I describe it as a urinal in the middle of the street

[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:22.180]
Yeah, but it's like I think with four different sides to it

[02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:25.660]
And each side has got a little urinal in there and you know they're green

[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.520]
It's a few plates urinal

[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:29.680]
Yeah, that's right, that's correct

[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:34.340]
And the food is like looking over the edge of the urinal

[02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:36.220]
Then you just pee right in their face

[02:42:36.220 --> 02:42:37.940]
I guess the man enjoyed an Amsterdam

[02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:39.460]
He never know they're into a lot of stuff

[02:42:39.460 --> 02:42:40.060]
They're weird

[02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:40.440]
Yeah

[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:42.740]
207 on the pool, yeah weird

[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:44.460]
So we got over 1100 today boy

[02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:45.520]
This has been a banner day

[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:46.580]
I think it's you know

[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:49.000]
Time to take a few weeks off after this

[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:50.500]
Oh

[02:42:52.220 --> 02:42:55.320]
So I was looking during the break on those under that number

[02:42:56.300 --> 02:42:57.240]
A battery pack?

[02:42:57.500 --> 02:42:57.640]
Yeah

[02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:00.960]
And there's one that looks like it's a battery for like a truck or something

[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:02.440]
I don't know, I googled it

[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:04.540]
And that's the one you need

[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:05.380]
Huh?

[02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:06.440]
That's the one you need

[02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:07.680]
Yeah, I don't think so

[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:09.860]
Huge

[02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:12.620]
And then there's another one that's like small with a branding

[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:13.620]
I will figure it out

[02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:15.560]
Erick will help put me in the right direction

[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:20.840]
Maybe I can order it online and they'll deliver right here instead of my having to schlep somewhere and buy it

[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:23.820]
Being the lazy fat old slut that I am, I'm sure that could happen

[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:25.940]
You have no idea how many, well I'm sure you do

[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:27.200]
How many things I order online

[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:29.680]
I like I got a great new pair of new balance shoes yet today

[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:33.260]
Great brand took me like two days and they were here

[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:40.760]
Dubah has to toss the low carb spaghetti sauce, the low carb dreamfield pasta, online

[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:41.520]
Really?

[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:42.600]
Oh yeah

[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:44.880]
It shows up here in a couple of days

[02:43:46.140 --> 02:43:47.900]
So after a whole second bacon you want

[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:51.660]
I can't find it, it's Sniders, the microwave bacon, and then this other stuff

[02:43:51.660 --> 02:43:53.760]
I got it, oh, it's to die from

[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:56.660]
Some things are to die for, this is to die from

[02:43:57.660 --> 02:43:59.080]
Awful, nasty, crap

[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:03.180]
Sorry, sorry, now you're interrupting while I got it, this is very important to go to save the world

[02:44:03.180 --> 02:44:03.600]
Sorry

[02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:08.200]
History may not repeat itself but as Mark Freen observed it can sometimes rhyme

[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:10.460]
The crises and conflicts of the past recur

[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.280]
Recognizably similar even when altered by new conditions

[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:20.180]
At present a race for the world's resources underway that resembles the great gain that was played in the decades leading up to the first world war

[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:27.180]
Then as now, or now as then, the most coveted prizes oil and the risk is that as the contest heats up it will not always be peaceful

[02:44:27.180 --> 02:44:30.680]
But this is no simple rerun of late 19th and early 20th centuries

[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:33.860]
Today there are powerful new players and it's not only oil lets it stake

[02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:37.920]
It was rugged kippling a brothy idea of the great gaming of the public mind and Kim

[02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:43.060]
His coconut dagger, novel of espionage and imperial geopolitics in the time of the rise

[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:47.660]
Then the main players were Britain and Russia and the object of the game was controlled central Asia's oil

[02:44:48.140 --> 02:44:52.280]
Now Britain hardly matters in India and China which were subject to getting countries during the last round of the game

[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:53.540]
Have emerges key players

[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:56.960]
The struggle is no longer focused mainly on central Asian oil

[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:00.260]
It stretches from the Persian Gulf to Africa, Latin America, even the polar caps

[02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:03.620]
It's also the struggle for water and the depleting supplies of vital minerals

[02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:07.700]
Above all global warming is increasingly the scarcity of natural resources

[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:11.920]
The great game that's a foot today is more intractable and more dangerous than the last

[02:45:12.780 --> 02:45:16.780]
The biggest new player in the game is China and it's there that the emerging pattern is clearest

[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:19.560]
China's rulers have staked everything on economic growth

[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:23.520]
Without improving living standards, there will be large scale unrest which could pose a threat to the world

[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:23.960]
Through their power

[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:28.520]
Moreover China is in the middle of the largest and fastest move from the countryside of the city and history

[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:30.320]
A process that cannot be stopped

[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:33.840]
There's no alternative to continuing growth that it comes with deadly side effects

[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:37.900]
Overused in industry and agriculture and under threat from the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers

[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:39.960]
Water is becoming a non-renewable resource

[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:44.560]
Two-thirds of China's city's fate shortages, while deserts are eating up arable land

[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:47.800]
Breakneck industrialization is worsening this environmental breakdown

[02:45:47.800 --> 02:45:52.960]
As many more power plants are being built and run high polluting coal that accelerates global warming

[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:59.540]
There's a vicious cycle that work here not only in China because I'm growing growth requires massive inputs of energy and minerals

[02:45:59.540 --> 02:46:01.780]
Chinese companies are scouring the world for supplies

[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:06.460]
The result is unstoppable rising demand for resources that are unalverably finite

[02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:09.740]
I'm never going to have time to read the whole thing. I'll do my best

[02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:12.520]
Is that all I can do as my best? Yes

[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:17.540]
Although oil reserves may not have peaked in any literal sense that these one conventional oil was cheap have gone forever

[02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:23.020]
Companies are reacting by trying to secure the remaining reserves, not least those that are being opened up by climate change

[02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:29.660]
Canada's building basis to counter-russian claims on the melting Arctic ice cap, parts of which are also claimed by Norway, Denmark and the US

[02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:32.220]
Britain is taking out claims that areas around the South Pole

[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:36.620]
The scramble for energy is shaping many of the conflicts we can expect in the present century

[02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:41.020]
The danger isn't just another oil shock that impacts on industrial production but the threat of famine

[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:46.540]
Without a drip feed of petroleum to highly mechanized farms many of the food shelves in the supermarkets would be empty

[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:51.020]
Far from the world weaning itself off oil is more addicted to the stuff than ever

[02:46:51.020 --> 02:46:54.480]
It's hardly surprising that the powerful states are gearing up to seize their share

[02:46:55.340 --> 02:46:58.000]
The new round of the great game didn't start yesterday

[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:02.280]
It began with a last big conflict of the 20th century which was an oil war and nothing else

[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:08.640]
No one pretended the first Gulf War was fought to combat terrorism or spread democracy as George Boyth Senior and John Major admitted at the time

[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:11.320]
It was aimed at securing global oil supplies pure and simple

[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:19.660]
Despite the denials of a less honest generation of politicians there can be no doubt that controlling the country's oil was one of the objectives of the later invasion of Iraq as well

[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:25.300]
In this round of them I'm going to skip to the last paragraph because otherwise I won't have time

[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:28.780]
I'm assuming I want to spill over who's on today or the D.A. show

[02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:31.040]
We don't want to spill over to him if he was jerks who would care

[02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:35.440]
In this round of the great game energy shortage of global warming or reinforcing each other

[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:37.600]
The result can only be a growing risk of conflict

[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:41.320]
There were about 1.65 billion people in the world when the last round was played out

[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:46.260]
At the start of the 21st century there are four times as many struggling to secure their future in the world being changed

[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:52.940]
That a recognition by climate change it would be a wise plan for some it would be wise to plan for some of more of history's rhymes

[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:55.440]
He says

[02:47:56.260 --> 02:48:02.600]
John Gray the whole article is on our website those who control oil and water will control the world from the common dreams and the guardian

[02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:06.560]
Got it I'm sure Zach is going to be racing to read the rest of that right at the end of the show

[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:07.840]
Absolutely not

[02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:12.860]
Oh here's one we can squeeze this in good sex does not to take long survey of therapists finds

[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:16.640]
Maybe men had to write all along it doesn't take long to satisfy a woman in bed

[02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:22.660]
A survey of sex therapists concluded the optimal amount of time for a sexual intercourse was three to 13 minutes

[02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:28.680]
The findings to be published in the May issue the Journal of Sexual Medicine struck at the notion that endurance is the key to a great sex life

[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:35.820]
If that sounds like good news don't cheer too loudly the time doesn't count for play and the therapist rated intercourse at last from one to two minutes as too short

[02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:37.380]
Why have heard that too short?

[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:44.900]
Researcher Eric Corley said he hoped to ease the minds of those who believe that more of something good is better and if you really want to satisfy your partner you should last forever

[02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:52.720]
The questions were not gender specific or he said but he said prior research has shown that both men and women want for play in sexual intercourse to last longer

[02:48:53.340 --> 02:49:05.860]
Dr. Irwin Goldstein, editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine, said in a four week study of 1500 couples in 2005 that found that the median time for sexual intercourse was 7.3 minutes women were armed with stopwatches

[02:49:05.860 --> 02:49:07.920]
Some of them were just youngy stopped

[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:16.760]
It's difficult for both older men and young men to make sexual intercourse last much longer, say Mary and Brain to the clinical psychologist and directorate well minds, well bodies and anapolis

[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:23.780]
There are so many myths in our culture of what other people are doing sexually as she said most people sex lives are not as exciting as other people think they are

[02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:29.480]
50 members of the society for sex therapy and research in the US and Canada were surveyed by Corley

[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:34.780]
34 members of 68% responded although some said the optimal time depended on a couple

[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:42.440]
How much time you have to watch? How much time you got? You understand? Sometimes you don't got a lot of time

[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:46.220]
WAN BAN, you remember I'm saying WAN BAN?

[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:54.320]
219 votes on the poll on the worst performance ever to win an Oscar

[02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:57.560]
Al Pacino is winning hands down Zack's pants

[02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:02.960]
You rigged it for a set of women, the great Al Pacino, well it's not going to be great

[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:05.240]
So it's been great having you Zack, keep losing the weight

[02:50:05.240 --> 02:50:08.460]
My pleasure you know, and I'll be next to it, I'll be next to stickers for you

[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:11.920]
We got Josh Cordis back tomorrow and Brandon need to be happy about that

[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:12.840]
I got his name

[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:15.740]
And the hope from our getting ready, you know, I'm going to get him soon

[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:18.240]
Maybe we'll play air whenever he needs

[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:19.440]
4th leader

[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:23.960]
It's day, if I am the town

[02:50:24.820 --> 02:50:42.720]
I have 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8

[02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:12.700]
I'm not a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good

[02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:42.680]
cos here's a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy, and you're only one that I like the most in America once in a while, randomly Rechts

[02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:46.600]
Well, Niels remain man, M-O-R-O-N.
