[00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.800]
The music expressed on the previous programs are those of the hosts.

[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.260]
Hey, the nanny wants to be your senator from the York.

[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.000]
The nanny.

[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.020]
The bigest name.

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.860]
I'll come back in real quick.

[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.220]
I'll come back in real quick.

[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.080]
I'll come back in real quick.

[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.640]
I'll come back in real quick.

[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.180]
Oh, man.

[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.500]
Oh, man.

[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.700]
What's up, bitch?

[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.100]
What's up, bitch?

[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.420]
What's up, bitch?

[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.860]
Nilsfatt's baguette is here too.

[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.780]
560W is UAM presets.

[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.300]
The NIL Roger Rowe.

[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.500]
Detromed to NIL.

[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.220]
Dial 5675.

[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.980]
The N.D. and Brod.

[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.200]
In other counties, cold cold free.

[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.660]
87775 NIL.

[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.080]
Or pound 560 on your AT&T Lock and Ray Pyser wireless phones.

[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540]
The opinion checker out finances his guests for his college.

[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.840]
Do not represent those of WQAM management staff or sponsors.

[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.160]
No.

[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.880]
Now the NIL Roger show.

[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.260]
I'm 560WQAM.

[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.640]
W-I-D.

[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.040]
Oh, I hate that station.

[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.440]
Bill Adams has a problem.

[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.340]
I'm feeling it.

[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.200]
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.360]
Wow.

[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.260]
No one wants to have to eat it.

[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.800]
No.

[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.220]
Bill, it doesn't.

[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.480]
What?

[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.880]
What?

[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.680]
It's not.

[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.720]
It's not eating it.

[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.140]
It's what?

[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.620]
No one wants to be defeated.

[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.360]
Really?

[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.880]
Yeah.

[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.860]
Oh.

[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.280]
In most ways, Bill appears perfectly normal.

[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.940]
But to the discerning year, he suffers from a terrible disease.

[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.420]
Oh, man.

[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.800]
Burnin' up my shoes up, parallel.

[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.020]
A bill, bill, bill.

[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.120]
But it's burning out his fuse up here alone.

[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.040]
Burning out his fuse?

[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.500]
But you sure about that?

[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.900]
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.300]
Oh.

[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.240]
Bill Adams, like millions of others, is a victim of chronic lyricosis.

[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.060]
Although he thinks he knows the words to popular songs, he is often wrong.

[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.640]
And embarrassingly so.

[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.740]
I was born, yeah, in a cross-eyed hurricane.

[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.840]
No, no, no, no.

[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.580]
It's cross-fire hurricane.

[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.340]
Yeah, pathetic, isn't it?

[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.120]
But there is hope.

[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.840]
With your contribution, we can beat chronic lyricosis in our lifetime

[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.420]
and provide a bright future for people like Bill.

[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.680]
You can always count to three.

[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.300]
You look as if you're first-short.

[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.680]
Then you get to four.

[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.060]
Wow.

[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.340]
It's 10.02.

[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.060]
You haven't played that in a long time, have we?

[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.360]
Nope.

[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.480]
Probably good reason.

[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.900]
Anyway, it's Tuesday.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.260]
These 7.16th boys getting closer and closer.

[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.120]
These people are out of their minds.

[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.100]
They're schlepping and shopping and going nuts.

[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.400]
You have chronica coming up in five days in Christmas and nine.

[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.080]
And New Year's and a little after that.

[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.000]
And boxing day.

[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.340]
Oh, and then after that, we finally get over with it.

[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.960]
Just just everybody's got to go nuts.

[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.880]
Got an email right off the bat this morning.

[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.260]
Isn't that great?

[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.860]
Yeah.

[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.700]
Charlie B's polls.

[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.280]
Thanks, Charlie.

[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.840]
Once we get to 1,000 on this one,

[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.080]
we'll switch over to the Charlie B poll.

[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.840]
The first of several.

[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.500]
Thanks, Charlie.

[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.720]
Alice Rantell.

[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.220]
The fake Alice Rantell says,

[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.020]
I fully understand business decisions,

[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.040]
but in the case of love 94, there's a lot of history

[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.140]
and no doubt a special place for many.

[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.940]
Oh, wasn't there a lot of history on she?

[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.320]
Yeah.

[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.840]
Did that stop a pattern from destroying it?

[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.880]

[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.120]
Don't let it turn into a piece of crap.

[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.500]
No.

[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.940]
Most stations have a lot of history.

[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.980]
Who cares about history?

[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.180]
Love 94 was among the FM stations I listened to regularly

[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.840]
when I lived in South Forest as Alice.

[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.840]
I always thought it was as close to the soundtrack

[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.860]
of the South Florida lifestyle as anyone could get laid back

[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.060]
in classy cool.

[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.560]
Oh, you fool.

[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.400]
Nacely want to drop some stool and jump in the pool.

[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.800]
I finally recall listening to Jim Kelly in PM Drive.

[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.020]
As much as I rocked with Y196X,

[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.700]
I found Jim the perfect company.

[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.920]
Hey, Alice.

[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.740]
You fairy.

[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.660]
What a smooth, relaxing voice.

[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.340]
I recall too how often I heard the station

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.540]
when I was out in the body, various businesses and restaurants.

[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.180]
Memories can never be taken away by so-called progress.

[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.820]
WIOT on FM is going to flop, says Alice Rantel.

[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.360]
All fashes on FM.

[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.020]
I don't know.

[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.920]
What do you think?

[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.580]
All the Nazis all the time.

[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.020]
Jimmy Cifalitic on FM.

[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.500]
That sounds like a real, real wiener to me.

[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.180]
I've got an email here that's like a bombshell.

[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.740]
Is she blonde and need to mark?

[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.440]
Would that make her the blonde bombshell?

[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.660]
That's from the fake and need to mark?

[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.280]
Yes.

[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.320]
I need to mark 560 at gmail.com.

[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.560]
I mean, you know, it's just so obviously fake.

[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.800]
I still think the B Senate.

[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.660]
I'm going to get to it.

[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.080]
It's long.

[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.000]
It's a pull.

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.920]
What?

[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.720]
We could take a poll.

[00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.960]
Yeah, do believe it or not.

[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.120]
It's intended obviously to piss off the big O and mad dog

[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.860]
and everybody else.

[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.860]
So it's either from across the street or it's the beast.

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.700]
It was just, you know, never stopping a troublemaker

[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.060]
since the day he waddled in the door.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.340]
The beast.

[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.140]
I never at 60.

[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.460]
Can I do the poll?

[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.140]
If you must.

[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.240]
No, go ahead.

[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.360]
I said, I don't think it's it.

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.340]
You don't think it's the beast?

[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.040]
He's the one that sent me the picture of any remarks in the first place yesterday.

[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.960]
It's there and all night crap.

[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.480]
Nevertheless.

[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.060]
Although the fake Jim Sarni was the one that sent me the email about any remarks in Jo Bell and Yadi, Yadi, Yadi, Yadi.

[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.640]
Jo is obsessed and fascinated and tittle-aided.

[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.860]
965 votes on a Tubby's poll.

[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.060]
Chris is with us again today.

[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.680]
We don't know when his last show is going to be.

[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.940]
Although actually you got to be there for when.

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.120]
George is on vacation.

[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.860]
Is that next week or the week after?

[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.080]
Next week.

[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.040]
Really?

[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.540]
And then the week after that, I'm on vacation.

[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.900]
Right.

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.600]
I got to be there too.

[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.480]
Well, I mean, I would think I would be here.

[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.480]
Well, why can't you discuss it with somebody?

[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.720]
Isn't anybody talk to you?

[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.180]
No.

[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.820]
And let me just say this before I start getting worked up here today.

[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.340]
It's the holidays I should be very calm.

[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.340]
The swill that we had.

[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.040]
I'm not talking about the usual swill.

[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.540]
We know them.

[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.220]
But the other swill life filtered on the phone yesterday.

[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.740]
I have it really changed my whole attitude about life.

[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.920]
And I was telling George before the show this morning.

[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.660]
There are some really, I'm not just talking about regular sick.

[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.920]
You know, like, I mean, really sick, disturbed people out there.

[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.500]
Stalkers.

[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.280]
You know, lunatics like a fan.

[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.540]
His call yesterday was really special.

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.160]
It's not bad enough that I tried to get into go away already on the emails.

[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.700]
But now take some calls and there he is.

[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.760]
Oh, this is a fan.

[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.440]
He starts getting all bent out of shape.

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.840]
And then hysterical.

[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.420]
Not not not just pissed off, but hysterical.

[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.080]
Oh, you don't let anybody hang up.

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.320]
Everybody is screaming like like a you need a butterfly in it for this character.

[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.060]
And that hangs up the phone.

[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.740]
Get a freaking life.

[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.500]
That's my suggestion of those of you who are like obsessed with me.

[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.520]
Anybody else on this show obsessed.

[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.220]
It's one thing to be a fan.

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.680]
It's nothing to listen religiously.

[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.700]
It's another thing to be obsessed as a substitute for life.

[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.400]
I have no life.

[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.420]
I mean, good, golly, a fan.

[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080]
You're a crazy person.

[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.840]
Let's face it.

[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.700]
If I were, if I was that person, I would go to the nearest mental facility

[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.020]
and check myself in.

[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.340]

[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.840]
If I were somebody who knew him, I'd have him be corrected immediately.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.020]
Can you be correct yourself?

[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.780]
That's what he should do.

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.680]
He could shoot James beaker, act himself.

[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.600]
Maybe good Tammy phase spirit to do it.

[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.340]
Oh, yeah, Larry last night.

[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.280]
I was channel surfing, which I never watch him, but I channel surfed.

[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.260]
And there was the nanny.

[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.380]
And I wondered what's all she doing on there.

[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.060]
Oh, she wants to be the next senator from New York when switlery becomes

[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.840]
secretary of state, the nanny.

[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.780]
And Larry King actually puts her on a year.

[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.840]
This is the same guy that tried to voice Ross P. Rowan to public.

[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.880]
Gotta roll up your sleeves and that's not the old studies and do, do, do.

[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.220]
Get out of the engine and step up to the plate and do, do, do.

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.140]
Some of the silliest swill in history.

[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.340]
You got a whole bunch of votes, too.

[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.680]
967 votes on our poll.

[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.560]
What's your take on a holiday season?

[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.040]
It's okay, 317.

[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:21.920]
Okay.

[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.980]
I can't wait for it to end 276.

[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.640]
Please.

[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.360]
I love it.

[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.200]
187.

[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.220]
I hate it 98.

[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.540]
And WTF.

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.360]
What the F 89 out of 967.

[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.080]
972.

[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.760]
Boy, they're coming in and chucks now.

[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.940]
They want to get us up to 1000 so we can change it.

[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.060]
If I was them, I wouldn't get too excited about it.

[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.420]
So at 10 12 p.m. last night.

[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.240]
By the way, thanks profusely to George for getting my internet back working this morning.

[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.940]
One of the worst things that can ever happen to you.

[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:54.780]
Right.

[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.860]
Is to sit down at your PC and you realize the internet is far blundging.

[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.660]
I sat down here this morning and no connection.

[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.920]
I mean, there was connected.

[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.900]
The thing was, you know, the lights were popping and puking but couldn't get on it.

[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.920]
Couldn't get on my Firefox.

[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.220]
And George walked me through the whole process.

[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.220]
I wasn't that hard either.

[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.140]
No, no.

[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.720]
And if we wouldn't have got the internet back on,

[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.380]
we wouldn't have been able to take all those great calls we're going to be taking today.

[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:22.940]
That's right.

[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.860]
I'm your friend.

[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.400]
I'm your friend.

[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.760]
Anyway, this came in at 10 12 last night as phony is a $46 bill because nobody could be that stupid

[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.360]
that they would send this crap to me.

[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.100]
Anita Marx.

[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.940]
The fake Anita Marx, of course.

[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.540]
Hi there, Neil.

[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.140]
A work colleague played me an outtake from your Monday show when you mentioned me.

[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:54.540]
While I hope the news did not cut an out this way or this soon, I guess I can confirm that I'm indeed joining the WQM family at the end of the Ravens football season.

[00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.400]
I'm really excited to become part of the most professional dynamic and industry respected sports radio team in the country.

[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:11.540]
Mr. Bell and Mr. Dero seem like they have a handle on what good sports talk radio is and are dedicated to keeping the station as the gold standard by which all sports radio is judged.

[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.940]
I can't wait to be part of it.

[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:23.320]
I'll be taking over the 2 to 4 PM time slot initially, but Mr. Dero has assured me that once he completes some other programming changes, I'll settle into the afternoon drive slot by March.

[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.040]
After that, I'll have a shot of being the third person on that often broadcasts next fall.

[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.180]
I don't know this Jim Sarnigai who brought up my name, but let me fill in some of the blanks.

[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.300]
Mr. Bell's been making inquiries to my agent about my availability for quite some time when discussions started to heat up.

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.380]
I got the chance to meet Mr. Bell. He seemed a little creepy with his white hair and leering look, but otherwise seem charming.

[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:52.480]
His downhomes in Syriti and obvious knowledge of the radio business were enough to convince me to make the jump to WQM.

[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.640]
His dedication to the best interest of the honorier talent also helped me make up my mind.

[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.340]
It took about 6 to 8 months to finalize the details of my contract.

[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.840]
Mr. Bell and Mr. Dero indicated they needed to free up some financial commitments.

[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.920]
The former and current employees to reach my contract requirements.

[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.380]
I sure appreciate the straightforward and honest way I was dealt with throughout the negotiations.

[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.980]
To close, I'm looking forward to meeting you at some point.

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.780]
Your history in South Florida radio is legendary. From the short clip of your show I heard yesterday, I didn't hear much sports talk.

[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.040]
We'll have to do some crosstalk between our two programs.

[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.040]
I also can't believe you allow your producer George on the air as much as you do.

[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.700]
I don't mean to tell you how to run your show, but I'm not sure he belongs on the radio.

[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.200]
The board off Chris sounds cute. I might want to meet him real soon.

[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.580]
If he looks as sexy as he sounds, I may want him to be the producer for my show, Wink.

[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.080]
You're soon to be co-worker Anita Marx.

[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.120]
Exo.

[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.400]
Happy face.

[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.280]
Wink, wink, nod, nod, munch nunch.

[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:52.680]
Oy, vain.

[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.400]
So what do you think, Senthus? I think the beast.

[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.940]
I don't.

[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.140]
Why do you say that?

[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.080]
Because I don't. I don't think that's his style.

[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.240]
It's not his style. I don't.

[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.040]
I think Joe Bell sent it.

[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.580]
Possible. We're likely to be. He'll send me an email saying, who blamed somebody else?

[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.900]
I don't know that. I think it's the same goofball that's defake everybody else.

[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.040]
It wasn't the fake Alice Rantel. I'll give you a damn tee of that.

[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.960]
Fake Alice Rantel is on to that thing about Gloves 94 and Yachty.

[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.780]
How come nobody's writing about that? What happened to the real Tom Jicca?

[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.700]
Who was going to get the lowdown on that crap? A cheap channel, huh?

[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.000]
What's going on here? Where's the fake Barry Jackass with the real Anita?

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.680]
Mark's story.

[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.460]
You guys talk a good game, but when push comes to shove, you ain't shoving it in the right place.

[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.600]
The biggest name.

[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.980]
The best of the best.

[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.400]
The best of the best.

[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.020]
The best of the best.

[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.240]
The best of the best.

[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.240]
The best of the best.

[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:42.860]
The best of the best.

[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.620]
The best of the best.

[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:48.560]
The best of the best.

[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.420]
The best of the best.

[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.320]
The best of the best.

[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.740]
Crosse dressing with Mo Jackson.

[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.580]
Oh, nose, lingerie.

[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.520]
Oh, nose, garter bell.

[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.540]
Oh, nose, I'll find last year.

[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.720]
And he's so good with eyeliner, don't you?

[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.760]
That's a looping.

[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.680]
You know that's true, but both sweetheart.

[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:18.700]
What?

[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.760]
You don't know deadly.

[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.740]
What don't you sit there and introduce me?

[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.780]
Okay, Mr. Deadly.

[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.840]
This is Mr. Jackson.

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.480]
Give you what it dress like a woman.

[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.680]
Just do it.

[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.400]
What is this?

[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.540]
This is a real tweet, digging out all these oldie moldy's men here at the end of the year.

[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.360]
Can you think? Sure.

[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.560]
I do. Oldie moldy.

[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.700]
Let's get some spy reports on Anita Marks and find out what that bitch, what she's all about.

[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.480]
I don't see anything happening on the phone yet.

[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:50.700]
What?

[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.160]
B said that was not him.

[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.400]
The call you were in the bottle in there.

[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.240]
He sent me a text.

[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.080]
Oh.

[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.220]
Who does he think it was?

[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.360]
He didn't say that.

[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.100]
Well, he's got the inside dope.

[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.300]
I mean, he's got his head so far.

[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.100]
Clarence's ass.

[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.020]
He comes out of his ear.

[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.980]
He ought to send you another text and tell you what the real lowdown is there.

[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.700]
Because certainly if there's anything going on, he would be the one to know.

[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.700]
He's got his ear to the...

[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.920]
Clarence's ugly ass.

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.740]
That's where you'll find the beast's nose and tongue.

[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.240]
And maybe the other body parts got only nose.

[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.320]
567-0560, pound 56 on the Verizon AT&T wireless lines.

[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.860]
I want to take at least two, two, three thousand calls today.

[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.360]
What do you say?

[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:36.760]
Great.

[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.080]
They might even sound like something.

[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.220]
You don't sound nearly as enthused about it as you did yesterday.

[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.460]
You were pushing me.

[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.320]
That's what I think calls yesterday.

[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.800]
Well, we wanted to do that experiment.

[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.320]
Well, how are we going to do it again?

[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.520]
I don't think anything has changed yet.

[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.460]
But you said that the engineer was in there with a whole bunch of wires.

[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.180]
He was running the wires.

[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.080]
But I don't know if he's done yet.

[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.700]
Let me see, is this phone working or what?

[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.000]
Are we on the air?

[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.100]
Is the transmitter turned on or what?

[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.540]
Good. God.

[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.520]
This is like the death now.

[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.340]
Talk about the friggin' Titanic.

[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.120]
Okay, let's take a look at that.

[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.260]
We got a... I don't know if this is the real Adam Kirschner or the fake one.

[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.440]
How do we know?

[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.400]
It's the fake one.

[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.580]
Oh. The fake...

[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.660]
QAM, hello.

[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.500]
Yes.

[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.680]
Oh, that was good.

[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:28.540]
Hello.

[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.940]
Maybe it was just line checking.

[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.920]
I think there was line 9.

[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.300]
The fake Adam Kirschner says,

[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.080]
I've been listening to the WIOD a lot lately.

[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.060]
Must say it's really a shell of its former self.

[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.340]
Yes, it's a shell of a station, all right?

[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.380]
WIOD used to be a powerhouse station for talking entertainment.

[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.360]
Now it seems to have morphed into a station where right wing opinion is more important than fact, which is really sad.

[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.180]
Who would have ever thought that WFTL would end up put a position to win in news?

[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.960]
I wonder if Charles and Charges Clueless or if his hands are tied by people higher up than he is.

[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.900]
One thing is for sure.

[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.640]
With them turning Jimmy Cifilis into a rushed limbaugh type program,

[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.780]
it's the final nail on the coffin for the once great olive dreams.

[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.100]
Software needs are reliable, radio news talk source to listen to in the mornings when we're all stuck in traffic.

[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.120]
Otherwise there's no compelling reason not to just turn on the XM or series.

[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.900]
Agree? This is a great question mark.

[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.040]
I don't care.

[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.960]
I mean, all these people keep talking about all these changes.

[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.520]
What I'd like to know is one thing.

[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.220]
When somebody's going to put something good on here.

[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.240]
That's what I like to do.

[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:28.720]
Yeah, let us know.

[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.240]
Yeah, let us know when somebody's going to put something worth listening to and we'll be delighted to promote it.

[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.520]
Oh, this one's changing this and this one's moving.

[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.780]
Tell us when there's going to be some really good programming on.

[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.280]
Then we'll get excited about it.

[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.320]
W-D-Q-I-M. Hello.

[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.500]
Hey, Neil.

[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.180]
Yeah.

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.340]
I just wanted to see if George checked out.

[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.040]
I was one of the half a dozen people that showed outside of the current F-E-S.

[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.820]
Oh, thank God.

[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.800]
Thank God for you.

[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.020]
Well, I just wanted to see if he checked out the sublime thing I gave him.

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.180]
Yes, it's great.

[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.000]
Thank you very much.

[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.480]
You're a very welcome.

[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.780]
I'm sorry I couldn't stick around out of that work.

[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.320]
It's all right.

[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.140]
Next time.

[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:08.460]
Hi, buddy.

[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.020]
All right. Thanks for carrying it off.

[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.960]
Okay, even though you don't care about me, that's okay.

[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.160]
I love you, Neil.

[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.520]
It's just a joke. Just relax.

[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.280]
Just calm down.

[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:15.860]
Have a great life.

[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:16.960]
Have a great holiday, Pali.

[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.100]
All right.

[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:18.920]
Okay.

[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.440]
God, these people are very sensitive and very uptight.

[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.860]
It's just a radio show.

[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:24.960]
No, it's the life.

[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.440]
It's my life. I'm a fan.

[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.460]
I'm a fan.

[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.720]
And you hang up on anybody who disagrees with you.

[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.800]
You're a big fan.

[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.620]
Great.

[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:32.620]

[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:32.640]
I mean-

[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.060]
That was a performance-

[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.760]
losing it.

[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.340]
I mean, even Joan Crawford would have been impressed

[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.480]
by that acting performance.

[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.800]
Just going ballistic-

[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.080]
996 on the pool.

[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.180]
Pretty soon we're going to change it.

[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:44.840]
Steve.

[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.420]
Joan Crawford.

[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:45.860]
What?

[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.480]
Bson says-

[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:47.680]
Yes.

[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.560]
basically he's no longer the Golden Boy.

[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.400]
So he has no special intentionally.

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:59.180]
Golden boy. Yeah, he has no inside that. I know that anymore. That's bull crab. He's been saying that for a long time

[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.740]
Believe you me when him and Clarence are laying there knows to know is lip to lip

[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.620]
Trust me when I tell you Clarence's whispering all sorts of somethings into a zirn. That's sweet nothing's but sweet somethings

[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.700]
Well, you know what song are we like I?

[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.680]
Give up poker face

[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.380]
Have you ever I don't think I've ever heard of that song what poker face

[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.240]
Yeah

[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.820]
By whom it's a big hit. I don't know the name of the group

[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:32.140]
Well, this is a relatively new song you're talking. It's very new the video is all right. It's a bit of a Egyptian looking chick right away

[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.400]
And then the part of the lyric is blah blah blah blah blah blah blah like that. I thought you were trying to think of before

[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.360]
No, we couldn't find it. Yes. Okay. Great. Maybe I don't know you don't know poker face

[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.320]
Yeah, right. Maybe you better find your music mister. Well, of course you don't have as much much music

[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.080]
We got much much much you got MTV would only know what if I hear it

[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.400]
You're a lot of music I recognize you chance it love

[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.880]
If they find anybody who outside this building anyway who watches that show I'm gonna have them be corrected

[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.900]
I wonder if they have the beaker act in Canada a

[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.640]
WQ I am hello. Yeah, this is a fake phone call

[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.540]
Yeah

[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.960]
Q I am hello

[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.720]
Q I am with a radio turned way up loud

[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.760]
You would like to speak speak

[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.520]
Speak can you do it?

[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.260]
That's a great song. I have on my heart. It's awesome. Yeah

[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.140]
Wow

[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.780]
See this audience don't know from that song because they're like all a hundred years old so they don't have any idea

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.600]
And the only reason I saw it is because Paco in between watching another shot of love

[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.280]
You know watch some of the videos how much music they should do show music videos. I know that's a shock

[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.920]
I know I know it's

[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.860]
Did you look it up poker face? I'm not looking it up

[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.820]
I'm gonna download it so that we can play it and I'll send you a copy of it. It's such and so on great. It's a good song

[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.420]
WQ I am hello

[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.060]
You're calling

[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:18.680]
Are you sir? Okay? I just wanted to say hello the gambling going good down here and you are the king

[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.180]
Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Wow WQ I am hello

[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.260]
Hey Neil good morning. Good morning. Hey, um, I hate to bring up a

[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:36.780]
That's a second bring up one then Godfather again. But Godfather Godfather to their in Cuba. They're up there

[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:36.920]
Uh

[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.860]
Hyman Roths like penthouse thing they're cutting the cake and whatever and he says to

[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:50.400]
Michael about they finally have a government to can work with business right how relevant is that to today's times

[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:56.520]
Considering what the Bush administration did with their oil cronies in the amount of money that they made over

[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.960]
This last eight years and then even

[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:05.800]
The financial interest see that banks did you I just heard yet today you know they gave the tarp money and part of the tarp money

[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.140]
Was the restriction of the benefit of how much they could get bonuses to

[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.980]
The executive and things like that work turns out Bush when he passed the bill

[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:21.060]
Change one thing saying that the executive didn't have to worry about that is correct

[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.380]
He overruled the Congress that's right. He said now we want the these guys to make get the big bucks

[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.380]
That's right. It reminds me of here. You know hymen Roths and all we finally have a government that knows how to work with business

[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.900]
Man was at the case for this one. I thought they knew though the Republicans have been the party of business ever since they were invented

[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.240]
Oh, oh true no doubt no doubt about it

[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.140]
But the amount of money that they scammed from well

[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.600]
Listen have a great holiday and don't worry about it. Okay. It's there. It's a corrupt world we live in it is a major

[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.340]
slaughterhouse. It's a madhouse

[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.580]
And somebody's calling maybe it's the president

[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.600]
Maybe he's not too happy with your altitude. Oh this guy that turned out to be the big scamster. Where the hell's the article about that?

[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.360]
Maybe I didn't even print it out

[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.080]
Made off made off made off the fortune. He made off with everybody's money

[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.260]
Yeah, including Norman Braiman and the owner of the redskins a whole bunch of people he made off of there they owner the

[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.780]
Giants or the jets somebody. I don't know and I don't really care

[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.840]
Sonny Fox wants his 600 grand back from Sal Foo so I guarantee you that

[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.040]
Maybe sonny Fox is the one sending these email remember we had that way back when we don't really care

[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.020]
I mean to be honest with the fake this one and fake that one those are actually pretty good

[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.480]
I enjoy those even though you hate them like poison. I don't hate them. They're just yes you know you despise them all right

[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.520]
I hate them. What are you saying?

[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:43.300]
So did you get that song yet poker face in process? Oh my god

[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.200]
I read me syphilite show or somebody

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.980]
Somebody emailed me some crap about to me syphilite this morning

Says this is the pull from Jimmy syphilite's page on W.Y.O.D. today. Oh

[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.640]
You know this right wing suck up that's going on over there

[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.920]
The suction is so hard. It's amazing that anybody can even be sitting in their seat

[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.340]
If all of a sudden you get pulled out of your cheer you'll understand what's going on?

[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.840]
Right wing ultra suction didn't they check out the election?

[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:03.000]
Then we have an election maybe yeah, I guess they missed it

[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.500]
Here's Jimmy syphilite's pull on his webpage today as President Bush closes out a second term

[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.280]
What grade would you give his presidency?

[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.600]
And here's the result so far a plus

[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.920]

[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:31.900]
Of the right wing Nazis who are glued there to 610 your fascist station by the way lady Gaga is the chick that that's a group. Yes, I don't

[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.280]
She sings poker face. Yes, she does

[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.020]
Now are you familiar with a song now that you've heard it or not? Yes. Oh, thank God for that

[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.120]
This it'll play on the radio

[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.620]
Of course I started to get to know the names of songs

[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.360]
Hold them like they do and take this day

[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.300]
Hold them let them hit me raise it baby stay with me

[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:10.320]
I love it love game and tuition play the cards of states to start and after he's been hooked

[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.660]
I'll play the one that's on his heart

[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.540]
Oh

[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.600]
I'll get him high

[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.620]
I'll get him high

[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:37.420]
But more oh not enough. Okay now the fake very jackass is really slipping

[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:43.220]
He sends me the same crap to be sent me yesterday about Anita marks with the same picture and the same bio

[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.660]
That's not what we're looking for some stupid biography

[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.940]
Stupid much a crap. Oh, no, this is a different picture. Sorry to fake Barry

[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.340]
But that's the best you can do

[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.320]
Anita marks grew up in South. They were playing football in the streets became a way of life

[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.860]
But it beat but a boop but about but about she then headed to Tampa to attend the University of South Florida

[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:12.080]
USF is where she was able to fine tune her football skills and dominate the collegiate bag football circuit for four years

[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:20.100]

There's no power today.

And we are getting tired of it.

[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.920]
New York, New York.

[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.700]
These electrical grids.

[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.880]
Our way out of date.

[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.820]
Get someone to rewire it.

[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.880]
New York, New York.

[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:33.600]
I don't want to wake up in a city with no AC.

[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.100]
And find my food has all spoils.

[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.580]
Can't watch TV.

In old New York.

[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:08.460]
If it can happen here, it can happen.

[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.540]
Anywhere, what will they do?

[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.420]
New York, New York.

It's not New York.

[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:24.820]
You have to say it right.

[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.220]

Is it Bristol Connecticut?

[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.880]
I thought the Bristol stop was like a Philly song.

[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:48.780]
Who did that?

[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:53.860]

[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.500]
The Dove House.

[00:35:58.940 --> 00:35:59.920]
An orange label.

[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.620]
What a memory.

[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.580]
What a sick home.

[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.320]
And I do like this song.

[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.080]
It's a sort of way.

[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.280]
Put it back.

[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.080]
Some of the companies stuck in with a food driver.

[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.420]
They're not even wanting it.

[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.020]
I was watching the lovely, young and good.

[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.720]
Okay, that's enough.

[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.000]
One more time.

[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.020]
I'm going to have a shot for the school Monday.

[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.600]
That's where it's the stop.

[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.400]
Love it.

Lady Gaga was at set nightclub on South Beach in Halloween.

[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.820]
Also, she performed at Wild 100s Jingle Ball three nights ago at Sunrise at the Bank of Atlantic

[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.240]
Center along with Jessie McCartney.

[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.500]
And nobody told me Jessie McCartney was going to be there.

[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.620]
It's not far from my house.

[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.940]
Oh my God.

[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.540]
Are you people crazy or what?

[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.380]
Jessie McCartney.

[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.200]
I'm in love.

[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.300]
Jesus God.

[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.340]
Man.

[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.980]
He's attractive, you know.

[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.040]
So here's the little faggot.

[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.600]
Here's the fake Larry King.

[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.980]
Oh, don't tell Joe, Joe dumbbell, but he need to march his Jewish.

[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.580]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait till they get wind of that.

[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.140]
I'm good timing to be applying for a job at 2 am when you're Jewish.

[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.960]
When they're blowing all the idlach out the door.

[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.440]
Everybody.

[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.360]
All the Jews you got to go out.

[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.320]
Yes, flea says as far as he knows, there's no need of marks coming.

[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.980]
She's not coming.

[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:30.720]
Correct.

[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.220]
Oh, it's not good to personal.

[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.880]
Lady football player, what do you think of that?

[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.160]
That's fine.

[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.620]
You fairy.

[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.520]
Lady football player, does that sound like a feminine person to you?

[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.320]
I mean, I don't know her.

[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.440]
I saw this picture earlier.

[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.780]
But she was very attractive to me.

[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.060]
I don't want to be presumptuous, you know.

[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.780]
But what difference does it make?

[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.880]
She ain't coming anyway.

[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:50.340]
That's right.

[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.500]
So that's what flea said.

[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.320]
What the hell does he know?

[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.500]
He thinks he's on the inside.

[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.360]
He's out of the loop.

[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.820]
Well, he's become our newest system program director basically.

[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.140]
What do you mean by that?

[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.700]
When they got rid of Allison, they asked him to take on some of the duties.

[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.500]
And I'm sure no increase in pay.

[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.420]
Jeff says, how about which is hot lineman?

[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.920]
What's with all these Glenn Campbell songs?

[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.700]
My God.

[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.460]
Hey, it just happened.

[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.500]
Hey, Glenn.

[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.180]
Have another pop, man.

[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:22.500]
W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:22.700]
Hello.

[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.600]
Not there.

[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.760]
Well, why would they still be there?

[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.060]
Been ringing and ringing and ringing.

[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.340]
I haven't been hot right on it.

[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.140]
You're fault.

[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.720]
You're supposed to steer me in the right direction.

[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.580]
I'm going to old, funny.

[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.700]
That was funny when the dots were on the phone this morning when my internet connection was all screwed up.

[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.360]
That's a panicky moment.

[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.280]
Panicky time.

[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.800]
Not panicky time, but just a disturbing.

[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:42.220]
Sure.

[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.540]
It might be panicky if we cared as much as we used to, but now that we realized we're not supposed to.

[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.080]
Don't get too panicky.

[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.700]
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.

[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.560]
Neil.

[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.360]
Neil, this is Fuddy.

[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.120]
I saw my last Fuddy sauce.

[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.080]
Get me back on the radio and I'll give you my wing ding, ding, ding, ding.

[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.520]
Yeah, you stink, Fuddy.

[00:38:59.600 --> 00:38:59.980]
You stink.

[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.180]
You stink.

[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.780]
Your show blow.

[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.140]
Remember all that crap.

[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.520]
Oh, Fuddy's going to kick your ass and Fuddy's going to do this.

[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:07.840]
Wow.

[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.020]
How's Fuddy doing now, huh?

[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.220]
Fuddy didn't sell out like Jimmy Cifullitic to the right wing and go on here and spew right wing.

[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.960]
Uh, uh, I'll fit there up this propaganda every day.

[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.820]
I'm getting tongue tied just thinking about how that station is turned into a Nazi outlet.

[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.080]
They ought to put a big swastika under building.

[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.080]
Wherever their building is now.

[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.500]
Where are they?

[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.620]
Don't know.

[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:28.920]
We know.

[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:29.960]
I don't.

[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:31.900]
You don't?

[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.140]
No.

[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.160]
Over Yundray, Matt.

[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.280]
Fakler, a king says the need of marks used to be on her make believe radio station in Miami.

[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.360]
She's now at ESPN Radio in Baltimore.

[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.540]
She's a horse face, but looks within the nude.

[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.460]
She's a real blonde.

[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.660]
She's lovers with Melkhyper Jr., who also is long in the push.

[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.300]
It is true that Joe dumbbell has a shine.

[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.500]
Oh, is it true?

[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.700]
Because it's got a question mark elected and erected in his office.

[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.760]
Yeah, he's got an erection in his office about a need of mark.

[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.920]
I don't know and I don't care.

[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:03.480]
Here's something.

[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:08.660]
US court rules Vatican can be sued for a sex abuse cover up.

[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.280]
Somebody emailed this story to me.

[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.800]
It's got a picture of Papa and it says underneath the photo before it gets to the story.

[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.820]
I wear the same shoes as Cristiano Ronaldo.

[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.020]
What does that mean?

[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:22.880]
I have no idea.

[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.300]
Well, we get to the end.

[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:24.960]
We'll find out.

[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:35.840]
Three men who claimed they were abused by Catholic clergy in America have succeeded in naming the Vatican as sole defendant in a lawsuit hoping to force Pope Benedict the 89th to give evidence in the case.

[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:50.120]
The 60 West Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled that although the whole East Sea is a sovereign state was immune from most lawsuits, the plaintiffs could proceed with their argument that its officials were involved in a deliberate effort to cover up evidence of sexual abuse by American priests.

[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.280]
No kidding.

[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.760]
No Schmidt Sherlock.

[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:59.160]
Their case centers on the 1962 director from the Vatican telling church officials to hide sex abuse complaints against clergy.

[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.100]
William F. McMurray.

[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.260]
Oh, I wonder if he's can do Fred McMurray.

[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:03.620]
What does that mean?

[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.440]
Fred McMurray.

[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:18.680]
William F. McMurray, a lawyer representing the man who claimed they were abused in Louisville, says the document which became public in 2003 makes the Vatican liable for acts of clergy whose crimes were kept secret because of the directive.

[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.300]
He says the propit 81 is the only living witness to the establishment of the 1962 policy.

[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:32.500]
Before his election of the papacy, Joseph Ratzinger spent 24 years as heading the Vatican Department charge with investigating and disciplining abusive priests.

[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:36.740]
A role that would have led him to brief his predecessor, John Paul II, on the situation.

[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.360]
Wonder if they'll ever go to trial.

[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.780]
It says, and then it says don't know about the Cristiano Ronaldo reference came from question mark.

[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.680]
Now is he asking me or is he telling me he don't know?

[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:47.780]
Don't know.

[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.020]
Don't know your question marks.

[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.240]
Happy holidays, Georgia's friend John V.

[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.500]
Do you know who that is?

[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:53.900]
Yeah.

[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.980]
Well if he's your friend maybe he'll tell you about the Cristiano Ronaldo.

[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.320]
Hi, where's the same shoes?

[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.760]
Okay, at least the other we don't wear those little prissy red shoes like the previous little Pope slippers.

[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.440]
Oh my god.

[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.180]
Papa.

[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:09.560]
Papa.

[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.200]
Remember Fredo?

[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:11.640]
Papa.

[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.180]
Yeah.

[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.220]
Fredo wasn't too good with the gun.

[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.380]
It wasn't too good with anything.

[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.180]
No.

[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.360]
He was good with the ladies.

[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.140]
He was good with the ladies.

[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.320]
He was banging cocktail which was a two to time.

[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.100]
Players could get a drink of this.

[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:23.400]
Oh, not this.

[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.580]
Hey, it's great to know.

[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.800]
Oh god.

[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.920]
I blocked this guy and he's back again.

[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.900]
The range ranges.

[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:29.420]
Ranges.

[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.580]
Go back to New York, you loser.

[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.560]
You chronic loser.

[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.360]
Really and truly there are some really, really, really.

[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.280]
How about going back to Miami by Wayne Cochrane?

[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.560]
Somebody says you want to put it on there?

[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.100]
It's not true.

[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:42.500]
It's free.

[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:43.780]
What?

[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:44.780]
It's free.

[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.740]
Oh, the fake Joey Reynolds Gary Bruce's three-piece suit.

[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.380]
Oh my god.

[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.720]
What is this?

[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.860]
Published on December 22nd, 1994.

[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.180]
And the fake Joey Reynolds sends me the story about boy Gary.

[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.920]
Bruce was replaced with W.I.D. by Steve Nickelham Rogers.

[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.320]
His nickname Steve Nickelbag.

[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.080]
Wow.

[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.900]
Why would anybody care about this?

[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.300]
Well, you talk about living in the past.

[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.580]
This again is somebody over there at the old I.O.D.

[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.300]
Please put Don't Go Back to Rockville by one of my favorite groups,

Don't go back to Rockville.

[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:30.580]
You know that?

[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.560]
Yeah.

[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.680]
Never heard of it.

[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.460]

That's about a city?

[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.140]
No.

[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.680]
It's about California.

[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:44.640]
Ain't that a city?

[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.480]
Oh, and Brandon sends me a long, long.

[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.240]
What's not that long?

[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.680]
It's good.

[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.520]
Keep them coming today.

[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.940]
Keep those emails coming because the more emails we get,

[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.980]
the fewer calls will be forced to take.

[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.600]
And believe you me after some of the demented tortured souls

[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.560]
that called in yesterday, especially a fan.

[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.060]
What a crazy person.

[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.160]
Get yourself some help.

[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.240]
Wow.

[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.440]
Or maybe move to the Philippines with that hot young chick

[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.080]
that you pretend that you're doing,

[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.040]
which nobody believed in and nobody believes now.

[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:22.980]
Very sad.

[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.640]
1156, 4 minutes to 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.720]

[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.080]
going to replace him with some chick,

[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.160]

[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.180]

[00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.760]
You believe it?

[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.460]
You think she's coming?

[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:47.320]
No.

[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.240]
Christmas is coming though.

[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.140]
Soon.

[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.180]
And so is Tannuka.

[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.320]

[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.780]
The bag will automatically drop down from the overhead panel.

[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:09.820]
And we always arrive on time because we never fly a little behind.

[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.840]
It feels a bird airline.

[00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.900]
We love to reach an inch.

[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.220]
It'll the bird airlines. No restrictions apply.

[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.160]
11-1 at 5.60 W.A.M.

[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.560]
Here's one from the fake field Henry.

[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.080]
It says subject fake emails.

[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.140]
The fake emails are coming from Kenny Grammer and Manny.

[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.460]
They're both obsessed with your show.

[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.240]
Huh? You buying it?

[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.340]
I'm not ruling it out.

[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.460]
This is from Phil Henry at Bill Henry at gmail.com.

[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.660]
The fake Phil Henry and the real Kenny Grammer and the real Manny Munoz

[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.900]
is a real retardo.

[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.100]
Oh my God.

[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.760]
Nice job on that footy show by the way Manny.

[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.500]
Almost as good as the job you did in the Randy show.

[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.220]
Wow, what?

[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.300]
Never mind. I'm not going to play that thing now.

[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.340]
It says, I don't know if you heard about this crap.

[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.240]
It says, Jorge, I guess the power is to be.

[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.380]
The power is to be.

[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.020]
And decided you can be charged different amounts of money at different times

[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.000]
of the day based on traffic.

[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.240]
That's like having to pay more for hockey games at the Macarena against certain teams

[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.220]
than other teams.

[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.060]
I mean, what a ripoff.

[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:13.940]
What a joke.

[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.880]
So when traffic is heavy, they can bill you about 100 bucks and when there's no traffic,

[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.820]
it's 25 cents.

[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:19.480]
Real nice.

[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.400]
Love your show.

[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:20.960]
Have a great holiday.

[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.160]
I hope you don't run into that Bohemian bitch it would mine.

[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.360]
I've never met a Jamaican that I like.

[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.280]
Same goes for those chinks at the nail salon.

[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.840]
He says, boy, talk about a big.

[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.080]
Wow.

[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.100]
Chinks talking about the Chinese man that way, huh?

[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.720]
I like some of the Chinese man.

[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.720]
No speaking English, you know, like that.

[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.420]
Patricia sends me a thing here.

[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.680]
Top quality generic Cialis soft hands for less money.

[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.420]
I don't want them.

[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.140]
Go away, Patricia.

[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.820]
And all of you are other lynched your mob.

[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.540]
I've never met a let's see.

[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.400]
PS tell my buddy, I've an United Auto get a life.

[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.340]
Now worry about what I'm doing.

[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.300]
One for your poll.

[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.820]
This might be too racy for your old ass, but pit bull welcome to Miami.

[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.060]
Why is that too racy for my old ass?

[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:02.700]
I out of.

[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.360]
Well, this is where he endorsed and build Georgia.

[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.240]
Oh, I wonder.

[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.660]
I don't believe you're in Boston, build Georgia.

[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.540]
Because first of all, why would you be considered about the I 95 tooling?

[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.680]
Number one, and number two, why would you be such a bigoted bastard about Jamaican's

[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:17.920]
mind?

[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.280]
All the way to agree with that.

[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.740]
I'm sure there are a lot of, you know, there might be a few nice to make and I've never

[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:23.140]
met any.

[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.220]
I have.

[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.140]
Have you?

[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:25.620]
Yep.

[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:26.460]
Oh, man.

[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:27.540]
It's a good machine.

[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:28.840]
It's a good machine.

[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.680]
Man, I know lots of nice to make it.

[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.300]
Guys, but women condescending snobby nasty.

[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.060]
Think of it.

[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.700]
But that knock about shiny man.

[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.380]
What that was that all about?

[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.800]
All of the old ones voice some of them smell like death.

[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.400]
Oh, and a Roma that will definitely put you into a coma.

[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.580]
You can't believe it.

[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:52.300]
You can't you can't believe that such an aroma exists on the planet in the universe.

[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.580]
Smelly old Chinese man.

[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.160]
But the young Chinese man, that's a different story.

[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.780]
If they were born in the in this hemisphere, they're, you know, they don't have that in

[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:03.200]
their blood.

[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.800]
But they eat, I think they eat like a lot of body parts, you know, tiger claws and

[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.260]
kitty paws and doggy jaw stuff like that.

[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:12.500]
Right.

[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.260]
Brandon says now I don't listen to either love 94.

[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.620]
W.I. would do, but I do see some purpose in moving W.I.

[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:18.260]
Do over to FM.

[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:24.460]
If they keep the current talk for medical for sure, tank, but keep channels had some success

[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:29.260]
turning FM state music stations over to talk, but generic talk, not news, not sports,

[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.420]
not just plain talk, or just plain talk.

[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:38.460]
The example is WZCR 94.3 out of Palm Beach and it goes on and on and on.

[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.940]
Brandon, it's just amazing.

[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.280]
Believe it or not, when I've listened to love doctors, which is on when you are, I've heard

[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.080]
many times people calling in saying they love you, but loves EZR better, which they

[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.780]
could simultaneously get a clear signal.

[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.160]
And the station that came up was W.I.N.Z.

[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.860]
But they just called it wish.

[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.800]
I don't understand what is W.I.N.Z have to do with W.I.O.D.

[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.100]
I don't get it.

[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.100]
Do you understand this?

[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:03.320]
Nope.

[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.380]
Maybe they could see at some point W.I.O.D. turning into something that's EZR currently

[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:07.700]
is today.

[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:08.460]
No chance.

[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.060]
No chance.

[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:10.800]
Are you crazy?

[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.000]
Come on, Brandon.

[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:12.540]
Get with it.

[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.720]
They're going to spend money to put stuff on here.

[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.640]
They're just going to put schlock on here.

[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:18.460]
Schlock.

[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.280]
Plus their signal is going to go down to how many watts?

[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:21.580]
30 watts.

[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:23.400]
Once they have to move off the island there.

[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:30.200]
Those of us out here on the islands, we have a certain way of living here on the islands.

[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.400]
Do you ever hear that story when I moved to that?

[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.860]
I don't even remember where the hell it was.

[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.060]
Star Island.

[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:36.960]
No, not Star Island.

[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.120]
There was some other stupid island.

[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.820]
A bunch of pseudo-inlectual slabs.

[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:40.260]
Palm?

[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:40.740]
Maybe.

[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.280]
No, not Palm Island.

[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:42.840]
I don't know.

[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.380]
Palm Island?

[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:45.920]
Larry's system.

[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:46.840]
I'm not into pool building.

[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.100]
And this probably won't get any votes.

[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.420]
But I like the streets of Miami by Alan Sherman.

[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:56.940]
It's old in ancient but got about right when Miami was all about pinnacle and canastid

[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:57.940]
playing Althe Cockers.

[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.760]
Remember those days where all the assisted living facilities were all in fact I had one

[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.060]
as a sponsor on KAT.

[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:04.960]
That what happened?

[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.000]
All the people died.

[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:07.820]
I don't know.

[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:11.900]
But here's the winner of the pool by the way.

[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:16.020]
I can't believe that I can't believe a guy like Charlie B left the winner off his own

[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:16.300]
pool.

[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.420]
My God.

[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.460]
Fill it off your freedom.

[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.280]
Get it on there right away.

[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:26.320]
You do it only is at the winner of this pool but that may be the best song of all time.

[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.360]
You don't like that filled it off your freedom?

[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:29.980]
I like it a lot.

[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:30.900]
Elton John.

[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.860]
Ever see Elton John and Barney Fag together?

[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:33.640]
Same person.

[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.560]
They both worked like they were sucking on a persimmon.

[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.240]
Great song.

[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:40.680]
Not good.

[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:41.120]
Great.

[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:41.740]
Yep.

[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:42.480]
I like it a lot.

[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.940]
Well thank God for that.

[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.600]
Do you like it better than poker face?

[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:49.580]
Don't make it too.

[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.160]
I don't have to choose.

[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:54.520]
Oh there's a coming around black boy over to look at boy and then.

[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:55.900]
Okay that's enough.

[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.720]
95 votes on the pool in New York.

[00:52:58.780 --> 00:52:59.020]
New York.

[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.280]
These little town blues.

[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.160]
I'm singing off key.

[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.620]
Bebo Las Vegas 10 19 to 10.

[00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.180]
New York State of mind.

[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:07.840]
Don't.

[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.080]
Only six.

[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:09.760]
Don't give me that.

[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.960]
Alan Tom is one of the worst songs that was ever recorded.

[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.060]
Blows.

[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.160]
Alan Tom.

[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.340]
Jesus God.

[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.360]
Not only that but look who that wants to go to Alan Tom.

[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:21.020]
That may.

[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.700]
Big Joe and Boyton beat says happy version of Guadalupe Day.

[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.640]
Have a great show today.

[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.980]
We're talking about the Monday night football crew the other day.

[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.020]
I'm sorry for the late response that Cornheuser Jack passes ridiculous.

[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:34.660]
I've never seen more done with eight hairs.

[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.280]
He's got the worst comb over.

[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.600]
And on TV he's as interesting as an insurance seminar.

[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:41.920]
PS George still sucks.

[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:42.980]
How do you like that George?

[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:43.920]
Oh yeah.

[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.460]
Nice sentiment for the holidays.

[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.740]
You know you people are relentless.

[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.700]
It doesn't make any difference.

[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.040]
What the calendar says.

[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.760]
It's just the same hate.

[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:51.500]
Bah.

[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:52.320]
Bah.

[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:52.680]
Bah.

[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.740]
Over and over again.

[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.280]
No matter what.

[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.260]
Did you watch the game last night?

[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.020]
I didn't watch one second of the game last night.

[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.520]
The Eagles and who the hell did they play?

[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.040]
Oh, the Brown Browns.

[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.020]
How many of the Browns lose last night?

[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.340]
Oh, here they're coming to get you.

[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.740]
There was like 30 to six or 33 or something bad like that.

[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.300]
I'm sure the Browns had the three of the six.

[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.240]
Yeah, but one part I actually heard that's one of my boys got injured pinky.

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.380]
Cornheuser actually made a good point.

[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.140]
Rare.

[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.160]
Yeah, they're talking about.

[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.440]
Donovan McNabbin like will he be there next year or whatever?

[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.800]
And they're like, yeah, people are saying, you know that.

[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.600]
I heard you need a Marxist replacing him.

[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.340]
That would be good.

[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.700]
But and I guess draw is like, yeah, but who are these people?

[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.220]
Who these people?

[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.620]
You know, and so cornheuser actually was like, look, he's like, I understand this part of it.

[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.140]
You go to you talk to a coach.

[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:43.800]
The coach can't tell you I'm telling you this.

[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.000]
He's like, what they tell you this?

[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:45.840]
So then you talk to other people.

[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.960]
He's like this whole thing about, you know, he actually like make this really a good point about how reporters.

[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:54.720]
Get these, you know, rumors that they can't come out and say the names, but it's true things.

[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.980]
So I was like, wow, did cornheuser just contribute something?

[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:58.600]
And then he said something stupid after that.

[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.440]
So I was like, oh, well.

[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.980]
I was at is that it?

[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.980]
Yeah, he just had one good thing about the second word.

[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.660]
Oh, he had one good thing to say.

[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:10.940]
And they have nothing to say.

[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.580]
He's a total idiot.

[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.760]
He doesn't have anything to tell the cast and he they just never learned.

[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.140]
They just have never learned.

[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:25.820]
They keep trying to revive the old days Howard Coastell and Frank Gifford, who was like the Jimmy Cifalus of his time and Dandy Don.

[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.220]
They keep trying to rekindle the old glory of Monday Night Football.

[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.040]
They'll never do it.

[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:32.840]
There was only one Howard Coastell, okay?

[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.720]
And it sure ain't Tony Cornhole.

[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.260]
He's got nothing to the table except like the guy said those eight hairs that he comes over.

[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.640]
Even Bob Coldon have that much of a comb over and that's saying a lot.

[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.740]
Donald says, good morning Uncle Neil, just a quick email to say thanks.

[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.860]
My wife and I are real living and breathing people who work hard and love the show.

[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:58.820]
Real living and breathing people as opposed to crazy people out of control, crazy people.

[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:04.500]
You make us laugh and think we're grown up so don't believe in fairy tales like Santa, God or Bigfoot.

[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:09.140]
And we're still trying to figure out how two people who love each other don't have the right to the same rights as anybody else.

[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:12.980]
No matter what sex they are, I can go on, but I don't want to be a nutnik.

[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:14.560]
Keep doing it Neil on the show too.

[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:15.460]
Thanks, Dino and Julia.

[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.460]
Well, thanks, Dino and Julia and happy holidays.

[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.780]
Neil, tell Chris that Clear Channel has job listings on their website.

[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.620]
They're hiring both AM and FM board office.

[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:27.360]
Any interest?

[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:28.520]
Hey, I'll look.

[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.020]
Hey, you don't want to leave us.

[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.560]
You don't want to leave us because once when clearance gets run over by a tractor.

[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.160]
And they bring in a real PD.

[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.680]
Maybe they'll recognize your talents.

[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.240]
And they'll put you on full time on this show.

[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.100]
They'll put you back on full time, give you all your benefits.

[00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.840]
They'll let the food come back in again free.

[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:49.700]
You know, it's it.

[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.960]
It's just that that's why that that fake Anita marks.

[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.480]
Email was so amusing.

[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:57.700]
It was hysterical.

[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.880]
About the respect that they have for the town, whatever the hell that said.

[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.660]
I mean, just just a joke.

[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.140]
Just an absolute joke.

[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.900]
Oh, no free food in there because Joe Rose overdid it in the morning.

[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:11.480]
Him and Zach.

[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.860]
And so everybody else could have to be like like a kindergarten, like a playground,

[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:19.320]
like an overgrown fat tubby guy and a sandbox with a pale in a shovel.

[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.780]
Anything to make your life miserable.

[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.160]
Anything to make you desire to be there that much less.

[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:30.040]
You know what I mean?

[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:30.440]
Yep.

[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.780]
When's lunch coming in?

[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:32.600]
Oh, I wish.

[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.920]
Now, but you do remember those days?

[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:39.520]
Oh, yeah, before this grave rubber decided, oh, here's oh, no.

[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:41.100]
Oh.

[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:45.820]
Yeah.

[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.520]
Remember Adam from Kitchener Waterloo, who called you.

[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.380]
I'm back in Toronto turns out my grandfather died over the weekend.

[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.020]
He was 85.

[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.600]
So he's plenty old enough still kind of sucks.

[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.720]
I just wanted to say if you wanted to get your hand on some butter fingers,

[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.320]
you should talk to the Chinese woman corner store owner tell her to get some.

[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.300]
I had a great time at the dolphins game can't wait to get back down there.

[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.740]
Oh, I'm sorry about grandpa, but you know something Adam.

[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:10.280]
I just.

[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:13.580]
I just don't know what to say anymore.

[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.960]
I don't know what to say.

[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:16.800]
Do you know what to say?

[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:19.080]
No, I don't know.

[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.860]
Give a time check and take a break.

[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:21.620]
You could say that.

[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.660]
I'm not talking about on the studio.

[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:28.620]

You know, it takes all kinds of people to make a miracle what it is today.

[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.760]
It takes doctors.

[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.180]
Hello and lawyers.

But it also takes much more than that.

[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:32.220]
It also takes America's more on.

[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.540]

[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.800]

You know why we're all around you.

[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.180]
We're taking 200 items through the express lane of the supermarket.

[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.360]
Wait, let me get my other side over here.

[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.360]

[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.660]
Hey pal, could you hurry it up?

[00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.140]
Fine, how are you?

[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:01.240]
We're the association of ignorant Americans.

[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.140]
And we're always looking for new members.

[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.720]
So if you hate any minority, don't read much and just love to litter.

[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.700]
Then have a friend dial the phone for you and give us a call.

[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:15.060]

Hi, I'm a moron.

[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.760]
It's two o'clock in the morning.

[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.880]
Oh, was you sleeping?

[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.600]
Oh, the Americans morons.

[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.500]
We're taking years off your life.

[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.260]

[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:39.520]

[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.540]

Now here's one.

[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.180]
Here's an email for the ages.

[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.920]
You want to know why?

[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:47.540]
Why?

[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.260]
Because it's a miracle radio accident.

[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:54.980]
That's the only way we get any new listeners on this show or on a station is by accident.

[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.220]
They don't even have a guy running around with a sandwich board up in that loss.

[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.140]
Oh, let's or Lincoln wrote more nothing zero.

[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.860]
Well, hey, listen, don't look at your thorns in the ass.

[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:25.660]
Let me tell you right now.

[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.360]
Yes, I'm really an old bag and yes, religions of a bunch or what does that mean?

[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:29.980]
Hate religion.

[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.320]
It's a bunch of fairy tales.

[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.320]
You fairy and of course the holidays.

[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.000]
I don't hate them.

[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.340]
I just want them to be over fast.

[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.620]
Yeah, it's from under the moon.

[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:42.720]
I see.

[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.260]
I thought you meant from under you.

[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:44.660]
Correct them.

[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.920]
Cory says could you add now here's a good one.

[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.120]
Walk into New Orleans by Fatson.

[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:50.960]
I'm a great fool.

[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.280]
You George and Chris stay rock solid.

[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.140]
No rock solid and thank you for providing us with inside humor.

[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.240]
Great great radio.

[01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:59.740]
You all just talk about.

[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:03.860]
Oh, I would ease go to FM and this one's going to do this and they're changing

[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.680]
line up across the street.

[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:07.020]
Walk into.

[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.100]
The fat man and Juan Fatson.

[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:11.940]
He's still alive.

[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.100]
Remember he kind of like disappeared when we had the hurricane.

[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:16.740]
Right.

[01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.040]
Low and norleans.

[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.260]
He said, Oh, he's okay.

[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.020]
He's still alive.

[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.360]
One thing about him.

[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.200]
I wondered because he was a great pianist.

[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.500]
But I wondered how he played the thing on the piano.

[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.640]
He had those fat fingers.

[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.620]
You know, he was a fat pianist.

[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.520]
He was a fat guy with fat fingers.

[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.180]
But nevertheless, he survived.

[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.880]
So anyway, my point being on that email that we.

[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.220]
New listener found us by accident, which is the only way.

[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.900]
Let's have a lot of people get a lot of accidents.

[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:44.300]
Okay.

[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.160]
We got the trend coming on Friday.

[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.400]
Any interest?

[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:47.720]
No.

[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:52.820]
Oh, yeah, but I would ease going to here and love 94 is going by by and this one's

[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.700]
doing in Jimmy Cifalitic is a lunatic.

[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.680]
Talk about a sell out.

[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.380]
I mean, this guy was like Casper Milk Toast.

[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:01.760]
You know what I mean?

[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.200]
He was like neither fish nor foul.

[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:07.400]
And boy, once they got a hold of him over there at I would eat.

[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.560]
They sure made him foul.

[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.220]
I'll tell you that.

[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.080]
Not as foul as his football broadcast, but then again, what could be.

[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.120]
And all of a sudden, he just turned into this raving, right wing lunatic.

[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.640]
That's what you got to be if you want to work on IOD.

[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.000]
It's the Nazi station, the Nazi channel.

[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:27.680]
This grace.

[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.620]
Let's get these phones cranking.

[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.080]
What do you say?

[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:35.080]
We're off to a pretty interesting start about 30 years ago.

[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:36.760]
Yeah.

[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.880]
30 plus years I've survived almost 33 March.

[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.640]
Why it'll be 33 years in this market.

[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.320]
And I've got these clowns out there.

[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.760]
Oh, when you got to do this and you got to take more calls, you got to do that.

[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.960]
All these experts on the show on my life on Georgia's life.

[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.800]
On fat Chris's life.

[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.140]
And these are people who have no life.

[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:00.660]
Absolutely.

[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:01.500]
Correct.

[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.540]
I have no life.

[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.060]
How can you be an expert on somebody else's life when you don't have a near on?

[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.340]
That's right.

[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:11.080]
It's like teaching somebody to drive a car when you've never, never sat behind the wheel

[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.540]
in your right or even seen a car.

[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:13.700]
That's right.

[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.820]
Never seen it.

[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.280]
I seen it.

[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.960]
So when's Jesse McCartney coming back with lady Gaga?

[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.700]
I go Gaga over that.

[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.320]
I'll do that.

[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.220]
And not until a few days ago I never heard of that punk Jesse McCartney.

[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.560]
I think Joe Belster to that with that.

[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.920]
That book, the Jonas Brothers book.

[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.200]
Oh, and I guess I guess he thought I don't know.

[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.400]
Should I give my couple of brownie points for that?

[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:44.820]
Okay.

[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:45.900]
Can't do it.

[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:46.480]
Why not?

[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.280]
Because it doesn't compensate for all the other evil stuff, you know?

[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:50.800]
Okay.

[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.680]
So in other words, you think I should.

[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.780]
I should like like change my feelings about this creature.

[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.180]
Not necessarily.

[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.120]
I mean, you did give me that 3% pay raise.

[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:01.720]
I'll say that.

[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.360]
Yeah.

[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.040]
And like somebody pointed out yesterday to fake somebody.

[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.860]
If you give back that 3% then we can keep Chris on the show.

[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:09.320]
Sure.

[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:11.440]
WQYM.

[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:11.660]
Hello.

[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.400]
Yeah, good morning guys.

[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.220]
I don't know if they can pull position, but I think sweet home Alabama kind of much.

[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.620]
The theme of what you're doing today.

[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.140]
Alabama is a city.

[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:23.460]
Oh, okay.

[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:24.440]
Well, I guess I'm a more.

[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.180]
Yes.

[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.020]
Okay.

[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.300]
At least he was nice about it.

[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:29.520]
Yeah.

[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.020]
That was great.

[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.060]
That was good.

[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:32.780]
He's a more.

[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.620]
He did that.

[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.260]
He's heard that bit we played before.

[01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.760]
Oh, you got a lot of company out there pal.

[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.500]
Don't feel bad.

[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.340]
Sweet home Alabama.

[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.720]
Not a city.

[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.620]
How about Baloxie blues?

[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:47.380]
Okay.

[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.320]
Is that a song or is it a movie?

[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.120]
I don't know.

[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.480]
Is there a song?

[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:53.640]
I don't know.

[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.260]
I don't know.

[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.020]
I don't know.

[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.240]
I don't know.

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.240]

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.240]

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.240]

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.240]

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.240]

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.240]

[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.780]
I don't know.

[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:00.780]

[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:00.840]
I don't know.

[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:00.840]

[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:00.840]

[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:01.000]
I don't know.

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.000]

[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.140]
I don't know.

[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:01.980]
I don't know.

[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.180]
I don't know.

[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:02.520]
I don't know.

[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.000]
I don't know.

[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.500]
I don't know.

[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:04.820]
I don't know.

[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.620]
I don't know.

[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:07.820]
I don't know.

[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.060]
I don't know.

[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.840]
I don't know.

[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:14.660]
I don't know.

[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.100]
I don't know.

[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:24.240]
I don't know.

[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:25.740]
You know what I mean?

[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:26.340]
What do you mean?

[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.480]
148 votes on the poll.

[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.060]
What's the best song ever about an American city?

[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.160]
New York.

[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:33.820]
New York.

[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.900]
The Little Tom blues.

[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:35.480]
32.

[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:37.720]
Viva Las Vegas.

[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.380]
I'm thinking about what's his name?

[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.820]
Bob Lincoln singing on the plane.

[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.240]
After we had all those difficulties again,

[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.400]
that plane boarded.

[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.320]
Oh, that ill-fated trip to Vegas.

[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.380]
It was the first one.

[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.160]
And then I was stupid enough to do it the second time.

[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.680]
That shows how dumb I am.

[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.220]
Remember that?

[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:54.820]
Yep.

[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.680]
He rented a 747.

[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.320]
And we flew 85,000 of our...

[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.680]
Of course, I guarantee you there were more people on the plane

[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.600]
than we got listening now.

[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.860]
Is there any doubt about that?

[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:09.540]
Nope.

[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.240]
It's called attrition.

[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.180]
See, I hate to break the news to these people because obviously they're the experts.

[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:15.680]
The brilliant broadcasters.

[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.500]
They know they're crap.

[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.660]
Just by attrition, people die off.

[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.340]
People move away.

[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.640]
People get tired of whatever the hell we're peddling here on this station.

[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.840]
And you have to replace them with new people living and breathing people,

[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.820]
especially since nobody listens to AM radio anymore in the first place.

[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:31.900]
Nobody.

[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:37.280]
So they're not going to find you doodling around and they're not going to find you.

[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.960]
You have to go out and tap them on the shoulder and say,

[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.820]
hey, guess what we need you to tune in.

[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.640]
Maybe you might like it.

[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:44.720]
Maybe not, but maybe you might.

[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.260]
You never know.

[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.200]
Unless you try it, you never know if you're going to like it.

[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.020]
That's what I always say.

[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.160]
And they run like a son of a bitch.

[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:50.920]
Mm-hmm.

[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.060]
So I told Joey Jonas I said, how about a Christmas bonus?

[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.000]
Or at least part of that.

[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.420]
Ram like a mother.

[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.540]
Man, those kids man can fly like hell.

[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.260]
What's the biggest name?

[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:06.380]
The best talent.

[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.640]
This is your model.

[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.600]
This is the sport radio.

[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.060]
It's 5.60 QAM.

[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.840]
The fourth leader.

[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.000]
The biggest name.

[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.120]
The best talent.

[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:14.520]
Yes.

[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.300]
It's the big dog, Joe Rose.

[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.180]
We're dimming seven at a time.

[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:21.060]
Where South Florida sports always matters.

[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.180]
Sport radio, 5.60 QAM.

[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.800]
The sports leader.

[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.020]
Greg H.H.U.

[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:35.840]
It takes a special breed of man to get these poets across the roughest part of the Colorado River.

[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.900]
Or to get that tongue alongside a 5,000 ton supertanker.

[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.320]
And when it's all said and done, you know you were the man in charge.

[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.340]
A bringing her home.

[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.540]
Yeah, that's me.

[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.300]
You.

[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.000]
Yeah.

[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:52.700]
Come on.

[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.820]
Get serious.

[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.120]
That's not you.

[01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:58.040]
You're like most peer drinkers.

[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.060]
All you want is eight hours of football.

[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.480]
A tub full of freedom.

[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:04.920]
And a couch.

[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.620]
Big enough to handle you and your tooth.

[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.420]
No big as a mountain.

[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.000]
On a twosh beat.

[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:14.520]
Welcome.

[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.100]
Big as a mountain.

[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.240]
Beer belly.

[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.520]
Big bottom.

[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.180]
No problem here.

[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.280]
Just have another king.

[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.220]
Extra heavy.

[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:25.940]
Tushbears.

[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:26.780]
Tushbears.

[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.440]
We're brewing the beer for the biggest party you.

[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.540]
Tush.

[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.900]
Big as a mountain.

[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:36.540]
On a twosh beat.

[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.540]
Fat thighs of Tushburys.

[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.480]
Say you're late Missouri.

[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:40.880]
Love a 32.

[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.960]
I'm probably should sign an extension.

[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.620]
I had five year deal for another 20.

[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:45.280]
Sure.

[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:45.860]
There you go.

[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.940]
No, seriously, because these people in the business,

[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:49.340]
I'm not talking about the general audience.

[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.700]
I'm talking about the people in the business.

[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.360]
Or who think they're in the business.

[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.320]
They can't survive without this show.

[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.000]
No, that's true.

[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.160]
I mean, they're glued.

[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.580]
I mean, and of course the emails have given them an opportunity

[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.180]
to really, really become a part to like,

[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.880]
cling on, man, big time.

[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:06.900]
Cling on.

[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.160]
Cling on to my big fat, pimply ugly ass.

[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:10.800]
Wow.

[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.380]
The door is an LA woman for the pool.

[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:13.940]
Okay.

[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.680]
This is one of those pools, Charlie B,

[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.340]
that you know, there's only about 80,000 different songs

[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:19.120]
that could be on here.

[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.780]
What about that song about Candidate with New York?

[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:22.520]
That's my favorite.

[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:23.460]
Yeah, how's that go?

[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.640]
Jim Morrison's time, the soda, the city of angels,

[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.040]
which he truly loved.

[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.420]
A few years ago, City Father's-Hast residents

[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.840]
to vote on an official song,

[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.640]
LA Woman One by a Mile,

[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.900]
crushing even Randy Newman's I Love LA.

[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.780]
Oh, Randy Newman, good God.

[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.440]
In the end, the City Council decided Morrison was too controversial

[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.880]
and the song was unflattering,

[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.060]
and then decided not to choose any song at all.

[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:44.860]
How do you like that?

[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:45.780]
What about your whims?

[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.340]
The song was too controversial.

[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:49.780]
Morrison was too controversial.

[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:50.080]
Yeah.

[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.260]
The lyrics always give me goosebumps, says,

[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.280]
whoever sent this.

[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.160]
Oh, the chronic and cocoa, Russell.

[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.920]
Perfectly describing this sprawling city.

[01:10:59.060 --> 01:10:59.960]
I remember from my time there,

[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.380]
a bright and light yet dark place,

[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.260]
where an individual can be truly isolated

[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.440]
alone among millions of people.

[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:05.800]
It's dangerous.

[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.100]
The fear is in the ear.

[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.700]
You can park your car like in a strip shopping mall,

[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.920]
and by the time you walk to whatever the stories are going to,

[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.400]
you feel like you're going to get mugged, raped,

[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.100]
and probably will be.

[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.160]
I see your hair is burning.

[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:20.540]
Hills are filled with fire.

[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:23.180]
If they say I never loved you, I know they are a liar.

[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.620]
Driving down your feeways Midnight Alley's Rome,

[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.260]
cops and cars, the topless bars,

[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.940]
never seen a woman so alone, so alone.

[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:31.460]
Wow.

[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:32.980]
Happy Channouca, et cetera,

[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:33.880]
this is the chronic and cocoa.

[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:34.860]
And back at you.

[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.040]
Now, this one I don't understand.

[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.540]
I mean, I do understand.

[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:41.340]
It says, how about the standels?

[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:41.840]
What was it?

[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.860]
I love that dirty water.

[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.180]
That was the name of the song, dirty water.

[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.220]
I mean, is that a song about a city?

[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:49.440]
Boston?

[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.440]
I mean, it does say Boston, you're my home,

[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.900]
but that's not, is that what it is?

[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.440]
Let's, let's review it.

[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.920]
I haven't heard it so long.

[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:58.440]
It's a good song.

[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:58.980]
I like it.

[01:11:59.020 --> 01:11:59.740]
I love you this fun.

[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.660]
I would say 1967 or 8.

[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.640]
I'm going to tell you, 60, 60, 60.

[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.240]
I was going to tell you about my town.

[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.020]
Where's my hill?

[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.880]
It's all about that town.

[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.240]
It's always be, man.

[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:14.060]
Yeah, I was all about my town.

[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:14.340]
See?

[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.360]
Tell about that town.

[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.040]
It's been down by the river.

[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.860]
I don't have bad wordes.

[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.940]
Down by the banks over river Chow.

[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.340]
Anyway, when I lived in the back band Boston early,

[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.500]
like 61-62,

[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.920]
they were digging up on Boyleston Street.

[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:31.640]
They were digging up to build a potential center.

[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.040]
And there were these, just incredible network of rats

[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.420]
that they found underneath the city.

[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:43.580]
And in the alleyway where I used to park my little corvary,

[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:44.920]
I've been told to this many times,

[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.660]
there were rats running around at night.

[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.200]
And we'd go out there and you'd bang on a garbage can.

[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.780]
They would, how like a wolf, like a coyote?

[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.800]
Big nasty rats.

[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:01.520]
Yeah, and...

[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.820]
No, it's just the idea that they're living under the city like that, you know?

[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.480]
Or, already, you want them to live.

[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:07.840]
Oh, excuse me.

[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.620]
They've always said that if rats were smarter,

[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.720]
they could take over the world.

[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:13.620]
They might just, anyway.

[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:17.420]
Yeah. Well, they've certainly taken over this radio station.

[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:17.940]
I'll tell you that.

[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:19.860]
Oh, my God.

[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:22.860]
So you got it on there?

[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:23.940]
Are you getting these all on there?

[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.980]
Are they, Ellie, woman, dirty water?

[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:25.860]
Does make any difference?

[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.220]
Because, you know, they're both on there.

[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:29.580]
Well, good for you.

[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.980]
Neil, I saw you at a remote with Rick and Suds

[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.320]
at the Cutler Ridge Mall a long time ago,

[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.400]
whatever happened to those boneheads, says Keith.

[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.080]
What does that mean?

[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:39.760]
Boneheads.

[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.720]
Suds sits around waiting for George to call to be a guest

[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.520]
on the show when I'm on vacation or whatever,

[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.920]
and Rick is an LA.

[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.380]
He's with the LA woman.

[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:48.820]
Right?

[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:53.120]
He's burning crosses on his front lawn.

[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:57.660]
Suds is living the life of Riley, not Rick Riley, just her.

[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:58.940]
He lives...

[01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.520]
Chester A. Riley.

[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:00.400]
He's living the dream.

[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.160]
His woman works and he doesn't.

[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.200]
And Junior.

[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.540]
What thought was the kid that played the Junior?

[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.460]
What's Junior?

[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.100]
I'm the life of Riley.

[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.340]
I never watched that show.

[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.300]
Well, of course it's before you were born in the 50s.

[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.580]
Jesus, God.

[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.880]
Here's one that says, and for that fat, simple Joe Bell,

[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.940]
tell him to get out of the closet and get a life.

[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:24.600]
Any life just get one, says.

[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:29.980]
What does that mean?

[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.240]
I don't know.

[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.620]
Here's one that says,

[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.360]
High Neal, High George, love you both.

[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.760]
Doesn't say anything about Fat Christo.

[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.980]
Could listen to either one of you without discrimination.

[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.460]
Different styles, great radio,

[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.920]
especially when you bash religion.

[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.080]
Oh, we don't want to do that.

[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:43.480]
Not during the holy time of the year

[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.460]
when all these bubble miceies are going around

[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:46.980]
and all these stupid religious songs.

[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.560]
Oh, holy night.

[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.480]
Yeah, right.

[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.740]
Savior my ass.

[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.440]
Savior your ass.

[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.500]
Yeah, you know, it's really interesting how the glam

[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.620]
make fun of the Muslims with the seven virgins and all that.

[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.380]
So what's the difference?

[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:58.500]
There isn't.

[01:14:58.740 --> 01:14:59.180]
What's the difference?

[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.320]
If you believe in a certain thing,

[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.220]
you're going to go to heaven and live forever and sit there.

[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.020]
Oh, praise God.

[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:03.560]
Praise God.

[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.680]
What's the difference between praise God and praise Allah?

[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.800]
It's the same stupid crap.

[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.560]
Superstitious garbage created by superstitious ignorant men.

[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.520]
That's why the women got to shorten the sticks, so to speak,

[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.200]
because men invented all this crap.

[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.080]
Not my favorite city, but I'm sure someone will think Cleveland

[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.320]
is in the heart of rock and roll is clear in Cleveland.

[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:23.560]
What does that mean?

[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:25.780]
Keep up the good work.

[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.240]
F. Joyce and Jolly Joe says,

[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.700]
what does that mean Cleveland is in the heart of rock and roll

[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.260]
is in Cleveland?

[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:30.880]
Is that a song?

[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.660]
What's the song?

[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.240]
Harder rock and roll.

[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.220]
They just and they mentioned Cleveland

[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.400]
among other cities in their.

[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.240]
Oh, well, that's what they're talking about.

[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.180]
No, that's like I've been everywhere.

[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.740]
You know, I like that song, by the way.

[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.760]
Who did the original one before Howard Dean recorded it?

[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.360]
I've been everywhere.

[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.580]
I know Johnny Cash did a version.

[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.080]
I don't know if I've ever heard of it.

[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.260]
No, not Johnny Cash.

[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.640]
Don't start with that Johnny Cash.

[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.020]
I don't know if that's the original.

[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.080]
And don't not Johnny.

[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.200]
I don't like Johnny Cash.

[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.020]
Well, to bet you he's dead.

[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.400]
I didn't like the wife either.

[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:02.100]
What was her name?

[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:02.820]
She's your own Carter.

[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.380]
How come her name was June Carter?

[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.180]
June Carter Cash.

[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.540]
I don't have that song.

[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.900]
You don't have what song?

[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:11.520]
I've been everywhere.

[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.720]
I will soon though.

[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.300]
Boy, I don't know.

[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.020]
Do you think he's slipping a little bit Chris?

[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.340]
No, he used to be your name a song.

[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.460]
No, any song in the world.

[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:23.860]
Let's say let's go over it again.

[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.640]
If it wasn't a hit, no, I don't want to.

[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.140]
When you relax, I know it.

[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:27.720]
I know it.

[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:28.980]
I'm just giving you a bunch of crap.

[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.640]
That's all I'm just busting your balls.

[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:31.200]
OK.

[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.060]
I've been everywhere.

[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.180]
There you go.

[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:34.960]
I've been everywhere.

[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.540]
That's Johnny.

[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.480]
I've been everywhere.

[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.500]
I've been everywhere.

[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.220]
I've been a Renault's cargo cargo,

[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:45.580]
Minnesota Buffalo Toronto and Sloot Toronto.

[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.580]
That ain't no Johnny trash right there.

[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.960]
Let me tell you how the guys sounds just like Johnny, don't they?

[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:51.600]
Yeah.

[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:53.620]
Here's one that says from your classic stuff already.

[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:54.700]
Sorry, Neil.

[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.320]
I didn't see you already had that up there.

[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.340]
Guess I should look before I cross the road.

[01:16:58.500 --> 01:16:59.720]
Anyway, go dolphins.

[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.520]
And please stop talking about football like you watch it or something.

[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:03.640]
Oh, yeah.

[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.460]
Don't watch it.

[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:07.660]
Well, you know, you don't watch sports.

[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:08.500]
Oh, right.

[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:08.940]
That's right.

[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.540]
Old fag like me don't watch no football.

[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.940]
I guarantee I watch more football in one week than this guy watches in six months.

[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.560]
By the way, the phone calls are hilarious.

[01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.800]
They might annoy you to know in, but they are hilarious spelled very badly.

[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.160]
I love listening to what the old fag has to say.

[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.400]
What is little Cuban sidekick has to say, but nothing is as refreshing as the callers.

[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.860]
Please tell the Canadians to go back home.

[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.700]
They're driving patterns are so much like the Haitians that drive me nuts.

[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.660]
Your classic stuff for Indians.

[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:33.880]
Yeah.

[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.040]
How about Kansas City?

[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.260]
And that's good.

[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.280]
Wilbur Harrison Kansas City.

[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:40.900]
It was a big hit.

[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.600]
Kansas City here.

[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:42.940]
I come.

[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.340]
Ever that?

[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:44.540]
Mm hmm.

[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.960]
And I'm not interested in Ruth King or your profitability channel.

[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.920]
Okay, bitch, go away and quit sending me the same monotonous crap over and over and over

[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:54.240]
again.

[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:55.560]
God.

[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:58.200]
Oh, man.

[01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.140]
Miami's back again.

[01:17:59.200 --> 01:17:59.520]
Chronic.

[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.580]
The one that loves the callers.

[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.380]
You sound pretty chipper today and I like it.

[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.580]
I'm wanting to know what day this week.

[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.280]
The friend is coming up.

[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.100]
Oh, the trend is coming out Friday.

[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.300]
Have a good feeling for you, George.

[01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.480]
You'll have a good number this time around.

[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:12.980]
Oh, we won't.

[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.840]
You can thank yourself and the callers for this happening.

[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.260]
Oh, yeah, there goes with the callers again.

[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:17.640]
Right.

[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.440]
That's interesting because last couple of months we hardly ever take any calls, but it's

[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.260]
always the callers.

[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.340]
Thank the callers.

[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.200]
I'm your friend.

[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:26.300]
I'm your friend.

[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.320]
I'm your friend.

[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.380]
That's what they want to hear.

[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.940]
By your mixing in the calls with your emails, your numbers will be big, really big.

[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:35.680]
Here's another guy who thinks I need his advice.

[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:36.900]
How to succeed in the business.

[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:43.180]
33 FN years have been in this market kicking ass until Joe Bell came along and this guy thinks

[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:43.940]
I need his advice.

[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.120]
How to get big numbers.

[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.480]
I'm looking forward to see how well your show has done.

[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.360]
By the way, I'm still waiting on some of those entertaining calls today.

[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.440]
Screw you, Matt.

[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:52.320]
Up yours.

[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:56.340]
Up your nose with an old rusty hose.

[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.080]
The biggest name is the best talent.

[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.200]
It's the mad dog.

[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.680]
Man, the captain owns 4 to 7 sports radio 560 QAM.

[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.520]
The sports leader.

[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:18.040]
Hi, Luis Miguel.

[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.300]
Play it, baby.

[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.600]
The incomparable David Boy.

[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.900]
The greatest names in pop music, stammering and stuttering.

[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.720]
They're way to the top of this one amazing record offer.

[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.200]
The ho.

[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.080]
Those Jackson.

[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:42.480]
Prince.

[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.720]
Three generations of praise.

[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.780]
You're right, those capco vets were pretty good.

[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.240]
I like them.

[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.180]
Remember when we used to do the poll building and we'd say give us one.

[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.260]
Yeah, we have a little bit of a problem.

[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.040]
Your boss, Florida, whatever this guy's name is.

[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:25.800]
Subdict.

[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.360]
Viva Las Vegas, Elvis Preston, which is already on there.

[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.580]
Then he's got LA woman, which is already on there.

[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:31.640]
Leaving Las Vegas.

[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.360]
He's got a list of 20.

[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.020]
All right.

[01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:36.380]
We know there's more than 20.

[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.360]
Post your comment to add songs to this list.

[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.140]
What does that mean?

[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:42.440]
Post your comment to add songs to this list.

[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:46.300]
Is this a crazy person or what?

[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:51.200]
You got to go back and read the poll question again.

[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.520]
Not name a bunch of songs about a city.

[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:54.080]
Now now.

[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.660]
Which is the best song ever written about an American city.

[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.880]
That's the name of the poll.

[01:20:58.700 --> 01:20:59.560]
That's the name of the game.

[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.000]
Oh, good.

[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:03.840]
God.

[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.580]
It's just taking a certain amount of getting used to.

[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:08.980]
You know what I mean?

[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:10.080]
Yeah.

[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.480]
So it's like being bombarded.

[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:14.580]
If you're not being bombarded.

[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.620]
And Matt and Miami, I'm going to block your ass.

[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:17.900]
So I came just here to your crap.

[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:18.980]
Everyday.

[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.380]
Complaints and what's the other one?

[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:21.900]
Critiques.

[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:23.140]
Critiques and complaints.

[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.520]
Critiques and complaints and complaints and critiques.

[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:32.340]
And how to do the show and when to take the calls and when to read the emails and when to wipe your ass and when to blow your nose and when to take a dump.

[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.680]
Oh my God.

[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:35.500]
How did I survive?

[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.940]
66 years of my life without Matt and Miami.

[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:38.920]
You just been lucky, I guess.

[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.100]
And without a fan.

[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:43.200]
WQA.M. Hello.

[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.040]
You're boring, man.

[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:46.860]
You're the worst.

[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:47.460]
You're the worst.

[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.640]
And I'm your friend, isn't he?

[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:49.140]
He's the worst.

[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:49.340]
Yes.

[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.520]
Because he's like an adult.

[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:56.000]
He's not some kind of like retar that ought to be in a, might he ought to be in a rubber room.

[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.800]
But he's pretending to be an adult.

[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.100]
He's as bad as Eddie.

[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:01.220]
This is Eddie.

[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:01.620]

[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.200]
And he's almost as bad as him.

[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:03.640]
Not quite.

[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:13.340]
But so George emailed me the song I've been everywhere was written by Jeff Mack in 1959 and made popular by the singer Lucky Star in 1962.

[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.180]
I told you it was no Johnny trash.

[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.300]
All you keep going.

[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.020]
It's listed Australian towns.

[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:26.780]
Later was adapted North American place names and by John horror HORE later known as John Grinnell with New Zealand place name 66.

[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.380]
The song was number one hit and come to music in 62 in the US for recording artists Hank Snow.

[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.000]
The song was also recorded by Lynn Anderson asleep at the wheel.

[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.480]
Johnny Cash chip doctorate Ted Egan.

[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.160]
I was the.

[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.460]
Houghton my pack along the dusty when I'm up a road.

[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.620]
Oh Johnny take a dirt nap Johnny.

[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.300]
The Ferrari Brothers TV series the anti-Jack show John Grinnell Mike Ford.

Clinton Clifton Jansky will and else than the statler brothers.

[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.580]
Well the statler brothers they had one good song with that wasn't something about flowers on the wall.

[01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.300]
Is that what it was called?

[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.340]
I'll find out.

[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.280]
Flowers on the wall by the statler brothers.

[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.640]
That was a good song Columbia records.

[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.240]
It was a big head more than a big fat booby hit.

[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.280]
What?

[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.240]
I thought they had more than one song.

[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:13.180]
The statler brothers flowers on the wall.

[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:15.140]
I don't have a lot of country music here with all apologies.

[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.600]
Oh come on good thank God.

[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:18.380]
Hey what about all?

[01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:18.540]

[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.340]
I'll go ahead.

[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:20.720]
What? No go ahead.

[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:21.720]
Go ahead.

[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.880]
I was gonna say amarillo brillo from Frank Zappa.

[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.040]
Yeah.

[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.520]
I don't know.

[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.220]
I don't care.

[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.520]
I've had a couple of those.

[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.120]
I mean that's the best song about a city's amarillo f and brillo.

[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:35.920]
Come on.

[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.540]
Come on.

[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.900]
All they want to do is put on it's just like the old pool building days.

[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.300]
They finally gave them something to say.

[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.580]
Oh gee here you go.

[01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:45.280]
How about this one?

[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.840]
Geneva, New York by hell of a town.

[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:47.580]
You know like that.

[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.540]
How about born in East LA from Cheez and Tom?

[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:50.380]
Sure.

[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.120]
Put it on there.

[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:52.780]
I don't give a crap.

[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.480]
I mean you're gonna compare that with LA women.

[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:57.380]
Yeah.

[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.060]
That's way funnier.

[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.860]
Original singer Lucky Star released an LP called Lucky's Been Everywhere

[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.180]
which contained four different versions.

[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.480]
Great Britain USA, New Zealand, Australia.

[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.260]
I've been everywhere.

[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:07.960]
That's a good song.

[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:08.400]
I like it.

[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:09.300]
You like it?

[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.640]
Yeah and apparently it's also been recorded by everyone.

[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:12.480]
Right.

[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:14.320]
So they like it too I guess.

[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.260]
QAM hello.

[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.760]
Oh he's got some concovers.

[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:17.660]
QAM hello.

[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:20.140]
Hola.

[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.180]
Yeah?

[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:22.000]
Yes.

[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.040]
What's up?

[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.460]
What do you got?

[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.940]
Oh, Lane for Philadelphia, Montabrumia, Super Soaker.

[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:28.720]
Got some fun.

[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.240]
QAM hello.

[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:34.080]
QAM.

[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:35.580]
Yeah hi.

[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:36.540]
Calling one for the poll.

[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:37.620]
Yeah.

[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.040]
Oh Neil.

[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:39.820]
Yeah.

[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.000]
Yeah.

[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:40.180]

[01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:45.140]
Well I'm in the car so I heard you talking and then I heard the polls of American cities.

[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:51.240]
But I wasn't gonna say London calling by the class but there's London Kentucky.

[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.820]
And now I gotta go with the worst song.

[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.120]
It would probably be please come to Boston.

[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.040]
Oh so glad you said that.

[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:58.440]
Yes.

[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.920]
So anyway that's all I got.

[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:01.660]
Thanks pal.

[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.140]
Yeah.

[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.900]
In fact when we were doing the duty water thing with the stand-ills I was gonna say and I forgot.

[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.080]
And thank the Lord this guy who doesn't have Alzheimer's like I do.

[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.120]
Please come to Boston.

[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.860]
That's one of the who did that Kenny Loggins?

[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:14.880]
Close try again.

[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.700]
Loggins of Messina.

[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:17.720]
Close try again.

[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.320]
I'm gonna say somebody Loggins Dave Loggins.

[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.040]
Right?

[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:23.600]
Right.

[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.020]
Well some Loggins guy.

[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.540]
He's come to Boston and bow your brains out.

[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:30.880]
Oh my God.

[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.060]
Talk about depressing.

[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.320]
I never felt that way in Boston.

[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.120]
Thank God I lived there for like I don't know about six months eight months.

[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.300]
61 62-ish and I was Jewish.

[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:42.340]
And I had my own little radio.

[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:46.840]
I told you this I bought one out to some radio chef kind of place and I bought my little transmitter.

[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.320]
I hooked it up to my web core real real recorder.

[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.000]
And I taped all this music off WBZ and then I had my own radio show.

[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:02.160]
I think it was like a 10 watt transmitter you know and you hook it up and you turn it on and you can adjust it to like almost any frequency you want.

[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.920]
Which you find an open frequency and then I get my little corveira and I drive around in the back bay there and I listen to my own show.

[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.140]
With my music.

[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.420]
Well that's something.

[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.360]
It was kind of like an amateur hour version of pirate radio.

[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.720]
But nevertheless I like Boston the food there was fabulous.

[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.120]
Oh my God and the people.

[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:24.680]
Wow.

[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:28.780]
Well, I got all those colleges there you know right off my alley so to speak.

[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.420]
All those college guys and girls and whatever else they are.

[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.720]
A lot of rats though.

[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:36.440]
Yeah.

[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.380]
Ronnie says Jimmy Buffett's got a song title.

[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.080]
Everybody's got a cousin in Miami aside from being perfect for the pool.

[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:42.940]
The lyrics are very accurate.

[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.860]
Oh, they must be skating then if they're very accurate.

[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:49.540]
Even though I've lost touch you know something I hope I have lost touch.

[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.080]
Oh God.

[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:54.620]
Barry McCockner says Cleveland rocks by the presence of the west of America.

[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:58.980]
It was also the theme song on the Duke Eri show Cleveland rocks got it.

[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:03.580]
I hope you're adding all of these because I'm going to have 10,000 city names on the uphol.

[01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:04.940]
At least.

[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:07.660]
WQIM hello.

[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:08.400]
I'm your friend.

[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:09.500]
QIM hello.

[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:16.620]
Yes.

[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.200]
I left my heart and share for Cisco, baby.

[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:20.900]
Yeah.

[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.900]
I think you ought to go back and get it.

[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:23.480]
It's on the pool.

[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:26.200]
Oh, I know number two on the pool.

[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.240]
Get out of here.

[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.280]
My God.

[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:31.680]
Holy sweet.

[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:32.320]
Jesus.

[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.580]
God and Mary.

[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.520]
Hollywood night by Bob Siger.

[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:36.260]
Who?

[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:37.960]
Hollywood night.

[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:38.900]
Hollywood night.

[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:38.980]

[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:39.480]
Hollywood night.

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:39.480]

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:39.480]

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:39.480]

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:39.480]

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:39.480]

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:39.480]

[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:39.720]
Yeah.

[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:41.820]
Put them on there.

[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:42.220]
I don't care.

[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.440]
Put 4,000 on there.

[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.480]
You're just a new daddy, Oak.

[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.680]
I keep hearing your concerns about my family.

[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.000]
Flowers on the wall, baby.

[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:51.800]
Flowers on the wall.

[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.660]
You're counting flowers on the wall.

[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.060]
I wouldn't have been a month.

[01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.240]
They had a lot of gospel hits.

[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.440]
The staff of Brethren's Hill.

[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:01.080]
Yeah.

[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.760]
I have a mission Joey Phonus and Jonas.

[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:05.180]
Yeah.

[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:06.140]
You have a lot of gospel.

[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.900]
Let them pop and play.

[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.280]
They'll all be a chance to be a thing.

[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.080]
We're in a chance to be in stone.

[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:14.520]
With the deck, girl.

[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:15.300]
No name at the moment.

[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:16.320]
I don't like it as much.

[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:17.220]
Now, I'm putting it back in.

[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:18.440]
Right.

[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.300]
Maybe you like the boy right?

[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.800]
Captain, hey, you're a kid.

[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.040]
I don't tell anybody.

[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.340]
That guy sounded like the Elvis guy.

[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.360]
The guy with the deep voice.

[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.100]
He used to...

[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.100]
And a guy in Laurence Welk with the deep voice.

[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.420]
What though his name?

[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.500]
Don't ask me.

[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.120]
The tall, skinny guy with the real members.

[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.660]
The lovely Anakani.

[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.760]
And here's the lemon sisters.

[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:41.160]
I wanted to.

[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:44.560]
Those are the the ticket numbers.

[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.000]
That's the Lawrence Well station.

[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:46.740]
I wanted to.

[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.060]
They never get to the three though,

[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240]
especially sitting the morning.

[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:49.880]
I wanted to.

[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.740]
Kind of like what we have at night.

[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:52.780]
Oh, it's something.

[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.500]
It'll be real interesting to see this trend.

[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:54.840]
Not.

[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.920]
Okay, I said you can't get any new audience

[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.620]
when there's no promotion when especially on a fossil

[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.580]
like AM radio.

[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.120]
Oh, we don't have any money for promotion.

[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.020]
You should know that.

[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.640]
Neil were making all these budget cuts.

[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.040]
Bum bum.

[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:09.740]
Yeah, right.

[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:11.720]
Sure.

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.260]
I don't think there is any depression.

[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:16.320]
I think a whole bunch more people are sticking a whole

[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.900]
bunch more money in their pocket and telling all the rest of us.

[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.060]
Oh, what was us?

[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:20.880]
What was us?

[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:24.200]
That's what I think, especially in this business.

[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:26.400]
And that ran look at that.

[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.040]
The Dow is up 122 points.

[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.880]
And that's because barracks have a news conference.

[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.280]
The story that you just talked about in your own paper.

[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.560]
I haven't confirmed that it was accurate.

[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:37.760]
And I don't want to get into the details of this point.

[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.120]
So do you have another question?

[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:43.360]
Conflict between what you said your hands off approach and the

[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.520]
possibility that he presents them in.

[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:49.480]
John, I said the US Attorney's Office specifically asked us not

[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.840]
to release this until next week.

[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.120]
What about on a special election?

[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.100]
I think it's a good idea.

[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.620]
Give him kind of a chaos here in Illinois.

[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.100]
I eat, you know, I've said that.

[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.440]
Throw your shoe at him, Barack.

[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.120]
Throw your shoe.

[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:01.480]
There you go.

[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.560]
I think I think that could start a new trend.

[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:05.720]
I'd love to see it.

[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.740]
Which is the best song ever written about in American city.

[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.140]
New York, New York.

[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:13.000]
These little Tom Blue is 48.

[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.600]
Winning hands down your pants.

[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.960]
I love my heart in San Francisco 19.

[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.320]
He couldn't sing a look either.

[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:19.880]
Tony Bennett.

[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.280]
He never couldn't.

[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:21.700]
He never will.

[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.480]
He sings like it with a list.

[01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.480]
He sings like Jimmy Cifalitic talks.

[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:28.580]
You know what I mean?

[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.620]
New York State of mind 17.

[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:33.500]
People lost Vegas 17 speaking of Vegas.

[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.660]
I always wondered now maybe it was just me.

[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.680]
Maybe too much Godfather, but I always wondered about those entertainers.

[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.760]
Maybe they knew Johnny Fontaine.

[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.760]
A lot of entertainers who really weren't all that good,

[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.400]
but they were always appearing in Vegas.

[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:45.940]
You know what I mean?

[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:47.400]
Yeah.

[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:51.320]
Maybe they had connections, right?

[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:53.720]
Joey Brown and a whole bunch of other guys.

[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.300]
And Dean Martin and Martin and Lewis.

[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.320]
Who are some of the other ones?

[01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.040]
Don Rickles.

[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.480]
Throw it down.

[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:02.880]
What's wrong with Don Rickles?

[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.300]
I'm not saying anything wrong with them.

[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.640]
I'm just saying maybe he like, you know,

[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.280]
had a piece of that cake from Hyman Roth.

[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:07.820]
I don't know.

[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:09.480]
The biggest name.

[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:10.580]
The best talent.

[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:11.880]
He don't have any new projects.

[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:12.780]
Sport radio.

[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:13.620]
Requires.

[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.280]
He's.

[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.060]
Oh yeah.

[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.060]
Fourth leader.

[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.120]
The biggest names.

[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.460]
The best talent.

[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:25.280]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQ AM.

[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.560]
Miami for the other day.

[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:31.080]
I am some of the maiden and whenever I am in Miami,

[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.000]
I listen to neuro Rogers.

[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:33.980]
We're a pool of hours.

[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.220]
You know, friends,

[01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:37.680]
chewing tobacco become real popular.

[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.480]
Seems like everywhere I go,

[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:42.740]
more and more people are chewing up baking mounds at the back.

[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:45.320]
And spitting out huge gobs at the back of you.

[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.260]
But when it comes to real spitting pleasure,

[01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:51.900]
you can't meet new great expectations chewing tobacco.

[01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.740]
It's not just another child.

[01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:55.540]
It's a way to shine your shoes.

[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.460]
It's a concealed but legal weapon.

[01:31:58.820 --> 01:31:59.460]
Give me your money, man.

[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.640]
I can't see.

[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:03.980]
Yep, thanks to great expectations.

[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:06.220]
You got the time to put your fist

[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.580]
between his cheek and gun.

[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.800]
It's even a convenient home decorator.

[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.740]
Honey, can I have brown polka dot furniture?

[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:14.880]
Sure, darling.

[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:20.180]
Thanks, huh?

[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:21.280]
Don't thank me.

[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:22.960]
Thank great expectations.

[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:24.540]
It'll help you spit.

[01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:25.780]
Clock the deck.

[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.600]
All right, 12 o'clock,

[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.940]
2 o'clock, 60 WQM.

[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:31.060]
We got the big old coming up into a clock

[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:31.800]
until I need a mark.

[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.120]
Stakes over that slot next week.

[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.680]
Here's one that says I just want to drop you.

[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:38.480]
No, tell you what a breath of fresh air you are.

[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.360]
You remind me of the golden era of talk radio.

[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.600]
All those of the days.

[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:44.400]
And it lists some of the most boring people

[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.760]
I've ever remembered in my life.

[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.280]
Bill Smith, Sandy Payton, Jerry Wiesner, and so on.

[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.360]
I've been a long time listener and like,

[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.040]
why don't you get better with each passing decade?

[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.200]
Go Fins and thanks to your board up.

[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.000]
Javier X.A.I.V.E.R.

[01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.420]
He's truly a compliment to the wonderful

[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:00.580]
Q-Bottle community.

[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:02.720]
Who is who?

[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.440]
Keep up the good work.

[01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:08.060]
And I'll just remember to end the bird hill.

[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.920]
Mary Christmas and have a blessed new year.

[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.040]
God bless you.

[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.220]
I think he means.

[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:15.820]
Who's Javier?

[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:17.560]
I remember Javier from Godfather's.

[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:17.640]
What?

[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:20.040]
But he's a great compliment to your show.

[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:20.760]
Yeah, he is.

[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:21.980]
Whoever he is.

[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:23.680]
Oh, if you think that one's good,

[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.480]
wait till you get this from one of our real chronics.

[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:28.020]
Jason, where in hell is it in my pile?

[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.320]
Oh, yeah, Jason.

[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.880]
There's nothing worse than chastising other people

[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.320]
for being stupid and then showing your own stupidity.

[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:39.580]
Let me start by reading the last part of this short email.

[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:42.820]
First, you're always saying you get words misspelled

[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:43.340]
on the emails.

[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.320]
Don't these dumbasses know about spell check?

[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.020]
For the pool, please.

[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.100]
Georgia by Willie Nelson.

[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.000]
City, Georgia.

[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:54.380]
Yeah, right.

[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:57.740]
And second choice, Rocky, him out in a high Colorado by John Denver.

[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.760]
Last time I checked, Jason,

[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.000]
Georgia and Colorado were states.

[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.040]
Not cities.

[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:03.800]
Maybe they're strong.

[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.240]
Maybe they're city states now.

[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.660]
I thought Georgia was by Ray Charles too, by the way.

[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:07.900]
It is.

[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.280]
Willie Nelson, record that.

[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.640]
He might have, but let's pretend.

[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:11.900]
He might have recorded a lot of stuff.

[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:14.260]
He had that, he had that thin hit gear on too tight.

[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:15.060]
That was his problem.

[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.980]
Take it off and wash it out once in a while.

[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:19.660]
Willie and let the roaches out.

[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:20.300]
Oh, that's right.

[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:21.880]
This is the guy that's obsessed with Willie Nelson.

[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:23.700]
Oh, good life.

[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.740]
How about last train to Clarksville?

[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:27.000]
Monkeys.

[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:27.960]
Yep, right.

[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:28.580]
Let's do this.

[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.020]
Clarksville.

[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:31.520]
I don't know.

[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:32.720]
Georgia does a whole bunch of them.

[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:33.420]
Georgia.

[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:35.640]
Georgia, my ass.

[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:36.960]
How do you do that?

[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:41.120]
Georgia, maybe it's a next down river from Aintree down the Kahoo

[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.360]
Lawasi River from Aintree.

[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:44.900]
That guy died.

[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.200]
The banjo picker, he died.

[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:47.560]
He got old and they died.

[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.980]
There's also a sweet home Chicago.

[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.160]
What are you doing?

[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.920]
Are you like, are you joining in with these crazy people and?

[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.300]
Hey, I'm just tossing them out there.

[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.380]
Yeah, toss this.

[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:01.420]
Go toss the salad.

[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:01.780]
Okay.

[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:02.160]
Thank you.

[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.660]
Vicki was talking about the night Chicago died.

[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.820]
Here's one from somebody who obviously just don't get it.

[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.640]
Neil, I don't understand what you mean when you keep saying how great the food is in

[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.200]
a certain place.

[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.500]
Obviously, it depends on specific restaurants.

[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.260]
And in even a few years of time, great restaurants open and close.

[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:27.460]
For example, in Miami, dozens of awesome restaurants have closed, but also dozens of awesome

[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:28.920]
restaurants have opened in the last few years.

[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.380]
So this person evidently is too slow to understand that in some cities, there is a great

[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:39.360]
selection of fabulous food like in Rome, for example, in Rome.

[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.440]
Anybody who thinks that they're going to get Italian food anywhere else like you get

[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.960]
in Rome is dreaming, dreaming, deluding themselves.

[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:52.180]
And for example, in Amsterdam, the food is kaka, even a ratchewan eat it.

[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:53.280]
Kaka?

[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.160]
That's right.

[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.160]
That's the food in Amsterdam.

[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:57.500]
So I don't think it's really rocket science to figure.

[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:01.700]
And when I keep talking about the great food in Boston, it was and it probably still is.

[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.800]
That's where I got fat in Boston.

[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.160]
Fat as in the prayer call.

[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:09.680]
That's right.

[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.420]
Well, you should have been banned in Boston.

[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.400]
Matt and Miami is back one last time.

[01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:16.080]
I blocked him.

[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:16.680]
You're an idiot.

[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:17.780]
He just won't stop.

[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.900]
He's like a fan, the same thing.

[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.860]
They just keep coming back like they want to have this ongoing argument.

[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.640]
And they just they always have to have the last word on and on and on.

[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.920]
Just repeating the same old crap over and over again.

[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:31.440]
Stubborn.

[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.120]
Like a woman.

[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:37.000]
Matt and Miami says, I'm not trying to tell you how to run your show.

[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:38.260]
You have the number one show in South Florida.

[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:38.920]
No, I don't.

[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.040]
And I can't beat the price.

[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:45.260]
I've noticed some of the chronic horrors haven't been calling you as much as they did in the past, which I'm sure you're happy about.

[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:48.220]
And which one would those be that aren't calling as much as they did in the past?

[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.120]
They call it any time I open the phone.

[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:51.960]
The same misfits are there.

[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.080]
I think they're all the fake e-mailers now.

[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.380]
Why can't they just be themselves rather than trying to be somebody else?

[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:01.900]
When is Fat Jolly Joe Belgun to realize what he has in the great Neil Rogers show?

[01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.260]
Quit trying to kiss my ass, Matt and just go away.

[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.680]
If you like the show, listen to it.

[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:10.040]
Listen to it and quit with the advice on and on complaints.

[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.220]
And there was the other one.

[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.180]
Critiques and complaints.

[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:14.680]
Critiques and complaints.

[01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:17.440]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, never stops.

[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:19.560]
Matt, get a life, all right?

[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:20.480]
I have no life.

[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:24.140]
He starts out by saying he's not trying to do this.

[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.940]
And then he just goes ahead and continues doing it.

[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.060]
I'll run the show.

[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.200]
OK, if you like it, great.

[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.640]
The product you said, the price is right.

[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.960]
If you don't like it, bye-bye.

[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:33.760]
Bye-bye.

[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:34.700]
Have a good time.

[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.540]
Do you like it?

[01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:36.080]
There you go.

[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.520]
And even if you don't like it, but you can't live without it.

[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.760]
Then keep listening and shut up.

[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:40.940]
God.

[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:45.080]
Here's this evil Jorge, allegedly in Dawsonville, Georgia,

[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.000]
but we know better because he's bitching about on N95.

[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.820]
He says, I have something for the holidays.

[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:53.980]
And this is one of the nastiest, one of the most negative hateful people.

[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:56.680]
And he's got a fake name, Jorge Hernandez.

[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.880]
OK, allegedly from client relations and investigations

[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.420]
in Dawsonville, Georgia.

[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:11.020]
I know, a Hollison-Billy Rieger from Hawkinsville, Georgia.

[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.000]
And so what's his name?

[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:16.380]
Taylor.

[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:16.960]
Oh, OK.

[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:17.400]
Not Ted Taylor.

[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.280]
The other harness driver, Taylor, Frank Taylor, with the one thumb.

[01:38:23.460 --> 01:38:24.720]
I have something for the holidays.

[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.960]
He says evil Jorge in Dawsonville, Georgia, not.

[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:28.200]
We should do a poll.

[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:30.240]
Which celebrity are you most happy as dead now?

[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.340]
Well, that talk about building a poll.

[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.320]
And in a cool Elvis, Bob Lasseter,

[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.960]
boy, talk about nasty, Bernie Mac, Luther Vandross, evil,

[01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:40.720]
cannibal, et cetera.

[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:43.840]
Boy, nasty, hateful, rotten, bastard.

[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:47.220]
I wish you were in the Hawkinsville, Georgia,

[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:48.900]
somewhere like that, some horrible place.

[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:51.220]
Because believe me, if anybody deserves it, it's Jorge.

[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:57.100]
Luna Moonbase says the name of that Zaffa song is really

[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.700]
Camerillo, Camerillo, not Amarillo,

[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:00.660]
so it doesn't count anyway.

[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.520]
Did we didn't put it on, or did we?

[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:04.960]
No.

[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:05.820]
Good.

[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:06.700]
Thank God.

[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:09.040]
Let's have your top.

[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.500]
Somebody sends me a list of 191 songs.

[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:13.480]
They Googled it.

[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.740]
And so they decided to send them all to me.

[01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:19.260]
There are some really, really.

[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.360]
What about Chicago by Graham Nash,

[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:23.680]
as Brian and Deerfield Beach?

[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:25.200]
And it says, oh, I need to get a life.

[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:27.520]
Chicago by Graham Nash?

[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:28.780]
What song is that?

[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.380]
It doesn't ring any bells.

[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:32.260]
Maybe I have it.

[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.800]
Oh, Andrew trying to be a real comedian.

[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:35.660]
How about this one?

[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:38.680]
I lost my ass in entry by Ned Vady and the River Buck Boys.

[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:39.180]
Oh, yeah.

[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:40.880]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:42.800]
Maria B.

[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.320]
Amarillo, Bartiromo is back.

[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.440]
How's the NASDAQ doing?

[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:46.560]
Is up 35 points?

[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.540]
The S&P is up 14.

[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.360]
And how's the Adao doing?

[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.720]
Dao is, well, we'll get it on there a little bit slow.

[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:55.940]
We know what time it is, OK?

[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:57.720]
Where is the damn Dao?

[01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:58.700]
You idiots at CNN?

[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:03.140]
You in confidence, you knitwits, you goof butts up on 97 point.

[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.320]
Hello, Mr. Rogers, is the fake Maria Bartiromo.

[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.360]
I hope all is well with you.

[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.400]
By the way, what's the price of the looney today?

[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:09.980]
81.

[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:12.600]
Just because I'm baggy, I'd bitch, doesn't mean

[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:13.500]
I don't know my markets.

[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:16.220]
I sure hope you followed my advice on looney protection.

[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:18.020]
Remember, there's always a buying opportunity.

[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:19.200]
Yeah, keep pedaling, bitch.

[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.140]
PS, I'd like to give a song suggestion.

[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.640]
Will Smith going to Miami?

[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.020]
That fits right in with the ambiance of your financial

[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:25.840]
advice, Maria.

[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.020]
Real bogus crap.

[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:28.940]
It's on the poll anyway, right?

[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.100]
It's, I don't know.

[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:30.840]
I don't care.

[01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.600]
Like I can keep track.

[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.620]
We've only got like 7,000 songs on there.

[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.060]
Jimmy Buffett's got a song titled,

[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.240]
says, run, everybody's got a cousin in Miami.

[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:40.960]
Aside from being printed from the poll,

[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:42.160]
lyrics are very accurate.

[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:43.140]
Everybody sent that before.

[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:44.580]
I read it once, now I want it to us.

[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.320]
Bring it in here.

[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.480]
Keep sending it over and over again.

[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:48.240]
Let's see if I keep reading it.

[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:49.120]
Can y'all feel that?

[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.320]
Can y'all feel that?

[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:51.620]
Yeah.

[01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:52.900]
Check it out.

[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:57.800]
Carolyn Ian.

[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:04.200]
Have a list of a whole bunch of sponsors that I used to have.

[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.700]
Says, Neal Rogers listeners, their loyal consumers.

[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:08.320]
Happy holidays.

[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.580]
Good luck at Woodbuy and Carolinian.

[01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:10.680]
Don't worry Carolinian.

[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.960]
They don't sell this show.

[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.140]
They don't talk about it.

[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.520]
They don't discuss it during sales meeting.

[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:15.360]
Promotion meetings.

[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:16.460]
They don't want nothing to do with us.

[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:17.060]
And you know what?

[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:17.480]
That's fine.

[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:18.520]
We don't want nothing to do with them either.

[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:19.500]
They suck.

[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.100]
Long time list, their love you show.

[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:24.040]
Just a song for the poll.

[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.440]
It says it's called Walking in Memphis.

[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.760]
I don't know who the performer is.

[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.340]
Keep up the good work and spread to the upper management.

[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:29.500]
Sean D.

[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:30.620]
PS Pat suck.

[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:32.340]
Go dolphins every day is a new day.

[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:33.140]
Oh, yeah, Pat suck.

[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.220]
They're 9 and 5.

[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:36.800]
It seems to me with like 90% of the team injured.

[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:37.720]
They're still 9 and 5.

[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:38.960]
Not that we're making excuses.

[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.100]
Man, man, man.

[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:42.860]
What's the biggest name?

[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.000]
The best talent.

[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.300]
People with new projects.

[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.960]
4.805.60 QAM.

[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.480]
The fourth leader.

[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.400]
So let's go play.

[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:52.640]
The best talent.

[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:54.100]
It's the G.A. Joe.

[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.440]
Wake night from the end to an end.

[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:56.080]
Here I come.

[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.140]
4.805.60 QAM.

[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.460]
The sports teacher.

[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:01.880]
You're a best.

[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:03.860]
And when I die,

[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:05.580]
Hey, man.

[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:06.960]
Yeah, man.

[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.620]
And when I'm dead,

[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:08.660]
I'm dead.

[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.380]
Is that death rock, man?

[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:12.500]
Yeah, man.

[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.620]
Well, turn it up, man.

[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:16.220]
Another one, bust it up.

[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.320]
You from more QAM records.

[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.240]
It's death rock.

[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:24.200]
Yes, it's all here.

[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:25.380]
Car crashes.

[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.000]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:28.860]
Murders.

[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:30.820]
I got a share of it.

[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:31.900]
Suicides.

[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:33.280]
I was the dog.

[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:35.620]
It's death rock.

[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:36.880]
This is the end.

[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.900]
You get all the mortal classics.

[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:40.480]
Live and let die.

[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.600]
Funeral for a friend.

[01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.580]
Don't fear the Reaper.

[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:43.780]
Only the good die young.

[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:44.500]
Get man's curves.

[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.380]
Psycho killer.

[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.100]
And more.

[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:49.620]
And if you order now,

[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:51.340]
we'll also send you the best of,

[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.400]
hate rocks.

[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:53.800]
Nothing.

[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:54.860]
Oh, man.

[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:57.060]
Let the killer out the minute.

[01:42:58.800 --> 01:42:59.520]
But hurry.

[01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:00.800]
This offer won't last long.

[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:01.880]
And hey, neither will you.

[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:02.700]
So order now.

[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:04.640]
Send 9.95.99 to death rock.

[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.280]
Pinebox.666.

[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:07.200]
Toothstone Arizona.

[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:08.760]
And do it today because.

[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:12.560]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:12.560]

[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.980]
Okay, 1217 and 560 WQM.

[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.100]
The emails are pretty good today.

[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.660]
They're, they're puking in.

[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:19.040]
You know what I mean?

[01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:19.980]
What do you mean?

[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.240]
They're not up to the standard.

[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.740]
Anita marks email that we started the show with.

[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:24.940]
But.

[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.160]
Did you find out who sent that yet?

[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:28.480]
Nope.

[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.540]
You know, did you find out?

[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:31.720]
I'm a friend.

[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:32.900]
You know what I did find out?

[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:33.500]
What's that?

[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:34.760]
I'm on the show the next two weeks.

[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:36.160]
All right.

[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.060]
All right.

[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:38.700]
Tommy's on the show for two weeks.

[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:39.740]
Let's have a party.

[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:40.980]
Thank you, Lisa.

[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:41.440]
Tell me.

[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:43.780]
Oh, Lee told you that.

[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:45.020]
I thought maybe Clarence told you.

[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:47.500]
Clarence doesn't waste his time with.

[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:48.260]
Underline show.

[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:48.460]
I knew you.

[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:50.660]
I have a course with this show.

[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:51.120]
That's right.

[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:51.880]
Goes without saying.

[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:54.680]
And what's the idea with that?

[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:56.620]
With.

[01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:59.320]
That you're on the next two weeks.

[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.700]
Is that because of the vacation thing?

[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:01.460]
I would assume.

[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:02.620]
All right.

[01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:05.200]
Well, that's great.

[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:06.140]
Now, let me ask you.

[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.140]

[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.140]

[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.140]

[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.140]

[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.140]

[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.140]

[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:08.220]
Because we did take a bunch of calls.

[01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:09.420]
We'll probably take a bunch more.

[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:10.400]
I'm saying to say.

[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:14.740]
But is this going through the old board?

[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:18.240]
Or is this right now going through the original way it was going through?

[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:18.320]
Right.

[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.880]
Oh, so we haven't even tested it out to see if your thing is.

[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:21.160]
No.

[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:22.000]
No.

[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.040]
QAM. Hello.

[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:24.180]
Anya, how are you doing?

[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:24.740]
Okay.

[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:26.120]
I got one for the poll.

[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:29.400]
What about the great city of Coca-Cola in Indiana with the Beach Boys song?

[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:29.760]
Right.

[01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:30.280]
That's right.

[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:30.980]
Good song.

[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.620]
That was about that place, right?

[01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:33.300]
Yeah.

[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:34.060]
Yeah.

[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.080]
I thought so.

[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:35.420]
See you.

[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.920]
I glad to hear Fred Christian back on the show for a while.

[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.060]
Two more weeks, baby.

[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.380]
I'm jacked up and I'm jacking at two.

[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:42.140]
Okay.

[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:42.420]
But.

[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:44.740]
So, what do you think?

[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:45.420]
Coca-Cola?

[01:44:45.420 --> 01:44:46.180]
You got that on there?

[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:47.140]
Do it at home.

[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.620]
Mani and Tallahassee says, this is one I know you'd remember and appreciate.

[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.800]
Someone called a classic.

[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:57.040]
The Battle of New Orleans made famous by Bobby Horton.

[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.240]
No, it was not Bobby Horton.

[01:44:58.300 --> 01:44:59.240]
It was Johnny Horton.

[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:01.900]
Mani, you better get your stuff straightened out.

[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:06.640]
Well, in the 1960 Grammy Award for Best Country Western Recording, it's your day, but

[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.640]
it's Johnny Horton, not Bobby Horton.

[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.320]
Jesus, God Almighty, Mani.

[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.840]
Rub it off on you up there in Tallahassee.

[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:19.600]
In 1814, we took the little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to my dismissal.

[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:24.940]
We took the little bacon and we took the little beans and we caught the bloody British and a town in New Orleans.

[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:28.460]
Yeah, I got to drop something in there when he said we took the little beans, but we can't play that no more.

[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:28.960]
Yeah.

[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:30.880]
That's Johnny Horton, right?

[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:31.200]
Right.

[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.040]
Same with Johnny Horton that did North to Alaska.

[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:35.760]
He got around.

[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:36.800]
How about that in North to Alaska?

[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:37.500]
Isn't that a city?

[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.960]
Georgia and Rocky Mountain High Colorado.

[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.160]
And this Jason's given people crap because they're illiterate.

[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.740]
Oh, God.

[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:51.600]
Talk about the popcorn and kettle turquoise.

[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.540]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:56.640]
Here's another sour person.

[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.860]
I'm so glad that tourism is collapsing and that there are much fewer visitors, especially French people.

[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:01.120]
I'm not a Canadian.

[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.480]
I'd be thrilled if you'd spend your entire show just trashing Miami.

[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:05.320]
And why is that?

[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:06.280]
They're like French Canadians.

[01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:06.980]
Are they going to hear it?

[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.900]
What are these people thinking about?

[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:12.980]
And trying to convince all your listeners to leave.

[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:15.560]
Unfortunately, most of them apparently have already left or died out.

[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:16.700]
That's correct.

[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:24.180]
Just leave one something open for me, or publics, and maybe the hard rock and everybody else get out.

[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.320]
Sour, nasty.

[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:32.760]
Screw you rotten, lousy, nasty attitude.

[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:37.440]
Here's one that makes a lot of sense.

[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:42.940]
Not where you're not invited to the labastered 40th birthday party extravaganza with bookshombie and grade code text.

[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.560]
No, I was not in order to give a crap about any of them over there.

[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:45.800]
Okay.

[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.500]
They're small potatoes.

[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:48.320]
They're like Frankie Pentangely.

[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.880]
They think that they're like running a radio station that they're like real broadcasters and they're not.

[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:54.140]
They're not.

[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.900]
Amateur hour, make believe and they don't even own an anastation.

[01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:00.240]
It's a lease deal from Dennis Collins.

[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:01.580]
Oh, God.

[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.780]
Talk about embarrassing.

[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:08.320]
Steven Jersey says, less you know, but very cool songs about cities.

[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.720]
Monteray by the animals.

[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:10.500]
That's less you're known.

[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:14.560]
It was a big fat-headed.

[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:15.180]
Hitted.

[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:16.880]
You got it?

[01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:17.380]
Monteray?

[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:18.800]
Look at the church.

[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:20.340]
By Eric Burden in the animals.

[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:21.820]
1968, I would say.

[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:22.400]
You don't have it?

[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:22.660]
Nope.

[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.860]
Oh, my God.

[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.760]
We'll go get it.

[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.480]
A near city blues by the art birds and go in New York by the climax blues band.

[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.300]
You want to put in there's a monitor ray for sure.

[01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:38.900]
By the animals.

[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:39.880]
Add it.

[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:40.880]
Got it?

[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:41.260]
Yep.

[01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:42.000]
Good.

[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:45.660]
At the end of the show, I'll read the whole list of the 6000 names of cities we got on there.

[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:46.800]
We got almost every city.

[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.380]
How about Saginaw?

[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:50.120]
Okay.

[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:53.000]
There is a song called Saginaw.

[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:53.700]
A couple of few bars.

[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.240]
I don't know how it goes.

[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.840]
Pete from Boccas is, I hear you talking about going to the casino all the time.

[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:02.480]
Sometimes I go to the aisle in Pompo, a hard rock and less often coconut creek.

[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:04.680]
Probably not old enough Pete to go to coconut creek.

[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:11.440]
Mostly I go because my wife likes to play the schlots, but lately we've gone to the hard rock because we like blackjack.

[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:12.980]
Do you ever play blackjack?

[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:13.780]
I have it.

[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.260]
I'm very, very bored with it.

[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:16.900]
It is so boring.

[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:23.840]
And you read an article yesterday that said, Casino is all over the country really feeling the pinch due to the economic meltdown.

[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.220]
So with this in mind, I have a question.

[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:29.580]
Do you think it's better to go to a casino when times are good or when times are tough?

[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.300]
Is that funny?

[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:39.000]
It all depends on your times.

[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.900]
If you got plenty of money, then go and do whatever you want.

[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:46.340]
I think what he's getting at is that they're going to have a better chance of winning when times are tough or tough.

[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:47.520]
I have no idea.

[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.240]
I had a good day yesterday.

[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:54.440]
Good and miracle day yesterday was losing my ass and pulled out a great day.

[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:55.620]
Not a good day, a great day.

[01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:56.840]
Pull George's whole story.

[01:48:57.620 --> 01:48:57.720]
Yep.

[01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:01.860]
I'm asking you because I've heard you say that Casino is all for machine payouts.

[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:02.320]
No.

[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.440]
If this is true, do you think they fix the machines to pay out less than hard economic times or more?

[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:11.940]
I tell my wife that now is not the time to go because the casino is a probably thing I'd less to make up for their current shortfall.

[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:12.780]
She thinks I'm wrong.

[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.900]
Unlike me, she doesn't believe Casino is fixed machine payouts.

[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:19.220]
No, they just let you go in and it's like random and I hope they have good luck.

[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:22.620]
Like Mowgreen, he just, you know, he wasn't skimming off the top.

[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:23.540]
He just had bad luck.

[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.560]
She says, why would they pay out less if they hope to bring people back?

[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.860]
I told her I didn't get an expert opinion, so which is it?

[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.440]
Higher payouts are restricted payouts.

[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:32.400]
I haven't got any idea.

[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:33.940]
You're the best, yes I am.

[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.220]
Pete from Volka also says,

[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:39.820]
PSI really liked the deli at the aisles, but heard a rumor they might be closing.

[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:40.580]
Hmm.

[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:44.440]
Yeah, those aisle of repeat people, they really know what they're doing.

[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:50.820]
Not, not, God, what they did to pump it up, it's just, it's scary as what it is.

[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:53.920]
Although they do have a pretty good selection of machines, I'll say that.

[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:57.240]
They got one, it's called a cheeseburger.

[01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:00.120]
I forget, I played it and I won like 600 bucks on it.

[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:01.100]
I didn't even know what the hell I was doing.

[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:02.420]
Cheeseburger.

[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:04.520]
Okay.

[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:09.920]
Yeah, and you have to like hit certain things and the burger ads like lettuce or mayo and it goes up to,

[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:10.760]
I don't know what it is.

[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:11.620]
Cheeseburger.

[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:14.600]
Branden says time for some math.

[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:19.880]
Just so you can figure sometimes how long the delay is for when you can email or reply from somebody.

[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:24.300]
Whatever the delay is on the radio, what is the delay?

[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.720]
We're on about 20 minutes, like 30 seconds, four hours.

[01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:31.540]
Plus about a 30 second delay on the internet stream from what is on the radio,

[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:35.520]
radio delay plus internet delay, plus whatever delay is on the email is your answer.

[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:38.520]
What is that, moon?

[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:38.760]
Huh?

[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.960]
Whatever the delay is on the radio, plus about a 30 second delay on the internet stream from what is on the radio,

[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.440]
radio plus internet, there's a delay on the internet.

[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:48.880]
I don't know.

[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:52.240]
They're on to be.

[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.700]
Now when you're talking about for dumping stuff,

[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:57.580]
we don't do that.

[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.360]
That would require an interest or effort or involvement on their part,

[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:03.480]
which they don't want to, they're not going to be involved in that.

[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.680]
If it doesn't make them any money, they don't want to be involved with it.

[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:06.420]
Don't you understand?

[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.580]
You're the one that's always saying, if it doesn't make me any money,

[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:10.140]
I do understand.

[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:10.920]
I do understand.

[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.660]
I do understand that it could lose the money.

[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.300]
It vows up 110 points.

[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:19.480]
Well, you're suggesting, like, that they're smart.

[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:20.320]
Is that what you're thinking?

[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:20.800]
I would never.

[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:23.000]
Is this email working or am I blocked?

[01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:26.100]
I said email about the glass urinals, but didn't hear you read it.

[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:30.880]
Well, I didn't get any email about any glass urinals, so you've ascended again, okay?

[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:31.640]
You're not blocked.

[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:33.580]
Wow.

[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:37.940]
Many in Tallahassee comes back, Johnny Horton, not Bobby.

[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.980]
Next he's going to say it was Tim Horton done it.

[01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:43.720]
I'm such a schmuck, damn gum at Bobby Bowden got to me.

[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:44.200]
That's right.

[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:47.220]
That's that Tallahassee mentality after F.S. and U.

[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:49.860]
Mata Hoopal.

[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:51.980]
Mata Hoopal and what?

[01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:53.560]
Yeah.

[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:57.580]
Mata Hoopal and what's the song?

[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:01.180]
New Mexico?

[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:03.280]
Well, I got a good one.

[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:04.580]
How about the BG's Massachusetts?

[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:05.460]
That's the city in that?

[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:05.800]
Sure.

[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:08.240]
God.

[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.800]
How many do we have on here?

[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:13.000]
About 6,000?

[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:15.620]
We only got 292 votes.

[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:16.980]
42.

[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:18.560]
42 what?

[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.780]
42 different songs?

[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:20.220]
Correct.

[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.600]
Who wrote for a hollywood?

[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:23.280]
That didn't have any.

[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:23.780]
It's old.

[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:25.580]
You know, that would be like one of those old timers.

[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:26.480]
Youngstown.

[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:27.860]
Detroit City Blues.

[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:30.240]
These have none.

[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:31.380]
Moderate.

[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.060]
Well, just one honor.

[01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:32.980]
Last train to Clarksville.

[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:33.580]
That's a good song.

[01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:35.140]
No sleep till Brooklyn.

[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.480]
Detroit City Blues.

[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:37.660]
Youngstown, Hooray for hollywood.

[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:38.160]
Have none.

[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:38.940]
Have the big O.

[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:40.960]
That's an infomnia.

[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:41.580]
That's a shame.

[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:46.220]
Remember the guy who called in or sent the email.

[01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:47.080]
What's an infomnia?

[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:48.140]
Yep.

[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.340]
I mean, does it take a lot, especially within the context of the movie?

[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.200]
And that scene where the heads of the five families are meeting?

[01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:54.720]
Right.

[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:58.060]
Does it take somebody really with a great deal of intelligence

[01:52:58.060 --> 01:52:59.580]
to figure out what the hell that word may not have.

[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.120]
What's the biggest name?

[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:02.200]
The best talent.

[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:03.540]
What is your largest?

[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:05.860]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:07.700]
The fourth leader.

[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.920]
What's the biggest name?

[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:10.260]
The best talent.

[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:11.300]
It's the big O.

[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:12.060]
Orlando Elzugeri.

[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:13.500]
Afternoon.

[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:14.200]
Two to four.

[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:16.760]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:19.320]
The sports leader.

[01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:22.020]
Be criminalized pot in Florida.

[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:35.240]
Put on my final ones and I heard it from Street.

[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:42.720]
Just check out the best of Hossler and I'm starting to feel heat.

[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:50.360]
Suddenly I see people checking out my buttons I see.

[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:54.860]
Yeah, I got a first class riser.

[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:57.740]
It don't pitch the 10-mile jeans.

[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.880]
Now I'm sporting a Woody.

[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:07.520]
I'm finding it impossible to see how I'm sporting a Woody.

[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.660]
I feel like an axle without a wheel.

[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:18.540]
So the ghost of this.

[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.820]
He was part one too.

[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.960]
Followed him up to the gate to Grayson.

[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:31.140]
Just to see what he would do.

[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:33.800]
So ghost of the face he could be there.

[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:36.700]
As he headed for his room.

[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.840]
There's a privilege in the ghost.

[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.880]
She's waiting for his post.

[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:44.260]
Down in the jungle room.

[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.740]
Whisper in what is in Memphis.

[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:52.060]
It's still impossible to conceal.

[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.240]
Sporting wood is in Memphis.

[01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:59.220]
I feel like an axle without a wheel.

[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.080]
Sporting wood is in Memphis.

[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:06.920]
It's almost impossible to conceal.

[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:09.400]
Sporting wood is in Memphis.

[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:15.440]
I feel like an axle without a wheel.

[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:21.180]
Oh, we got another fake email from fake Anita Mars.

[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:22.660]
Great.

[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.440]
Hey, you better get with it, Mr.

[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:27.820]
You're just ending with the fake people like I am.

[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:32.440]
I've been around as long as I have.

[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:35.280]
You made a lot of fake people in your days.

[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:38.220]
To live in Dianna L.A., two-pock.

[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:39.300]
You want to put it on there? No.

[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:40.960]
I don't care.

[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:42.000]
Sure, why not?

[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.500]
How to you?

[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:50.300]
Joe says ACDC, I feel safe in New York City.

[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:51.780]
Why?

[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:53.560]
It came out late 2000.

[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:56.340]
It's not been heard since 9-11.

[01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:02.180]
PS, I was in a flight out of Florida to spend time with my mother for Christmas.

[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.540]
Funny, but my furnace broke down.

[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.440]
This is Joe from Toronto.

[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:08.320]
Yeah, pretty funny, Joe.

[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:08.780]
Haha.

[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.760]
Back in the New York group by Alice.

[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:18.560]
Freely.

[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.240]
I know her.

[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:20.620]
Freely.

[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.100]
I pee.

[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:22.180]
Freely.

[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:24.080]
Oh, Freely.

[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:24.860]
From Kiss.

[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:27.000]
Oh, from Kiss.

[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.040]
Oh, my God.

[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.020]
I sure hope that party don't show up on that Gene Simmons family jewels crap.

[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:34.760]
Oh, good.

[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:35.180]
God.

[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:38.460]
What we discussed the other day, those shows are evil.

[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.540]
Not as evil as...

[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:41.680]
Not a shot of love.

[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:42.440]
But almost.

[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:44.540]
What is that crap?

[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:47.260]
Is that Ace Freely something you're just talking about?

[01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:48.320]
I've never heard of it.

[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.260]
I thought it.

[01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:50.380]

[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:52.820]
If you're lucky, you're dead.

[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.060]
I can't eat cowly on CNN.

[01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:58.760]
Okay, here's the way to pull shapes up right now.

[01:56:58.880 --> 01:56:59.940]
How many votes we got 304?

[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:03.360]
309.

[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:08.260]
Which is the best song ever written about an American city.

[01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:11.080]
Not a state, not a country, not an ocean.

[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.940]
New York, New York, these little town blues 54.

[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:16.620]
Winning just hands down your pants.

[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.880]
New York, New York.

[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:20.380]
That's not it.

[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.220]
That's a hell of a town.

[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:23.980]
These little town blues.

[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:24.480]
That's it.

[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:25.600]
The one that he sings off key.

[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.400]
Anyway, did you get my point?

[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:31.020]
I was making before about the mob and a lot of these entertainers who always

[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:32.520]
have been up and figured about that before.

[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:33.440]
Yeah.

[01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:36.600]
Really wonder about some of these people.

[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:38.100]
But you know, I can't prove it.

[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:41.240]
I left my aunt San Francisco 25.

[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:41.940]
He was another one.

[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:42.500]

New York State of my 19, Viva Las Vegas 19.

[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.200]
Boy, nobody's singing like Bob Lincoln man.

[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:51.320]
Viva Las Vegas, remember that?

[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:51.860]
Sure.

[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:53.500]
Oh my God.

[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:55.500]
We're all ready to kill somebody, especially him.

[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:57.520]
And he's singing Viva Las Vegas.

[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:00.400]
He hasn't called us in a long time from out there.

[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:00.920]
Thank God.

[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:01.920]
Maybe he lost his ass.

[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.760]

[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:13.540]
The Bronx is up in the batteries down 11.

[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:15.720]
Philadelphia Freedom was a late addition.

[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:16.320]
It's got 10.

[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.080]
Should have a million.

[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:21.480]
Going back to Miami 9, Allentown 9, Galveston 9,

[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.760]

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans 2?

[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:51.100]
I sure don't.

[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:52.980]
Oh, what a toilet.

[01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:55.120]
Last train to Carstville 1.

[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:04.860]
I'll tell you what it was.

[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:06.260]
Watson Beer, man.

[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:07.820]
And Nazis.

[01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:09.580]
Emorylo by Morning 1.

[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:10.860]
And that's not the name.

[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:11.840]
We see you did put it on it.

[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:12.660]
It's not the name of the song.

[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.320]
It's Camer, Rich Camerillo.

[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:17.620]
East Side West Side, the Side Works of New York 1.

[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:20.040]
Now, can they figure out what song they want to play

[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:20.840]
before the Belmont?

[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:24.180]
You know, like at the Durbian to preekness,

[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:25.480]
there's a song they always play over here.

[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:28.380]
And the Belmont they used to play New York, New York.

[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:30.280]
I can't figure out how it's East Side West Side.

[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:31.160]
I don't know what they want to play.

[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:31.800]
Neither do they.

[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:33.900]
Monterey Detroit City Blues,

[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:35.600]
Youngstown, Hurray for Hollywood, have none.

[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:38.500]
Oh, Ethel Merman must be really upset about that.

[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.020]
Hurray for, huh?

[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:41.100]
Emorylo by Morning 1.

[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:43.080]
It was one of the original choices.

[01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:44.700]
What do you mean by that?

[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:45.820]
I didn't add it.

[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:46.800]
It was already on there from the beginning.

[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.260]
Oh, don't know.

[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:48.100]
Don't get defensive.

[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:49.360]
We've got you for next two weeks.

[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.520]
You ought to be like, uh, pushing up a little bit.

[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:54.700]
I'll start getting defensive now that you finally got, you know,

[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:57.520]
a little, uh, solidarity there with flea.

[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:58.520]
See, if flea were the PD,

[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:00.180]
we wouldn't be getting screwed over like this.

[02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:02.740]
Because you know, damn well,

[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.400]
the amount of money they're going to save off of you

[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.120]
are losing a few hours.

[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.060]
It's so insignificant.

[02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.780]
You know, even pencils and paperclips.

[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:12.340]
Hey, don't forget all those benefits, you know.

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:13.420]
Oh, yeah, right.

[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:17.720]
You ever collect any benefits from the station?

[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:18.500]
Uh, no.

[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:26.540]
Is there any way you can stop playing them a graph

[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:28.060]
the crime dog spots on the internet?

[02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:29.700]
No, I, we have nothing to do with the internet.

[02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:33.820]
At all, I'm almost rather listening to George

[02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:35.800]
and those commercials says some smart ass

[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:38.380]
giving you a nasty shot.

[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:42.260]
Uh, somebody says the streaming is 30 seconds behind the radio feed.

[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.040]
So put all those things together and then you've got an answer

[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:48.120]
for whatever Brandon was trying to figure out which I really

[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:48.760]
don't care about.

[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:50.120]
You hear it when you hear it.

[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:52.300]
You know, I mean, the price of the same price is right.

[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.000]
Journey, the city by the bay.

[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:56.980]
Got it. You want it?

[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:58.320]
I'm just reading them.

[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:03.320]
A new building just opened downtown called Vice Roy at Icon Brickle.

[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.820]
One of the towers is along on the 50th floor.

[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:08.440]
The bathroom and lounge has glass urinals up against the floor

[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.480]
to ceiling glass windows.

[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:11.920]
So if you've ever fantasized about flashing Miami

[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.940]
from 50 stories up while peeing,

[02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:15.240]
now you know where you can go to do it.

[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:15.480]
Great.

[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:19.540]
Oh, God, a bad joke.

[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:21.760]
Have you heard from Mitch Lewis lately?

[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:22.960]
Last time I heard he was here in LA,

[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:25.560]
can you play the Neor-Efford promo, sisal?

[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:27.340]
Oh, fake Alice Rantell.

[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:28.960]
What is that Neor-Efford promo?

[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:29.680]
What is that?

[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:33.200]
It's called Epic promo and I heard from Mitch Lewis just this morning

[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:36.860]
to remind me that he's voicing a documentary about Charles Manson's

[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:39.260]
missing victims on December the 8th at 9 p.m.

[02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:45.780]
George couldn't find Monterey 67 video below.

[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.060]
Don't delete the link.

[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:48.940]
Steven Jersey.

[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:50.980]
Yeah, funny.

[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:52.260]
Funny video is as easy.

[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:53.460]
Funny the MP3 file.

[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:54.780]
That'll sound good on the air.

[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:55.500]
Exactly.

[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:56.960]
What am I going to do with that?

[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:57.880]
Where am I going to stick that?

[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:00.880]
Oh, Pete from Bokeh is back with a law.

[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:03.980]
I just got your Readiness thing about the casino.

[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:05.120]
Pete from Bokeh, remember?

[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:06.280]
Yep.

[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:09.240]
Oh, he's going to be a real man.

[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:12.320]
He likes the deli at the Isle of Comprim and he thinks it's going bust.

[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:15.640]
Here's another Cliff and Kendall, pull ID.

[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.160]
Who'd you like most to throw a shoe at?

[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:19.960]
Neil Rogers, George Rodriguez, Joe Bell or Jimmy Cifalus?

[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:22.180]
How about Cliff and Kendall?

[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.880]
Let's throw 100 shoes at you, Cliff.

[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:25.140]
God.

[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:29.340]
I think the shipment must have come in to that, believe it.

[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:30.340]
Are you kidding me?

[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:30.880]
What's that?

[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:34.060]
Drifting through Lines and without to rescue you?

[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:34.820]
Then I want to talk to you.

[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:35.120]
I know it.

[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:37.240]
I know it.

[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:48.040]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.240]

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:49.320]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:50.160]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:52.000]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.740]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:58.080]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:02:58.340 --> 02:02:59.300]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:03.100]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:03.980]

[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:07.220]
I know it's a good idea.

[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:07.220]

[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:07.220]

[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:07.220]

[02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:07.220]

[02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:11.420]
And so for you, we got the cure.

[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:14.000]
Just eat some of us.

[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:15.220]
Eat us every day.

[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:19.720]
And then flush your clothes away.

[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:23.200]
Don't you know that they're in cold and they're tasty?

[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:27.360]
Never use the list of pasties.

[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:31.220]
They're XX is nice, but it don't work fast.

[02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:34.000]
Just eat some foods.

[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:35.220]
They're real blasts.

[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:37.360]
I'm the party developing.

[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:41.960]
I'm the party dreaming of 320 messages.

[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:42.880]
I'm the party hoping to see my dream.

[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:43.780]
I'm ready!

[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:47.960]
I'm a party hoping to see my dream going to started at 4 am.

[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.360]
Hey instituiAA!

[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:54.920]
Known as Georgia Breanna & competition.

[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.840]
Next weekend, I'll be on vacation for that but my

[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.440]
kiss would be on a week after the weekend.

[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:05.340]
But at that time last weekend, Tracy virginia

[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:07.420]
What city is that song about?

[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:13.360]
Peter says about WBC. Well, I tell you that was a great radio station way back in the day

[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:19.120]
Back in the days of personality radio back when AM was like living and trolling and breathing and

[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:23.360]
Etc. Neil did you ever listen to Bruce Badley on WBC sir?

[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:27.180]
Can 1965-66? Yes, I did earlier than that early 60s

[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:32.400]
Probably the best rock DJ I ever heard he says no your friend Pete and Tampa

[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:39.020]
Now he was good the thing about Bruce Bradley is that most people didn't realize that he used to be an MLR middle-to-road DJ

[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:44.740]
You know back before the rock era and he hated almost all the music he had to play hated wow

[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:48.180]
That an interesting little piece of trivia there. Yes, it is

[02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:52.320]
I would say Jefferson K was my favorite DJ on the WBC at the time

[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.160]
Maybe because he was Jewish, but I didn't know it at the time, but nevertheless

[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:02.180]
Those are the days man W.A.V.C. New York, heiner 13 and Detroit

[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:08.760]
All the great stations all the time great booming 50,000-watt giants and

[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:10.720]
then

[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:13.320]
It went to this

[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:17.760]
Like they look at the latest and this year this year. Yeah

[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:19.620]
See our minds work

[02:05:21.820 --> 02:05:25.760]
He's great nip and suds with the weed

[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:32.220]
It's just these guys nip and suds and whatever the heck it is and the people I call in

[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:37.940]
They're just like them like that they were on the year what a quarter weed and they're high and they're

[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:40.120]
I mean it's terrible

[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:44.740]
But years that I've been look at listening to 610 and

[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:47.180]
And this here. Yeah

[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:48.480]
This here

[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.480]
Mike and four Myers suggests streets of Philadelphia by Bruce Prinks. Is that on there?

[02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:56.980]
Not yet. You sure? How do you keep in track?

[02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:02.060]
That a good memory god. It's been a long time since we had a poll that had this many additions to it. Oh

[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:05.040]
I've gone there on the already Charlie B. See I told you

[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:14.460]
Tracy says don't edit but the house of the rising sun is my favorite song about a city is a fantastic song

[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:19.760]
Why not answer to get many votes? I hate for it. I'm at the bottom of the pack. Why? Oh

[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:22.920]
She just answered my question. What why not add it and then she

[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:25.980]
What I added put it on

[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:30.340]
General opinion is that the house of the rising sun was a brothel

[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:33.940]
There have been several claims about its location including place in a French clover

[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:37.980]
Excavated in 2005 which had the name rising sun in the 1820s

[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:43.720]
advertising found on the excavation movement to prostitution on site and numerous parts of russian cosmetics

[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:49.980]
also fun

[02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:51.340]
Still got it still got

[02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:54.000]
Kind of your way to the rest of that

[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:59.940]
Another possible location was a brothel run by a French madam whose name translated to the rising sun

[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:04.860]
Or maybe when your son went there it would rise. I don't know

[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:08.380]
There's no agreement about whether it was a real place or euphemism for brothels in general

[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:14.220]
It may have also referred to several other things including the New Orleans prison for women a place where prostitutes were detained

[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:15.880]
Well being treated for syphilis

[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:22.040]
Yeah, something pens on well that it's chopped off again, you know

[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:29.120]
It was often sung by female performers as the singers gender can be ambiguous as the song of a woman who follows a drunker

[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:32.700]
Gambler of New Orleans becomes a prostitute the unapricot to there and

[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:39.480]
Really how many of the songs on the poll to people seriously considered to be the best song about American city ever written almost none

[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:40.840]
They don't answer the poll question

[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:44.400]
Here's just name us a song about a city right or a state

[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:51.880]
No, it's just calling or mailing in e names for a chance to feel like you can contribute. That's right Tracy. You got your thumb on it

[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:52.100]
I

[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:58.080]
And here's an example your close personal friend Puerto Rican Ralph. I told you he was a dumb-bo

[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:06.100]
You want to hear his selection for the best city? Please the best song about an American city my old Kentucky home by Jim neighbors

[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:07.340]
There you go

[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:14.560]
Maybe Ralph needs a refresher course back in Puerto Rico. Okay, Kentucky last time I checked with not a city

[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:22.900]
You're suggesting is shmitty, but it ain't about a city. Okay, my old Kentucky home by Jim neighbors. You fair. Oh my god

[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:28.540]
Wow, oh, so here's the a follow-up from the fake Anita Marx

[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.120]
Please

[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:34.800]
Hi Neil, I'm sitting here doing a little show prep for this afternoon. I'm listening to your show online

[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:39.740]
The more I hear of it, I'm convinced I made the right choice to join WQM after the Raven season

[02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:45.880]
Thanks for being so welcoming and for an advanced promoting my new show that kind of teamwork was a long way with me

[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:47.640]
Mr. Bell was sure right about you

[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:55.240]
Yeah, Mr. Bell was sure right about you. Oh boy. Talk about a tip off

[02:08:56.340 --> 02:09:01.060]
And by the way nobody's promoting your new show because you're a talentless bitch. Okay other than that

[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.520]
Although, maybe she looks pretty good. I don't know

[02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:09.160]
Whether the b-says she looks horse face ass, huh horse face

[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:12.160]
Hort that's right that one a email said she's horse-faced

[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:17.080]
Horsey faced well, maybe Joe Bell likes horsey puss. I don't know

[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:22.580]
Here's one that says Scott McKenzie San Francisco is better known than or whatever. I don't near right

You look at this

[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:06.600]

[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:13.740]
This is streets of San Francisco. That's right. Carl Maldon and Michael Douglas that's right before he became a legend doing his own mind

[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:14.440]
Bunky

[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:18.080]
We talk about a guy who takes himself away from the seriously

[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:21.280]
Michael Buckley. He's got a lot of money

[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:23.480]
Good for him

[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.720]
Then the Kirk Douglas finally broke his seat still on

[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.260]

[02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:58.560]

[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.900]

Paul Sean says well, this is interesting

[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:10.600]
Here I'll call Neil. I think Mata Hoopel guy wanted all the way to Memphis

[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:16.000]
The creepy thing about Lawrence Welk is that despite the heavy German accent he was natural born American

[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:21.520]
So tight was their community in North Dakota. He didn't learn English. He was 21. No speaking English

[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:25.420]
No speaking English like my Chinese market people across the street

[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:26.600]

I said no those are aluminum trays. They're tin foil trays coal. So he puts them down

[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:15.520]
He goes in the back of the story and he he brings out a pack of charcoal. Okay cool. I said yeah, cool make fire

I don't know what to say about him obsessed

[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:44.420]
Obsessed anyway, here's a whole bunch of emails

[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.060]

Correction only because you made this error multiple times the reason I made the errors because I don't really care

[02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:24.480]
790 to ticket is not a license at least deal anymore

[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:27.220]
It was formerly leased by Joel Feinberg from Lincoln financial

[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:31.360]
But after Feinberg went under Lincoln financial and took it back and is running it themselves

[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.500]
See that's even worse yeah

[02:17:34.220 --> 02:17:39.380]
That's even worse being run by Dennis Collins and Lincoln financial that's even worse than a leased deal

[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:43.660]
So I'd be really embarrassed about that

[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:50.560]
But then again you folks go across street have no shame anyway, so you know anybody that would put Sid Rosenberg on here has to have no shame

[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:55.860]
Alice Rantel says not or a stand major can you play you belong to the city by Glenn fry

[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:04.580]
Stan used to play all the Don Johnson call at the end. I love your talk up says Alice. Well, what does that mean you belong to the city by Glenn fry

[02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:08.740]
Well, that's a song we got it. No

[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:10.980]
Oh

[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:20.080]
Stan used to play all the Don Johnson calls at the end. What does that mean at the end of the song I'm thinking

[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:27.380]
I don't know probably you know, it sounds like Alice is having tough time and before you go could you do one short thing for me

[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:34.700]
What's that fan just say freeze major Miami vice your under arrest absolutely. I'm not going to do that. Oh you

[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:42.100]
Back to the Stanley that's because the Rod Baguille of it is in the name telling he looks like a younger Stan major

[02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:45.760]
Take the word here same Illinois sour look

[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.740]
What's that same song you belong to the city

[02:18:51.140 --> 02:18:53.320]
Sounds a little bit like another one but oh

[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:58.480]
Okay, that's enough. Well wait till Stan gets his own show again. He can play that

[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:06.100]
So the fake Barry Jackass is the annual shareholder meetings only a couple days away and serious xm radioink is facing a

[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:09.060]
Trifecta of negativity surrounding the company

[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:14.500]
shareholders are angry subscribers are angry and pundits are all pining over the death of a medium

[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:21.920]
A recent article in business week underscores the negativity not only is the economy in the toilet causing strains on revenue streams from

[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:28.780]
OEM and retail channels, but the company still the reads refinance of billion dollars in debt that's coming due in 2009

[02:19:29.460 --> 02:19:36.440]
And that includes 210 million in February add to that the threat of being delisted from Nasdaq and the also popular reverse stock split

[02:19:37.380 --> 02:19:43.940]
So now you have analist and pundits questioning the entire business model from use of the expensive satellites to high priced programming agreements

[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:46.160]
They made a mistake you made a mistake

[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:51.180]
They made a mistake and their programming contracts is Paul Gallant senior VP at Stanford group

[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:53.260]
It's like an albatross around their neck

[02:19:54.020 --> 02:20:00.660]
There are lots of ways to distribute programming and satellites may not prove to be the ideal way since Mac angle and an analyst at frost and Sullivan

[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:06.920]
Serious maybe artificially limiting its scope by relying on satellite technology is a delivery vehicle

[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:12.900]
Says Susan Kavorkian a program director for research IDC what an appropriate name for somebody analyzing

[02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:16.100]
A serious Kavorkian, but wait there's more

[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:24.420]
It's not just experts who are negative about serious sex and angry subscribers continue to fester negative sediment over the combining of channels

[02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:29.040]
It's been a month since the switch was thrown and the unhappy narrative continues

[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:31.400]
In the middle of the holiday season nonetheless

[02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:35.480]
I don't think the company expected the backlash it received or that it would continue the way it has

[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:38.480]
But during a period of much needed retail sales

[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:43.900]
It's crucial that satellite radio is part of a positive worth of mouth conversation and all it's getting right now is negativity

[02:20:47.820 --> 02:20:53.420]
Reality check not all subscribers are unhappy another reality check the onion online population subscribers

[02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:55.900]
Doesn't necessarily represent the entire population of subscribers

[02:20:55.900 --> 02:20:58.280]
But you know what most people don't think about that

[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:04.220]
More importantly potential subscribers don't know that and even if the it's the vocal minority

[02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:10.540]
It's still vocal very vocal when entire articles are written about how unhappy subscribers are guess what the general conclusion is

[02:21:11.700 --> 02:21:12.560]
it blows

[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:17.680]
And Thursday shareholder meeting male Carmanson doesn't need to just to address the fear and loathing

[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:25.000]
Spawning from investors and analysts. We need to address the disheartened subscribers and wrap it all with open and honest candor

[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:29.380]
Remember Egyptian candor who drove that horse Egyptian candor

[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:32.280]
We all know the economic climate is bad right now

[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:34.340]
We understand that Mel is not happy with the share price

[02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:37.600]
We get that there needs to be a lot of belt tightening order to get through this mess

[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:42.340]
And that means jobs and shows and channels, but it shouldn't be expensive simple communication

[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:45.320]
But people are looking for isn't acknowledgment

[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:52.000]
It's a vision of plan clearing concise leadership and open communication at all the touch points as in touch this

[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:56.420]
Companies always try to control the message to shape themselves in a positive light

[02:21:56.420 --> 02:22:01.260]
But when you're pushing 20 million subscribers and over 40 million listeners you can't control the conversation

[02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:03.620]
The only thing to do is be part of it

[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:07.940]
Riverberry got that see very fake buried doesn't really say much

[02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:11.660]
He just sends me articles like it a long article by Mike Snyder USA today

[02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:14.540]
also about

[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:16.360]
satellite

[02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:24.700]
As serious an xm signals merge customers are confused it says oh this goes on for pages and pages you want hear it or not

[02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:27.140]
I'll save it for later. Okay, if we need it

[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:37.660]
Q a m. Hello, see I was thinking maybe there would be a person good caller can make what's his name happy the one that I blocked Mike and Miami or whatever his name was

[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:43.020]
Matt mad at Miami go away Matt no go away mad just go away

[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:48.540]
Larry says from your partridge family greatest hits album

[02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:53.180]
Used to play when there weren't any calls a song to add to the pool

[02:22:53.180 --> 02:22:58.580]
Point me in the direction of albacracky. I mean see see what I'm worried everybody says

[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:05.440]
Point me in the direction of albacracky to anybody ever heard of it. No. Is it the best song about a city? No, would anybody believe no?

[02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:10.980]
He says why do I have a feeling you may need the euphere button ready if you play this one. This is Larry

[02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:17.980]
Oh, Larry Larry they just don't understand name a song about a city

[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:27.520]
Q a m hello

Q a m hello

[02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:31.420]

Oh, Neil Joe Bell here. Oh, Q a m hello

W Q a m hello

Hey, how you doing? Okay

[02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:52.200]
Listen, how come the media doesn't make any comment about present elect Obama smoking two packs cigarettes a day?

[02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:57.000]
Stop presses yeah

[02:23:58.600 --> 02:23:59.080]
And

[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:07.240]
And oh, he just want to hear like most of me. Just want to hear. I thought we could buy it during the campaign

[02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:09.900]
Who cares? I don't

[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:12.760]
Business he wants to destroy his lungs. That's his business

[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:17.760]
If he wants to get the you know, bronchial disease cancer, whatever that's his business

[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:24.860]
He could smoke 20 packs a day and he still got the what we got right now beat hands down your pants schmuck

[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.360]
Three hundred eight nine votes on the pull we got a shot at the 400

[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:36.380]
Especially with like 400 names on the pool

[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:38.940]
We still got four or five that don't have any votes

[02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:42.100]
San Francisco by Scott McKenzie now. How could that have no votes?

[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.320]
That's a legendary song what just recently went on there

[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:51.620]
Get out of here to live in Dianne LA Detroit city blues youngstown and hooray for holly would have none

[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:55.340]
I guess all the Ethel Merb and fans are just like her they're all dead

[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:57.780]
The best

[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:03.760]
Think fourth leader

[02:25:06.380 --> 02:25:07.020]
Best talent

[02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:10.640]
Jim Mandage

[02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:19.940]
Fort radio five sixty Q.A.M. The sports leader. I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers

[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:23.680]

Mike says today show is horrible

[02:25:55.260 --> 02:26:01.100]
You're mailing it in more than ever. It's always boring when your whole show revolves around a pool. Please put some effort into it

[02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:01.520]
No

[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:09.360]
The whole show revolves around a pool like I'm the one sending all the emails right

[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:15.980]
Urchin that's it. Ah now I figured it out. Yeah, that's right. You're the fake everybody writing them all on the fake here

[02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:18.220]
You're the great great. I guess I'm the fake Mike

[02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:24.280]
The wonder you like the picture of the nation is horrible today. She was fine. I'm enjoying it

[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:29.180]
Even though these people are still doing the same thing they always do you know but blame me for that

[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:33.240]
That's my fault. Right what a just name a city that there's a song about

[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:38.440]
Jimmy says we serious customers are not confused. We're disgusted

[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:42.960]
I'd like to wreck my car just so I can buy a new one that doesn't have serious pre-installed

[02:26:44.180 --> 02:26:49.160]
How do you like that? Yeah, not confused. Disgusted

[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:55.240]
Now here's one from somebody 80s 1980 whoever that is

[02:26:56.300 --> 02:27:01.180]
And again same same thing these classic songs are of Texas City's or Towns

[02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:02.400]
Lagrange ZZ top

[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:07.440]
Luckin back Texas waitlin Jennings or one that we will put on there El Paso by Marty Robbins

[02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:15.840]

[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:18.500]
There it is

[02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:22.280]
Marty Robbins a white sport co-oping carnation

[02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:24.820]
And my foot deep inside

[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:29.460]
You're welcome out in the west Texas town of El Paso

[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:31.560]
Okay

[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:31.920]
Enough

[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:36.240]
Very Macognus is a police and oh this is a story

[02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:39.300]
From Ken Shasha in the Congo

[02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:46.720]
Police in Congo arrested 13 suspected sorcerers accused of using black magic to steal our shrink-winds penises

[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:50.640]
After wave of panic and attempted lynchings triggered by the lens witchcraft

[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:58.780]
Reports of so-called penis matching or not on common West Africa where belief in traditional religions and witchcraft remains widespread

[02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:02.500]
And where ritual killings to obtain blood or body parts still occur

[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:11.400]
Rumors of penis theft began circulating last week and Ken Shasha democratic republican of Congo's sprawling capital with some 8 million inhabitants

[02:28:12.060 --> 02:28:16.040]
They quickly dominated radio calling shows with listeners advised to be where

[02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:20.140]
A fellow passengers and communal taxis wearing gold rings

[02:28:20.700 --> 02:28:23.820]
Like the Jonas Brothers there where they're wearing a ring around their thing

[02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:31.840]
Proported victims 14 of whom were also detained by police claimed that sorcerer simply touched them to make the genitals shrink or disappear

[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:36.180]
What some residents said was an attempt to extort cash with the promise of a cure

[02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:41.580]
You just have to be accused of that and people come after you. We've had a number of attempted lynchings

[02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:46.480]
You see them covered in marks after being beaten can charge as police chief told Reuters on Tuesday

[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:53.440]
Police are right to the accused sorcerers in their victims in an effort to avoid the sort of bloodshed seen in Ghana a decade ago

[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:59.120]
When 12 suspected penis natures were beaten to death by angry mobs the 27 men have since been released

[02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:01.780]
I'm tempted to say it's one huge joke

[02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:03.300]
Said the appolice chief

[02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:09.320]
But when you try to tell the victims that their penises are still there they tell you that it's become tiny or that they've become impotent

[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:13.060]
That then I tell them how do you know if you haven't gone home and tried it? He said

[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:14.660]
Go home and try it

[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:21.720]
Some kin charge our residents accuse a separatist sect from nearby bass Congo province of being behind the witchcraft and

[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:26.080]
Eventually recent government cracked on its members so to speak said a plan word that is members

[02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:29.760]
It's real just yesterday here. There was a man who was a victim

[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:36.000]
We saw what was left was tiny said 29-year-old Elaine Kailala who sells phone credits near a conchacha police station

[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:43.880]
How do you like that? They're shrinking and stealing penises in the Congo. Yeah

[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:50.340]
I could go to the Congo, but I don't want to yeah goes on all the time does it really

[02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:55.100]
That I heard let me touch that and see if it shrinks

[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:59.820]
Oh, here's the fake Mahatma Gandhi you're right about the emails most of them are fakes

[02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:03.380]

[02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:21.500]
I mean it's deleted and blocked in what yadeon

[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:31.780]
405 votes nice going there tubby I mean to over 14 ever votes on the two polls, but of course this one is so gigantic in humongous

[02:30:34.400 --> 02:30:40.220]
New York I'm not really sure which of these songs that keep singing around one these little Tom blues

[02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:42.100]
I'm singing off key

[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:45.700]
71 kick and ask man went in by a landslide

[02:30:46.220 --> 02:30:49.240]
And then Tony Bennett I left my heart in San Francisco 31

[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.720]
Couldn't see his way out of a paper sack

[02:30:53.160 --> 02:30:56.940]
New York State of mind 25 Detroit rock city 22

Victorian humanist society president Steven Stewart said

[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:56.620]
The society does not consider itself to be a religious organization and believes ethics have no necessary connection with religion

[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:03.420]
Humanists believe people are responsible for their own destiny and reject the notion of a supernatural force or God except the course for

[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:06.240]
