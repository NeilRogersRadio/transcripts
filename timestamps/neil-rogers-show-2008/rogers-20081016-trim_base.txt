[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440]
The music expressed on the previous one.

[00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.580]
What about jerk jerks tree?

[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.960]
Ghost, gas and collars.

[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.140]
And you not reflect those of the busily broadcasts.

[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.600]
Was that yesterday?

[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.300]
Staff, average, average, average, average.

[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.860]
Yeah, I think so.

[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.160]
That was just her jersey was on yesterday.

[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.280]
I think so much.

[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.800]
I think so.

[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.360]
But he had to do it right now, show them the days for that.

[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.740]
That's not exact.

[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.860]
WQA, real jerk.

[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.100]
Jackanne.

[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.260]

[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.960]

The Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.520]
Did you tell me?

[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.880]
Dile 5, 670.

[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.300]
That was up 74 points.

[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.260]
Let's hear it.

[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.080]
Another count.

[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.400]
Call 123.

[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.660]
Here comes the bunny.

[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.280]
435, 60 on your 18T.

[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.460]
Wonder how Jill Pummers is doing.

[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.400]
Jill Pummers.

[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.960]
The opinion expressed by me.

[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.100]
Oh yeah.

[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.960]
Wonder if he's got Pummers cracked.

[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.440]
He's got a first needs of time.

[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.040]
Represent those of WQA Am management staff or sponsors.

[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.500]
Now the next step is the Boundera 17 560 WQA Am.

[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.000]
All the crap you can unwrap.

[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.740]
All the slime, all the time.

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.840]
And now it's time for another edition of Professor Mould.

[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.820]
Ah, hi, I'm Boris and girls.

[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.640]
Welcome back to another electrifying notification.

[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.740]
Today we're going to learn about the Roma Therapy.

[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740]
Now if myelistry the assistant will give me a hand.

[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.140]
What?

[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.840]
You said give me a hand.

[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.500]
I asked till no press.

[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.640]
Now get out of there.

[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.380]
I know what you're doing.

[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.780]
I know who's behind this.

[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.740]
I've seen people.

[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.380]
I've seen people.

[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.540]
What are you talking about?

[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.840]
Never mind that now.

[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.600]
We got to demonstrate the infectious of a Roma Therapy today.

[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.400]
All right.

[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.820]
Okay.

[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.160]
Now, yeah, smell my fingers.

[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.440]
But I'll open smell my finger.

[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.180]
Okay.

[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.740]
Now you'll notice boys and girls that can gildy

[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.060]
is a smell of my fingers.

[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.020]
They ain't doing it.

[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.580]
They right there and smell my finger.

[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.460]
Don't move.

[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.040]
A till the boys and girls out there

[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.600]
and it smells like pizza.

[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.700]
It smells like don't do it.

[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.620]
You'll keep it right there until it's not smelling like pizza.

[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.980]
Why doesn't it smell like...

[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.820]
I'll hide up my ass all morning, but that shouldn't matter.

[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.240]
I am called pizza for breakfast.

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.280]
Now I'll pay your dominant measure.

[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.720]
I'm going to pass out.

[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.320]
If I have to, I'll bring this.

[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.020]
Listen, you'll want to smell my fingers, then.

[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.520]
No.

[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.620]
That's not good.

[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.200]
Slaves.

[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.940]
Smell my finger.

[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.880]
Give a smell of...

[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.040]
woman.

[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.320]
Yeah.

[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.300]
Yeah, but not like the ones back in my day.

[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.240]
Back then the broods had a rain.

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.800]
Pire is running up there, crash to the armpits.

[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.660]
What are you dead?

[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.560]
Yeah.

[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.760]
10.025, 60 WQA.

[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.040]
I'm happy Thursday too.

[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.820]
Why thank you.

[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.800]
You're welcome.

[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.080]
We missed a Drew Rosenstein house.

[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.940]
The crans shorts on the Joe Rosho.

[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.200]
Oh, you just were trying hard to...

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.840]
But I was...

[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.780]
Well, I don't know.

[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.760]
If I would have known that the jerk jerks be would have been on,

[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.360]
then I would have listened.

[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.840]
Not.

[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.320]
Here's the poll results so far.

[00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.820]
Obama, by the way, kicked ass.

[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.360]
Last night.

[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.160]
That's all over.

[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.820]
No, it's done.

[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.100]
Yeah.

[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.940]
Every poll, except Miss Fudge.

[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.780]
Miss Fudge on the Fudge report had the...

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.520]
the poll result up there before the debate was half over.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.400]
With the can of course, Winding Handley.

[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.940]
Hand's down.

[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.160]
Miss Fudge is pants.

[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.300]
But everybody else.

[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.220]
Overwhelming.

[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.300]
Grumpy.

[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.000]
And you know something?

[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.580]
Not only is he grumpy and keeps going on the attack.

[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.980]
But he looked really bad last night.

[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.920]
Not that he ever looks good.

[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.380]
But he looked extraordinarily bad.

[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.760]

[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.740]
That cheek was really fluffy and...

[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.200]
Yeah.

[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.160]
Nasty old, cramudge and miserable coot.

[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.780]
Small business income.

[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.200]
Yeah. How's Joe the plumber doing?

[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.480]
Okay. Here's the poll results so far.

[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.580]
I feel old, Wind.

[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.360]
930 votes. But we can change him when we get to a thousand fat Chris.

[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.640]
Now, what's the story?

[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.680]
You're going to be here tomorrow or not?

[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.020]
Oh, that's what I lean out.

[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.500]
We're talking about.

[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.580]
And?

[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.620]
Haven't you sat it yet?

[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.860]
I'll probably be here.

[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.180]
What kind of an answer is that?

[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.980]
At least you're consistent.

[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.300]
You never ever give me a direct message.

[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.580]

[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.580]
Well, I did it one day a week off so far.

[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.240]
Yeah.

[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.160]
Tomorrow would be a second day off.

[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.380]
Which is that no one knows people get.

[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.960]
So, but I'll probably be here tomorrow.

[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.140]
We here on Monday?

[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.480]
No, that was my one day off.

[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.760]
So then what do you debate?

[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.060]
You're going to work like three days on the show?

[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.020]
That's what he wants me to do.

[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.220]
No, I'll play.

[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.260]
Who wants you to do?

[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.400]
I will probably be here.

[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.600]
If that's what who wants you to do?

[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.720]
If Josh is going to do my, uh,

[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.900]
clearance, doing it.

[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.080]
F clearance.

[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.240]
No, thank you.

[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.040]
God.

[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.940]
You're, you're taking orders from that little pipsqueak.

[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.380]
It traded with contrast.

[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.980]
Well, I would rather have a contract for five minutes.

[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.160]
Exactly. I would rather have a clearance.

[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.640]
Work Friday and have Sunday off.

[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.820]
I'm coming to you up the way Sunday.

[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.840]
So kick him in the ass and show him against the wall, drag him around like a freaking ragged

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.660]
down clearance.

[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.200]
Oh, there's Joe the plumber.

[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.900]
My name on national TV.

[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240]
And like I said before, I'm just glad I could be used.

[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.680]
Yeah, it could be used by.

[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.260]
Yeah, right.

[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.720]
That's right.

[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.940]
At least he's being honest.

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.040]
I got the story about that that's making the rounds on the Internet.

[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.940]
Thanks to one of our e-mailers out there.

[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.460]
Neil at NeilRodgers.com is the e-mail address.

[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.080]
And also be sure and look on NeilRodgers.com.

[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.660]
Right under the pole and take a peek at that lovely picture.

[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.280]
And that's very popular now.

[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.020]
I feel old when a long time celebrity gets older dies, 203.

[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.860]
When I talk to young people, 184.

[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.980]
When I look in the mirror, 171.

[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.020]
When I look in the mirror, I go, oh, hey.

[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.240]
Talking about my favorite old movies, music TV, et cetera.

[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.060]
Food, restaurants, 150 living in the past.

[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.440]
I remember when gas was under a bucket gallon, 121.

[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.640]
I remember things from 50 years ago, 68.

[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.560]
I'm asked if I'm a senior citizen, 33.

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.980]
Would you like the senior diet coke, sonny?

[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.340]
Oh, my God.

[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.860]
That'll...

[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.060]
So it's only this one bitch.

[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.020]
She always does that to me.

[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.540]
I'm not going to go to her line anymore.

[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.660]
Oh, Alice Rantell is back to work.

[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.660]
Aren't you excited about that?

[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.340]
He was ill.

[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.380]
Oh, you know what?

[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.400]
I thought my life was over, but now.

[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.660]
Alice Rantell is announced to be returned to KABC

[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.600]
after four months of treatment for lymphoma.

[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.500]
Rantell says she is now cancer-free and ready for work.

[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.860]
She'll be returning to her normal hours, 11 to 11.

[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.860]
45 a.m. and 7 to 10 p.m. weekdays.

[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.140]
Welcome back, Alan.

[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.500]
Continue good health, it says.

[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.320]
Well, I wish him good health, but other than that,

[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.380]
putting her back on here right before the election,

[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.780]
you know, that's just what we need.

[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.060]
Not that she'll do any good out there in California.

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.460]
California, it's a done deal.

[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.660]
In fact, the whole election's a done deal.

[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.960]
Oh, the dollar's down 19.

[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.120]
Oh, my.

[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.700]
Tiss, tiss, tiss.

[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.280]
Oh, the S&P is up new.

[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.520]
Yeah, likely story.

[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.440]
What if that guy is laying under a viaduct somewhere?

[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.920]
God, what a shmeckle.

[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.500]
Pracey and Kendall says, given your love of music,

[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.620]
your love this was sight.

[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.480]
Did she send this to you?

[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.320]
Yes.

[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.380]
Well, you can look it up.

[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.760]
I will.

[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.700]
TropicalGlenn.com.

[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.980]
It's a jukebox that plays the top 100 Oli songs

[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.920]
from the 40s to the 80s, as well as other musical genres.

[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.400]
You can look up a song from any given year,

[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.980]
play it for background sounds, or use it to help with a pull.

[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.120]
I know that you don't do links on the show,

[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.180]
so just try it for yourself.

[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.480]
Well, I can't play the stuff on here.

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.520]
Why don't you stick it in here and see what it does?

[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.060]
Stick it?

[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.340]
Yes, stick it.

[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]
All right, let me go look.

[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.140]
Stick it to the ticket.

[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.180]
Are we not running those anymore?

[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.500]
Those ones that go ticket, ticket, ticket.

[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.040]
I hope not.

[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.260]
No, I hope not.

[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.800]
Oh, please tell me.

[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.440]
No, please.

[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.540]
The book comes out tomorrow morning at 10.

[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.220]
So I got to be here.

[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.580]
And this morning, I may have to make a run for a joy.

[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.700]
So at some point during the cellist alerting you now,

[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.240]
well, this morning I sat, but I couldn't match that.

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:46.620]

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.040]
So they're you sat all brokenhearted.

[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.400]
I sat, but didn't match.

[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:49.860]

[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.820]
Well, it was just, you know, your normal routine.

[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.460]
You sit there and you think something's going to happen.

[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.420]
And this morning it did not.

[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.980]
Very unusual for me.

[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.880]
Maybe that's because I had a good Atkins Day yesterday.

[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.360]
Perfect.

[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:01.940]
No, I did not.

[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.900]
I had a Snickers bar.

[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.820]
Damn it.

[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.800]
But other than that, I had a perfect day.

[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.680]
No good.

[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.540]
That's good.

[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.300]
No, no.

[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.700]
I'm I'm crelling over here.

[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.380]
Today I'm not having no Snickers bar.

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.180]
I'm going to get in that cab at two and head off to Woodbine again.

[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.280]
Where I won a few bucks yesterday.

[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.020]
How do you like that?

[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.880]
I want a few dollars.

[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.180]
TropicalGlen.com.

[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.760]
Find it.

[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.900]
So here this is from Babel Magazine.

[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.340]
Somebody emailed this to me.

[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.460]
Joe the plumber has got his picture here.

[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.440]
Republican plant and relative of Charles Keating question mark.

[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.920]
If you watch the third and final presidential debate last night,

[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.880]
you know that there were many mentions of Joe the plumber.

[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.780]
Joe is actually Joe Wurzelbacher and every man who appeared out of a crowd

[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.260]
at a no-bomber campaign appearance and asked the senator about his economic plan.

[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.720]
Joe says his American dream is being able to provide for his family and send

[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.360]
us under college.

[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.900]
But some are saying that Joe isn't who he appears to be.

[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.780]
Here's the buzz from the internet.

[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.860]
Wurzelbacher who says he was playing football outside with the summit

[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.480]
and came upon the crowd gathered around Obama was planted by the Republican party.

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.060]
This would explain how conservative sides got stories posted about him and advanced to the debate

[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.160]
and how easily everybody else found him for interviews.

[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.860]
Wurzelbacher is not even a registered voter.

[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.040]
He may not be licensed in his home state of Ohio.

[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.860]
Wurzelbacher may be related to Robert Wurzelbacher since the radio

[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.360]
who happens to be Charles Keating's son-in-law.

[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.920]
Keating was implicated in the Keating 5 scandal along with John McCain.

[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.740]
Wurzelbacher already owns a few companies which would confident his claims of being a plumber looking to buy a small business.

[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.600]
One thing that is definitely on the record, Wurzelbacher compared Obama to Sammy Davis Jr. in interview with Katie Kourk.

[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.040]
I didn't know Obama could tap dance.

[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.180]
I know McCain can tap dance around the questions.

[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.880]
Well, he just wants to raise taxes and raise your taxes.

[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.740]
Just keeps saying the same crap over and over again.

[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.800]
And he's a terrorist and a schwarzer.

[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.960]
So as any of this true, I'm not sure it says, but some things are suspicious.

[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.980]
For instance, how was it that a newspaper was present when Joe was watching the debates?

[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.620]
They took the picture above if Joe didn't know his name would be mentioned.

[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.060]
I'm sure the national inquiries already had on Wurzelbacher's trail.

[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.000]
It says, so expect you a more on Joe the plumber soon.

[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.040]
In the meantime, I'd like to get Joe's number.

[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.980]
My bathroom faucet is leaking.

[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.160]
He's got a leak.

[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.340]
Now, cute.

[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.280]
So anyway, I'm on that site for what it's worth.

[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.160]
And yeah, that's everything she said it was.

[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.840]
Now can you play the songs off of there?

[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.520]
Yeah, you just go out of the mic.

[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.580]
Well, I've been cranking up from the 50s.

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.520]
Oh, what is that?

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.200]
Come on now.

[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.760]
Pops.

[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.680]
Oh, give me.

[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.820]
Give me a break.

[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.340]
It's a chick.

[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.100]
You might not like her.

[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.920]
Oh, I see.

[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:45.920]
That's right.

[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.800]
I hate women, I forgot.

[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.720]
It's my foolish heart.

[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.720]
Yeah, but it's...

[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.560]
Who is it?

[00:10:59.600 --> 00:10:59.880]
Patty Page.

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:00.820]
Who?

[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.520]
Patty Page.

[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.440]
Oh, Patty Page.

[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.260]
I'm like Patty Page on deck of records.

[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.980]
Oh, all this syrup, man.

[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.120]
Oh, what do you want?

[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.720]
If you're having waffles and pancakes,

[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.520]
you got all the syrup for it this morning.

[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.240]
You can click on hits by the week.

[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.740]
That was down 55.

[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:18.840]
What year are you in?

[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.880]
50?

[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.980]
Oh, that's too far, Pat.

[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.760]
Good night, Irene.

[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.020]
Irene.

[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.060]
Yeah, good night, Nurse.

[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.180]
Okay, play something from like 54 or 55.

[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.420]
Hang on.

[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.020]
I'm all over the place of a 50.

[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.620]
She's in the place of a...

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.120]
I'm all over the place of a...

[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.900]
54 or 55.

[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.040]
Yeah.

[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.040]
I don't know if it's...

[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:41.680]
All right, here we go.

[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.000]
55.

[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.560]
It doesn't look like it's giving me a choice,

[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.120]
although it does have a little search thing.

[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.540]
What do you mean by that?

[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.620]
Like, I mean, the middle of the...

[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.220]
I have to figure it out of you to get out.

[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:54.920]
That's 56.

[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.720]
That's 55 top bits off.

[00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.460]
Eighth on the shame.

[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.080]
Oh, what does that say?

[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.100]
55, let's hear it.

[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.320]
Imperial records, the fat man.

[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.260]
Antoine Fats Domino.

[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.300]
I just love the fat man.

[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.920]
You got to have heart.

[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.500]
And switch choices.

[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.380]
You got to have heart, but don't cut a fart.

[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.520]
Who was that?

[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.620]
I think it's all the same.

[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.760]
I'm not sure how it comes up yet by artist random selection.

[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.640]
Are these just some musical beds?

[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:27.560]
A lot of these...

[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:27.820]
No.

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.700]
A lot of these sites don't give you like exact control,

[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.240]
like just to play anything you want.

[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.580]
But you can break it down by genres or so.

[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.780]
You're playing so much syrup.

[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.500]
Yeah, well, that's not coming up.

[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:44.800]

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.680]
I'm not coming up.

[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.300]
I think I was down 100 points.

[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.460]
Oh, here's a little bit.

[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.220]
Now, wait a minute, Elvis.

[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.220]
That's what it gives you.

[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.360]
I don't click on a date.

[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.100]
It just throws you at an artist.

[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.280]
A lot of an artist at you.

[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.640]
Oh, it's got TV themes, though.

[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.760]
Such as...

[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:06.940]
Come on now.

[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.060]
Yeah.

[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.360]
That and all that.

[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.500]
All right, you know that one.

[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.560]
You know this one too.

[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.600]
For my favorites.

[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.520]
That was the song I'd be reaching.

[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160]
Dad Major.

[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.000]
Oh, sorry.

[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.720]
Oh, yeah.

who says so how come a mccain kept harping on William heirs obama didn't say

[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.460]
i was eight years old when he was involved in the anti war well he did say that

[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.980]

to get suckered of that through the dirt game

[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.220]

I got that time, I got that time, I got that time, I got that time.

[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.100]
Well, I've got some bad news about that market, Matt.

[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.180]
It's down to 203.

[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:45.680]
Wow.

[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:46.620]
200 point.

[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.060]
And yesterday lost 700 point.

[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:48.720]
I know.

[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.600]
Do the math.

[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.520]
I don't want to do the math.

[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.160]
Oh.

[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.380]
Well, that was those idiots.

[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.600]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.140]
You do that now.

[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.400]
That's another idiotic expression.

[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.540]
Do the math.

[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.380]
Warner says, McCain, not my friend.

[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.240]
Oh, actually, this is from Eric and Tamerack.

[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.600]
Who wants me to play a taste like a penny.

[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.540]
Oh, yeah, hold your breath.

[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.140]
Uh-huh.

[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.820]
He says, I'm sorry for what I'm about to tell you.

[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.120]
Every time I see McCain talk.

[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:16.700]
Yeah.

[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.280]
Every time I...

[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.100]
Well, this is...

[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.500]
Well, he's under a lot of pressure.

[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.140]
I say stress.

[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.040]
Every time I see McCain talk, this followers and calls them my friend, I think of you.

[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.120]
My friend, I'm your friend.

[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.300]
I've decided not to watch him anymore for as long as I shall live.

[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.000]
Since I have nothing we need to live for, would you please load a gun, put it in my face, and pull the trigger.

[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.860]
Your friend, Eric and Tamerack.

[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.400]
Please, this is the last request.

[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.220]
You do play an old bit for me that has something to do with...

[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.060]
Taste like a penny.

[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.300]
That has something to do with it.

[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.600]
Well, thank God you don't want us to play that because we sure know.

[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.660]
You can play this much.

[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.040]
Yeah.

[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.940]
Hey, how's Sarah doing?

[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:53.840]
Yeah.

[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.160]
That's all we're playing.

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.400]
Who had better handle the economy?

[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.600]
CNN, Polo, Obama, 59, McCain, 35%.

[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.480]
Oh, Jimmy Cifilis, by the way, is doing a poll or did one this morning in IOD.

[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.720]
Jimmy, right wing Cifilis, who sold his soul to the company's story.

[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.420]
Hey, Jimmy.

[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.100]
You fairy.

[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.140]
Jimmy, a break. That was down to 24.

[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.060]
Oh.

[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.000]
Here's Bill Schneider on CNN.

[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:14.520]
I don't know.

[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.780]
Well, they may be ready to vote because we asked them,

[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.320]
would you like to see more debates?

[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.780]
And by two to one, the vote is said,

[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.180]
Nope, we've seen about...

[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.600]
That was pretty boring again last night.

[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.640]
Not as boring as the second one, but it was pretty boring.

[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:27.780]
No, no.

[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:33.000]
I was waiting for McCain to get to waddle over and just try to smack Obama on the side of the head.

[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.400]
He didn't do it though.

[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.080]
No.

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.280]
I think he had the energy to do it.

[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.400]
In fact, at the end, remember when he was trying to like fake hands with what's his name?

[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:44.940]
No.

[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.560]
But he's a cheater.

[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:46.980]
Okay.

[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.340]
And he was like trying to find his way around the edge of the table.

[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.140]
And then he does all that exasperated stuff and like laughing and puking and like,

[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.100]
Oh, what a dottering old fool.

[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.680]
And believe me, I know what it is to be a dottering old fool.

[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.460]
Trust me.

[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.180]
I got a little experience myself and I'm no 72.

[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.680]
You've been dottering with me.

[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:04.380]
72? What?

[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.640]
You've been dottering lately?

[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.540]
I'm dottering.

[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.580]
How do you dotter?

[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.700]
I don't have no dotter.

[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.540]
You got two dotters.

[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:10.780]
Yes.

[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.680]
That might be dottering.

[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.480]
Daniel says James Carville was on CNN this morning and basically said Obama is a lock.

[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.860]
What a difference having Obama rather than carry your grow run and can't wait to later this week when that hockey mom gets

[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.700]
in Pester censored in Alaska.

[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.340]
PS the Nazi party is over.

[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.680]
Well, don't be too sure of that.

[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.000]
Yeah.

[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.440]
Maybe the current addition of the party is over, but they're never going to go away.

[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.280]
Well, you've a.

[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.460]
They're never going to throw in the towel.

[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.200]
Right now as we speak, I'm sure they're having all sorts of clandestine meetings.

[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.780]
The project for New American century and all these other far-bissen.

[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.500]
Believe you me, they're not going to go away easily and I keep thinking of that old bitch in Tamrak.

[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.860]
Well, he's not the same color as me.

[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.980]
I'm a little uncomfortable.

[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.260]
God makes me makes me for just a moment.

[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.200]
It makes me wish I never had any a kishki.

[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.540]
Might as well forget ever had it because I can't find any.

[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.880]
Now at 205 on the negative side.

[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.380]
Now 83 71.

[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.100]
Boy, if it gets under 8000, I think a lot of people are going to kill themselves.

[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.360]
Don't you?

[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.980]
I think what they ought to do.

[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.240]
Oh, it's one 99 negative.

[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:22.140]
What they ought to do is go to the headquarters of CNBC in New York and like just shoot all the people on the gambling channel.

[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.680]
And also hunt down like Ted David who used to be there.

[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.820]
Who used to call a show all the time and think it was a big joke.

[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.900]
Well, have you done your due diligence?

[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.500]
Oh, he was I mentioned Ted David was like a Jewish joe bell.

[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.260]
You know what I mean?

[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.060]
Yeah.

[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.500]
This one says forget all the polls that you are reading.

[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.560]
The most important polls on the cephalopage on the WIOD website were 64% say I don't believe the polls I think McCain is winning.

[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:58.960]
Hey, Jimmy, how does it feel to send your soul down the river for a few bucks to sell out to a bunch of right wing fascists at Clear Channel?

[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.600]
Oh, Jimmy, you are so tragic.

[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.880]
Jimmy's syphilis indeed.

[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.160]
The poll is over 1,000 to votes.

[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.340]
You were supposed to remind me, fat man.

[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.740]
Sorry.

[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.020]
You better show up tomorrow.

[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:12.720]
You want to know why?

[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.060]
Why?

[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.080]
Tomorrow is the book.

[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.520]
Oh, okay. I'll be here.

[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.300]
You don't care.

[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.660]
I said I'll be here.

[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.680]
You got that big bonus money hanging in the way.

[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.240]
That who won, huh?

[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.580]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.640]
This poll, what is the most tired movie premise?

[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.960]
Somebody emailed that to me this morning.

[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.560]
I think that who?

[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:28.980]
Who?

[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:29.600]
What a good idea.

[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.700]
Although the top one, reluctant buddies.

[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.780]
I don't know what that means.

[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.660]
Don't you?

[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:35.500]
No.

[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.280]
You know, their enemies are supposed to be enemies, but then over the course of the movie, they bond.

[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.920]
Because they have a common interest or goal.

[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.300]
They brought them together.

[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:43.840]
Yeah.

[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.480]
Now they're buddies.

[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.240]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.960]
Oh, like, um, talented Mr. Ripley.

[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.760]
Well, I guess it didn't work out too good.

[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.060]
Not butt buddies.

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:53.760]
Oh.

[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.560]
No, they were bad tub buddies.

[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.020]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.220]
Let's see, reluctant buddies, rubber touch switch, slasher kills teens.

[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.180]
Retard makes good.

[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.340]
Lo-lo-lo-ner cop has to do things his own way.

[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.220]
Cop has to get revenge for a partner.

[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.520]
Disease of the week.

[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.780]
Chick road movie.

[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.080]
Flesh eating zombies.

[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.540]
Yeah, I think that's what I'm voting for.

[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:14.340]
No way.

[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.760]
Triple overcoming handicap.

[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.080]
What?

[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.980]
I can't make enough flesh eating zombies.

[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.000]
Formless geek.

[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.660]
Wins the hot chick from a rich jock.

[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.860]
Underdog team beats powerhouse.

[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.140]
Little guy prevails against huge corporation.

[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.280]
Disaster flicks or depressing or self destruction.

[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.500]
I think that's what we're doing here at QAM, depressing self destruction.

[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.960]
So there's the pull for you.

[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:38.820]
The new one.

[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.520]
Here's the final result on the old one.

[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.440]
Is it even worse reading it?

[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:45.960]
I don't know.

[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.720]
I didn't like this one all that much.

[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.820]
I'll kill some time if you do.

[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.180]
Not too much time.

[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.800]
And I'm getting older by the second.

[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.660]
Thousand two votes when I feel old when a long time celebrity gets older dies 220.

[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.620]
Who died yesterday?

[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.920]
There were a couple of people who died.

[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.480]
Who died?

[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:01.800]
Who?

[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.140]
The guy who did the music for Batman Neil Hefty died.

[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.460]
He was 85.

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.020]
You know Batman.

[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.200]
Yeah, I want you to play it.

[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.920]
If you wanted honor and Neil Hefty, he's dead.

[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.180]
He was 85.

[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.920]
I don't know if you got the original one.

[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.360]
I got it.

[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.960]
I got all of that.

[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.040]
You got airs on.

[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.180]
To the Batman.

[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.060]
I go.

[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.600]
Potomac battery is the power.

[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:29.920]
Turbine is the speed.

[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:31.720]
Roger.

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.680]
Ready to go down.

[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.520]
He's alive.

[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:34.780]
He's alive.

[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.020]
He's alive.

[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:35.440]
He's alive.

[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:35.940]
He's alive.

[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:37.900]
He's alive.

[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:41.840]
He's alive.

[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:41.980]
He's alive.

[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.020]
He's alive.

[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.060]
He's alive.

[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:42.060]

[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:42.100]
He's alive.

[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:42.540]
Okay, that's enough.

[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.520]
I feel old when a long time celebrity gets older dies 220 like Neil Hefty.

[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.100]
I talked to young people 196.

[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.100]
I look in the mirror 185.

[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.860]
Talking about my favorite old movies music TV.

[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.160]
Thinking living in the past 163.

[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.060]
I remember when gas was under a bucket gallon 129.

[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.400]
I remember things from 50 years ago 75.

[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.620]
And I'm asked if I'm a senior citizen.

[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.500]
Hey old man, do you want the senior citizen discount?

[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.240]
34.

[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.160]
I do hate that.

[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.880]
I mean, I can afford to pay, you know, the extra nickel for the diet coke or whatever the hell it is.

[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.760]
I don't want to be asked if I want the senior diet coke.

[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.300]
I love it.

[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.580]
Yeah, by the way.

[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.220]
Do you?

[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.600]
Yeah, that's a stereotype.

[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.060]
It kind of took me a back.

[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.620]
First of all, I didn't know there was any such thing as a senior diet.

[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.300]
I can't wait for some, you know, like boys got to offer to help you across the street.

[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.580]
Well, a couple of years ago when you sent me those food clogs.

[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:34.880]
Yes.

[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.160]
Don't you remember I slipped on the ice?

[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.440]
Right.

[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.260]
That's why I sent them.

[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.660]
And the one guy helped me up.

[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.960]
I was like slipping and sliding.

[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.960]
Splashing and splashing with Bobby Daring.

[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.220]
He's still dead by the way here.

[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.280]
And I keep thinking he had a bad booze problem.

[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:54.380]
But I saw my biography and wasn't, was it him that had it or Sandra D and somebody had a bad, a head mumbling.

[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.540]
Please, please, splash.

[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.840]
I was taking them back.

[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.820]
I'm not going to be able to go in there.

[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.080]
Maybe we're taking a bath in Champagne.

[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.080]
What do you think?

[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:03.680]
No.

[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.680]
So Joe, the plumber is going to be our guest at 11.

[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.620]
What is that?

[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.520]
Slip slide in the way.

[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.540]
By Clarence Clark.

[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.100]
Slip slide in the way.

[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.900]
Oh, by Paul Slant.

[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:23.440]
Like this.

[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.240]
Slip slide in the way.

[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.980]
What's the one by, uh, I'm thinking of Clarence Carter.

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.980]
One of Eddie K's old theme songs.

[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.680]
Well, somebody will know.

[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.980]
1041 or QAM.

[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.720]
What biggest name?

[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:36.880]
The best talent.

[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.840]
Little white.

[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.560]
Oh, 560 KAM.

[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.100]
I think.

[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.600]
For it's the biggest name.

[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.060]
The best talent.

[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.120]
It's the mad dog.

[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:46.960]
Jim Mandit.

[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:47.740]
Half-a-round.

[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:48.360]
Four to seven.

[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.260]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh not.

[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.880]
You are the sports leader.

[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.340]
Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again.

[00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.140]
Ever?

[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.140]
Steamy.

[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.400]
And I'm the big bitch.

[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.900]
What's that stand for?

[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.020]
orgasm?

[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.500]
No, that's just short for Orlando Blue.

[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.700]
You don't look, Julie.

[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.380]
No, no.

[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.560]
You got a lot.

[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:12.780]
No.

[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.740]
Now Neil's going to ri-dee for 4 hours.

[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.440]
Well, I've been asked to keep this in strict confidence.

[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.880]
But in case you wonder why we're here,

[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.580]
Joe got suspended, Joe got suspended!

[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.300]
Mwah!

[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:24.720]
Mwah!

[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.700]
Maybe we should take this call from our special guest, Roberto L'Oongo.

[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.060]
Hi, you're a boy, though.

[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.560]
You know that I'm the voice of the Pantas now?

[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.120]
Yes, aren't you that squeaky voice guy that goes by all the time?

[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:37.780]
Oh!

[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.880]
You got me confused with a character on another show.

[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.120]
That's not me.

[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.320]
I have children now.

[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.160]
Doi doi doi.

[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.280]
You have a funny name.

[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.040]
What did you...

[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.360]
What did you...

[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.120]
What did you...

[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:50.860]
Doi and play!

[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:51.940]
Doi doi doi!

[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.340]
We can't get into that right now.

[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.160]
Do the music!

[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.320]
Do the music!

[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:57.460]
Hey, Joe!

[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.200]
I don't want you walking out of there,

[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.720]
but just thinking in here.

[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.380]
I'm going to walk out of that.

[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.140]
Come here!

[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.020]
I'll ride you, Joe.

[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.460]
I'm going to crash here if I'd like to meet up.

[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.120]
Mwah!

[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.040]
Mwah!

[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.880]
Oh, I love that Keeldi, man.

[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.140]
Can't get enough of him.

[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.560]
Let's get him back on there from two to four,

[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.180]
and give the big OO the rest of the year off.

[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.300]
Somebody else died.

[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.060]
I'd tell you, when they die, they die in clumps.

[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.380]
Yeah, well...

[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.460]
How would you do it?

[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.180]
Edie Adams is dead.

[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:29.940]
Get out.

[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.740]
Broadway's original Vazy May, 81.

[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.680]
Does that hurt?

[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.000]
No.

[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.760]
I was going to say...

[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.280]
That's the thing for when he co-bags you,

[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.200]
and then we'll be true.

[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.060]
Wait before your time.

[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.540]
He was great.

[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.600]
He was a genius, a real TV pioneer,

[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.900]
and then he died in a car crash.

[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.780]
Edie Adams, a multi-talented actress

[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.960]
who put her shapely figure,

[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.320]
comic instincts, and clear,

[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.680]
Juilliard trained singing voice to good use

[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.560]
by creating the roles of Eileen Sherwood

[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.840]
in wonderful towns and Vazy May,

[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.260]
died October 15 in the West Hills section of Los Angeles.

[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.520]
October 15, that's yesterday.

[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.100]
She was 81 lived in LA.

[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.620]
The cause was Panamonia and Cancer, said her son.

[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.060]
Well, that's a bad combination.

[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.840]
I mean, one or the other is not all that good,

[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.420]
but Panamonia and Cancer?

[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.280]
And the guy that sent this to me says,

[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.620]
Ernie Kobach's was a genius.

[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.840]
Edie Adams was not.

[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.520]
She must have given her great...

[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:30.640]
...job...

[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:30.640]

[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.720]
Maybe some three-sums, and...

[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.480]
Oh, this is terrible.

[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.460]
Anyway, she's dead.

[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.900]
That's bad wine, don't you?

[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.560]
Not too late to get in on that.

[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.240]
No, no, no.

[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.680]
Boy, three ways and ask to ask and all this other stuff.

[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.520]
Ernie Kobach was a genius.

[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.540]
That was the Nairobi trio, the little monkeys.

[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.240]
Don't remember that?

[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:46.780]
Sure.

[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:47.900]
You see in the video?

[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:48.380]
Absolutely.

[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:49.120]
I have it.

[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.280]
You got it?

[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:50.760]
I own it.

[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.820]
That's what the senator said to a guy called a fool.

[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.240]
They have a science statement from...

[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:02.660]
Well, I have it.

[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.440]
I have it.

[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.860]
How about that?

[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:07.660]
Yep.

[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.660]
I have a science statement from this man saying...

[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.620]
I can say the Bible quality only did this.

[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.320]
And the Bible quality only did that.

[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.680]
So I said, yeah.

[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:26.980]
Yeah, sure.

[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:27.540]
Sure.

[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.720]
Anyway, she also did the White Alola cigar spots after he died

[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.140]
in order to make money to pay the bills.

[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.500]
Did you know that?

[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:35.800]
Nope.

[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.360]
I don't want to come up and see me sometime.

[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.420]
That was her?

[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.060]
Yeah.

[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.500]
I thought that was Maywest.

[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.840]
Well, that was before.

[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.580]
I mean, that was the whole idea.

[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.900]
They stole the...

[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:46.220]
I see.

[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.100]
...from Maywest to the...

[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:47.900]
Oh, she's ugly.

[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:49.540]
Idiotoms.

[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:49.940]
Maywest.

[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.560]
And Maywest.

[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.080]
Yes, both.

[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:51.920]
I don't know about ED.

[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:53.160]
Trust me.

[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:53.640]
All right.

[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.200]
That was down 174 points.

[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.680]
Oh, boy, I'm on the edge of my seat.

[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.280]
I don't even have any stock and I'm getting nervous.

[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.300]
I have no idea why.

[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.640]
Just not good.

[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.280]
Michael, a really chronic regular...

[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.620]
And when I call you a chronic emailer,

[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.280]
don't let that discourage you, folks.

[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.560]
Keep the emails coming.

[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.000]
That was an email I just had there right now about ED and I was

[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.680]
we never would have known.

[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.560]
And you'll have to, and then some rock guy died yesterday too.

[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.280]
Some 39-year-old rock...

[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.600]
Some singer.

[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.120]
From some group I never heard of because I'm an old fart.

[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.460]
And you don't even know who it is, do you?

[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:28.880]
Nope.

[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:29.980]
Well, here you go.

[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.620]
Way behind the time is, man, you're losing touch.

[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.460]
It says Obama was great as usual, smart enough not to engage in

[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.800]
the tit for tat with McCain.

[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.280]
He said that last night, Obama, do you see that?

[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.140]
He said tit for tat.

[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.860]
Yeah, I wanted to record that so that I could, you know,

[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.620]
play it as a drop.

[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:48.580]
Not.

[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.960]
I still think the Republicans will steal it, Michael, says,

[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.580]
I hope you're correct that it's not close enough.

[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.180]
I won't sleep well until it's really over.

[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.100]
Now, if not close enough to steal, they'd have to steal like 20

[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.040]
states, you know, not going to happen.

[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.840]
Unless we have a real October surprise, like the one guy on

[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.200]
Capitol Hill, blue keeps writing about how McCain is going to

[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.660]
fly the plane and Sarah is going to shoot down, or some have been

[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.640]
loud and just before the election, he's going to shoot his ass and

[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:11.960]
kill him.

[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.440]
How do you think those Hillary voters caught the McCain's

[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.480]
flippant remarks about the health of the woman exception

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.000]
on abortion?

[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.020]
I think McCain really showed his ass to the world on that one.

[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.300]
He said,

[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.720]
the more they showed McCain and his idiosyncrasies, the more

[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.500]
I'm convinced I am.

[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.300]
He's an absolute madman.

[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.820]
He is a madman.

[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:28.840]
He's insane McCain.

[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.400]
He's a nut job with a big, puffy cheek.

[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.860]
And I got news for Joe the plumber.

[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.880]
I think he spent too much time cleaning out septic things.

[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.180]
Maybe the fumes are getting to him.

[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.520]
But if you can't afford to buy your business because it's

[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.860]
going to put you in a higher tax bracket, maybe you don't know

[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.720]
jack about business.

[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.420]
I never heard anything more ridiculous.

[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.240]
Paying more taxes comes with a territory of making more money,

[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:48.960]
as you well know.

[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:49.280]
Yes.

[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.740]
And by the way, why does he need to buy the business?

[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.980]
It's a friggin plumbing business.

[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.040]
Joe, for Pete's sake, just open your own company.

[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.400]
He's already got several companies like I read before.

[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.340]
He's a plant.

[00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.420]
He's a total fraud.

[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.600]
It's not like there's any secret formula

[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.540]
or proprietary information at the old business head.

[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.380]
It's plumbing.

[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.020]
Joe, get a license and cooperate and you go, Joe.

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.160]
He don't have a license in Ohio, said that story.

[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.800]
To go a plummet out.

[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.880]
To get the old plunger.

[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.420]
37 votes on our new poll.

[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.480]
I think we can go over a thousand today.

[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.680]
I think so too.

[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:24.900]
Well, we already are.

[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:25.720]
Exactly.

[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.360]
How did that happen?

[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:29.800]
What do you mean?

[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.080]
Just what I'm saying, how do we have so many on yesterday's poll?

[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.260]
That was put on during the show.

[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.500]
Yeah, that's why we cheated again.

[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.260]
I cheated.

[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.800]
Not your, Joe doesn't cheat with the poll.

[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.880]
That's because you don't care about it.

[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:41.540]
That's right.

[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.080]
You don't care about anything.

[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.380]
You have getting paid and getting laid.

[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:44.980]
That's it.

[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:45.680]
That's it.

[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.160]
Actually in that order, yes.

[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.820]
Bill, your mug-wump friend from Clearwater Beach says,

[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.360]
not your who is responsible for putting your picture on the website,

[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.500]
but I haven't stopped laughing since 10 a.m.

[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.480]
I think you look much better now, since Bill.

[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.460]
Yes, I do, Bill.

[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.200]
That's the whole idea.

[00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.880]
That's why I put it on there.

[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.740]
And maybe you may be that offer a little bit of hope.

[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.880]
I got through one day yesterday to need too much.

[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.580]
You can mark it down.

[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.940]
Mark it on a calendar back there, fatso 190.

[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:11.360]
Okay.

[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.920]
Mark it on Thursday, October 16, 190.

[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.560]
I know we've done this a million times,

[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.640]
and I always start pretty good, and then, you know,

[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.720]
like all other fat people, like decide I want to eat.

[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.400]
I want to eat.

[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.500]
I want to eat.

[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.980]
That's so wrong.

[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.380]
You get it on there 190?

[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.400]
Yeah, today is National Ball State, too.

[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.580]
National what now?

[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.420]
Ball day?

[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.280]
National Shoot Your Ball State.

[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.040]
Oh, right.

[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.180]
I'm coming right down.

[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.140]
Now this is really interesting.

[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.180]
Not real interesting.

[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.220]
It's about another dead person.

[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.140]
Now came in right at the ass end of the show yesterday.

[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.180]
Jim in Getzville, New York, who's chronic.

[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.240]
What's your story, Jim?

[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.040]
I have no life.

[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.280]
Oh.

[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.480]
He says, I understand Frank lefty Rosenthal passed away recently in Miami.

[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.560]
From what I've read, he was quite a character, and one hell of a handicap.

[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.680]
Or, Neil, do you have any comment on Mr. Rosenthal?

[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.440]
Keep up the good work.

[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.360]
Jim in the Getzville.

[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.740]
Do I have any comment?

[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.460]
Well, do you?

[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:13.100]
Now, right before that came in from Jim from Getzville, came this one.

[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.120]
Casino operator was known as country's top sports handicraft.

[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.660]
And guess who wrote it for the herald?

[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.720]
I don't know, Ellie Brusher.

[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:22.400]
Right.

[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.920]
Lisa Davis says great experience in selling and approved medications.

[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.180]
Oh, my crackberry.

[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.040]
So tired of that stuff.

[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.360]
Oh, we got Seattle.

[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.380]
Us we got Viagra.

[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.200]
We got Viagra.

[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:32.880]
We got Seattle.

[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.880]
Us we got LaVitra.

[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.160]
Oh, my God.

[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.660]
Now, do you get as many of those as either?

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.180]
I get at least five million of them every day.

[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:40.340]
Yep.

[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.300]
That was down 166.

[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:48.380]
Anyway, Eleanor Brusher, who I guess he's really graduated now, she gets to write about dead people.

[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.000]
Like Swifty Schindler.

[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:50.440]
Remember that?

[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:51.060]
Okay.

[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:57.660]
Sports illustrator once called Frank Lary, Lefty Rosenthal, the bookmaker and Vegas casino operator played by Robert De Niro in the film Casino.

[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.540]
The greatest living sports handicapper.

[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:06.160]
He got his nickname in 61 after plitting the fifth amendment in 38 times before a Senate subcommittee investigating organized crime.

[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.460]
Among other things he refused to say whether he was left or right handed.

[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.340]
Oh, that's another thing.

[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.580]
You notice that McCain is left handed?

[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:12.900]
No, it did not.

[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:13.620]
They both are, I think.

[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.460]
He did the same thing last night.

[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.440]
They did the previous debate.

[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:23.240]
And that is before when Bob Schiefel was still a talking, he sat down in the chair and he grabbed that grease pen man at Magic Marker.

[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.680]
And he was already writing stuff down.

[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.120]
Like, my name is John McCain, Niro like that.

[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.320]
The next year he asked a mommy, Harold reporter.

[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.360]
This is Lefty Rosenthal.

[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.300]
So what if I'm a gambler?

[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.720]
There's no log against that.

[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.060]
There's a log against bookmaking.

[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.000]
But I'm not a bookmaker.

[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.280]
I'm a professional handicapper.

[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.120]
I'm the greatest.

[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.040]
Rosenthal died Monday, reportedly of a heart attack.

[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.320]
It is the apartment they found him lose luxury, treasure tower in Miami Beach.

[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.160]
He was 79.

[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.520]
Not so old.

[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:47.760]
79.

[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.700]
Maybe the Lord was punishing him.

[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.840]
Like the Lord was punishing Dick Teenie yesterday by making his heart flutter.

[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.060]
Rosenthal, real name Norman Lewis Rosenthal.

[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:57.580]
Oy!

[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.160]
Posted the website, Frankrosenthal.com.

[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.200]
Nicholas Pilegi, who wrote the book from which Martin Scorsese Casino was adopted, says.

[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:09.600]
That for most of his professional life, the Chicago born in Casino bread, Rosenthal, has been the country's top handicapper.

[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.520]
He was one of a handful of men who literally set the line for thousands of bookmakers from coast to coast.

[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:20.420]
During the 70s and early 80s, Rosenthal ran four Vegas Casino simultaneously, including the world famous Star Dust.

[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:26.480]
Rosenthal is also credited with creating the first race in sportsbow parlor in Vegas that was copied by every casino on the strip.

[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:32.020]
In addition to running the Fremont, Hossie ended Marina Casino's for a financier Alan Glix,

[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:33.780]
Argent Corporation.

[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:39.340]
Rosenthal hosted a live from the Star Dust TV show, where it comes for the Vegas Sun and Las Vegas Valley Times newspapers.

[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:46.260]
In a mommy-healed interview earlier this year, Rosenthal said Sam Ace Rothstein, the hero's character of the 95 film, was accurate,

[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.080]
even the part about having a crooked blackjack player's hand smashed with the rubber hammer.

[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.740]
The card player in his core hurts had raped the strip's casinos over a period of time he said,

[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.800]
and the hence we played hardball sending their entire crew a message.

[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:02.100]
Sent him a message like Joey Zaza, gonna send me a message?

[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.600]
Fighting a gaming commission band from Vegas Casino's Rosenthal hired lawyer Oscar Goodman, now the city's mayor.

[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.900]
Goodman told reporters Wednesday that Rosenthal was a tough taskmaster and a perfectionist.

[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.220]
He was meticulous in everything he did.

[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.940]
And in honor of lefty Rosenthal, I'm going to woodbine it to a clock.

[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.580]
How do you like that?

[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:48.880]
The best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the best talent, the

[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:18.860]
Most Cosmic Millionaire, the mostulous Millionaire, that the most existens, the most talents jednaks, the most amazing mentality, takes a lot of life behind them, but with and prayers they and their

[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.700]
You can swear.

[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:51.220]
You can fight, man.

[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.880]
Mother with conflict pain is supposed to play.

[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.800]
Ooh, the bell's down scanner's in twenty-nine points.

[00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.180]
Hey.

[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.480]
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.360]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, boy.

[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.760]
But who cares, right?

[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:06.180]
Right.

[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.860]
I've been telling these people for a long time.

[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.160]
Don't be a sucker and get suckered in the stock market.

[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.300]
You think you're investing in your gambling.

[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:12.840]
Great.

[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.200]
See, when I got into it I thought it was like investing,

[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.540]
I really believe that, because I'm stupid.

[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.280]
as Mo would say I'm stupid. So who needs a Joe the plumber when we've got time the carpenter?

[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:30.100]
We do. We do. On the email. Yeah we do. All right. It doesn't like you. Oh gee. And you don't like him either he's the one that was a bugging you while you'll know who it is.

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:40.100]
Question I'll be voting early on October 20th for I'll be out of town November 4th. Do they count the early votes and get that out to the public before 10 4 so we can get a feel who's voting for whom? No they don't.

[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:46.180]
I mean wouldn't that be something if they started counting the ballots before election day and then they started saying yeah.

[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:55.360]
Oh well this one's ahead by you know I mean no they don't. Also tell that slipper George that I don't I do not have a well on my puter.

[00:49:55.380 --> 00:50:02.200]
I've high speed DSL with Firefox all the bells and whistles and still can't vote on your site or listen. Thanks for the help George not.

[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:13.040]
Go Obama Tom the carpenter. Oh gee my peruse Tom the party was only just Tom before today but now he's somebody else contacted me with a similar problem and they had a well so I thought it was him.

[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:20.680]
Yeah my deepest apologies. Another dead person boy you know something between the stock market and all these dead people I don't know I don't think I can continue.

[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.860]
Although you know I've lost a flame finally it does sound like that. Oh yeah it's gone once it's gone hopefully it's gone.

[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:35.860]
And today is Thursday so it means we got our two for one deal coming up less than an hour away and you got food coming in boy like I said what a great day.

[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:43.140]
A lot of dead people make me very sad when decent people die I think only nasty people should die.

[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:55.360]
Nasty means if a hostile people like Jolly Joe Bell for example would that be great if he opened up the door again which he seems to be doing a lot lately and you heard him squeal out.

[00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:02.460]
I'm dying out of the hands. That would be great. I've heard you Chris would like kick the body out of the hall roll it out there like a bowling ball.

[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:15.340]
Somebody's dead and either one of you are going to know who it is. Tom Tresch who former New York Yankee dead at 71 and it was a arbitrary tiger too.

[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:28.480]
I don't know Tommy Tresch. No. First time the big league scene in 1962 when working the year honors as a fill in shortstop for the Yankees after Tony Kubak was called in a military service died of a heart attack yesterday he was 71.

[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:46.760]
Message from Senator Tom Tresch was on the Yankees back when you rooted for them I think yes we're all going to die soon some sooner than others meet for us as oh and look who who allegedly sent this master agent Saul Fouce cute but it's S.O.L.

[00:51:46.760 --> 00:52:02.520]
and the real Saul Fouce was S.A.U.L. Saul I know he was my agent and the worst thing that ever happened is that he tried to rip all those people off and went to the slammer because if he would continue to be my agent I'd have been a contender baby but now I got Norma can't you know pop had Saul I got Norma.

[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:10.300]
So just inspired by that email and by Tom Tresch's death I googled agent Saul Fouce.

[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:18.340]
Yeah and here's just a short blurb from an article in the Chicago Sun Times dated December 30th 1993.

[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:27.640]
So Fouce used to spend his days negotiating million dollar deals for summer broadcasting's biggest stars and advising them on career moves and investment opportunities.

[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:35.820]
But that was before Chicago's highest flying attorney agent was forced into involuntary bankruptcy and became target of a federal investigation into his business practices.

[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:42.140]
Now Fouce spends most of his days dodging phone calls and shutling between visits to his lawyers and the US attorney.

[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.520]
Oh this is before he went to jail.

[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.180]
There is no light at the end of the tunnel Fouce told a friend the other day the parties over.

[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:57.280]
For weeks pressure reports have been describing ways in which Fouce allegedly misused the funds of his clients and deals that blank by and then it says read all this article with a free trial.

[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.440]
I don't want a free trial.

[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:01.260]
I don't want the right wing Chicago Sun Times.

[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.740]
Was that the tribute or both of them?

[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.740]
I don't know about the Sun Times. I don't know the Chicago Tribune.

[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:17.260]
It was owned by the, it was owned by the, uh, really people by the Cubs who spend more time attacking his opponents of debate watchers 80% said McCain 7% Obama attacking.

[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.160]
Bad, I'll kill this bad, Schwarzer bad.

[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.400]
You know all this stuff.

[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:22.980]
Not good.

[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.100]
So Saul Fouce was a notorious.

[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.000]
I wonder if he's still alive.

[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.720]
Who better handle the economy Obama 59% McCain 35.

[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.880]
And the Dow is on 311.

[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.000]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.220]
We continue being off tourist and spread of all these bailout plans.

[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.420]
What else going to take time for these to kick in for us to get the money?

[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:43.760]
Uh-huh.

[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.180]
Now let's see you're getting 350 billion.

[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:46.880]
I'm getting what?

[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.400]
What are you laughing about?

[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:52.720]
I don't think we do better with this than the freaking government.

[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.640]
There there's no question.

[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.880]
God I'd have a hell of a time man.

[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.900]
You sure see me again.

[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.660]
Of course I don't think you'll ever see me again anyhow.

[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.020]
Of course I said that before.

[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:04.600]
And then we had the Gulf Stream appearance.

[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.360]
You think we'll ever do that again?

[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.500]
I hope so.

[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.420]
We had a good time.

[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:10.860]
Sure.

[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.660]
Fat boy over there he ate all the food in the damn buffet.

[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:15.480]
Really?

[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:16.580]
Yeah you did.

[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.640]
I guess good thing for you I didn't eat the, uh, the, uh, the Cubs of ice cream.

[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.340]
Oh yeah.

[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:20.620]
Cubs.

[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.480]
I think that was not like a little monkey there by the ice creamer.

[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.260]
I just dreamed that.

[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:26.880]
I don't know how to go over there.

[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.240]
I know that the chef there, the ice cream, he had to scoop it out for it.

[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.600]
And I guess I went over there like a little bit late after everybody else had.

[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:39.000]
And he was a little bit put out over the fact I was disturbing him from watching.

[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.500]
Oh big brown is retired by the way.

[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:40.920]
Did you see that?

[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:41.340]
Yes.

[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.940]
Yeah another minor injury and big brown is going down.

[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.700]
He's not going down but he's done.

[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.380]
He's finito.

[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.840]
We'll never know what really happened.

[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.080]
I'm at Faithful Bel Monte.

[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.560]
Rick Dutro.

[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.640]
Really very shady character.

[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:57.120]
I wonder what left you Rosenthal would think about Rick Dutro.

[00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.060]
Trainer of Big Brown.

[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.520]
David says in looking at your picture two words hateful sal.

[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.380]
I love it.

[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:09.800]
Woo.

[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.420]
On the pole how about poor underprivileged black kid rises up and learns to pick one.

[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.060]
Dance ballet.

[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.320]
Play the cello play chess.

[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.540]
Swim when the highs minute set where you get the picture.

[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.880]

Tony I'm getting a lot of.

[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:57.380]
Hey Ali.

[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:02.700]
He's right now and the topics tend to still be connected to what the government is doing.

[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.080]
About this bailout.

[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.000]
How about the bailout and back and forth.

[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.720]
Oh Tony Harris and Ali Feltz.

[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.720]
And what a combo that is.

[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.800]
You think my picture is bad.

[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:12.220]
The thou is down three hundred and forty points.

[00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:16.540]
That means over a thousand points between yesterday and today.

[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.180]
And all these people had jumped back.

[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.660]
You know it's a buying opportunity.

[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:21.980]
Maria Bartiromo.

[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.160]

[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:31.080]
So maybe the heavy pancake make up a war on some of it last.

[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.160]

[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.320]
Oh you're so lovely today Maria.

[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.480]

She says good morning and watching last night debate.

[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.960]
Many things struck me about John McCain.

[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.720]
His incestant eye blinking.

[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:45.580]
Was he sending coded messages to someone.

[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:48.460]
His constipated teeth gritting when he smiled or talked.

[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.500]
And his rude and childish interrupting of Obama on many occasions.

[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:55.120]
But the most appalling moment of all was when he demeaned and be little women.

[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:59.140]
By using finger quotation marks in regard to women's health issues.

[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.060]
Health and issues of abortion.

[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.300]
Anything well in this country would even consider voting for this man.

[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:07.420]
And a stepper wife of a running mate should turn in their woman card immediately.

[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.080]
Have an ice day.

[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:08.660]
You too Holly.

[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.880]
Have a wonderful day and a great life.

[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.840]

[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:24.520]
Dead.

[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.760]
Should we take a look at the poll?

[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.460]
Please do.

[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.900]
Before we take the break.

[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.520]
345 on the downside.

[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:34.460]
I'm going to keep you posted all day because there are a lot of you waiting to kill yourself.

[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.320]
Well look at all the damn emails on there.

[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:36.620]
Wow.

[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:38.820]
Just a zillion of them.

[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.360]
Chuck says, how do you like McCain's reaction when Obama said there would be a zero fine?

[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.000]
I thought McCain was going to jump out of the chair and launch into space.

[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.020]
And evidently he didn't hear it though.

[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.680]
I didn't remember it because I'm going to leave him.

[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.900]
He repeated the same thing about the joke.

[00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.180]
Joe the plumbers fine.

[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.640]
I liked also when Obama called him out on his supporters at the rally saying horrible things about.

[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.380]
And not doing much about it.

[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:00.600]
Thanks Chuck.

[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:05.420]
One or more active ex-controls could not be displayed.

[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.660]
It says here on my computer.

[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.620]
Better call up Tom the plumber.

[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.720]
Tom the carpenter and see what that's all about.

[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.040]
The biggest name.

[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.200]
The best talent.

[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.780]
You don't hear no rejects.

[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.840]

The sports leader.

We start on this theme and I'm going to wrap it all year long.

[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:29.180]
Barack Obama believes kindergarteners should be taught about sex.

[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.900]
I'm John McCain and I approve this message.

[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.900]

I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.

[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.200]
Barack Obama wants to force you to have an abortion.

[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.360]
Even if you don't want to and the abortion will be performed by a terrorist.

[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.160]
On an American flag.

[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.820]
I'm John McCain and I approve this message.

[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:53.000]
John McCain wants to force you to have babies.

[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.200]
Even if you're a man and the penalty for having an abortion will be death.

[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.840]
I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.

[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:05.180]

[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:06.360]

[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.040]
He's going to die in office.

Will make you eat mousse.

[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.900]
What do you mean mousse?

[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:26.640]
Yes.

[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:27.500]
Mousse.

[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.660]
You really think people are going to believe that?

[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:29.960]
Yes.

[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.140]

[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.280]
Oh, there's Joe Deplummer again.

[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:37.860]
It ends.

[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.040]
Solidad O'Brien.

[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:41.220]
You don't look like Solidad O'Brien.

[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.100]
Hey, Solidad.

[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.920]
She is so intellectual, man.

[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.860]
It just really cracks me up between her and Ricky Tiki's samshares.

[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.740]
And you wonder why the public are like.

[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:50.800]

I don't know.

[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:56.840]
Is this a good poll or not?

[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.860]
That's all right.

[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:00.880]
It's out of word.

[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:01.780]
We never done it.

[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.200]
I don't think.

[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:02.380]
No.

[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.580]
You know what show is making the rounds here on screen TV?

[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.660]
It's supernatural.

[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.760]
They're showing all the reruns again.

[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.340]
Oh my god.

[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.680]
And you know who hated that show?

[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:27.840]
It was important.

[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.180]
Oh, and you keep forgetting to remind me to send him that show.

[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:30.900]
Oh, well.

[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.900]
Maybe I'll make it out during the show today.

[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.600]
And I'll put it in the mail on the way to Woodbuy.

[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.240]
No, you won't.

[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.560]
Just to show the world that you're full of crap, I'm going to do it.

[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:42.920]
Okay.

[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.280]
Retard makes good five.

[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:45.780]
Oh, there you go.

[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:46.680]
I was speaking of you.

[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.980]
Reluctant buddies five.

[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.540]
Flesh eating zombies three.

[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.540]
Yeah, he hated that show because he couldn't understand why the two brothers slept in the same hotel room.

[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.400]
Maybe they were on a tight budget.

[01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.220]
Or maybe they were really tight.

[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.860]
At least I slept in two different beds.

[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.280]
Remember that when he used to get all bent out of shape about that?

[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.400]
I think his sexual identity became very, very confused when he'd watch that show.

[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.560]
Two hot-looking brothers.

[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:14.740]
Yeah.

[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.880]
I hope he listened to that.

[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.680]
Yeah, I do too.

[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.080]
Hey, he better watch his response though, because I'm getting ready to send that check.

[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.880]
Flesh eating zombies three, chick road movie three, depressing self-destruction two.

[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:31.380]
Kind of like, I guess, Requiem would be called a category, right?

[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.920]
Depressing self-destruction.

[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.080]
All around.

[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.380]
Look at that arm.

[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.200]
Oh, my God.

[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:41.300]
Little guy prevails against huge corporation two.

[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.200]
Cripple overcoming handicap two.

[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.520]
Disease of the week two and body switch two.

[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.300]
Oh, now did you, uh, you got a Google that that Ray Milan movie?

[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.920]
The man with two heads or the thing with two heads?

[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.040]
Why?

[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:55.180]
Because I want you.

[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.580]
Maybe I'll send you a copy of it.

[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:58.460]
Okay.

[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.120]
And I'll guarantee you'll get that as opposed to that damn book.

[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.020]
I was supposed to get that.

[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:02.380]
Oh, I know.

[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.560]
Don't be sending me nothing for that birthday.

[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.500]
Now it's coming up soon.

[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.620]
Today is the let's see.

[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:13.800]
So if the election is three weeks mind less two days, so my birthday is three weeks less one day.

[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:18.180]
Yeah.

[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.620]
Three weeks from yesterday.

[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:21.980]
November five.

[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.960]
Cash will be accepted by the way sent bags.

[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.760]
So do you ever figure out what this damn chip, this thing is that I got in the mail?

[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.300]
No.

[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.300]
I thought it was going to explode or something.

[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:34.660]
I don't know.

[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.440]
There wasn't any like literature with a no, there was nothing in it.

[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.080]
That's why it's mysterious bizarre.

[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.760]
It's just a little plastic case.

[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.780]
It came in a in a manila small manila envelope.

[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:47.780]
Uh-huh.

[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.580]
In fact, it was a manila envelope and it was another manila envelope inside of the smaller one.

[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:56.880]
I opened that up and there's just a little plastic case and it says sand disk adapter.

[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.400]
And you snap it open and it's got a little thing.

[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.400]
Let's see if I can read it.

[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.520]
Yeah, is it to turn a micro into a?

[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:10.680]
Sand disk 8GB micro something micro.

[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.940]
That's I ordered an 8GB thing not an adapter though.

[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.840]
Well, they say the wrong thing then.

[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.400]
So it says 8GB is not an adapter.

[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.240]
Well, why don't you send it to me?

[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.460]
What are you going to do with it?

[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.860]
If it's not the right thing, I'll send it back to where it came from, but it might be my thing.

[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.060]
It's an adapter.

[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.420]
It says adapter right on it.

[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.760]
You see you need to order a chip.

[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.660]
But if it says 8GB, that's not an adapter.

[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.460]
It might be an adapter with a chip.

[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.460]
Oh, let me open it again.

[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.280]
All right.

[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:45.540]
Okay.

[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.800]
Now, first of all, oh, I see you're right.

[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:49.400]
You're right.

[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:49.900]
You're right.

[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:50.700]
When you're right, you're right.

[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.380]
When you're wrong, I have to send this to you.

[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.900]
I didn't realize that.

[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.400]
I thought that was just like a label on the thing, but it comes out of there.

[01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.580]
The thing that says 8GB.

[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.020]
Yeah, that's the chip thing.

[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:01.380]
That's my chip.

[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.820]
And the other thing is the adapter.

[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:03.900]
Woo!

[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.040]
Oh, this must be.

[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.560]
And how much are you going to pay me to send this?

[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:07.900]
I don't know.

[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:08.720]
Eight bucks.

[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.220]
How much is the $8,000?

[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:10.900]
Sure.

[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.760]
Well, the $1,000 that then, in fact, I'll say you could just turn the $1,000 over to quarters.

[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.320]
Now, I'm going to have to get the same envelope as that.

[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.220]
You know what I'm going to do?

[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.000]
You're filled for like 30 seconds.

[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.960]
I'm going to go give me an envelope and I'm going to get my checkbook.

[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.580]
And I'm going to write this check in a couple of stamps.

[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.540]
That's right.

[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:30.000]
I'm going to write it out right here just as quite fat stuff here.

[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.280]
I'll do that.

[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.160]
I'll wait for that food by the way.

[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.420]
And there's still nine certificates for a notebook.

[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.140]
I'm in the wine.

[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.480]
I'm still embarrassed.

[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.440]
Just talking to Catherine this morning.

[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.800]
What would I want back?

[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:49.480]
We're all going back.

[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:50.660]
Yep.

[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:51.820]
That's great.

[01:05:54.820 --> 01:06:00.500]
Tell me you would try to slip away somehow.

[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.360]
Oh, I need you.

[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:05.880]
Eight bucks.

[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.080]
Oops.

[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.600]
I want to see your answer.

[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.180]
Good luck, John.

[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.120]
Okay, I got my two stamps on the envelope.

[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:12.500]
All right.

[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.220]
Two Canadian stamps because it's going to the USA.

[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.300]
In fact, let me write that right here on the bottom.

[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:17.600]
USA.

[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:17.800]
USA.

[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:18.200]
USA.

[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:19.120]

[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.460]
I feel so much more macho now.

[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.080]
I'm hurt.

[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.820]
And I got the stamps on there kind of cut guide.

[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.800]
Cortis is going to look at that thing.

[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.380]
Oh boy, he's really must be stolen.

[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.320]
I know he's not.

[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.280]
No, he's just going to rip it open and grab the damn check.

[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:31.580]
That's right.

[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:31.820]
That's right.

[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:32.020]

[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.120]
I'm screwing this thing all up on my return address and everything.

[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:38.660]
That's all right.

[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:39.500]
He needs more of me.

[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.240]
I'm writing and talking at the same time.

[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:41.960]
I know.

[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.900]
It's not the same as singing in the shower isn't.

[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:49.080]
And dropping me your body wash, walking in chewing bubble gum.

[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.240]
Okay, I got to return it.

[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.720]
I got you.

[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.100]
I said I got my check book right here.

[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:53.480]
Yeah.

[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.680]
Now let's see how big should I make this check?

[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.380]
Oh, maybe I should go by six.

[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.380]
Maybe I should write one for Chris too.

[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:02.820]
I think you should.

[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:03.900]
I think you should.

[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:04.640]
It's not going to happen.

[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.360]
I'm not going to ask for it.

[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:06.460]
I'm not like that.

[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.020]
Well, what do I owe you?

[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:09.740]
I don't know.

[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:10.580]
Painting grief.

[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.360]
Briefing suffering.

[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.000]
I don't know who knows.

[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:12.900]
Let's see.

[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.800]
Josh Cordis.

[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.200]
I almost wrote my own name in here.

[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.340]
I could use it.

[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.320]
I could go cash it.

[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:19.020]
Take it to wood.

[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:19.280]
Yeah.

[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.200]
A grand, yeah.

[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.540]
My balance.

[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:22.700]
$1,000.

[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.080]
No, my checks don't balance.

[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.640]
Although to be honest with it, the way things are here.

[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.460]
I have a lot of expenses.

[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.160]
You know what I mean?

[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:31.840]
Mm-hmm.

[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.820]
$1,000 and no $100.

[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:38.700]
$1,000.

[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.300]
What do I write for what?

[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.240]
Sex.

[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:47.860]
Okay.

[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:48.880]
I'm going to write that.

[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.620]
I wrote that for sex.

[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.340]
No, always do.

[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.420]
Somebody hands me a check.

[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.800]
Or something along those lines.

[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.340]
I wouldn't pay him a thousand bucks.

[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.080]
Are you kidding me?

[01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.320]
Maybe 50.

[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.640]
How about eight bucks?

[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.900]
Yeah, that's more like it.

[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.520]
No, I sure would not pay him for sex.

[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.900]
Eight bucks for a-

[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:06.340]
Sorry, Josh.

[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:07.420]
Huh?

[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:07.900]

[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.020]
I'm looking at it.

[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.380]
I mean, yeah.

[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:11.800]
Yeah.

[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:12.900]
That'll make sense now.

[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:13.220]
I wrote that for sex.

[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:13.220]

[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.040]
I wrote that on there, sex.

[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:14.760]
That's-

[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.200]
Now, who do they really look at?

[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.080]
They don't have time to look at that.

[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:17.260]
Who do they?

[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.040]
The machine.

[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:19.780]
The automatic-

[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:20.680]
Caching machine.

[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.860]
Josh, I'm not sending this to you like I used to.

[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:24.020]
I'm sending it directly to him.

[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:24.880]
What about my chip?

[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:26.800]
Care of what?

[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.980]
You want me to put that in the same envelope?

[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.000]
Well, yeah, or something?

[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.200]
Get out of here.

[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.400]
I'll FedEx that to your side.

[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.420]
Okay, well, bless your heart.

[01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:33.560]
How fast do you need it?

[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.600]
Today, I've been waiting for it all week.

[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:36.180]
I get home everyday.

[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.000]
Get out of here.

[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:37.820]
You need it today.

[01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:39.960]
I'm not lying.

[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.300]
Every day, I get home and I look through my chip show up.

[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.500]
I should have schmitcanded.

[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.300]
Bastard.

[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:55.500]
Well, I only asked you because, you know, you're the computer maven.

[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.480]
And I- what do I know from chip?

[01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.320]
I'm glad you did.

[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:00.140]
You know about chips and dip.

[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.340]
Now, let's see.

[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:01.860]
What's the address?

[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.740]
20295 Northwest Second Avenue?

[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:04.200]
Jess.

[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:05.860]
My jammy.

[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:07.820]
Just a minute.

[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.040]
No, sweet water.

[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.760]
No, wait, check the-

[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.600]

[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.220]
That's it.

[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:16.720]
What a memory.

[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.000]
What a memory.

[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:20.940]
And what penmanship?

[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.540]
That's something as you get older right scraggly, you know.

[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:24.800]
Okay, there it is.

[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:25.880]
Ready to go right at 2 o'clock.

[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:28.560]
A red chip?

[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.360]
Now, you really wanted to try and start that today.

[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.660]
I would like you to mail it to me somehow at your earliest convenience

[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.120]
and then expecting it for two weeks.

[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.620]
I was wondering what-

[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.700]
It was-

[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:41.660]
I'm not blaming you.

[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.260]
I'm not blaming you.

[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:43.440]
I'm not blaming you.

[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:43.820]
I'm not blaming you.

[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.680]
I'm not-

[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.480]
I'm just trying to get you to appreciate how desperately I've been wanting this thing and it was supposed to have been there Monday.

[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.260]

I love you.

[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:55.840]
No, you don't.

[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:56.860]
Deeply.

[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.200]
It's a mad passionate kind of love.

[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.180]

Oh, so happy.

[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.380]

Week after week, more and more people are taking advantage.

[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.560]

Of our half-priced deals.

[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.300]

[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:35.600]
Yeah.

Tonight, Fox News presents an expose on the Chicago-based radical group of gay meteorologists in the early 1970s known as the weather underground.

[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.600]
Help it there.

[01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.520]
Check out my high pressure ring south of my border.

[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.600]
In that domestic storm.

[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.940]
It's raining back.

[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.000]
We're doing fine now.

[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.520]
A good night.

[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.720]
And see to a light shot.

[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.140]
What do you mean by that?

[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.660]
Well, ain't no feature Chicago.

[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.920]
I know, but I hear other women say it.

[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.180]
What's that mean anyway?

[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.020]
I don't know.

[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.400]
Light shot?

[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.520]
It we an Hong Kong fluency.

[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.580]
It's raining back.

[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:25.600]
Discover the truth behind Barack Hussein or Thomas involvement with the weather underground.

[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.380]
Okay, weathermen will go underground.

[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.740]
Who's that kid you would tell me about?

[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.740]
Oh, that little sweetie with a silly name.

[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.300]
Barack so riley or something.

[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.780]
And he's too young to be playing with the pointed.

[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.260]
Oh, nothing like that, sugar.

[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.060]
He just wants me to teach him how to write backwards.

[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.740]
Who knows, he may grow up to be president someday.

[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.180]
Yeah, right.

[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.420]
The weather underground or underground weather.

[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:56.860]
Exposed.

[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.900]
Oh, we are fairly unbalanced.

[01:12:59.240 --> 01:12:59.940]
I'm talking to you.

[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.260]
Why do you should be pretty damn proud of me?

[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.640]
Your thing is all set to go.

[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:05.820]
Thank you.

[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:06.680]
Thank you so much.

[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:07.800]
Wasn't that pretty quick?

[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:08.600]
It's very quick.

[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.380]
You do everything quick.

[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:09.740]
I understand.

[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.280]
And that's because I got my supplies here, man.

[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.880]
I got my pre-printed Zone.

[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.580]
FedEx shipping stuff.

[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.480]
And I got my envelopes and that.

[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.080]
A rat.

[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.820]
So I put it like a little, I put that little thing into a little envelope inside the FedEx envelope.

[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.280]
And it'll be honest way.

[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:24.920]
You'll have it tomorrow.

[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.220]
All right.

[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:27.940]
They said it here.

[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.000]
Yeah.

[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:29.720]
Eight.

[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.540]
It'll be there tomorrow.

[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:33.660]
Thank you.

[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.080]
Somebody steals it.

[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.340]
By the way, it's very valuable.

[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.040]
Yes.

[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:38.720]
We've got to give him a dollar.

[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.180]
FedEx for George shows up tomorrow.

[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:40.860]
It's still it.

[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.000]
That was down to 41.

[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:43.620]
Not so bad.

[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:44.900]
It was down over 300 before.

[01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.220]
Although it's early in the day.

[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.880]
It couldn't have a real plunge, you know.

[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.100]
It could be really, really bad.

[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.720]
But that's where it goes.

[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.360]
Keep a stiff upper lip and just laugh.

[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.500]
That's all this laugh.

[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:58.880]
It's only money, man.

[01:13:59.260 --> 01:13:59.580]
Oh, yeah.

[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.440]
Now here's a joke.

[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.620]
From Miles.

[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.260]
It takes to the warding.

[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.220]
Miles in the land.

[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.680]
It's not it's Halloween joke.

[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.220]
It says.

[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.140]
Cabbie picks up a nun.

[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.480]
She gets into the cab.

[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.980]
Notice is that the very handsome cab driver won't stop staring at her.

[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.520]
She asks him why he's staring.

[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.260]
He replies, I have a question to ask you, but I don't want to offend you.

[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.420]
She answers, my son, you can't offend me.

[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:27.280]
When you're as old as I am and have been a nun as long as I have,

[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.220]
you get a chance to see and hear just about everything.

[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.340]
I'm sure there's nothing you could say or ask that I would find offensive.

[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:36.160]
Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me.

[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.820]
She responds, well, let's see what we can do about that.

[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.360]
Number one, you have to be single.

[01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.840]
And number two, you must be Catholic.

[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.740]
The cab driver is very excited and says, yes, I'm single and I'm Catholic.

[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:47.980]
Okay, the nun says, pull into the next alley.

[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.280]
The nun fulfills his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush.

[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.420]
But when they get back under road, the cab driver starts crying.

[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:57.620]
My dear child says, the nun, why are you crying?

[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.360]
Forgive me, but I've sinned.

[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:00.800]
I lied and I must confess.

[01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.120]
I'm married and I'm Jewish.

[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:03.940]
The nun says, that's okay.

[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.160]
My name is Kevin.

[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.400]
I'm going to a Halloween party.

[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.140]
I heard that before.

[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.820]
Maybe it'll be funny later.

[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.480]
100 years on Halloween, maybe.

[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.820]
Oh, not even a little chuckle.

[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.880]
No, I heard it before.

[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:21.540]
Why didn't you interrupt me then?

[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.300]
Maybe other people hadn't.

[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.840]
Who is Christian purifier?

[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:25.940]
Boy, boy.

[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.040]
Christian purifier?

[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.040]
I got to know that.

[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.700]
You sprayed on Christians.

[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.240]
Is he a good Christian?

[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:31.800]
I don't know.

[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.020]
Italy is the rest of the world.

[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.800]
And everyone here is throwing that support behind the one that is going to be a good one.

[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.180]
And they think can help the world's problems of Obama.

[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.880]
I'm Mr. Obama.

[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:49.320]
Now, I know it's a stupid question, but those brits, you know, what they did to South Africa.

[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.180]
We all know what they did.

[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.720]
And so the white people in South Africa, they speak with that British accent just like the Austrians.

[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:55.540]
Right?

[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.020]
And like some of Canadians, eh?

[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:57.960]
Right?

[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.720]
Michael says, sorry to be a chronic.

[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:01.980]
This is rather interesting.

[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.060]
It's certainly better than that stale joke.

[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.420]
Now, the joke was okay.

[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:06.060]
I thought it was cute.

[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:07.640]
Not everybody heard it.

[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.160]
I know.

[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.920]
Michael says, I worked for Lefty Rosenthal once.

[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.300]
He used to run Crocs, a bar in Boka back in the 90s.

[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.740]
I worked at that bar during a summer before I went to college.

[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.400]
I was actually working at the night of OJ slow moving Bronco chase.

[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.200]
The whole party was sitting there watching the whole thing.

[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.240]
He was okay.

[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:34.000]
Robert De Niro came in and met with him one night when they were starting to move, make the movie Casino.

[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.140]
I always thought it was pretty silly that I had to have De Niro come to the bar to meet with him.

[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:39.520]
They could have met anywhere, but that's how he wanted it.

[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.660]
He wanted everyone to see he got De Niro in that bar.

[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:47.260]
So in that regard, he was like a typical software to want to be, but he was a showman and the bar always did well,

[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:48.560]
even during the summer slow season.

[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.240]
He always tipped the employees above what customers gave us.

[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.560]
Good old Lefty.

[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.820]
Well, he wasn't such a bad guy then, Lefty Rosenthal, huh?

[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.300]
I mean, some of the gangsters were okay.

[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:58.720]
They took care of their people.

[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.880]
Speaking of gangsters, saw food.

[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:01.900]
Somebody sends me an email.

[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:02.660]
Yeah.

[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:07.020]
And it's an old, old, old, old thing.

[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.980]
So not sure if this is up to date.

[01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:10.200]
No.

[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.040]
Sofus 867 North Dearborn Street, Chicago.

[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.900]
10% fee, 10% to first year.

[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:17.540]
7.5% to second year.

[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.280]
Charges retainer 15 hundred bucks.

[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:23.180]
If the client makes less than 80 grand, 25 hundred bucks of more retainer, yadi, yadi.

[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.020]
So not sure if this is up to date.

[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.100]
At least one person is definitely deceased, Bob Wolf.

[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.680]
Bob Wolf was a great broadcaster.

[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:31.680]
He's dead?

[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:32.760]
What?

[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.980]
There's a lot of dead people, you know?

[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.280]
Can you ask you that question again?

[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.860]
What do you think are there more people living?

[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:38.400]
Dead.

[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.340]
More people dead.

[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:42.280]
Starting for one.

[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:45.200]
You know, 6,000 years ago when the world was created?

[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:45.780]
Right.

[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:46.360]
That way we're starting.

[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.780]
Adam and Eve were under the treaty.

[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:48.100]

[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:48.420]
Dead.

[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.000]
More dead people.

[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.340]
Eating that pear.

[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.220]
There's more dead people than living peop.

[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:55.680]
That's my guess.

[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.380]
You know, I'm just, uh, I put my arse, yeah.

[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.560]
That's a good job for Chris.

[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.620]
Chris, I'll lose a little bit of weight.

[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.980]
Maybe an answer to go out there and start counting all the dead people.

[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:04.760]
All right, I'll see you later.

[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:10.900]
Speaking of that, the family of a dead elderly woman cremated her remains on a makeshift barbecue

[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.400]
and continued to code.

[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.840]
This is from Corning California.

[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:14.260]
All right.

[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.580]
And continued collecting her retirement checks money more than 25 grand.

[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:25.040]
Authorities in Northern California said Ramona, Almond's daughter and grandson were arrested Sunday

[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.700]
on suspicion of embezzlement elderly or elder abuse and disposing of a body without a permit.

[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:32.400]
Almond 84, likely died of natural causes.

[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:37.860]
The investigators were still trying to determine the exact cause of death said to Hamlet County Sheriff's Captain Paul Hozler.

[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.800]
Almond's daughter, Kathleen Almond 50 and Almond's grandson Tony Rae 30.

[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.760]
Total investigators, the relative died in December.

[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:51.100]
They left her body on a bedroom floor for a week before cremating the remains in the backyard fire pit.

[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.920]
Investigators said the two kept collecting Almond's monthly retirement checks,

[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.540]
mounting to more than 25 grand.

[01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:01.980]
Sheriff's detective Richard Knox said they may have been trying to honor Almond's desire to die at home and be cremated.

[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.200]
Right.

[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.640]
Sounds sensible to me, don't that?

[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:05.900]
Sure.

[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.700]
The two were arrested after Almond's son grew suspicious about her whereabouts.

[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:13.380]
Both were in jail in lieu of bail, but the Raymond scheduled for today.

[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.800]
The Sheriff's Department said they don't have attorneys yet.

[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.180]
To his Ray.

[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.600]
Well, Rae says thanks and he lost his appetite.

[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:25.200]
I'm not sure whether it was from the story he sent me or from looking at that picture of mine.

[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.580]
And Renee in Atlanta is very topical.

[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.020]
What about Frank Sinatra's Renee beautiful voice?

[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.160]
And we did that poll, what was that like 18 weeks ago?

[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:34.680]
Yeah, at least.

[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.440]
The most beautiful voice.

[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.740]
And Renee is just catching up.

[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.480]
What about Frank Sinatra for the podium todays and days?

[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.140]
Well, you know, it's Atlanta.

[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.180]
Things kind of trickle real slowly up into Atlanta.

[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.880]
And if you've ever been here, you'd understand why.

[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.320]
The biggest name.

[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.440]
The best talent.

[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.740]
You know, it was Neil Rogers.

[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:58.080]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.840]
The fourth leader.

[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:00.840]
The biggest name.

[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.060]
The best talent.

[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.320]
It's a big dog.

[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.140]
Joe Rose.

[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:05.440]
Weakly morning 7 o'clock.

[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.940]
Where's that Florida sports?

[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.120]
Always matters.

[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.740]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:11.160]
Oh, it's killer.

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:11.780]
Ticket ticket.

[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:13.320]
Sport leader.

[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.120]
Were you grudge back in?

[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.920]
I'm John McCain, my prisoner.

[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.600]
And I don't approve of negative campaigning.

[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:27.020]
Because it doesn't give Americans much hope for the future.

[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.860]
And my friend is here.

[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.960]
The badama afraid my friends that Barack Obama is a terrorist.

[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.100]
Who wants you all to die?

[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.880]
I have it on Kodasar, the my friend.

[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.340]
But at the age of nine, Barack Obama was affiliated with homegrown terrorist,

[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:44.840]
Lou Ares.

[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.840]
Who flew bisexual planes until an answer to death.

[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:55.940]
Through bisexual planes into initial stacks of hay.

[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:00.080]
And I think once on the climate dealership, I'm not sure.

[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.340]
At the tender age of six, Barack Obama consorted with known underground radicals.

[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.160]
Paul Crashner and Abby Dalton.

[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:12.640]
Barack Obama was the elusive fifth beetle, my friend.

[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.260]
Who was a member of the Charlie Mansion family.

[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.300]
And he has Tori DeFairy with Squicky from Willie Horton here.

[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.900]
Joho, my friend.

[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.920]
Barack Obama held light skin-shot for Buffalo Bill.

[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.120]
And played the triangle in Dr. Judge's death symphony.

[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:37.940]
And that's not the kind of change we can break a 20-wiz, my friend.

[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.860]
And I have my queen for now.

[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.020]
You think maybe Dick Taney is really lurched in the skies?

[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.080]
I think he's out there.

[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.900]
I think he's a professor.

[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:52.680]
Wow, he's here festering in my crawl, I'll tell you that.

[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:54.040]
What is a crawl?

[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.040]
It's right over here.

[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.300]
Now it's down 165, by the way, we're making a comeback.

[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:57.660]
What?

[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:58.700]
It's right over there.

[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.160]
The crawl.

[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:03.060]
So I was just thinking,

[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.940]
you know, I'm going to have to do a little bit of a roll.

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.940]

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:21.960]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:22.020]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.600]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.660]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.780]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.660]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.040]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.300]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:44.280]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:44.300]

[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:44.300]

[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:44.300]

[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.080]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:46.080]

[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.220]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.600]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:49.600]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.240]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:50.700]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.760]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.440]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.860]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.960]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.420]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.020]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:11.460]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.380]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.320]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.500]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:19.500]

[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:19.500]

[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:19.720]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:19.720]

[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:19.720]

[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:19.720]

[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:19.720]

[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:19.760]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.960]
I'm going to have to do a roll.

1,78 on the downside of the Dow.

[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.220]
well i think one of its very best moments of this debate they had a long

[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.880]
conversation at the negative tone of the campaign and after you've been

[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.560]
using the bill air thing for a bit the king came back and said but my

[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.380]
campaign is all about the economy and i think that was a wonderful use of the

[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:40.380]
true smile by obama he had a tweak on the eye he was saying in effect i don't

[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:44.040]
believe that his campaign is really about the economy that was that was good as

[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.700]
if who who the hell are you kidnol man

[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:49.500]
kind of like me who you're kidnol man i don't know i must be kidding the

[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.760]
easily because they keep sending those big checks every two weeks

[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.960]
although that's going to be over in about what two and a half months

[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:55.800]
yeah

[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:59.500]
the start sending me much smaller checks every two weeks all i'm going to

[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.220]
survive on that

mister david is sworn under oath he does not wear a herpes and has never had

[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:05.940]

[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:09.900]

[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.140]

[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:28.700]
and everyone knows

[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.400]
god it's almost noon already i'm going to tell you one thing the emails have

[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:33.740]
done

[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:33.800]
and

[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:37.520]
it makes the show seem like it last about five minutes for me

[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.320]
does that because i'm well because i'm big i'm busy man

[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.360]
bc i'm really busy

[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:45.760]
if you're really interested number of that is going to be estimated if you go

[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.900]
back to the days of the pyramids

[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:48.120]
five thousand years ago

[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:51.480]
it says to me that some six billion have died around the number of living

[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.100]
living today

[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:55.560]
if you go back to the introduction of the modern man

[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.120]
forty to forty five thousand years ago

[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.380]
estimates range from twelve

[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:02.700]
billion to a hundred ten billion dead

[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:03.820]
that would mean we

[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.240]
several ancestors to each living today so living won't be catching up to

[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.120]
dead anytime soon

[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.440]
hope that answers your question

[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.020]
we're not catching up but the way they're going last couple days i think we're

[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.360]
really making a big move man

[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:17.780]
i'm

[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:19.200]
all my ass

[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:23.380]
four hundred and sixty qa m

[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:23.740]
the

[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:24.640]
fourth

[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.040]
leader

[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.940]
this is pretty quick whenever i shape my balls

[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:31.520]
i listen to the meal Rogers twelve to one hour

[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:40.160]

[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:40.760]
tell

[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.620]
this religion

[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:46.160]
thing was not for me

[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:46.900]
absolutely

[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.540]
they held a big convention

[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.640]
let me in for free

[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:58.100]
i don't know what i was about to see

[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:00.680]
oh they were speaking in

[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:00.960]
time

[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:01.500]
that

[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.000]
made me believe

[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:04.340]
that

[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.240]
was kind of fun

[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:08.860]
just

[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:10.720]
take it out of my mouth

[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.280]
speak in time

[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.820]
they got people

[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.520]
even my tongue is

[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:17.760]
we

[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.740]
then from side to side

[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:19.980]
that

[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:20.260]
that

[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:20.660]
that

[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:21.220]
that

[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:21.460]
that

[01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:21.460]

[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:23.540]
that

[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:23.540]

[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.560]
that

[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:32.280]
that

[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:32.280]

[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:32.720]
that

[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:33.160]
that

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.160]

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.160]

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.160]

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.160]

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.160]

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.160]

[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.180]
that

[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:33.180]

[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:33.200]
that

[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:33.200]

[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:38.380]
my tongue

[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:38.620]
to

[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:38.920]
that

[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.240]
whatever i do

[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:42.740]

[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.660]
because now i speak in time

[01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:48.260]
that

[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.940]
makes me believe

[01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:50.080]
that

[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:50.940]

[01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.780]
Look and the Mavins fun

[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.640]
Playing round the time

[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:12.840]
Well, one is five sixty WQM happy Thursday to you from all your Pizons at the WQAM the three of us

[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.860]
And of course get in touch with your wife they come on. He did not touch me that check for sure tomorrow

[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:19.800]
I don't think he's here. I think he's stuck in that meeting like Chris said no, well

[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:24.020]
Like I said you can do it everyone now we got 50 of these certificates for jakes

[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:28.700]
So I'm assuming the food is there right cuz you just send me the you know no no

[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.980]
Jeff said the guy is a minute away stuck in traffic

[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:36.740]
Okay, we got 32 left so we've already sold 18 real quick out of the 50

[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:41.860]
These are $100 certificates for 50 bucks, and I'm looking at this menu

[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:46.440]
The steak special Thursday night menu and it's making me get really upset cuz I'm not there

[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:54.360]
Yeah, every Thursday night all cuts 18 bucks 16 ounce in your strip eight ounce tender one 16 ounce bone in rib eye all cuts you

[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.220]
West D.H. Choice beef all come with your choice of one accompaniment

[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:06.920]
One of these Jimmy Tury blue cheese butter. Oh God. That sounds good garlic confit or peppercorn demiglis and all sticks come with

[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:13.800]
Choice of two sides sauteed spinach themed asparagus brussel sprouts with parmesan or as mr. Eagle would say parmesan

[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:22.480]
Roasted chitake mushrooms hand-cut french fries sweet tater steak fries baked mac and cheese crispy chili onion rings or tomato sweet onion salad

[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:25.800]
God I

[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:29.040]
Could just sink my teeth into one of those great pieces of meat right now

[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:29.680]
mmm

[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:37.440]
With that blue cheese butter, and that sound good sounds great. You're making me hungry. Oh, yeah, too bad food sounds there. Yeah, it'll be there

[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.360]
So I guess we'll assign the fat boy to a 27 we sold 23 we're almost halfway home

[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.060]
See slow and steady is the way these things are gonna go now

[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.380]
22 we sold more than half 28 28

[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:56.120]
It's a fabulous place boy. I can't wait for you to eat the food so I can hear you what the place is great

[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.340]
I've been there two or three times already

[01:35:59.420 --> 01:35:59.780]
And

[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.500]
There's nothing next day

[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.280]
Well, that sounds like really good meat. Oh, yeah

[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:15.320]
Did that was down 146 by the way for those who are getting all panicky don't get panicky was down over 300 earlier

[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:19.700]
It'll definitely not go down more than what two three thousand points today. Don't worry

[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:26.800]
When the number on CNBC on the gambling channel starts with a minus that's the time to start getting a little bit worried

[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.040]
That's right minus

[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.160]
When you open points kind of like that book tomorrow morning. I almost forgot about that

[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.300]
Maybe that's why I'm in such a great chipper mood today, huh?

[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:37.800]
Yeah

[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.800]
21 we got 21 left

[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.980]
Out of the 50 means we sold 29

[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:49.200]
We're going to a pretty good rate wouldn't you say that is because nobody's got any money these days

[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:52.800]
That's why everything has come slowed down to a crawl and nobody's got any money

[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.220]
except Jake the plumber

[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:59.780]
Joe the plumber right whatever the hell's name is get it right. This is cute from Barbara a

[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:05.420]
Typical day in retirement in Florida. I haven't read it yet, but it's it's cute. I think

[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:08.680]
It better be it's long it'll take us up till midnight

[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:13.780]
We get up at 5 a.m. Have a quick breakfast and join the early morning walk in talk club

[01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.420]
There are about 30 of us

[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:22.400]
Rainer shine we walk around the streets all talking at once after a nibble walk avoiding I read drivers out to make us road kill

[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.860]
We go back home shower and change for the next activity

[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:30.900]
My wife goes directly to the pool for her underwater Pilates class followed by gasping for breath and CPR

[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:38.720]
I put them. I asked me about my grandchildren T-shirt my mid-caps shorts my socks and sandals and go to the clubhouse lobby for a nice nap

[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:45.260]
Before you know it's time for lunch. We go to Costco to partick of the many tasty samples dispensed by ladies and white hair

[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:47.760]
Nets all free after a filling lunch

[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:52.680]
This is cute after a filling lunch if we don't have any doctor appointments

[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:55.480]
We might go to the flea market to buy a Rolex watch for two dollars

[01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:01.100]
We're usually back home by 2 p.m. To get ready for dinner people start lining up for the early bird around 3 p.m

[01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:04.000]
But we get there by 345 because we're late eaters

[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.260]
The dinners are very popular because of the large portions they serve

[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:12.560]
You can take home enough food for the next day's lunch and dinner including extra bread cracker sweet and low packets and mints

[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:18.100]
At 5.30 p.m. We're home ready to watch the six o'clock news by 6.30. We're fast asleep

[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:24.380]
Then we get up and make 5 or 6 trips to the bathroom during the night as time to get up and start a new day all over again

[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.080]
Doctor-related activities will eat up most of your retirement time

[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.000]
I enjoy reading old magazines and sub-zero temperatures in the waiting room so I don't mind

[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:36.260]
Calling for test results also help the days fly by it takes at least half an hour

[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:37.740]
Just getting through the doctor's phone menu

[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.660]
Then there's a whole time until your connection to the right party

[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.860]
Sometimes they forget your holding and the whole office goes to lunch

[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:49.920]
Many of the receptionists are quite rude they keep you standing near that dopey closed window totally ignoring you

[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.640]
After half an hour I ignore the do not tap on the windows sign I tap on the window

[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:54.940]
This always drives them nuts

[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:59.600]
If you do they put down their egg McMuffin or their copy of the inquirer and fling open the window ready for a fight

[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.400]
I lie explaining I tap the window accidentally because I have Parkinson's

[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.500]
They claim they're required to keep the window closed because of the privacy law

[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:12.000]
But I don't believe it they're afraid if they were over if I were to over here saw lip shits has hemorrhoids that I would blackmail

[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.700]
Resolve information to a foreign government is everyone in Florida in Florida everyone's got hemorrhoids says Barbara

[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:19.880]
You got boys

[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.600]

[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:25.480]

[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:34.180]
Choosing a development with suitable amenities is an important decision the various clubs in these communities provide most of the activities

[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:39.760]
Art developments got over 300 clubs. There's something for everyone clubs like the kidney donating club the Taliban club

[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.400]
The East meets west club not to be confused with the west meets east club, etc

[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:48.540]
A truly active community is one where the ambulance is there several times today and is part of the travel club

[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.720]
Most lights important to choose a development with an impressive name

[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:57.000]
Italian names are very popular in Florida. They convey world traveler up at a sophistication and wealth

[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.120]
Where would you rather live maris condos or the lakes of Venice?

[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.760]
There's no difference. They're both owned by Murray who happens to be a cheap SOB

[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.900]
I hope this material has been of some help to you future retirees

[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.740]

[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:36.800]

[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.220]
I thought hopefully Adam's just he's fun in me, right?

[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:41.620]

And we got 13 certificates left. That's outrageous

[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:29.400]
I know that they're going a lot slower and a lot of people like footy aren't even doing them anymore

[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.900]
That's because you don't have a show but long before we got canned they stopped doing his certificates

[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:34.480]
He wanted to why he wasn't selling any

[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:42.020]
He wasn't selling it. That's because right wingers are cheap. They got a lot of money many of them, but they're cheap

[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:47.940]
Remember at i and z we did a charity thing and mr. Broward aka Jules Adler mr

[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.960]
Right wing. He was our token right winger on a station

[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:58.640]
He didn't raise squat all the rest of us. We got you know good donations for whatever it held was for and he couldn't raise squat

[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:03.320]
Because the right wingers all talk about game, but they keep the money tight to their ass

[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.120]
right in that wallet

[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:11.380]
jose's i noticed McCain started out to debate by giving us the status of Nancy Reagan's health

[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:16.300]
He did the same the first debate referring to 10 Kennedy notice there was no mention of chainy

[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:22.620]
But then at this point McCain will jump at any opportunity to mention the word Reagan and disassociate himself with the current corrupt Bush regime

[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.100]
The difference between the candidates his McCain seems to be bumbling through a script full of attacks

[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:33.380]
Contempted anger while Obama stands up to his opponent where they respectful tough and diplomatic manner

[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:36.800]
That showed me how these two would handle foreign leaders in difficult situations

[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:41.320]
With Obama will have far fewer enemies in our prestige will be restored possibly better than ever

[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.220]
Obama is special and it seems mainstream America is beginning to understand that

[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:47.720]
The campaign is about hope versus hate

[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:53.360]
And i can remember you calling Obama is our next president back when he was in a room full of other democratic candidates

[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.180]
Bush be gone says Joe that's right. I thought it. I told you

[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:59.060]
Once every 10 or 20 years man, I get something right

[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.960]
Unfortunately about 11 or 12 years ago. I got something wrong. We came to Q.A. Amin

[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:05.860]
Nothing's perfect

[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.500]
Little did we know what you knew?

[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:13.700]
You knew after that summertime of events we got 13 certificates left for jakes bar and grill

[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:20.340]
$100 certificates you pay only 50 bucks. It's on wqam.com and maybe if you can find that banner with my push on it

[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:25.940]
Almost every night of the week also they have some type of special going on so yeah places great

[01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.200]
I think they're feeding you for free over there. I wish

[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.480]
And you sure i mean obviously it's a great place but you sure are really

[01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:38.860]
Got their head way up there collective ass. I mean you just love it. It's a great place. It's right on a corner

[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:44.980]
So it's easy access the food is awesome the place is just great like you know it's great ambiance and everything

[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:49.580]
All the people are really nice. So why wouldn't you like it exactly what's not to like

[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:54.460]
The real one from hialia as opposed to a fake one

[01:51:56.180 --> 01:52:02.540]
As opposed to mario. I don't hear from mario anymore. Thank god. Have we seen a fake one? What? I've ever seen a fake one. Oh, yeah

[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:08.080]
Hello, Neil. First let me congratulate you on your show no matter which four matter what obstacles are placed in your way

[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:10.840]
Thanks, Joyce you always managed to provide an interesting enjoyable entertainment

[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:14.700]
I'll turn it to the rest of the programming crap on radio these days especially in south florida

[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:17.580]
I can always count on you to provide me with some last information

[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:20.780]
I would otherwise not be receiving thanks for reading the bedtime stories

[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:23.320]
I don't always have time to log on to your website and read them myself

[01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:29.640]
Anyway, after watching the debate last night I got an instant headache watching the talking heads follow head over heels once again

[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:35.880]
Over something as simple as a well thought well written well rehearsed response to a talking point senator obama was sure to be trying

[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:38.400]
Back really types seven and a mechanic president bush

[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:42.860]
Instead of pointing out how well Obama stayed on message and didn't get himself drawn into the motorgate

[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:45.280]
All crabby and pissed off as the grouchy old man did

[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.880]
If it wasn't republicans vote stealing apparatus which they're sure to deploy whether they're candidates ahead in the polls or not

[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:55.800]
I would say right now game over p s whatever happened to the mime and police prostitution scandal

[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:57.600]
We're still checking that one out

[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.960]
Like oh jay still wishes you were on a course looking for the killer of run in the call

[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:05.440]
But he can't be because he's on the inside and he's still on the inside

[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:07.700]
You know in Vegas

[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:09.880]
somebody sent a cute picture

[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:16.520]
What stays and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas got a picture oh jay behind bars cute medium cute

[01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:18.940]
not hysterical cute, but

[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:20.260]
cutesy

[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.840]
We still got 13 certificates left. What are we gonna do to sell these all out?

[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.080]
Jump up and down and scream

[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:30.460]
Okay, I'll jump up and down you be the scraper. Okay jump up and down

[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.320]
The best talent

[01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:41.580]
You know, Roger

[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:44.360]
I think

[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:49.540]
Fourth late sports reader. I know that the zord even loves neo-rodgers

[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:55.360]
What I did in Alaska I got involved in the pta and then was elected to the city council

[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:58.820]
And I was just your average hockey mom in Alaska

[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:02.800]
Don't attack

[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.180]
She's loved by the ride

[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:08.560]
She took his plane sold it on eBay

[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.480]
My

[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:14.580]
She'll fire you if you step out alive

[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.360]
She was an ex I don't know miss a last cut

[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:32.600]
She is a qualified candidate

[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.500]
I

[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:46.440]
Do

[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.860]
This is the most qualified

[01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:02.620]
He could have picked this is the pick that John McCain made. I think John McCain is a question

[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:08.660]
What's the question 12 30 at 5 60 on WQ him getting a little choked up again. I thought it was 100% over this

[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:16.540]
Flim there's just a little bit in there. Maybe if I get a trowel yeah or it's hype it or move my bow about a spoon

[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:25.300]
Spoon be good when I'm doing it out of there spoons one. I'm long thin spoons like when you get a hot-fudge sundae or something in a like a real fountain place

[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.320]
Like Alan's drugs

[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:29.200]
Is

[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.860]
Is it Alan's it is

[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.860]
You know there's an Alan's is it Alan? No, it was cutting ham drugs in Michigan state east lancing cutting ham drugs

[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:44.080]
And they had a fountain that that's back in 1960. Yeah, 61 did they have soda jerks?

[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:47.280]
No, yeah, and they had a lot of customers who were jitter-djuever

[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:48.840]
Jerk

[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:50.360]
Yeah, the soda jerk

[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:54.780]
We got 11 left for Jake Sparrow and grill in the gables

[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.140]
6901 red road scandalous food is what scandalous?

[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:02.920]
What that we have 11 after the food yeah, and that they're $100 certificates

[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.760]
Yeah, they're $100 certificates for just 50 bucks. They should all be gone right now if we had any audience or if anybody had any

[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:14.300]
Bar and group you know working it up with that we're working it we're working it and it's moving along

[01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:18.600]
You know what on this list of side dishes sounds really well. I like them all

[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:23.480]
Even in which you probably don't like brussel sprouts because you don't like your veggies brussel sprouts are yeah

[01:56:25.780 --> 01:56:29.020]
Brussels sparts with parmesan man, that sounds just awesome

[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:31.620]
But that's something parmesan with yeah

[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.080]
You're gonna get a spanking and I guarantee that your program director's gonna be given it to you

[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:44.480]
Oh, no, you're just going to know. Yeah, he's gonna put your fat ass over his knee and spank you until your guts spill out

[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:47.020]
And it's a fish. I already told you I'll be here tomorrow. So

[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:53.980]
Well, thank you so much for carrying enough to say thank you very much for what for having you on the show

[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:57.560]
What's your job? You have to thank me for having a job

[01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:02.300]
Jesus god like we ran out on a street corner and picked you out of a crowd

[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:07.360]
Well, you know the way the thing you're going to go man you're going to go and we're real happy to have you

[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.000]
Well, thank you very much most of the time. I'm happy to be here crispy

[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:17.020]
Boy, you are really easy he's working for like 20 cent an hour. It's better than nothing in an hour

[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:20.100]
Crispy chili onion rings that sounds awesome

[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:22.680]
Did they bring any of those? I bet you're not no

[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:22.680]

[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:26.940]
Doesn't that sound good definitely crispy chili onion rings

[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:27.580]
hmm

[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:32.120]
They brought sweet potato steak fries. Yeah

[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:39.720]
Oh baked mac and cheese. Oh, oh, I love you know me and I'm not gonna cheat. Yeah, how's the mac and cheese you?

[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:42.360]
Let's go start to met up here. I had some of it. Yes, it was very good

[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:47.560]
You know when macaroni and cheese is the best I've told you this before when it's like crisp like like um

[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:52.660]
Burnt on top a little bit. Not burn. Yeah, well when you go there they bring it out to you. It's like your side dish

[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.880]
And they bring it on to you like this little

[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:58.340]
You know container not container but a nice little like uh, it's not a container

[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:00.720]
What? Yes, I think whatever a casserole

[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.920]
Yes, so it's got the brown the the crust on the top of it and it's just doing baby good inside

[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:08.780]
Like creme whole lay, you know, you know how they do that with a creme relay

[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:11.960]
Yeah, you know, do that use the blow torch. That's right. He was a blow torch

[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.820]
We've only got 10 left now in the certificates

[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:18.960]
That was down 20 and a half points. Oh, there's that silly as queen

[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:24.760]
If the six circuit court of appeals said your right Republican party the secretary of state has got to do this

[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:30.000]
She's got to confederal appeals court order to hire to reprogram. How to registration database at the counties

[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.820]
We didn't have to liquidate any time for the October 25th at least she's out date

[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:41.240]
Which is the beginning of she out the absentee ballots now the secretary of state says this is wrong for a lot of reasons first of all

[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:46.160]
She says this list this system has been in an effect for at least four years in Ohio

[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:50.600]
It was used for the general election in 2006 the presidential primaries

[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.400]
We have nine rings. It's a little late now

[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:56.020]
She says to come just before the election and claim there's something wrong with it

[01:58:56.020 --> 01:59:01.800]
Secondly, she says there's a competing federal law that says you can't make wholesale changes in the voter registration list

[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:07.420]
Within 90 days of the election and finally she says this is a they've already started the absentee voting

[01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:11.980]
This is going to be chaos if she has to sort of drop everything and comply with this ruling

[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:15.080]
So that's why she's asking the supreme court to step in here

[01:59:15.620 --> 01:59:20.060]
And the question for the justices is whether they want to just sort of put a hold on everything

[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:25.800]
Let the state go ahead with the system it has here. Let him fix it again. Okay. They did a really a hell of a job in 2004

[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.440]
whale of a job

[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:32.880]
Rocky says you think mad dog man is still thinks oil prices are based on supply and demand

[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:40.320]
He kept saying that the price of a barrel was based on solely on supply and demand right they got oil up the ass those reg heads man

[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:42.280]
They got oil everywhere

[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:48.500]
back home and the price is determined what did I tell you it's whatever the public will the consumer will bear and

[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:52.480]
When people start resisting and they stop driving and then when it gets a little bit too close to the election

[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:57.280]
And when the economy is going to hell on a hand basket. Oh gee oil was down to like 70 bucks a barrel

[01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:02.700]
You realize the prices dropped half of what it was

[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:11.080]
Yeah, 70 dollars and 20 cents right now right as I spoke I turned on bnn the business news network

[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:12.160]
Canadian a

[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:18.280]
84.14 on the looney. That's not bad. I'll take it 84 cent euro is 134

[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:25.160]
And the T.S. X the Toronto stock exchanges down to 160 point probably a lot more than that if they would have elected that frog

[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:27.220]
Stefan Dioll

[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:30.100]
God

[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:37.920]
There's one thing I can't stand is people running for public office in a country where they can't speak the language

[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:39.340]
That's the language of the country

[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:46.400]
Stefan Dioll man. I'm telling you liberals in Canada you got a death wish

[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:49.600]
I'm dying on the hand but nevertheless

[02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:54.720]
But like I said we go only got eight left we're gonna sell them all today

[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:58.220]
It's been quite a while since we sold them all because of the economy

[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.880]
Yeah, and because we don't have the audience we used to have I mean

[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:06.520]
We'll see when that book comes out tomorrow man. Let's kick some bloody ass

[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:09.780]
What do you say? Sure? Oh

[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:14.760]
Yeah, now you're talking a big game now because you had the world fed. Yeah, yeah, now it's time for an auto son

[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:20.240]
He's all pumped up. Yeah, you can do some copy of that my pantaloon is on it's only 1236

[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:24.360]
Why did I say that with the emails the show moves on and by the way?

[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:26.940]
Here's one and this is a good. I'm glad I found this one

[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:30.360]
We have a lot of people

[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:34.540]
Who listen in other countries online? Yes

[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:38.840]
Now I will grant you that there's a time difference and a lot of those people probably listen like archive

[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:43.080]
But how come we're not getting a lot more emails from those people

[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:44.360]
Good pert

[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:48.100]
In other words, and not just overseas, but if you're listening like um

[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:49.720]
Out of South Florida

[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:54.360]
We'd like to hear from you. I mean, you know, not gonna beg please

[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.520]
Neil at neorodges.com any

I L ro g e r s

[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:04.280]
Isn't it amazing how people like to spell any a l or put a d in the Rogers people like to spell things wrong

[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:07.800]
I have a name rod regas and see how they'll butcher it. No, I don't want to

[02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:09.000]
Hmm

[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:13.820]
Too many rod regas is I'll say and so little time

[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:20.700]
We got eight left for jakes you better grab them while we're still there because once they're gone

[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:21.660]
Mm-hmm

[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.380]
This is from Peter it says love from Cubans in London

[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:30.960]
I

[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:33.620]
Listening to you in London. I got a real life and a job here in the UK

[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:37.260]
Used to see when publics Jack Oranda remember when you looked like that picture

[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:41.600]
You look like Ron Jeremy's little brother if you pardon that expression. I look like Ron Jeremy's big brother

[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:42.900]
Wow, although not as hairy

[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:44.620]
Oh

[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:51.660]
One thing about Ron Jeremy. He's not only hairy, but he's got a hairy back. Oh and shoulders. He's just a fur ball. Yeah

[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:51.940]
Oh

[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:58.220]
And look at this Peter has got a long article that he sent me here too a long

[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:04.780]
Ponderous article, but let's start hearing from those people living out or listening outside of South Florida on the email

[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:10.980]
Rick says you were right again oil is under 71 you can see the future sometime. I'm psychic Rick

[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:15.000]
I'm a psychic old fart fag trust me

[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:20.560]
I can see the future. Maybe that's why I do fairly good at wood buying. I mean fairly. I lose my ass, but nevertheless

[02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.540]
Because I can find a good machine mine

[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:33.380]
You think that's it that's it right there. I think it's called blind luck Obama's all whipped up

[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:36.380]
He's in your handshift

[02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:45.880]
Because this is the United States of America. This is a nation that is faced down war and depression

[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:48.420]
great challenges and great threats

[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:56.300]
The American stories never been about things coming easy. It's been about rising to the moment when the moment is hard

[02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:57.980]
So American

[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:00.800]
America can meet this this moment

[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:05.560]
We still have the most talented most productive workers of any country honor

[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:12.100]
We're home to innovation and technology colleges and universities that are the envy of the world

[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.340]
Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and the that was up 80 cents

[02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:21.460]

Money bells and eyes

She doesn't need to fall

[02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:51.540]
As if she's always surprised

[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:55.820]
She's willing when she's caught

[02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:00.920]

Oh is it every three months I send you a check that's right too much

[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:17.620]

Right I'll go in there

[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:40.780]
We've only got four left for jakes and give me that alert folks because once they're gone

[02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:45.500]
They really will be gone and you don't want to miss out on these sometimes just tell you we're gonna get them all gone

[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:47.600]
Josh study was gonna buy one but it doesn't have the money for

[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:48.880]

All right, thank you for I'm out of here. Thank you. You'll have it tomorrow and if uh

Huleo there doesn't give it to you. You'll know he uh he passed the grand bought me a hookah

[02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.420]
I'm not really sure I made it out for the right amount

[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:08.780]
I'm not joking I'm serious

[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:13.520]
I may have to open that thing back up again. The court is getting scared now

[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:18.020]
I just send it and if it's the wrong amount then you can just you know send another one the next cycle

[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:23.280]
Didn't didn't I make it out on the year yeah, mm-hmm

[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.140]
Should we tell them what the uh the comment is?

[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:29.420]
No, don't what do you mean don't

[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.140]
What's the comment the memo

[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:44.240]
That you wrote on there oh i'm a check yes, I remember right in that's your fault not mine. I know

[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:47.700]
Did he leave no? No, he's still there

[02:09:48.140 --> 02:09:53.300]
Well, when you see the comments know what it says and the bottom left hand works is four you know, I usually write um

[02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:57.460]
Website or whatever it's got something different. There was your idea. That's right

[02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:59.920]
Not mine me it was all me

[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:03.440]
Leave me. I so I think George's got the hotspour. Oh, yeah

[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:09.160]
George wants to do you still got four for jakes boy. We better get those gone

[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:16.140]
Otherwise, it's good to be an infomnia. Oh look at this greetings from jersey. Lister from another country. See this

[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:20.100]
Oh, I don't want naked pictures though. Oh, no

[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.000]
ha ha

[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:28.500]
This is one of the greatest pictures in history

[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:30.940]
I'm going to forward it right now

[02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.060]
Okay, okay

[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:38.120]
It's a I thought it was just going to be a naked guy

[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:46.320]
But it's a naked guy with a gigantic human like a farahose wrapped between his legs and back up over a shoulder

[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.460]
It's a most amusing thing

[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:50.600]
Cute

[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.000]
So let's get that on there

[02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:57.440]
Giving you a shot from Concord North Carolina. Love the show

[02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:04.380]
Hollabax says Melissia Golden. Oh Melissia. Remember her? Yes, we miss you Melissia

[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:07.600]
Now is that Concord or Concord Concord? I'm sure

[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:12.300]
The only place they say Concord is a new Hampshire. There's Concord, Michigan

[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:14.400]
I'm sure must be Concord North Carolina

[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:19.560]
Nothing to be finer than to be North Carolina another pond receipts and watching the Panther games on TV

[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:27.260]
Only to be screaming shut up potpan. It says every few minutes the organization should make a change as Marty the organization should shut down business

[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:33.540]
It's a joke a hockey team in a market. It wouldn't know hockey from it's pathetic

[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:41.160]
The thousand down 25 not bad Bob says why I'm telling I may not get through all these emails

[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:45.840]
For having a spastic Thursday. I believe me. I'm not complaining. It's great and

[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:50.140]
And the best part of it is it's not brought from the same like six people, you know

[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:54.200]
Oh, this is dad from Maryland tomorrow. I'll be Lillian and

[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:00.460]
Somebody else and you really suck into your show blows. You don't have the balls you enjoy. Oh

[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:01.760]
my god

[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:04.120]
Chronic I have no life

[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.320]
Anyway, here's that story that I was gonna give you very important to

[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:13.500]
Theresa Dillon was surprised to learn four years ago that what she deemed as an average sore throat

[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:16.420]
Actually was staged to cancer out her tonsil

[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.780]
People think the face of oral cancer is the 70 year old man has been chewing tobacco and drinking whiskey all his life

[02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:27.840]
She said but the face of oral cancer is now me a young woman healthy non smoking fit

[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:33.420]
But what really shocked the waitress and then 38 year old was that the human papalo

[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:38.340]
Mavirus papalo Mavirus may have caused your illness an illness that is often sexually transmitted

[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:44.460]
It was a virus that caused my tumor the HPV virus would just knock me over she said

[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:47.540]
Or maybe it was that picture that knocked you over

[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:52.820]
Bill is part of a new trend that the puzzling scientists while most HPV infections clear on their own

[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:56.920]
There's an alarming surge of oral cancers linked to the virus the headline

[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.400]
Dr. Say there's a link between oral sex and throat cancer

[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:03.140]
So watch what you put in your mouth

[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:09.380]
John Hopkins research is reported in a study published in February in the Journal of Clinical Oncology at between

[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:16.180]
1973 and 2004 the incidence of HPV related oral cancers among people in their forties nearly doubled today more than 34

[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:20.680]
Thousand people have oral cancer and 39% of those cases are related to HPV a

[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:22.520]
Coendater from the American Cancer Society

[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:27.240]
These are patients who are young and they're in their 30s and 40s their non-smokers

[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:32.660]
They don't drink alcohol excessively and every time we look to find we are able to find HPV 16 in their tissue in the

[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:38.000]
biopsy specimen said Dr. Robert Hadad a data-farmer cancer institute head and exergin

[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:48.800]
Men are 35% more likely than women to develop HPV related oral cancer according to the study of the Journal of Clinical Oncology both men and women are susceptible

[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:55.580]
And once the virus is in your mouth you can't just wash it out the only way to get rid of it is extensive drug treatment

[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:59.440]
While scientists don't know yet how sexual orientation factors in the equation

[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:05.380]
They know the number one risk factors a high number of sexual partners. So straight or gay the more partners the more risk George

[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:13.400]
Yeah, that doesn't mean it's a magic number unfortunately it takes only one exposure to one infected parted where actually acquired the infection

[02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:20.720]
Infection with the virus and usually happens in adolescents and while oral sex today is necessary more prevalent than it was in the past

[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:24.420]
It certainly is more accepted and some often presume it's free of risks

[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:31.620]
A 2005 study in the journal P. A. Pediatrics found that teens think oral sex is less risky to their health and vaginal sex

[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:37.180]
It's really obvious now to really say that oral sex is not a safe way of having sex and could have consequences

[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:38.240]
Hadad said

[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:45.460]
The risk associated with it don't get as much presses the risk you can see with vaginal sex. You don't see someone pregnant after oral sex

[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:51.960]
And many don't even know they've contacted HPV and Jill almost one of those people you'd be hard pressed to find anybody

[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:54.340]
Would say that I'm promiscuous because I'm not she said

[02:14:54.940 --> 02:15:00.320]
Dylan who after six months of grueling chemotherapy is now in remission said she wishes she had known the risk as a teen

[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.660]
You have to be careful know who you're with and have to take precautions

[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:07.600]

[02:18:57.700 --> 02:19:02.600]
Oh, and speaking of that moron Tommy Tom. Where is that? I don't know god

[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:36.680]
Also, of course no more garden state racetracked on the street now that land is retail restaurants and residences

[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:41.400]
Garden state man. That was because that was a racetrack that was built to be a casino and

[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:44.420]
When they didn't get the permission for casinos

[02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:49.640]
Yeah, but I'm being there it went they went garden state

[02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:53.460]
I was actually there one once upon a time in America

[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:57.200]
All the racetracks never against it park

[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:06.520]

[02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:28.800]
Remember when they're having the meeting of the heads of the five families?

[02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:35.020]
Mm-hmm, and he says I don't want any talking about the drug trade. I don't want to near children. That's an infomnia

[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:39.340]
I mean you really have to be clever to figure out what that means

[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:44.060]
Use it in context figured out from the community. Yeah

[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.140]

[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:48.560]
The thing we had on there a couple weeks ago. That was bad that that moving icon, you know, mm-hmm

[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:51.520]

Just a coincidence don't you think and then of course always the same

[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:09.640]
And you guys to cover oh he has nothing to do with that. He doesn't control that

[02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:12.700]
He doesn't have a choice

[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:15.960]
He has to do what he's told like all the rest of us

[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:25.620]

[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:00.260]
That's shallow oh

[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:02.380]

The papers are happy to see it. I don't know if I want to see it. No, you don't want to see it put your head on my shoulder

[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:40.420]

Well, I want to think about Joe Rose man. He enjoys being a buffoon

[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:28.020]
He's not one of those people who's a buffoon because people laugh at him. They laugh with him like you know

[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:29.780]
Hey, Joe you're real buffoon

[02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:33.700]
He knows it. Huh? He knows and he don't mind especially with that big head

[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:10.420]
I'm just like Colonel Hogan

[02:28:11.220 --> 02:28:15.200]
Since he spent five years in style at 13

[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:19.560]
