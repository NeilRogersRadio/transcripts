[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.100]
The music expressed on the previous program is the basketball game started in colors and do not reflect those of the Beasley Bronchess group.

[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.220]
It's staff, advertisers, or agencies.

[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.220]
The biggest names of bests.

[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.620]
Not today.

[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.520]
Pen for the listening to sports radio 516s basketball.

[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.140]
Here's Joe's a gaffa gaffa gaffa gaffa.

[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.680]
Be clear.

[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.140]
Be clear.

[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:55.400]
Be clear.

[00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.620]
On 560 WQAM.

[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.820]
It's out of here.

[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.100]
Be great.

[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.240]
Don't show your area again.

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.240]

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.240]

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.240]

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.600]
The dislike of being by humans creates greater spending Wednesdays, including minutes from hours.

[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.200]
We're born, we start dying, we die a little more every day

[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.240]
Young or old, richer poor, there's nothing we can do to stop it

[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.340]
So we look long at that Christmas tree, it may be the last one that you see

[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.080]
Decorate your house in green and red, cause someday you'll be dead

[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.180]
I'm dying on the day

[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.820]
Dead, dead, someday you'll be dead

[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.160]
Oh

[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.040]
Dead, dead, dead

[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.360]
Someday we'll all be dead

[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.580]
It might happen in a couple months or 50 years from now

[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.120]
But no matter when it happens it will seem too soon to you

[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.100]
Uh-huh

[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.800]
So be sure of Christmas Eve when you snuggle into bed

[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.120]
That you'll thank God for your family

[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.320]
Cause someday they'll be dead

[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.440]
Dead, dead, dead

[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.700]
Someday they'll be dead

[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.380]
Dead, dead, dead

[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380]
Someday we'll all be dead

[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.120]
Who knows how many Christmas's are left in their short life

[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.720]
Nobody knows that's my point, enjoy the while you can

[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.440]
And so on Christmas morning let good tidings go

[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.280]
Oh

[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.740]
What a festive season

[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.600]
Someday you'll be dead

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.340]
Oh

[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.040]
Dead, dead, dead

[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.200]
Someday we'll be dead

[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.540]
Dead, dead, dead

[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.920]
Everyone you know

[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.340]
Dead, alive

[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.420]
Very Merry Christmas to you

[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.880]
Dead, dead

[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.340]
That was up 147

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.100]
Woo

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.000]
Merry Christmas everybody

[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.820]
Yeah the goyema got the Christmas trees and the Christmas lights on

[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.160]
It's not even Thanksgiving yet

[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.860]
We got two days to go to Thanksgiving

[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.820]
And you farbicin' a goyema

[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.960]
They just can't stop rubbing our noses any, you know

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.560]
The rest of us who don't want to participate

[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.840]
You don't want to play the game

[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.120]
Mm-hmm

[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.040]
That was up 130

[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.780]
Well what

[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.640]
At what point do you think it's appropriate to start crack

[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.200]
Cracking out the Thanksgiving, the Christmas crap

[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.680]
Oh you know, if I was a boy I would have hit a good Christmas crap

[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.980]
And a good this year was crap

[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.360]
Oh

[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.160]
I'm a crap in my brains out all morning long

[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.900]
I don't know why

[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.960]
Maybe it's from two days ago

[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.160]
What would they was it that I just ate and ate

[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.120]
Yeah maybe because you're just full of it

[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.900]
Well, everybody knows that

[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.720]
At least I don't deny it like some people

[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.260]
Oh and speaking of some people denying

[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.780]
So the rumor according to George is

[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.620]
Well George heard it

[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.000]
Right

[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.600]
To the grapevine

[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.900]
Sure

[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.880]
That across the street they're very pissed off and fired up

[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]
About the fact that I mentioned

[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.520]
I mean why wouldn't we mention it

[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.640]
If we have some dirt on

[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.120]
Then why are we going to put it on the air

[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.880]
You know, it's okay for them to trash the hell to me

[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.880]
Oh that Roger is he stealing my

[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.240]
Yeah, he makes up the numbers

[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.400]
Yeah, like yeah

[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.900]
Right

[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.720]
But in the meantime they're going syndicated

[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.300]
From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.960]
Five hours right in the middle of the day

[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.800]
When people are awake

[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.360]
Wasn't bad enough when Joel Feinberg pulled up steaks

[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.820]
And he flew the hell out of there

[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.540]
He knew when the hell to get out

[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.200]
They're flailing and failing

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.880]
Their numbers are pathetic

[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.040]
Not that we got anything to scream about

[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.560]
But at least we admitted I admitted

[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.040]
The rest of our station we don't talk about it

[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.280]
Because what's it got to do with the game

[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.780]
You know, what's it got to do with the game

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.760]
So 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.660]
They're going syndicated

[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.780]
Talk like sports you know like Jim Rome

[00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.760]
Or whatever the hell they're gonna be

[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.820]
I don't know what it is

[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.520]
Something really good I'm sure

[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.280]
Oh yeah

[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.780]
Because syndicated sports in this market

[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.880]
Always gets at least a

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.340]
And usually right around a

[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.980]
Oh sure

[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.480]
So what happened to their big superstar

[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.320]
Jorge Sedano

[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.600]
I guess they gave up on little Jorge

[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.680]
And the interesting part of all this

[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.940]
Is what can they be spending

[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.240]
Right in the day

[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.780]
But by the way

[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.500]
And this is just a rumor

[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.120]
Yes just a rumor

[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.280]
Is that they're gonna move Jorge

[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.600]
And just sits in slot

[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.720]
Ah

[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.640]
Just a rumor

[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.580]
And we're sick going

[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.160]
That's a

[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.140]
You know TBD

[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.760]
I have a fear

[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.560]
Maybe I know where he's going

[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.220]
Maybe a way

[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.220]
Fight fight fight

[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.900]
Oh no

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.780]
Fight fight

[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.400]
Just a rumor

[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.320]
Mm-hmm

[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.280]
That's the latest rumour across streets

[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.540]
That's if the kid is on a way out

[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.940]
Maybe maybe he's going to take that job

[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.440]
It's serious

[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.460]
Seriously

[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.260]
Have the serious stock is doing right now

[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.680]
Toi toi toi toi toi toi toi toi toi toi toi toi toi toi okay let's see

[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.600]
Sirius XM radio ink the stock is 15 cent

[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.300]
It opened at 17, but it's already down to 15

[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.560]
Oh no

[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.260]
How do you like that

[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:19.280]
15 cent. A couple bucks worth of that. How about $10 worth? I mean, six shares for 90

[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:28.580]
cent. So say six shares for a buck. So 10 bucks gets to 60 shares. I'm serious. 15 cents.

[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.080]
I'm going to tell you something to the Thanksgiving from now till the end of the year we all

[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.020]
have off because if we're going to depend on the audience like like this email thing, I'm looking

[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.820]
at it right now. No items in this view and the stuff that did come in this morning, I wouldn't

[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.040]
wish it on Sid the kid. That's how bad it was. So he's getting blown out over there or else he's

[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.940]
going to take that seriously. He's leaving maybe. Maybe. Maybe. That's the rumor. We don't want to

[00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:05.060]
start any false rumors all the way not. So Jorge Sedano is getting shoved up to mornings and they're

[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.380]
so they're giving up 10 to three. It's called capitulation. Maybe like he's stuck. Huh? Might as well.

[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:18.680]
Might as well. What? Give up. Yeah. Well, we sure have in some day parts. I know that. Oh,

[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.300]
I talk about reading my mind. Yeah, we've given up because what? What did I tell you a long time ago?

[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.560]
When it comes to competing, see, it's really ironic. The greatest irony of the whole thing is that

[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.420]
here's a jock sniffing radio station. That's all about athletic competition. But when it comes to

[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.140]
competing, these people don't want to. Oh, we don't want to. No, we don't want to. They're part of

[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.600]
the fraternity also. You know, the one that we're not in. What does that mean? That these are

[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.280]
frat brothers on these two radio stations. That's why we, you know, we help each other. We don't

[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:56.600]
want to compete with that radio station. You pick it on fat Chris again. No, not me. Let's have the

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.720]
fat brother show the beast fat Chris and we can bring the Humber back. Please let. And who else?

[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:08.320]
And Jack, and let's bring it back and Zach, although, anxious, Zach, crants, gotta, gotta move up and out.

[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.400]
Now, gotta, you know, something I'm never going to forgive him for that. That was the worst act of

[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.620]
he's, he's a sabotage. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if he shows up across the street with the

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.740]
what's his name in the morning. Jorge Sedano. Nice supermarket, though. Jorge, no speaking English,

[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.960]
but good supermarket. Okay, let's see what we do have on the emails here. It's pretty weak. It'll

[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.880]
take, you know, maybe till the first break. Oh, here's the interim poll we did yesterday,

[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.500]
boys and girls. It was inspired by some chronic crank out there. Oh, the Eisner Mickey bits are

[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.580]
boring and the audience hates them and they were suck and you suck and mad at it. So we did a

[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.420]
little interim poll on this to see, you know, instead of just one or two Ojón provocateurum,

[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.120]
let's find out what the take of the audiences. What's your take on the Mickey Eisner bits?

[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:06.420]
446 votes. I love them 283 63 and a half percent. I love them. I love them. They're okay. 73 WTF 47. What the,

[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:13.920]
and I hate them only 43 9.6 percent in last place out of the four categories. I hate them. 43 and

[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:21.160]
probably a couple of those Ojón provocateurum goyam. They probably voted several times just, you

[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:27.960]
were angry, were a hostile, we just pissed off. We don't know why. We just, yeah. So 43.

[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:35.260]
9.6 percent. Overwhelming. They love them. In addition to which guess what when it comes to the

[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.500]
bits, I mean, they're so few we were allowed to play anymore. So I'm going to play whatever

[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.760]
they want to play that we're allowed to play. And maybe a little tiny bit of stuff we can't

[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.980]
play. Then we even had that one about all and not any other really terrible bit that we're tired

[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.200]
of hearing, which we can't play anymore. Anyhow, we haven't played in years. Is this?

[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.660]
Hi there boys. Yeah, playing bagpipe. That's a classic one of the all-time classic best. Some of

[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:07.300]
you people your taste is in your tukas, okay? In your tukas. Here's Madeline who sends me an email

[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:15.540]
yesterday evening 626 PM. I think I might have been taking a BM around 626 PM. And it says subject

[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:23.020]
Neil is angry today. Maybe it was that time of the month, Madeline. Madeline says hello. I downloaded

[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.280]
one day's show and I'm listening to it now. What's the matter with Neil? He's grumpier and lacks

[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:35.980]
his usual grumpy man charm. I don't understand why his mood fluctuates so much from show to show.

[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.260]
Let me give you one little clue to that Madeline. I'm a human. Oh no, we didn't know that. Yeah.

[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.580]
Why his mood fluctuates so much from show to show. Can you tell me what that means? I don't know

[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.600]
why why doesn't. Maybe we've ought to find out why Madeline's mood fluctuates so much. Maybe

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.480]
because she's a woman. Please tell him to check his blood sugar or avoid stimulants like caffeine.

[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:04.520]
I don't consume caffeine, which can cause a drop in serotonin levels, especially in those with

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.480]
diabetes. Serotonin, if you don't know, yeah, we know is the hormone responsible for positive

[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.360]
moods. Well, let me go get some candy then. Also eating bananas helps us to raise natural levels of

[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.000]
dopamine. Let me see if I can go find me a good banana. Maybe Matt Cassel ain't busy right now.

[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:28.080]
He's the top banana in bean town. Madeline, how come his mood changes so much from show just

[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.360]
another stuch, just another shot. What kind of cheap shot can we take? Once we opened up the

[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.980]
emails, man, made the phone call seemed fantastic by comparison. Error be malcontent every misfit,

[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:45.180]
everyone with a little is on emails. If it's actually like a comment or something worthwhile to say,

[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.940]
it does it become non-existent. The beginning, the first couple of weeks, boy, it was great.

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.300]
And they said what they had to say and they disappeared. Oh, here's some. An article. Here's one

[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.760]
from Ron an article student arrested for passing gas at school. Yeah, we had that story yesterday.

[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.380]
Did you ever find out what the drilling was? Says Adam, I have no life in the kitsner water

[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.940]
Lou. Yeah, the drilling is construction. And by the way, it stopped. I went down to complaint.

[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:17.420]
It stopped. Here's one that said, oh, this is from Gruber Tuchus, who's obsessed. Oh, look

[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.600]
at this. Come on, the Eisner Disney poll was so wired in favor of the bitch George must have

[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.820]
voted 50 times plus all your suckups. If he had a poll that read what current Neil bitch should

[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.380]
never be played again, the winner would be between Disney, Eisner and Chris Matthews.

[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.340]
Does this guy got good taste or what? Wow. Both are extremely boring. Both are not funny.

[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:42.940]
Both caused major listener tune out. Well, why don't you tune it out? Okay. Bye, bye. Bye, bye. Please

[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:48.000]
please no more of either bid, not bid bid. George may love them, but remember that A-hole George

[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.500]
still thinks South Park, American dad and Simpson's are hilarious. He definitely has a juvenile

[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.080]
sense of humor. Plus, I think he's hit his head too many times on the skinny ring floor.

[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.000]
Yeah. You know what I mean? I'm ready to get out of here. Yeah.

[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.000]
So good morning and happy Thanksgiving and

[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.540]
best. The best talent. You're his new projects. 4.00. You're 5.60 QAM.

[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.920]
The fourth leader. No portion of this program may be reproduced without the express written

[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.940]
Hey, it's Chris Matthews from HODBO on MSNBC. I'm his daddy is a Catholic

[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:42.000]
schoolgirl. Gone to see the John his brothers. I'm literally tingling all over my body.

[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.680]
I'm having this sensation. I'm back at high school and my prime day in his hiding place.

[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.560]
I literally feel like I've eaten a York tap and metadie and a cold breeze is blowing through my hair.

[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.720]
I truly have not felt this good since Nancy Pelosi accidentally pressed her hand against my

[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.880]
man-junk and the congressional elevator. I feel as if I'm completely naked on top of a

[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.340]
mouth-needing pepperoni pizza and drinking chocolate and you who make a plate and total

[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.880]
dish regard for fairness is actually worked out in my favor. I think the only time I may feel

[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.920]
more happiness is when I have to sit down and write out what I owe in taxes for the year

[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.040]
and it's almost half my salary. It's going to be great. Of course there are more

[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.520]
means that make them close to that happiness like interviewing the opposition. People have voted

[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.220]
for John the King like this post love. How do you feel, sir? Well, I can't hear you.

[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.840]
Go ahead. I tell me how you feel. What I want to do is through your brain. I feel the

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.460]
amicably gone. Go ahead. What do you want? Go ahead. Go ahead. Thoughts. Then I'll have to

[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.520]
let you finish and thought my guy would. And Chris Matthews, I'm a sent-be states. Oh yeah,

[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.660]
those bits are terrible. You know, between Ed and the bridge tender and playing backpipes. Yeah.

[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.600]
And certainly Mickey and Eisner. I think maybe on Thanksgiving day since the beast and who

[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.720]
else is going to be on on Thanksgiving. It's Jesse, I believe. Oh, the beast and Jesse. Well,

[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.380]
that's half a loaf of humanity. They're Jesse. Eisner. Yeah, they could just play that before.

[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.700]
Sure. Get a bigger number than Sid the Kid. It's one thing to have a big mouth. It's another

[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.940]
thing to have numbers to back it up. He does Lawrence Wilk radio. You know, a one or two. Not

[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.240]
a three. He never gets to a three. One or two. And sometimes they, oh, like that.

[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.460]
Eisner. But they can talk a big game over there. Would open up a big, stupid

[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.680]
mouth. Anybody can do that. But the fact that it matters. There. I think they're on the way out.

[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.660]
That'd be a good pull. Which one's going to go out of business for a serious or

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.020]
waxy? The ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket. Huh? Which one's going to go under first? That was

[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.860]
up 99. Although Hank Paulson speaking. It was up more than it was up more than that. And he's

[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.020]
opening up a stupid mouth. And by the way, fake Tom Jikker. Nobody cares about Alan Comes. Okay.

[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.360]
He doesn't even exist. Oh, Hannity Comes split up. Nobody cares.

[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:59.360]
He was just, he was just the stooge. He was the in house stooge for, uh, Hannity to pick a part.

[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:05.420]
Didn't work too well. Did it? Oh, here we go. In the wake of the expansion of the Bubba

[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:12.540]
the Lovesponge Empire, Cox active rock WHDR morning man, Jay Lalonde exits. Woo. This is also

[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.360]
from the fake Tom Jikker. It was very busy today. Lalonde says, I want to thank Kevin Vargas

[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.400]
and Mike Disney for my three years in 93 rock. Did you ever hear him, Jay Lalonde?

[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.240]
Nope. Did you ever hear them, Pazzo? Nope. Never heard of you, Jay Lalonde. Three years in the

[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.060]
market. Never heard of you. So thank Mike Disney. All you want. Go kiss him on the red nose.

[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.060]
Wow. And Brenda Macklemore showed up to get her hair dyed at a local JC Penny salon in

[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:44.540]
Downing California. She probably didn't expect to hear no. Unfortunately, that's exactly what

[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.580]
happened. According to Macklemore, the receptionist at the front desk told her we don't do African-American

[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:55.480]
hair. Macklemore said he was astonished to be denied service strictly because of her race.

[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.980]
Now, wasn't because of her race was because of her hair. After writing several letters to JC Penny

[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.340]
about the incident, they represented responded with an apology explaining these salon's receptionists

[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.760]
didn't feel these salon's employees had the technical proficiency to perform the service required.

[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.740]
Macklemore was not satisfied with that answer. If you only want color, I'm not asking for

[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.320]
a permanent salary, anything else. It doesn't take a special personal special skill to do that.

[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.540]
She said during a press conference last month, a press conference. How do you like that?

[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.520]
Well, she went to get her hair done. Actually, she's doing press conferences.

[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.080]
Macklemore recently called upon prominent defense attorney Gloria Allred to represent her in a lawsuit

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.720]
against JC Penny in the lawsuit. All red charges that JC Penny violated. California's Unruh Civil Rights

[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.160]
Act, which prohibits businesses from denying services based on race. We don't do African-American

[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.960]
hair. They said, how do you like that? Oh, here's an attachment from somebody that says,

[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.800]
this is great. And I'm still deleting it. What part of don't send me attachments and don't send

[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.520]
me links? What part of that do we have to explain to you? Maybe we ought to go like on TV and draw

[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.340]
a diaphragm. Right. The part where you say don't is the part that they don't. This is great. And there's

[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:09.560]
you know, the paper clip and I just deleted. You blame me? No. I don't have time to popsky around

[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.020]
with that. Okay. Say something. Instead of sending me some stupid article, I mean the last one

[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:21.520]
was good about the lady with a hair. Gelt. Here's one that says, hey, Uncle Cornelius, will you be playing

[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.400]
the rack on Thanksgiving day? If you haven't made plans yet, please do, son Andrew. I won't be here.

[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:33.080]
Neither will George. Nope. Oh, here's one from the fake clearance. The rumor George heard is true.

[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.760]
As soon as the kid will be coming to QAM, he'll take over a big-o's morning slot. Oh, yeah, right.

[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.320]
I'm going to tell you something if they brought him to this station. Listen, don't discount it.

[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.680]
If it's a stupid idea, they're bound to like it. Oh my God. Talk about a death wish.

[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.860]
Also, Fat Chris and the Beast will be working together on his show. Tell Fat Chris, I hate him and

[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.320]
I hate him being on your show. That'll take effect January 9th. Thanks, fake clearance.

[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.920]
The fake clearance is said the kid's going to be doing the mornings five to seven a.m.

[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.940]
Now, what do you think? Do you think they're really that stupid?

[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.100]
Yes. That's what you think they say. It's a will. I'm saying they're that stupid.

[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.080]
I don't think it's going to happen now. They are that stupid but I don't think it'll happen.

[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.740]
Oh, let's hear it for Fat Chris. He admitted they are that stupid.

[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.600]
Talk one up for Tubby. You must be on your feet. They must be getting ready for a big

[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.480]
Thanksgiving feast. Now, what don't you like cranberries? I just never got into cranberries.

[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.680]
I don't like cranberries. I don't like cranberry sauce. Oh, well, I don't like that gel. You know,

[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.260]
what's in cranberry sauce? Yeah. Like in a can where it's like a... Oh, yeah. That's nasty.

[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:53.160]
But cranberry is a great... Oh, good stuff, man. Sweet. It's really good. The best part, of course,

[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.500]
of the Thanksgiving dinner is the stuffing. Anybody who denies that has got taste in their

[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:03.460]
tush. That was only up 82 points. It was off to a really good start and then Hank Paulson started,

[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.760]
buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh and they all looked at him like, are you crazy? Why don't

[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.820]
the whole Bush government just resign now? Retire! Huh? Why'd they do that? Just have a little

[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.500]
decency. Obama's already working feverishly to put his economic group in place and they're

[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.780]
grouping and grouping and get them in there already. You know, we don't like you. And that includes

[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:26.860]
Hank Paulson. Everybody hates you like poison. No items in this view. I guess they shot their

[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.740]
load this morning. Six hundred sixty-one votes on the pool. What do you think? We had a shot

[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.900]
of a thousand. I don't think so. Yeah, I think so. Two days before Thanksgiving. People are

[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:41.420]
beasy now, man. They're beasy. I would die if anyone ever found out that I blank. I have nothing

[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:49.280]
to be ashamed of. 138. Half people liar. What are you? Spanked my weeny 98. I mean, come on,

[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.320]
grow up already, will you? You would die if anybody ever found out. That's like saying,

[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.880]
I've got everybody knew. If anybody ever found out, I took a BM. I thought everybody did that.

[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:03.120]
And everybody knows it. Yeah, well, have sex with prostitutes 46. What's wrong with that?

[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.160]
Emma O'Holik 33. I wonder if Disney voted on this pool. Voted Republican 25. I can understand.

[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.480]
Listen to Neil 24. That's right. That's our closet audience 3.6 percent in the closet.

[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.040]
Get stoned at work 17. Why didn't no George voted on this? I don't get stoned at work.

[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:24.520]
Sleep of the teddy bear 16 and gay 14. I would die if anyone found out I was gay.

[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.860]
Emma Virgin 13. Emma Crossdresser 12. Voted Democratic 10.

[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:36.180]
into a ballroom dancing 7. Watch soap opera 5. Vengeance purge 3.

[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.580]
Out of 662 vote. That was up 88. Not too great. But at least it's continuing in a positive

[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:50.480]
direction after Friday and yesterday and. Isn't that great? Yep. Here's one that says,

[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:59.540]
where where is it? Oh, yeah, from Jerome. Jerome Scrogans. I am buying Syria spelled C-Y-R-E-U-S.

[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.280]
And I'm going to be rich and I will not share my newfound wealth with George.

[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:11.740]
Signed tiny and crap coral. Not cute? Sure. Yeah. Unless I understand. These emails make you really

[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:17.460]
scared to even go outside. Okay, will you play the rack tomorrow then? No, I will not play the rack.

[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.580]
We can't play the good stuff anyway. So what's the point? Yeah, I know about Tony Cigarette, okay?

[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.860]
Oh, Brandon. Kimmy a break. Is this my friend Brandon, the real Brandon?

[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:39.160]
I got the story. I got the whole thing. Oh, God. I had tifters in WTVJ. Let me know it was going to happen

[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.680]
soon, but not this soon. Tony Cigarette was retiring at the end of the year from WTVJ. Thanks, Brandon. I got it.

[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.400]
Brandon, well, it's, you know, holidays now. People don't have the immaterial.

[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.560]
Hey, are you cracking your knuckles again? Yeah, God is going to punish your ass.

[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.580]
What biggest name? The best talent. He's a new Roger.

[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.720]
Sport Radio 560 QAM. The fourth lead.

[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.620]
The biggest names. The best talent. It's the big dog, Joros.

[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:14.140]
Weeked in morning 7 at 10. Sport Radio 560 QAM. The sports leader.

[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.340]
Neon God.

[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:24.300]
Oh, Fatboy sent me some crap. Go away, Fatboy. Go away with all your boyfriends from the ticket.

[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.580]
And stick it.

[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.460]
Stores are already selling crap. All Christmas.

[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.620]
It's too damn early.

[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.960]
Haven't even had work yet. And they want to put me in debt shopping on.

[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.300]
Dog. Nets.

[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.840]
I don't want to hear bells or sea little bells or rolls of holiday wrap.

[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.040]
I don't need to see lights or things I like nighting.

[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.520]
Surely to give a crap.

[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.140]
And if I see a sidewalks and the all give him a slap.

[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.080]
Stores are already selling crap. All Christmas.

[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.560]
It's early and every year.

[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.840]
They're setting up the major scene.

[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.220]
I hope that this don't sound mean.

[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.520]
But we just finished up with Halloween.

[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.720]
Stores are already selling crap. All Christmas.

[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.960]
You're fairy.

[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.960]
It's too damn early.

[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.760]
I don't want to hear people sing.

[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.280]
It's a freaking thing. It's not even saying.

[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.400]
Fade.

[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.220]
1032 at 560 WQM. Let's take a look at that Tuesday schedule on QAM.

[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.800]
We got the big O. Rock solid.

[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.460]
Two to four.

[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.560]
Mad Dog at Chulis 4 to 7.

[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.060]
Dolphins tonight 7 to 8.

[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.660]
Just an abomination of an hour.

[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.880]
And then we got Oh Hurricane Hotline 8 to 9.

[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:08.580]
Why is that?

[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.880]
Probably because Thanksgiving is on Thursday.

[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:13.840]
Oh.

[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.080]
And then 9 to 11 we got DA.

[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.320]
9 to 12.

[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:17.760]
What?

[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.300]
9 to 11 says DN and midnight to 5 ESPN radio.

[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.940]
So 11 to midnight we must be doing transmitter.

[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.280]
It'll probably be DA 9 to midnight.

[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.860]
Well don't assume anything when you're dealing with this program director.

[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:29.660]
Well that's the truth.

[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.560]
That's what was last night.

[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.680]
How the canes do.

[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.440]
Come on. Nobody even emailed me on that yet.

[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.820]
They win. They lose. Does anybody care?

[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.080]
No.

[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:36.860]
Obviously not.

[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.620]
So Jeff high a regular O.

[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.320]
Jean provocateur tub of crap.

[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.300]
Happy Thanksgiving Fatboy and you want to know how I know it's from the real one.

[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.040]
How do you know?

[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.800]
Because it's it's about evidently a sedano or a sedano went nuts about some rant about me.

[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.120]
And of course he's got a paper clip attachment on there.

[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.040]
Fatboy. I just.

[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.400]
I just check this out and I deleted it.

[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.740]
Oh well I forwarded along to you.

[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.720]
I don't know if it came from him.

[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.180]
It's amusing.

[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.500]
Why do I what do you mean it's amusing?

[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.280]
Oh it's amusing.

[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.280]
Listen to it during a break I just did.

[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.020]
What do you say?

[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.820]
He said that he be two in the ratings.

[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.900]
He beat you during the election.

[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.380]
I know that's why it's amusing.

[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.180]
And they're doing great over there and they beat us all the time.

[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.220]
And he beat you.

[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.680]
That's why they go and syndicated from 10 years.

[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.180]
And that's not true.

[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.660]
What you say a lot of times syndicated isn't true.

[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:23.800]
And a lot of things.

[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.220]
Give it a little bit more.

[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.980]
This started this message started with Ozzy Rodriguez producer of the horror

[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.440]
his adano show who took that clip and forwarded it to

[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.380]
Howard Davis who's the abyssal over there at Lincoln financial media.

[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.800]
And then from Steve White and then it went to let's see.

[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.100]
Somebody else Tony Viscardi whoever that is at the ticket.

[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.140]
And then he sent it along to Hester Jerry and Jeff high.

[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.120]
So we know it's the real fat boy.

[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.420]
Tommy Jeff high.

[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.000]
See one thing about you guys across the street.

[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.360]
Anything that you send to Jeff high he'll immediately send to us.

[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.460]
So just keep it up.

[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.160]
Just keep they've got a real leak over there man.

[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.020]
Talk about a mole.

[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:02.620]
Oh yeah.

[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.940]
They're all moles over there.

[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.060]
God almighty.

[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.380]
They've got like an open pipeline.

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.020]
Every time somebody farts over there we smell it at QAM.

[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.340]
Even all the way up here I can smell it.

[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.140]
Oh god.

[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.520]
It must be that Howard Davis again.

[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.480]
Not to be confused with that.

[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.860]
So he beats me in the rating.

[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.140]
So when was that during an election that you listen to a drink.

[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:21.720]
It's a fun.

[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.200]
I'm not going to and and he talked about how hot for him you are.

[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.080]
Right.

[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.640]
Swaycheville thinking sounds like to me.

[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.320]
Fat boy.

[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.700]
I'm not going to listen to it during the break.

[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.500]
Don't you understand I don't care about them.

[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.080]
No I do understand that.

[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.700]
Why would I waste my time?

[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:40.360]
Never the last.

[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.880]
Because it's a music.

[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:42.820]
Say it again.

[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.480]
Why I'm not getting into a tinkling contest with a bunch of losers over there.

[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.340]
Who are putting five hours of syndicated talk on the middle of the day.

[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.440]
Tony Viscardi was one of them.

[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:53.860]
Yes.

[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.320]
Senior accounts executive.

[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.420]
Oh one of the sales holes over there.

[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.840]
Well he must be a fat boy's buddy.

[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.080]
They must go out there and rub elbows and asses out there on the street.

[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.020]
You know who is the senior account executive?

[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.420]
Who's that John Weiner?

[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:09.900]
Stoo gots.

[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.560]
Is the sales hole?

[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.620]
Yeah he's a senior account executive slash host.

[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.840]
I thought he's a superstar radio host.

[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.220]
So they got the sales people or the air people selling and the selling people on the air.

[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.360]
Oh my god.

[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:24.320]
Where are he?

[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.400]
Uh-made of themselves guy also.

[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.220]
He sucks.

[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.400]
From Eleanor Breffer.

[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.000]
Oh, I know what is Ron and Michigan.

[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.060]
Will you get a life already?

[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.280]
And it's a it's a clip from an article she wrote months and months and months ago when we were having our big

[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.760]
concert times there with the Jolly Jobelle.

[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.180]
After a decade a QA and the King of South Florida talk Neil Rogers had enough to beat the book.

[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.180]
Uh-uh and then it says here how old is this article still listening in Michigan.

[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.800]
Old Ron not as old as me but it's old.

[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.340]
I'm not going anywhere nobody wants me okay and at least I'm honest enough to say that.

[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.420]
Nobody wants me I'm pretty sure these people don't want me either but I got that deal you know.

[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.100]
And you know what I'm going to stay here just out of spite because I'll take the money number one

[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.220]
and number two just a spike.

[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.320]
Remember that word in that article yesterday spiked?

[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:07.560]
Yep.

[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.140]
And that email I got it was a good email too.

[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.660]
We had some good stuff yesterday left over from the previous week.

[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.100]
Too bad we ain't got no more leftovers.

[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.820]
After Thursday you'll have lots of leftovers.

[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.660]
That's one thing about stuffing as good as it is um fresh out of the bird.

[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.320]
Leftovers oh thanks give me leftovers are fabulous.

[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.560]
Am I right?

[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.380]
Oh yeah.

[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.500]
Mmm that's hurt me a tricky sandwich.

[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.880]
Oh here you go George sent me uh this is great.

[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.760]
Yeah George wrote you wrote this is great?

[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.220]
No.

[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.480]
Oh fat boy wrote this is great.

[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.200]
It's not great anything that for he said now he's a groupie he's uh one of my

[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.140]
groupies for Christ's sakes and all of a sudden he's a talk host over there.

[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.480]
The King's won 80 to 45.

[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.520]
All right 80 to 45 what did they play at girl school?

[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.300]
San Diego.

[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.740]
Oh like I said San Diego what a bunch of pansies.

[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.920]
Armando the fake Armando says the other day I saw the new picture you

[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.000]
posted yourself on the website and the next night I had a dream

[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.500]
with you really no lie.

[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.000]
How?

[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.520]
Now George does that make me gay anyway have a great holiday?

[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.500]
Oh god get a life Armando get a life.

[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.220]
Here it is you and 80 San Diego 45 somebody emailed it to me.

[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.880]
Wouldn't that nice?

[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.180]
Yep.

[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.920]
Here's one from the open toolbox.

[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.480]
Homelessness preparing to solve an existing problem and it's not even my name

[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.200]
isn't even on here.

[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.000]
You know what I mean?

[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.360]
I think the audience should should get a real taste of the kind of swilla comes

[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:33.900]
in on a seame.

[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]
It's a press release about homelessness and it's sent to the media from the open

[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.680]
toolbox.

[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.180]
Oh god.

[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.060]
I told you these emails were going to be at a salvation of this show.

[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.060]
Oh listen to it during the break.

[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.160]
Listen I was really surprised to you.

[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.920]
What makes you I wouldn't have said what makes you think I'm interested in

[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.200]
anything any of those losers have to say over there.

[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.920]
Normally nothing but I thought it was so ridiculous that you would chortle.

[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.200]
Well I did.

[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.180]
It is pretty funny.

[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.260]

[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.420]
It is pretty funny.

[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:07.880]
Well good.

[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.900]
I already deleted and I'm not bringing it back.

[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.380]
Jorge Sedona.

[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.120]
Everything he says is wrong.

[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:16.860]
Yeah.

[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.320]
Is untrue.

[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:18.600]
Nothing.

[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.440]
What do you want him to say admit that they suck over there and we pound the crap out of

[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:21.940]
them in the ratings.

[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.720]
This should I get the trend out again.

[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.800]
Well I mean I wouldn't waste the time doing it but shall I get the trend out and read it

[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.620]
again from last week.

[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.200]
But they beat us in the summer book or something that I don't know about.

[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.040]
No they do not.

[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:31.440]
No.

[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.040]
In mid days.

[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:32.940]
Not even close.

[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.260]
All right.

[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:33.920]
Why does he say that?

[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.080]
Not even close.

[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.020]
Because he's a liar.

[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:36.260]
Oh.

[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.140]
He's a freaking liar.

[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:37.900]
Oh okay.

[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.180]
They think they like most people in the market they think when they talk about ratings

[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.420]
they can go on the year and make up any numbers they want.

[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.100]
They don't realize that I've been doing this on here for like 25 years giving ratings

[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.460]
and that when I give them out whether they're good, bad or indifferent I give out the

[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.680]
real ones because they're right there in black and white and print and people can verify

[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.760]
it and check it out.

[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.380]
Jorge.

[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.660]
Not you.

[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.060]
Oh I know.

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.420]
Jorge supermarket.

[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.500]
I don't know what he's bitter about if he's really going in the morning there.

[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.940]
Morning drive boy he's going to take a dive in morning drive.

[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.120]
You think Sid does bad in there.

[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:07.400]
Wow.

[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.900]
Joe Rose will pulverize his ass.

[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.700]
Oh here's from your friend grubber.

[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.740]
Talk to us the one who doesn't like this bit and doesn't like that.

[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.260]
Oh yeah.

[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.000]
This is just another sour bastard okay.

[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.980]
Just a professional sour bastard.

[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.500]
If Jorge is covering for you on Thursday and Friday know he's not going to work on Thursday okay.

[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:26.400]
Jorge don't work on Thanksgiving day.

[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.920]
He's a big shot.

[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.820]
Then please tell him that there are three things we do not want to hear.

[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.960]
This is the guy who's appointed himself as the as the individual who will tell us what they

[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.300]
know.

[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.720]
I know something I don't want to hear.

[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.220]
Now what they do want to hear what they don't want to hear.

[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.660]
One rock music who they want to listen to rock music on the AM station.

[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.280]
Two is vasectomy pitch.

[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.480]
We know he gets a saw bug for every snippy refers and three the roller rink.

[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.160]
It's all teens and preteens skating along with George on penifile patrol.

[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.140]
I know something I don't want to hear.

[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.180]
This guy's emails these emails yeah.

[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.880]
From grubber grubber to us.

[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.120]
Oh my god.

[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.160]
You want to hear this as much as I want to hear for H.

[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.620]
Dono and the biggest names the best talent is the mad dog.

[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.200]
Yeah, man.

[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.060]
Sports radio 560 Q.A.M.

[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.240]
The sports leader.

[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.160]
God.

[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.700]
We're back with one of my favorite people Tom Cruise.

[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.040]
But first let's get to something next.

[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:28.900]
A little more serious.

[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:29.240]
Sure.

[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:29.740]
Bring it.

[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.120]
Okay.

[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.520]
What happened with the guy who made charges about having a relationship with you?

[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.960]
Where we are now is a really beautiful place.

[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.120]
Madly in love.

[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.620]
Come on.

[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.080]
Oh yeah.

[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.260]
I know what he wants.

[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.380]
I know I know.

[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.380]
For the delicately.

[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.500]
How to play his stuff.

[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:45.620]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.140]
I get it.

[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.900]
What's important to me is casual sex.

[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:48.560]
No kidding.

[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.900]
And the pornography and all that kind of stuff that's accessible on the internet.

[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.620]
You know, I'm sure you have that.

[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.220]
Absolutely.

[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.300]
Yes.

[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.480]
I love stuff like that.

[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.080]
Right back with Tom Cruise after this.

[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.280]
Hey, Tommy.

[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.900]
You can hear it.

[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.620]
You fairy.

[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.540]
Hearing that laugh.

[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.940]
You know that lady like laugh.

[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.360]
Yeah.

[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.760]
So anyway, just to humor you because you get a lot of yourself to get suckered in by that

[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.660]
Jorge Sadoano crap.

[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.020]
I think it's the name that did it.

[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.520]
Must be.

[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:16.760]
So I went into my drawer.

[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.540]
My ratings drawer.

[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:19.560]
Okay.

[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.700]
Here are the monthly's for the summer.

[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.120]
Men 25 54.

[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.840]
First of all, here's the men 18 plus.

[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.440]
Many 18 plus in the summer book.

[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.580]
QAM 3.1.

[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:33.920]
Cross the street.

[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:34.800]
Not on the first page.

[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.780]
Not on the second page.

[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.460]
A tutu.

[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.100]
Oh, he'd look lovely in a tutu.

[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.380]
And then in the August of September, October trend, we had a 3.4.

[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.480]
They had a 2.3.

[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.760]
All making a gigantic move there.

[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.280]
They went from 18th to time for 17th.

[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.320]
So it wasn't many 18 plus.

[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.480]
And was it men 25 54?

[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.040]
No.

[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:53.340]
No.

[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:54.820]
Let's see.

[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.340]
July, we had a 2.9.

[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.100]
They had a 1.3.

[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:58.520]
From 10.

[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.340]
This is 10 to 2.

[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.700]
In August, 6.6, they had a 5, which they'll never reach again.

[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.220]
Trust me.

[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.000]
In September, we had a 3.6.

[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.720]
They had a 2.9.

[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.180]
And I don't have the extrapolation for October, but I'm sure we'd be

[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.460]
this is not out of them.

[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.200]
Just keep going on here and lying about ratings.

[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.280]
You know, keep lying about it and making them up.

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.920]
So that's why I don't waste my time responding usually to crap like that.

[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.420]
You allowed yourself to get suckered in because fat boys sent you that crap.

[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.060]
First of all, when you saw it came from fat boy, you should have gone like that.

[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.340]
My copy didn't come from fat boy.

[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.000]
What?

[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.420]
My copy did not come from fat boy.

[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.180]
Who did come from?

[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.720]
TC Meister, whoever that is.

[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:38.960]
TC Bubble Meister?

[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:39.500]
Yeah.

[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.320]
Bubble Meister.

[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:43.500]
Who's that?

[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.300]
I don't know.

[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.820]
Well, somebody will inform us.

[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.280]
Okay, somebody will let us know who TC Bubble Meister is.

[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.580]
Made up name.

[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.820]
Probably a PD Lenny.

[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.240]
Although why would he make up the name?

[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.860]
He would he'd be bragging about what he was sending it to us?

[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.500]
He'd be rubbing it in.

[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.620]
Oh, it's PD Lenny with the inside scoop.

[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.700]
Another radio yenta.

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.580]
The market that douse only up 21 points.

[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.240]
It was doing nicely and then Hank Paulson opened up a mouth and bup bup bup bup bup bup bup.

[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.560]
And all of a sudden went down.

[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.000]
How serious doing, by the way.

[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.980]
Georgia was sitting there at 15 cent.

[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:15.880]
What a drive.

[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.800]
I'm going to see if Maria is going to tell me it's a real buying opportunity today.

[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.800]
Maybe if it goes down to about 12 or 13 cent.

[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.040]
I might five five or $15.

[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.600]
Here we go.

[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.540]
I'm flipping on it and won't even open up.

[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.880]
And won't even go to it.

[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.180]
Terrius.

[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.980]
I said, Maria was stocking and it just it's just stuck there.

[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.720]
Why do you think that is?

[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:40.820]
Huh?

[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.140]
I don't know.

[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:41.820]
I don't know.

[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.440]
I don't know.

[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:42.820]
I don't know.

[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.140]
I don't know.

[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:43.560]

[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.980]
The douse is going to go in the negative.

[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.100]
It's up 1.75.

[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.580]
It's going to go in the negative.

[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.480]
Uh oh.

[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.220]
Florida judge.

[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:53.760]
Turn the way for Martin Gil who challenges a law to adopt two foster children

[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.620]
that he's been raising for four years.

[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.960]
The attorneys for the state plan to appeal.

[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.160]
Judge Florida judge rules in favor of gay adoption.

[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.200]
How do you like that?

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.800]
Yeah, this will not open up.

[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.280]
You think it could really be that bad, serious, Doc?

[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.320]
Maybe it's got a minus in front of it like they do.

[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.560]
Eyes across the street with their numbers.

[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.560]
Boy, they're really a hoot.

[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.620]
I remember back in the beginning when they first went on the air,

[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.880]
they got some wired 18 to 34-male diaries.

[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.280]
And so they had, you know, like one trend that carried them for three months.

[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.980]
Oh, this is going to be our demo.

[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.880]
We're going to own it and all those guys across the street are so old.

[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:27.560]
And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.380]
I don't like to remember that.

[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.760]
And then once that wired diary month disappeared and the real members came in,

[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.460]
they were like with a minus in front of it.

[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.580]
Start over like that.

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.360]
You guys can talk all you want.

[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.900]
You can suck around with very jackass all you want.

[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.060]
All these other media losers.

[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.060]
The fact that the matter is it's an experiment that is failed.

[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.040]
I mean, it's questionable whether there's room for one sports talk station in the market anymore

[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.140]
because this is a format that's just, oh my god,

[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.460]
talk about running its course.

[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.400]
Wow.

[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.340]
But we got four now.

[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.420]
And of course the guys over there at James Crystal Radio with their point.

[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.180]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, nothing.

[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.740]
Fredric in the focuses, you're right, the email sucks like the Doll Fans.

[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.460]
That's cute.

[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.100]
Doll, D-O-L-L Doll Fans.

[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.740]
The fake Roger Magawen who can't even spell Magawen

[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.700]
at uga munga at yahu.com.

[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.040]
Yeah.

[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.040]
Yeah, Tony Sigerredo is a zalky to that.

[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.620]
Retiring from NBC6, I think the ears got too big for the camera.

[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.560]
It's like when Dave Game got too wide for the screen.

[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.280]
Tony's ears were like protruding off the edges of the screen.

[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.120]
Kind of like Kelly Craig is doing over there.

[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.620]
Good morning, Neil with the announcement that Tony regretto

[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.900]
who looks like the love child of Liberace in Contracular

[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.500]
is thankfully retiring getting his ugly mug off TVs at the end of the year.

[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.320]
I'd like to suggest the following poll.

[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.260]
Who is your least favorite local TV news personality of all time?

[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.780]
Tony Sigerredo, Angela Ray, Brian Norcross, Rick Sanchez, Sally Fitzpitter,

[00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.580]
for I like this poll.

[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.520]
Walt Cronice, Joe Rose, Kimba Bo camper, Elliott Rodriguez,

[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.400]
Vilkamaal, Dan Cofflin.

[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.120]
Obviously there's some left off here, right?

[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.400]
I reckon.

[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.820]
T. P. S. is the fake Roger Magawin.

[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.380]
If I buy George some, probably finally forgive me.

[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.860]
No, they'll take the property won't forgive you.

[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.440]
Excuse me for speaking for you, but no harm no foul.

[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.160]
Now who was it that you got the thing from?

[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.940]
The thing, the email.

[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.560]
Oh, TC Meister.

[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.880]
M. E. I. S. T. E. R. Meister.

[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.340]
Look at this. From the fake Tom Jicca, George is hosted the George Zadano show on the ticket,

[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.420]
Yadi, Yadi, Yadi.

[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.440]
And there's Monday through Friday, noon to three.

[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.340]
And who cares?

[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:40.880]
Who cares?

[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.480]
So maybe George Zadano is the fake Tony Sigerredo.

[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:43.920]
Who knows?

[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.540]
Erda Tony, Tom Jicca, whatever.

[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.700]
Oh, here's more from the open toolbox.

[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.840]
Time to block that, baby.

[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.900]
The open toolbox.

[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.080]
What, what is that?

[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:53.680]
I don't know.

[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.680]
You get those two?

[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.420]
Maybe.

[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.520]
I mean, this morning I had like 50 from,

[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.100]
oh, I need your assistance immediately.

[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.720]
Thank you so much, kind sir.

[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.340]
I mean, coat the I've won.

[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.200]
Oh, brother.

[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.180]
Here's one from Ron and Coke on a Creek.

[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.000]
How are you today?

[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.440]
I just got this email from a friend.

[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.400]
I thought you would like it.

[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.880]
And just put it in your birthday.

[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.560]
It will show you the number one song on the day you were hatched.

[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.820]
Have a good Thanksgiving and keep your sack warm.

[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:21.820]
Says Ron.

[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.080]
And it's a, I don't know what it is.

[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:27.900]
I'm sure it's a link.

[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.180]
One song on the day you were born.

[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.060]
Let's got a link to a thing here.

[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.060]
You care about the number one song on the day you were born?

[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.000]
I don't know, maybe.

[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:35.660]
I don't.

[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.140]
Okay, thanks a lot, Ron.

[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:37.900]
Got a good idea what it was.

[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.000]
Not what?

[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.460]
I got a good idea what it was.

[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:40.960]
You do?

[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.060]
What was it?

[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.680]
Oh, I'm guessing I want to hold your hand by the Beatles or something by the Beatles.

[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.500]
Here's another one from the Faker and East Ocean, excluding athletes and coaches

[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.660]
who is the biggest piece of sub-human scum to be affiliated with the University of Miami.

[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.620]
Here's the list they got.

[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.420]
Slice to loan.

[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.380]
Dan La Bastard.

[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.000]
Gloria Estefan.

[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.160]
Luther Campbell.

[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:02.760]
Vanilla ice.

[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.440]
Brian London.

[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.160]
Charles Groden.

[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.000]
John Sakata.

[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:06.720]
Roy Firestone.

[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:07.880]
Mickey Erison.

[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.800]
Drew Rosenau's.

[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.520]
Manny Diaz.

[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.160]
Alex Penga.

[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.100]
Oh, excuse me.

[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.380]
Peanipicania.

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.900]
Hilly Anna Ross.

[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:14.300]
Lateman.

[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.340]
And whoever brought in Bufo.

[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.740]
Bufo Toads from South America.

[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.740]
In an act of fairness and equal time,

[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.740]
I'd also like to propose the following poll.

[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.520]
Who is the biggest credit to society?

[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.400]
Do you have as I ever produced?

[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.220]
The list is as follows and it's blank.

[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:28.880]
There's no names.

[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:29.500]
Ah.

[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.040]
By the way, the obvious winner of that is the

[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.920]
unmancipatable one.

[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.700]
704 votes on the poll.

[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:40.300]
Now what's the story?

[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.460]
We got the one for tomorrow on there?

[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:42.160]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.860]
Nice going, Eric.

[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.940]
And thanks to Ashawn from Hollywood for a couple of decent polls.

[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:48.720]
Yep.

[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.860]
Yeah, we're putting Charlie B out to pasture for while he needs to rest.

[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.640]
A radio host Todd MJ Schmidt said he's had enough of on-the-air

[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.300]
mudslinging by Radio Shock Jack Buppet Love Spongebob's Clim.

[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.640]
Clim is accused of stealing money from Clear Channel

[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.940]
and calling him a lion piece of crap, a snitch,

[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.580]
and a real modern day stool pigeon.

[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.680]
And he has repeatedly referred to Schmidt's wife as a horror.

[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.280]
Clim characterized his comments as parody.

[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.060]
Schmidt wants to judge to decide whether Clim is crossed the line.

[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.380]
The MJ Morning Show host in this wife, Michelle,

[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.720]
filed a defamation and false light lawsuit.

[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:23.340]
What does that mean?

[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:23.940]
False light.

[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:24.860]
Don't know.

[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.880]
Lawsuit begins Clim in Hillsborough County's circuit civil court yesterday.

[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.740]
Also named in the defendant's our Cox Radio,

[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.880]
which broadcasts Clim's Morning Show and Bubba Radio Network Inc.

[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.500]
He has absolutely played into every aspect of me coming back in my quasi-war

[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:39.240]
I've waged on him.

[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.180]
Clim said, what about phone?

[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.080]
What an idiot.

[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:41.860]
What a...

[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.720]
You're fairing.

[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.080]
The Suits says Clim claims to be exacting revenge against Schmidt and his wife

[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.120]
for allegedly orchestrating his prosecution after Clim broadcast the castration

[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.640]
and slaughtering of a pig on his show.

[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.620]
Clim went to trial on animal cruelty charged in 2002 and a jury acquitted him.

[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.540]
Schmidt was one of the top four or five people behind our arrest in the trial of the hog

[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:01.860]
deal.

[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.680]
Femton listeners of his show, Clim, to lawsuit.

[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.940]
Boy, like a bunch of little children over there in Tampa.

[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.860]
Jesus, God.

[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.840]
Clim also accused Schmidt of having secret meetings at the time with Hillbrostate Attorney Mark

[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.620]
Ober, the suit alleges.

[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.240]
Michelle Schmidt is former assistant Hillsbrostate attorney who worked in the Mr.

[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.060]
Meanor division.

[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.860]
A spokeswoman for Ober declined to comment about being mentioned in the Radio Disjockey's

[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.840]
bat. Schmidt's on vacation couldn't be reached.

[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.180]
His attorney, C. Philip Campbell Jr. didn't return call for comment.

[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.260]
Campbell said in the court filing that Clim statements about the Schmidt's are false,

[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.800]
but Clim compared the thing he said about Schmidt and his wife to a Saturday night live

[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.240]
or something.

[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:39.620]
Purity.

[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.400]
Well, it's chopped off on the right.

[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.260]
I know you're surprised.

[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.320]
Everything I've said about MJ is my opinion.

[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.660]
Everything is outlandish, Femton said.

[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.560]
He's not a midget.

[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.720]
Obviously, he's not a snitch.

[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.700]
The dueling this joke, he's are no stranger to public feud.

[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:56.200]
In 2000, when Clim's morning show aired on local Clear Channel sister station,

[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.860]
WXTBFM, an intense dislike between the men began to show.

[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:00.820]
Intense.

[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.900]
Clim reported on the air that a 500-pound Tampa man was getting help from Schmidt's

[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:08.520]
morning show to get wave reduction surgery and once been arrested for a sexual offense.

[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.300]
At the time, Clim's show was number two and Schmidt's show was number one in list of standings.

[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.140]
In that dispute, Schmidt said Clim violated Clear Channel policy and not to wonder

[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.840]
mind Bash or attack and sister station.

[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:19.900]
Schmidt cleaned out.

[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.260]
His office didn't return for a week.

[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.260]
He cleaned it out.

[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.260]
He cleaned out his orifice.

[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.180]
Clim's current morning show debuted in January and broadcasted for the beat but a boot put bump, etc.

[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.220]
So they're having a Schmidt fit.

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.260]
Why do that was coming?

[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.060]
So when is Sid the kid leaving, brother?

[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:40.800]
The biggest name.

[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:41.940]
The best talent.

[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.880]
You know, if you know, Rajax, you're 4.

[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.620]
You'll find 60 QAM.

[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.300]
The fourth lead.

[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.100]
The biggest name.

[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.680]
The best talent.

[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:56.420]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.

[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.220]
This is the Neoronger show.

[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.040]
This is your brain.

[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.960]
Any questions?

[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.020]
No.

[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.760]
You see

[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:35.160]
Doctor who was the most popular dance whistle battle of Christmas.

[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.000]
While the applause made him absolutely drunk andú

[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.000]

[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.480]
I'm ready to play some music on the new registration

[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.000]
What the last eight years gave us hyperinflation

[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.160]
In the new update

[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.400]
The ancient things should be in the past

[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:08.560]
With all the repovertoos in your ass

[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.720]
All your moves should crack and cause that breakdown

[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.380]
Here's a bell I've kept, not a great vacation

[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.940]
U.S.A. is detonation

[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.360]
And now the god is hyperinflation

[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.000]
U.F.A.

[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.540]
11.02 at 5.60

[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.420]
There's a heavy pulsing and I'm sure it's on tape

[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.540]
I hope it's on tape

[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.080]
That was hanging on man, it's up 13.70

[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.660]
And serious is hanging in there, 15 cent

[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.200]
You want some?

[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.800]
Oh no, thank you, I'm cereal

[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.540]
For free

[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.740]
So we never found out who was that sent you that thing

[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:55.480]
Who was it again?

[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.800]
Probably a fake name

[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.720]
I'm sure

[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.900]
A fake name on the email?

[00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.380]
Come on

[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.100]
Yeah, that's all we get is fake names on email

[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:04.140]
All the fat boy, that was one that was for real

[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.400]
Unfortunately, the fake joy rental says

[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.960]
Pay attention to you since you often lament

[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.540]
It's to my negativity regarding WIOD

[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.160]
But here's something for you

[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.620]
Here's something for you

[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.620]
Says the fake Joey

[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.940]
Thank god WIOD is bringing on Phil Henry

[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.580]
One of the most talented innovative broadcasters in the industry

[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:26.100]
And in the era of talking clones, it's nice to see that Phil Henry won

[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.020]
Return of the year and two tweaked is already winning formula

[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.020]
I give major kudos to WIOD

[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:31.940]
Now when is he on?

[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.080]
When is he show on IOD?

[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:34.660]
Ask him to

[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.920]
Come on

[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.700]
I'll Google it

[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.060]
Alright

[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.280]
Well they called today about the bangin and clangan

[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.180]
It's going to end on Thursday

[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.680]
I'll have something to be thankful for on Thanksgiving

[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.440]
There you go

[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.500]
They're doing construction right up above

[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.760]
Oh well to be back tomorrow and Thursday but then

[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.200]
But a beep bit of boop bit about they're going up to the 85th floor

[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.140]
Let's see, I don't see anything about Phil Henry on here

[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.880]
On the IOD website, I see Jimmy Cifilis

[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.800]
Okay, here's schedule, let's see, schedule

[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.460]
Coast to coast, South Florida's first news

[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.040]
That's Jimmy Cifilis

[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.920]
Glen Dreck, Rush Lardas Limbaugh, the Schmidt show

[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.320]
Sean Hannity, Mark Levin and Coast to Coast rewind

[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.960]
Where they replay a tape

[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.000]
I bet you've had Joe Bell likes that

[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.620]
Oh that that was down 20 points, dammit

[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.340]
Coast to coast rewind, where they play tapes over again for two hours

[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.940]
Well there's nothing more desperate

[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.580]
But then again that's radio

[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.100]
This is the life we have chosen man, this business blows

[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.000]
But serious is 15 cent

[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.420]
I said I won't even mention the IOD should have taken a step further

[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.480]
And given cephalo the axe but hey a nice step in the right direction

[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.860]
Well maybe if somebody knew what time he's going to be on or whatever

[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.040]
We could promote Phil Henry

[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.600]
Are you sure?

[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.160]
Not that we really care but you know

[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:04.200]
So in other words he's come back from his right wing adventures

[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.780]
Now that the election is over and the right wing has got the other

[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.700]
He really sure did good timing on that didn't he?

[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.200]
Oh yeah

[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.520]
Jumping over to the other side and then all of a sudden they get a warrant

[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.720]
They get just oh my god, womped

[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.220]
Just like the dolphins on Sunday

[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:18.920]
Got walloped

[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.500]
Me

[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.760]
Frank says on poor Frank, Frank I don't know where Frank is but he's definitely out of touch

[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.400]
I'm so glad I'm working from home today since I left Florida in 2003

[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:29.460]
It's hard to listen to your show

[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.480]
Great here you and George have a great Thanksgiving

[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.800]
You too Frank, congrats on your new contract

[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.180]
I hope you took them deep

[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.880]
Yeah you took it deep alright

[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.560]
Yeah deep deep in my

[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.060]
Brackum

[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.400]
50% pay cut I really took him deep Frank boy

[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.500]
Talk about it in a touch

[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.480]
Out a touch

[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.100]
Hope you took him deep

[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.100]
Oh

[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.220]
I just want to sit on the floor and cry

[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.900]
A lot of people be talking about it say that

[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.620]
And you're getting sucked into attachments with stuff from the George Sedano show

[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.720]
You ought to be ashamed yourself

[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:02.280]
Alright

[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.120]
I guess I didn't teach you well

[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.340]
I wouldn't have sent it along if I didn't think it was just ridiculous

[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.140]
Oh here's this thing about Ann Colter, the three people to send me about

[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.780]
She's got her mouth is wired and she had some brokerage

[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:13.600]
Nobody cares

[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.840]
Nobody cares, okay, grow up

[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.680]
We won the election, it's all over quit with the baby crap already

[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.620]
Too many of you people are involved in baby crap

[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.680]
Oh Ann Colter and Sean Hannity and the billow

[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.480]
Who cares?

[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.260]
Get a frickin life

[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.220]
Oh Phil Bill Stedon and back at magic

[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.240]
Oh boy

[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.760]
As tipped in a wild back

[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.280]
This is from the fake time jicca

[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.120]
Lincoln financial oldies magic one oh two brings back

[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.060]
Veteran radio program or Bill Stedman to be PD

[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.900]
He replaces Bob Hamilton who left the station in August

[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.980]
We received scores of applications from across the country from qualified candidates

[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.060]
But Bill stood out as the right choice to lead

[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.100]
Magic one or two points out in the future

[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.100]
SVP GM Dennis Collins said

[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.800]
Oh Denise, oh my god Dennis Collins my ass

[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.000]
I wonder if that tomb is still sitting out there in front

[00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:05.700]
The tombstone

[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:06.600]
Yeah

[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:11.060]
I wonder if tombstone or the douse down 71

[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.080]
Yeah I told you I'm stone

[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.080]
Hank Paulson spoke a little while ago and now the douse taking a big dump

[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:20.120]
Coming back to work with some of the same talented people again as the biggest attraction for me Stedman said

[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.640]
Magic is poised to continue its evolution as a force in South Florida radio

[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:28.980]
With a stellar team in place and organization committed a success and growing presence in the community

[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:33.620]
It shows you really can go home again said below. Here's the the poop on Phil Henry

[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.300]
Here's the schedule

[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.260]
Segar Dave oh no

[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.220]
Oh on the weekend this is on the weekend he's gonna be on

[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.140]
I don't know I said he's on from 8 to 11 at night on the weekend

[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.820]
Well, isn't that a big deal?

[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.960]
And one to 3 p.m. Dave Zeppler with Segar Dave

[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.360]
Oh my god another make-believe broadcaster

[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.880]
Long ashes and

[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:01.700]
Exaltations

[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.420]
Another tamper reject

[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.160]
I'll tell you one thing man tamper is a pretty crappy radio market, but they sure as I'll have

[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.520]
Branced a lot of their disease all across the country you know it seems to be from Lionel and

[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:16.380]
Segar Dave

[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.200]
Maybe he can go on with standing to the coughing show

[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.340]
Turn your head and cough

[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:27.940]
And then you guess what which dog you they're smoking on

[00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.560]
Is that over?

[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:29.940]

[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.900]
Wouldn't that be a hell of a deal?

[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.540]
You get to stiff it

[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.300]
If it's kind of like the wheel of meat the wheel of smoke

[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.400]
What are they smoking and we can't have George do a guest appearance of course we know what he's smoking

[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:49.220]
So here's the story Tony cigarette or we're tears from NBC6. Woo! We big news

[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.220]
This picture here what did I say years ago about how bad he's aging?

[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.300]
Yeah, he don't look a day over a hundred

[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:04.460]
Broadcasting career spans 40 years covering sports and news and South Florida. Here was a silly sports guy and they made him into a silly news anchor

[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:09.960]
Tony you can't complain about your credibility when it comes to news because you don't have any none

[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.600]
Zero although he does know which runway is which at MIA

[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:20.400]
Remember when that venue jet thing crashed no that wasn't it that wasn't the ever glaze wasn't it?

[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:23.500]
What was the one that crashed like right outside the airport a few years ago?

[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.280]
I don't know

[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.620]
And Tony was on there breathlessly telling us oh it's runway XL9 left

[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.620]
Like like anybody would know that what which runway is with who the hell knows that?

[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:39.640]
Right nothing I guess he was showing his expertise on the Yoko community though he knows his runways baby

[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.820]
Tony cigarette announce today that he'll retire from WTVJ at the end of the year

[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:51.900]
Retirement comes after 40 years of an illustrious career with WTVJ. This is from Yog Yog Yog Yog Yog Yog

[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:57.000]
So you're right to join WTVJ as an intern in 1968 and grew professionally while carrying out a variety of jobs

[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.320]
First is photographer moving on to produce a reporter and sports anchor before being tapped as the main news anchor and what an ego too

[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.980]
Remember when him and sloppy Vellope wanted to be picked up in limos and given to those new channel four studios remember that?

[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:18.640]
No, which then became channel six or whatever to became cigarette was covered every major national international sporting event including two Olympics and over 17 super bowls

[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:26.500]
He's interviewed two US presidents traveled a Cuba for a papal visit and was source of critical information while reporting about major weather events including Hurricane Andrew

[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:34.980]
Tony has always been a key member of the NBC to six news team because of his experience is inside of the South Florida community as deep and goes on and on and on

[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:50.020]
We will definitely miss him professionally and personally we'll miss those ears my god I think in this picture they got him pinned back like with a safety pen

[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:50.300]
Yeah

[00:54:51.740 --> 00:55:02.720]
SIGRANO's commitment to his community has been clearly demonstrated through his personal involvement with many charitable organizations and it goes on and on and in 2009 he'll be inducted in the Miami-Dade College Hall of Fame

[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.260]
What is that?

[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:19.360]
I don't know my career is in the broadcasting Hall of Fame. Okay. No somebody mentioned that to me yesterday email. I didn't know there wasn't broadcasting Hall of Fame. I'm sure Mike really appreciates it now. Why don't they do it when people are alive not after they're dead? That would be too cool.

[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:28.340]
Upon his retirement from WTV J. C. Redd will continue to reside in South Florida with his wife Rosanna their children Anthony Joseph born in 94 and Samantha Rose born 98.

[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:34.000]
The following is a statement written by Tony SIGRANO to be shared with his colleagues and with the South Florida audience.

[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:53.580]
This, did you read this on your last night? Do we notice anybody watch channel six? No. No. Should I read it? It's not that long. Okay. Sure. No. I don't want to. Good. For 40 years WTV J's been my home away from home and turned treating me like family. Yeah, just like they treated Bob Weaver, huh? Hot Tony.

[00:55:54.740 --> 00:56:08.960]
They practically put him in the grave and closed the lid poor Bob Weaver. They've treated him like family. Isn't that something the way these people talk? God. This subhuman business the way they just discard people like used dish rags.

[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:21.220]
Now weaver the weatherman there was a guy man. There was a guy. Good guy. No BS. No silliness. Well, he, you know, he was silly when it was the weatherman, but that was his stick. Remember? Yep.

[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:31.960]
You're going to be driving. Did I drive carefully and used to like tiptoe? He'd like look like he was going to fall over on his tiptoes. He was a great guy. Weaver the weatherman. Now he's dead. They screwed him over. They blew him out and he died.

[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:42.380]
I moved back to Maryland. Yes, I'm out of touch. You need to get on satellite radio. Says Frank. What does that mean?

[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:51.600]
Get on satellite radio. Well, how is he listening now? How did he hear what I said about his last email if he's not listening now? I'm not going on satellite radio. Okay.

[00:56:52.420 --> 00:57:02.200]
It's not going to happen. So quit joining the quit jumping on the bandwagon with all these other silly people. Oh, here we go from the fake Tom jicke. A whole release about the triumph.

[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.340]
I'm going to return to the fill and reshore. Wow.

[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:11.560]
At a boy, Phil, you're going to be a big success on the weekend. Are you sure? Absolutely.

[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:18.300]
The biggest name of the big talent. You don't give me a budget. Sport radio 560 QAM.

[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.140]
The fourth leader. Big shot.

[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:43.140]
I met a priest when I was 11. He said he would say my soul. But we made a D2.

[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:55.080]
I'm the way to heaven. And into his bedroom. We did take a stroll. Well, he was standing in his underwear.

[00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:06.580]
Told me to bend over and say a prayer. Both up is broken when they thank you, man. I got molested by the preacher man behind the rectory.

[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:35.000]
The next day, I felt like a sinner. And I showed up to get communion. Put on my tongue that was in a wafer. And it wasn't one of dripping up my chin.

[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.860]
Oh, my God. Well, he was standing in his underwear. Told me to bend over and say a prayer.

[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:50.260]
Both up is broken when they thank you, man. I got molested by the preacher man behind the rectory.

[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:14.720]
Well, the fake time jikers sends along some very important information. There is a radio hall of fame for a junior just like there was a Santa Claus.

[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.120]
And it's got a list of the inductees for this year. You want to hear them? Sure. We'll kill a lot of time.

[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.920]
Hey, listen, talk very slowly today. Okay, based on what's coming over here.

[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:34.040]
A email thing might actually have to take a few calls here today all the way down it. That experiment yesterday, which you suggested, by the way, was a disaster.

[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:41.860]
Do it again. Okay, radio hall of fame, 2008 inductees, Art Bell, Art Bell. Oh, my God.

[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:53.640]
Jess Kane, Howie Carr, Bob Collins, focused on the family. What is that? I don't know. Michael Mickey Luckhoff. What do you call me?

[00:59:55.400 --> 01:00:02.400]
What? So keep going. And Charlie Tuna. Not to be confused with the big rotten tuna, the one that's in mind.

[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:11.380]
What was that? Oh, I'm blowing on. Oh, my God. That sounded like I can't tell you what it sounded like. What did it sound like? Hell.

[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:22.940]
Did you hear that, Chris? Yeah, of course. I'm on the other room. Sound like like that. Oh boy. Trust me. I came out of his nose. I don't think so. Trust me.

[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:33.960]
Peter says, wanted to ask you after reading your Wikipedia bio was that small radio station where you got your start WCGR. It certainly was, Peter, not that there were a whole bunch of stations in Canada, when New York.

[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:47.980]
It says, I knew Mr. Kimball and the sons, Russ and George, Mr. Kimball. That's West Kimball to you, Peter. As provincial and crappy as that station was, it was at least at least at foster the community spirit that was nicely quaint.

[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:54.840]
This was the type of station where you can call them up when your dog ran away from home. They would learn everyone in town to be on the lookout for the month. Happy Thanksgiving.

[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.440]
Pete and Tampa, PSG are Dave sucks. Now you're talking to me.

[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:23.780]
So guard Dave sucks. All right. God, what a jerk. Oh my God. Dave Zephalowicz. Another another one of these make make make believe broadcasters. A large ass limbal wannabe with a big fat Stogi permanently a stuffed in his pus. God, Dave Zephalowicz. Remember those days? Oh yeah. That was during our tenure, right? Sure. Met him several times.

[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:48.840]
Look at this. Why Pahu woman? A Vegas novice wins 2.4 million on the wheel of torture. Oh my God. At first she thought she won two grand. All the numbers on the slot machine just in register. But a boyfriend wouldn't stop yelling and other casino players flocked around. Oh yeah. When there's a big jackpot that come running from everywhere, man. Even from out in a parking lot.

[01:01:50.380 --> 01:02:15.700]
That's when Jessica abguang abanag of wipe out realize that a $16 wage had brought in 2,000 in $136,000, $165. The mananza came Tuesday on the Wheel of Fortune Mega Jackpot machine at the California hotel and casino and Vegas never heard of it. Did you? Nope. The date coincided with the birthday of her late grandmother and avid Las Vegas gamblers. See that maybe grandma was pulling the wheel for her. She was pulling it.

[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:38.400]
Everybody was like grandma was with you said, Agnog. Ag. B. You and AG Ag. Buna. Ag. Agnog. You have Agnog on Thanksgiving or just on Christmas? Just on Christmas. Why not on Thanksgiving? I don't know. They don't have it. Well, why not? It's just not around. Agnog is good. It is especially with the ground. Oh, Brandy.

[01:02:39.700 --> 01:03:07.340]
A 24 year old babysitter who didn't plan on gambling during her first trip to Vegas on 2.4 million on the Wheel of Fortune slot machine. They're just repeating what they just said. I'm excited. Just as Jessica said during her phone and from Vegas. I didn't even know I would win. I just wanted to come here and shop. I didn't even know I would win. I mean, what kind of a statement is that? I didn't even know I would win. Is it just me or is that rather inane statement?

[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:38.380]
I mean, how do you know if you would win? You wouldn't. That's the point. Yeah. A 2002 graduate of Y. Powell High School, the jackpot on the birthday of her grandmother who died two years ago. And it just keeps repeating the same. Who sent me this? Jesus God. Frank. Her grandmother's game of choice was slot machines. Before hitting the $2 million jackpot. Agnog won twice on the other Wheel of Fortune machines earlier in the week where they stayed when they arrived Sunday night. She won $300.00.

[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:53.000]
$1.00 slot machine following morning. She won 280 on the 25 cent slot machine quarter slot later that day. She stopped gambling after she started to lose money at about 1140 PM Tuesday. She wanted to see whether she could regain her winning streak and inserted $16.00.

[01:03:53.120 --> 01:04:01.140]
A $10.00 bill of five and a one into a Wheel of Fortune dollar mega jackpot slot machine. And she hit two million. The audio. The audio.

[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.440]
The audio. When asked he asked her to name it

[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.380]
A couple sold 400 of the toys in 90 minutes for a bucket piece and

[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:36.800]
1945 400 bucks with some serial money. I was speaking a serious 15 cents. It's hanging right in there, baby

[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.720]
15 cents a share. All right

[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.480]
Here comes the bunny and there goes your money. I'm serial

[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.920]
The same year they introduced the slinky they borrowed 500 bucks to former company that was eventually known as

[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.120]
James industries to mass-produce the 20 fill it off the area

[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.100]
By the late 50s the couple had a 12 acre estate near Brynmore, Pennsylvania

[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.980]
But Richard James seemed uncomfortable with material success. Oh

[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:04.480]
Yeah, he didn't like that money who wants that filthy money. You know, it's got germs on it and stuff great

[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.420]
and yeah, oh

[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.280]
Wait till you hear this

[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:13.820]
He left this family in 1960 to join a religious cult in Bolivia and died there in 1974

[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.540]
He'd left behind six children between the ages of 2018 and a business in shambles

[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:22.860]
He'd left in 60 to join a religious cult in Bolivia

[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.440]
Yeah

[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.500]
God maybe he drank the cool aid died in the 74 these religious people always had their hands out

[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.460]
It'd given so much a way that I was almost bankrupt

[01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.540]
But he James said 96 at the Austin Texas American statesman

[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:41.800]
She later recalled in 61 is her toughest year. She moved her children near her hometown of Al Tuna, PA

[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:47.240]
Made a 450 mile weekly round trip to Meantodifactory while a caregiver stayed with a children Monday through Thursday

[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:52.560]
By 1965 she had moved a slinky plant to Holidays, Burgner home where it remains today

[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.220]
It remains they still make slinkies

[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.120]
Sure, yeah

[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.400]
All sorts I'm supposed to know that of course you are

[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:04.360]
They still make slinkies. I'm gonna go get me one and go out on the patio

[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.100]
All the way along and just sit there and watch it bounce back and forth and back forth and back

[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:14.940]
Using a mortgage taken out on our house James gambled everything she had went to an Nevada to a New York toy show in 63 and

[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.840]
Orders once again came pouring in set her son Tom James in 2005

[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.840]
What if that's Tommy James from like and the chandelier, you know not not more than how do you know

[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.660]
Just get more than 300 million slinkies have been sold according to a company history the toy now sell for almost four to five bucks

[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.000]
That's pretty good bargain for a slinky four and a half bucks. I'll say I'll take two

[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:44.160]
Well, no, I'll take one then I'll the other I can buy some serious stock with the rest 15 cents baby. Oh, yeah

[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:51.640]
James was also credited with expanding the slinky line to include slinky junior plastic and neon colored versions at center and so on and

[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:57.620]
The slinky dog made newly popular by 95's toy story and slinky pets among other products

[01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.260]
The gris is in sound that the

[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:05.320]
Roll steel slinky makes wild in motion is but one oral memory childhood for many baby boomers and the Ralph spring and

[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.540]
oral memory like that

[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.820]
Razberries, you know

[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.100]
The other one is the catchy commercial jingle which debuted 1963 and includes this refrain everyone knows it's slinky

[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:20.180]
It's slinky it's slinky for fun. It's a wonderful toy. It's fun for a girl and a boy

Since then they've merged all XM and series channels rearrange many channels and change formats

Introduce censorship on some stations aired more commercials and allowed them more on DJ's see app more and more

[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:57.800]
Now it's a struggle to find a station I can just sit back and listen to oh and here's a surprise

A West Virginia man who police said past gassed and fanned it toward a patrolman has been charged with battery on a police officer

Jose Cruz 34 of Clarksburg

[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.880]
Was pulled over early last Tuesday for driving without headlights police said

[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:08.220]
According to the criminal complaint Kruz smell the booze had flared speech and failed three field sobriety test

[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.380]
Before it was handcuffed and taken to a police station for a breathalyzer test

[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.980]
Well, I guess they didn't realize his mouth was in it. Yeah

[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:22.520]
As patrolman T.E. Parsons prepared the machine Kruz scuted his chair toward Parsons lifted his leg and passed gas loudly

[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:29.380]
The complaint said I guess it wasn't a thought with a silent but deadly weapon Kruz according to the complaint then fanned the gas toward the officer with his panty

[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.100]
Yeah

[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:31.940]
Yeah

[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:39.160]
The gas was very odorless and created contact of an insulting or provoking nature with patrolman Parsons to complain to ledge

[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:45.440]
It created contact of an insulting or provoking nature with his nostrils I guess right

[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.640]
Oh my god even nostril dominance would be embarrassed by this

[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:54.040]
It was also charged with driving out of the influence driving without headlights into kinds of obstruction

[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:58.960]
Kruz acknowledged passing gas but said he didn't move his territory of the officer nor aimed the gas into patrolman

[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.960]
He said he had an upset stomach at the time

[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:05.100]
But police denied his request to go to the bathroom when he first arrived at the station. I couldn't hold it no more

[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:05.460]
He said

[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.880]
It's a good thing. That's all he couldn't hold

[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.480]
He also denied being drunk and uncooperative as the police complained ledge

[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:15.820]
He had and he was upset for being prepared for breathalyzer test while having an asthma attack

[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.460]
The police statement said he

At first resisted being secured for a trip to the hospital and then he requested for the I don't understand

[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.340]
He's something yeah

[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:30.940]
Kruz said the officer sought the gas incident was funny when it happened laughed about it with it with him

[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:35.360]
Now that story is a real gas it says oh why did they write that?

[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.980]

[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:46.980]
Scooted his chair lifted his leg and passed gas loudly and fanned it with his hand toward the police officer

But still a decent paycheck twice a month more than you'll make any year mr. Radio

[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:12.100]
Which is obvious because how could he have all day long to be sitting there and sending me this crap every single day

[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:15.200]

Reports are coming into CBS for concerning mayor my amy mayor manny Diaz being considered for a cabinet post and the new Obama presidency ranging from secretary of transportation

[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:03.620]

[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:11.040]
The last time CBS for a new spoke with the mayor he said it was proud to be in the mix

[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:19.680]
However a short time ago CBS for news i team investigator Jim de fetus spoke to his democratic sources. Oh, this is from Jim de fetus

[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:26.460]
Fat Jim de fetus they said that while the s might be under consideration nothing is close to being final. Thank god. Don't do it, Barack

[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:27.760]

[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.720]
If the as is to make it from my amy city hall to wash nid will be after the mother of all background checks

There are five maybe ten people tops who are sending 99% of every email that we get

[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:06.480]
Am I right? Yep. Now Jim de fetus. He's one of the real ones. I'm sure it's coming from him because he sells a lot

[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.300]
It sends a lot of self aggrandizing crap

[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:13.320]
Like I'm gonna make him famous and I know he's a groupie so for sure he's out there

[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.880]
What else is he gonna be doing you don't have no job that I know of

[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:14.760]
Oh

[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:21.600]
That's what I want that's my ultimate dream is just to have like a billion dollars in cash and small bills and just my own

[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.420]
Personal row of machines at woodbine my own quick hit row in my own wheel of fortune row

[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:32.700]
Quickly this fun. Do you ever play it? No, no, I keep I keep pushing that while you're the one that sent me the book on the slots

[01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:39.660]
I thought me right setting up on you nothing all for you for the horse guy the big spenders. They got the two set machine

[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:44.580]
Of course if you play to max it's six bucks to hit, but that's okay. They pay

[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:50.860]
They pay good and then of course there's somebody there's one I told you the old geezer who smells like he peed on himself

[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:55.720]
Always there playing quick hit and always playing like one credit like two cents

[01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:59.700]
You know, I put it like in a $20 bill and keep him going for like two hours tying up a machine

[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.320]
And you see all these quick hits coming up and stuff that would really pay if he was planning

[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:09.280]
But of course, you know, he gets four cents here and eight cents there and you're just just spitting blood

[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.940]
Because he's taking up the hot machine monogating nothing just just sitting there on his ass peeing on himself

[01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:22.240]
Big Joanne pointin beats his Howard Stern has been funny or interesting in years. He blows his audiences is boring as him

[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.260]
I will say that he doesn't have the elected audience like we got we got like a

[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.160]
Oh, yeah, an electric eclectic audience all six of them

[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:36.720]
We got Jim DeFetus. We got the fake Tom jick of the fake Larry King the fake who might leave it out

[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:42.740]
Fake jolly joe the fake fat Chris even the fake fat Chris hasn't to chimed in today

[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:49.400]
Now let me ask you a stupid question. I know I'm stupid. I admit that unlike a lot of the other blowhards on here

[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.220]
I think stupid

[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.280]
Because if I weren't stupid, I wouldn't work be working for these bastards and especially fat ass jolly joe

[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:02.260]
But what is it about like the holidays that I mean people aren't out Christmas shopping yet. Sure they are yeah, if they're smart

[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:08.040]
They're smart. They're smart. They keep their money in their pocket except for our fine sponsors of course

[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:13.720]
And of course you'll notice every year you'll see every year is being closer and closer to Christmas the log gets empty and empty

[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.180]
That's so backwards. Yeah, yeah, the opposite of every other radio station

[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:22.040]
That's the ass backward broadcasting thing that's that's because it's this place

[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.600]
You don't want to buy any spots would you?

[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:35.960]
Fourth leaf they're smoking it out in the Everglades

[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:45.340]
There is a chemical that always seems into my mind

[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:50.020]
It seems to happen each year right about face giving time

[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:54.040]
It isn't part of track or even LSD

[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:57.880]
It comes right out of the turkey

[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:13.980]
If I'm not careful it will happen really soon

[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:19.000]
My head is bobbing and it just fell on the gravy school

[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.900]
Just a quick cat nap I promise not to snore

[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:28.120]
Wake me up by foreign I'll have more

[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:33.920]
If I get tired it's all because of ill trips or fans

[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:39.160]
Can't keep my eyes open will be watching page in toy land

[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:45.340]
I lay on the couch and in a short time I'll be right I sleep tonight

[01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:53.620]
Come 32 at 560 WQM Thanksgiving man a time to be with family and a time to pick out forget about the family just shovel it in there

[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.340]
Until you pass out in the corner and maybe die

[01:51:56.940 --> 01:51:58.860]
What a way to die though, huh? Oh, yeah

[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:02.420]
And I'm not going to be able to get no big Thanksgiving dinner here because I

[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:06.800]
Every year I say the same thing. I started seeing that to you this morning. We got sidetracked

[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:13.560]
Not that it would make any difference because I they just don't and the Canadian Thanksgiving already took place like weeks ago back in October

[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:19.340]
Yeah, and so the restaurants here. I don't make account at least I've never found one

[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:23.220]
It makes a comfort for the fact that there's Americans here as celebrating Thanksgiving this Thursday

[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:27.000]
How about some toy key, huh? How's about some Canadian bird

[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:32.080]
Sounds good to me bird is the word the fake Charlie B says

[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:38.520]
At least it's a new fake somebody right at least

[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:43.500]
He says I know that lately my pulls have sucked more than Chad pennington and every glory hole in willed manners

[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:44.820]

Though you think are you sure I'm positive

[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:23.260]
Are you sure so speaking of that the fake Tom jica wrote this a long time ago

[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:24.700]
I saved some of these because they're so bad

[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:28.440]

Of the day while still using his humorous voice characterization

It's not surprising how many stations welcome the return of Phil handry said T-R-N FMC O mark masters

[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:04.020]
Phil is the master of satire always delivers a payoff which brings perspective on important issues of the day

[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:05.600]

Who said Phil is simply a master of blending humor and issues

[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:49.440]
In Omaha KKAR PD Neil kelp Nelken said Phil and who was the perfect addition to our schedule a live show during the late night hours relevant foreground and outspoken

[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:54.060]
Response for the first two weeks has been much more than I expected he said

[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:57.820]
In other words, he didn't believe there were that many people up at that hour the night

[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:00.760]
I guess he's trying to say well good luck to you Phil

[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.040]
Are you sure? I guess

[01:55:03.660 --> 01:55:08.980]
We forgive you for being a turncoat and a right wing sell out and and turn it back. You know he's like a

[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:09.620]
comedian

[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:13.760]
Whatever way the wind is blowing

[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:20.620]
What exactly do you have against many d as as chronic frank? He's done the excellent job

[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:25.680]
Have you been to downtown Miami lately? No, I have not he may be Cuban. Oh, that must be because he's Cuban

[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.180]
But he's not part of the Cuban political crowd that you despise

[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.920]
Assume that you're judging. I'm not judging him at all

[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:36.320]
I'm assuming him based on the fact his name is manidias from Miami without knowing anything about him

[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.340]
Wasn't this kid the one that was making the counterfeit money?

[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:40.740]
Yes, no, I think that was somebody else

[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:42.420]
No, it was not okay

[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:48.600]
What do you know about Miami politics huh nothing or but I think that was somebody else it was

[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:54.220]
Not sure. I'm sure you're wrong. All right

[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:59.500]
Paul says I'm hearing on your show about this bovod love sponge. I'm looking forward to the challenge

[01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:03.800]
You should be nice to the ten people emailing you need all listeners. You can get at this point

[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.000]
It's been pretty funny though actually regards Paul. Oh from the fake Paul Castanova

[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:15.520]
He's looking forward to the challenge. Oh my god. You know, it's got to be the fake one

[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:19.100]
Because the real one can't be that stupid. He's looking forward any kind of a challenge

[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:23.820]
There numbers went down in his last trend. I wouldn't wish it on Hitler. Yes, it was one of his sons

[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.240]
Miami D.S

[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:31.820]
I told you that what now why are you being such a bad guy because there was somebody else who was involved in that that kind of thing also

[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:34.740]
But I don't want to open up a mouth until I find out who

[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:41.040]
But you already did didn't you already open up a mouth Chris no, he said yeah, he did. Oh, you're bad today

[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:44.080]
I'm getting out of here. I'm leaving. It's two against one today

[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.660]
You tub

[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:51.740]
I was just thinking about this weekend being the weekend. I said George out his birthday card with a check in another check

[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:52.700]
What

[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.260]
What do you charge what do you want to put it face? Yeah, but he did it's always funny one

[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:01.740]
The unusual one idea as it was a rollando

[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:06.220]
I wasn't gonna say any other name. I just I know that there's somebody else involved in such a thing

[01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:09.300]
In it their kid making counterfeit money. Yeah

[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:15.300]
No, you're thinking about the one whose kid was had the big pot deal in New York. Who was that that was the afforded chief

[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.320]
Timiny yeah

[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:21.620]
They my honey to owning my tomonie

[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:25.580]
That was down 43 points. It's not doing much. It was up earlier and then

[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:33.180]
And then they all started opening up a big mouth Hank Paulson spoke and Barack spoke and we don't want this crap

[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.160]
We don't want this stock down 40

[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:39.260]
Let me take a look at serious again

[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:43.800]
I want to keep everybody abreast of it because it might turn out to be a gigantic buying opportunity to go under two dollars

[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:45.940]
Our two cents. Oh, it's 15 cent

[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:52.800]
It opened at 17 it went to 15 and it's staying right there. It's rock solid baby serious rock solid 15 cents a share

[01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:56.760]
You could buy bubble gum

[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.660]
For less well, at least used to be able to

[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:05.960]
You never bought baseball cards because you know the sports not how about you little kid by baseball cards when you were kid

[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:28.960]
Yeah, because even as a kid I was a clutz. I've always been a clutz and do you do that?

[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:34.180]
Do you like run into like stuff walls or stub your toe on stuff for sure? I do that all the time. I'm bad

[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:40.520]
I'm a bad clutz, but I admit it. There's another thing people don't want to admit to go back to the previous pool

[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:45.020]
That was down 33. It's not too bad 84 10 84 oh six. Uh-oh

[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:31.800]
exchanging ideas with likes of quarter Schlotz guy and Prozac Ron he had debating and exchanging

[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:38.980]
ideas with the quarter Schlotz guy and Prozac Ron the third one or should what or should be done by

[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:44.700]
one of your polls is voted on by your listeners your ratings would skyrocket oh yeah this is what

[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:47.940]

What's my video?

I'm going to read the movies to them.

[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:55.960]
The biggest of all ones.

[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:58.700]
And we did.

[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.840]
Jack, those you need to know.

[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:04.580]
Now, please get it.

[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:07.420]
Those you need to know.

[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:11.860]
Get them all in the show.

[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:13.080]
And don't blow.

[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:14.900]
I'm going to blow.

[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:17.620]
I hope you don't mind.

[02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:18.620]
I'm going to blow.

[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:21.120]
Jack, pull me to give you this.

[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:21.820]
What is he?

[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:24.560]
Where are you going to go?

[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:25.060]
Why am I?

[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:31.280]
Anyway, we've got some real detective work to do now.

[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:35.080]
I wouldn't you know it's right at the holidays too, when people are going to be like Lee and Low.

[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:36.460]
Yeah.

[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:44.020]
The fake Barry Jackson says, and I got a hint of this because Ed Braillinor said something this morning on the Cross of Street said somebody earlier.

[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:45.180]
And it wasn't worth reading.

[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:46.480]
So I schmitcanned it.

[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:50.460]
But fake Barry Jack asked who was definitely not to be ignored.

[02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:53.600]
It says, Ed Braillinor was on the ticket this morning from 6 to 10 a.m.

[02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:56.480]
From 6 to 10 a.m.

[02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:59.120]
What does that tell you?

[02:14:59.640 --> 02:14:59.860]
Nothing.

[02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:02.120]
What do you mean by that?

[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:03.680]
That tells me, say the kid wasn't there.

[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:04.500]
Oh.

[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:05.300]
Finito maybe.

[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:06.820]
Finito, Adios, are we prepared?

[02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:07.920]
I didn't notice the difference.

[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:14.140]
And so that would like add to all the rumors going around about Sedona's going to do the morning.

[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:20.260]
They're going to put syndicated crap on from 10 to 3 and basically throwing in the towel because I'm sure Sedona works real cheap, real cheap.

[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:29.020]
So Siddi-Kid either took that deal with the syndicated deal with the not syndicated but with a satellite which I doubt because it fell through I thought.

[02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:32.340]
And or he's just out or maybe he's actually coming over here.

[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:33.660]
Oh my god.

[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:34.120]
Whoa.

[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:37.200]
Can you begin to imagine that?

[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:37.840]
Nope.

[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:39.720]
Five to seven a.m.

[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:41.640]
Although it's before most people are awake so that's good.

[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:44.820]
Now where are we going to get the info on?

[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:53.940]
And see a fat boy and some of our other radio spies out there would send us some worthwhile crap as opposed to some stupid audio clip from George Sardano ripping me an ass which nobody gives a crap about.

[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:56.320]
Then we'd have some information.

[02:15:58.420 --> 02:15:59.200]
See what I'm saying.

[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:00.700]
Ed Berliner was on this morning.

[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.080]
Don't you find that well you wouldn't what do you think fat so yeah whatever.

[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:11.600]
What do you mean by that?

[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:20.380]
I don't really find that mysterious you don't find that a little bit bizarre with all the other you know not enough itself with all the other rumors going around.

[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.260]
Ed burlinner.

[02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:27.480]
I'm going to get it right.

[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:29.900]
I'm 16 WQA.

[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.080]
Ed Berliner.

[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:33.940]
Unforced radio.

[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:36.240]
I'm 16 WQA.

[02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:40.420]
Oh another radio reject retread Ed Berliner.

[02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:46.480]
Pete from Baloxys is I'm thinking of taking a two week vacation to France.

[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:49.940]
I know that you've gone to Europe several times like several Zidian times.

[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:53.680]
I was wondering if you'd recommend taking a guided tour just rent a car and go all our cards.

[02:16:54.740 --> 02:17:02.320]
Now take a guided tour okay don't rent a car and go all our car you'll get lost plus France the only time I've been to France was in Paris and I hated it.

[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:06.840]
The people were obnoxious and the city was like a it's like an outdoor toilet.

[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:09.220]
If you're all a garbage on the street.

[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:14.380]
If you don't speak French man that's just Americans but no matter what you are.

[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:20.480]
They look at you like me like that me the frogs I say.

[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:27.120]
So I have a good time there but to take a tour don't you're renting a car and you lost and have a great time or not.

[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.580]
Here's one now this is pretty impressive.

[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:32.320]
Okay.

[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.020]
Oh look at that phone is ringing Q.I.M. Hello.

[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:36.500]
Hey I don't know.

[02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:37.040]
Okay.

[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:43.320]
You want the straight bill but my dad would say shit's having a kid but I did hear he was going to New York.

[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:45.680]
Okay.

[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:49.580]
Now I think he did say SH Sydney I just dumped it.

[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:50.800]
Sid's.

[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:51.580]
Oh Sid's.

[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:55.880]
So Sid's going to New York and he's out of there so he's sure not coming here.

[02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:56.760]
Thank God for that.

[02:17:57.340 --> 02:17:58.840]
So all these rumors are true.

[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:01.940]
Sid is leaving across the street and that's the rumor anyway.

[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:39.540]
There was only one traffic guy who,

[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:41.720]

[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:50.780]
Al Bumbe.

[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:51.700]
Hi, Mark Morgan.

[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:52.340]
There he is.

[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:55.520]
Now, here's Neil Rogers on 560 Q8L.

[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:57.540]
Who else could do it like Mark Morgan, huh?

[02:27:57.780 --> 02:27:58.300]
He could do it.

[02:27:58.740 --> 02:27:59.540]
He could bring it.

[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:01.200]
He could sing it.

[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:05.060]
And if he didn't have the right info, he could wing it.

[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:06.880]
He could Ted Wingard.

[02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:11.580]
Steven Jersey says the only thing creepier and more entertained than listening to a couple of

[02:28:11.580 --> 02:28:13.120]
two-bit jocks sniffing and outing,

[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:15.020]
Homer is gushing over a home touchdown or win.

[02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:16.460]
Is listening to the same honours,

[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:19.960]
Homer is speaking in hushed tones like they were doing play by play at a funeral.

[02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:21.900]
WTF, how embarrassing.

[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:26.720]
Mad Dog should save his all right for when he's watching Chad's package in the shower after the game.

[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:28.940]
You might be gainy, but these guys are haggits.

[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:31.280]
You're sure it's the least gay thing on QM.

[02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:33.180]
Sheesh says Steven Jersey.

[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:36.140]
Sheesh about the dolphins broadcast team.

[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.380]
They really sent new loads for the broadcast industry this past weekend.

[02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:42.420]
And don't get me wrong.

[02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:44.220]
I like a little dog and big dog just fine,

[02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:46.020]
but that's personal, not business, but business.

[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:46.620]
Oh, my.

[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:47.780]
And Jimmy Cifalus.

[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:51.520]
See, if we had somebody with balls,

[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:53.740]
and I don't want to knock a little Tommy, the real one,

[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:55.200]
but he just, you know, he just don't want to say,

[02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:56.320]
maybe he disagrees with me.

[02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:57.980]
Maybe he thinks Jimmy is a wonderful broadcaster.

[02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:01.100]
I mean, Barry Jackass is just a suck up for the guys across the street.

[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.120]
And he'll basically kiss anybody's ass who's on the air other than mine.

[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:07.880]
And Jika, he just, you know, he don't have time.

[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:10.320]
And as a matter of fact, his thing in his blog yesterday,

[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:12.520]
nobody read it about Bubba loves Bungie and about,

[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:14.260]
I'm not going there and yada yada yada.

[02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:17.280]
So Sid's going to Sirius and Janie where he's leaving.

[02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:18.040]
He's bailing out.

[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:22.220]
So wasn't that the rumor yesterday, the story?

[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:24.360]
Part of it.

[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:28.580]
I don't know is that they were doing syndications starting in January,

[02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:29.220]
10 to 3.

[02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:30.920]
So that would make sense.

[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:31.980]
Cidicated is leaving.

[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:32.800]
He's bailing out.

[02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:36.280]
There's stuff in the Sedano there in the morning for about 50 Cent an hour.

[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:39.280]
And they're going to put syndicated crap on 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:42.120]
Talk about just showing in the towel.

[02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:45.040]
Like they're always saying on the gambling channel.

[02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:46.160]
Oh, it's capitulation.

[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:46.960]
It's capitulation.

[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.940]
Yeah, remember that song with Roger Williams and Jane Morgan?

[02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:52.640]
It was capitulation.

[02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:53.980]
I know remember that.

[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:55.800]
I'm trying to deliver it.

[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:57.220]
Fascination on cap records.

[02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:00.380]
What a memory I've got for useless school.

[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:01.520]
I would say 1955.

[02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:03.380]
Fascination.

[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:04.940]
You got it?

[02:30:04.940 --> 02:30:05.880]
Do it or that.

[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:07.600]
And then there's instrumental too.

[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:12.960]
Roger Williams and some violin guy, some fiddle guy.

[02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:15.740]
Also on cap records.

[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:17.160]
You don't got it.

[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:17.600]
I got it.

[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:19.580]
I'll be damn boy, you really?

[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.220]
181 votes on this a poll.

[02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:23.940]
Who should be in the rock and roll hall of fame?

[02:30:23.940 --> 02:30:25.720]
Now, what do you have on the original poll there, fatso?

[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:28.960]
Oh, give me one second to flip back.

[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:29.780]
What?

[02:30:30.300 --> 02:30:30.620]
787.

[02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:32.140]
787.

[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:34.500]
77.

[02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:37.820]
And 181.

[02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:39.100]
Oh, we're not going to.

[02:30:39.300 --> 02:30:39.620]
183.

[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:41.200]
What 183?

[02:30:41.460 --> 02:30:41.780]
That's good.

[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.140]
So that means 978.

[02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:44.340]
Oh, we got a thousand licks.

[02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:45.780]
Yeah, I told you I'd bail your ass out.

[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:48.040]
If we left that other lame ass pull up to the whole show,

[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:50.300]
no freaking way you get to a thousand.

[02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:53.880]
I know how to cheat man with a best of mine.

[02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:55.220]
I know how to manipulate the poll.

[02:30:56.640 --> 02:30:58.740]
Believe me, lots of experience over the years.

[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:03.900]
That was down 88 points by the way for those of you market watchers.

[02:31:04.360 --> 02:31:05.200]
Here comes the money.

[02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:06.000]
There goes your money.

[02:31:06.140 --> 02:31:06.360]
Sorry.

[02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:10.020]
I wonder if we got any races on from Fraser Downs.

[02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:11.700]
That guy just is a panic.

[02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:13.120]
Oh, hand me no life.

[02:31:13.120 --> 02:31:14.260]
Oh, we got even worse than that.

[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:15.240]
On the outside today.

[02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:17.660]
We got Roger Houston from the meadows in the snow.

[02:31:17.660 --> 02:31:18.920]
They're racing in the snow, George.

[02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:20.700]
Ooh, they always do.

[02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:20.960]
They always do.

[02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:23.480]
Trady racing fifth.

[02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:24.820]
Bell Harbor baby.

[02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:26.660]
Sixth on the outside.

[02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:28.660]
That's bio-joba.

[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:29.400]
Seven.

[02:31:29.660 --> 02:31:30.640]
Just catch it.

[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:31.320]
The meadows.

[02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:33.040]
Roger Houston, man.

[02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:35.620]
Talk about a self-indulgent A-hole.

[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:37.080]
Three cars.

[02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:39.100]
We go bigger than the entire universe.

[02:31:39.280 --> 02:31:40.360]
28 and four.

[02:31:40.580 --> 02:31:40.960]
Uh-oh.

[02:31:41.180 --> 02:31:41.660]
Outside.

[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.100]
Just one.

[02:31:42.380 --> 02:31:44.040]
He jumped it off as they said.

[02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:45.900]
I don't know why they say that.

[02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:48.080]
Here comes electric storm.

[02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:51.160]
It's like snowing, swashing, and speeding, and puking.

[02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:55.920]
They think the horse can enjoy that running in the, uh, brutal weather.

[02:31:56.580 --> 02:31:57.280]
Uh, no.

[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:01.200]
I think we got a call of the S-P-C-A.

[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.420]
Hand me no life.

[02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:03.300]
Call the heated people.

[02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:04.840]
The electric storm battling to the wire.

[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:07.240]
Yeah.

[02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:07.520]
What?

[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:08.800]
Fixing.

[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:10.400]
He didn't call it.

[02:32:10.400 --> 02:32:10.900]
It was too close.

[02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.600]
I bet you said that he, I can't believe he didn't call it.

[02:32:13.640 --> 02:32:14.300]
He's got a big mouth.

[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:16.040]
Adaboy, Roger Houston.

[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:19.360]
He was the first public address announcer, the first race caller at Pompello Park.

[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:20.280]
Did you know that now you do?

[02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:20.460]
Nope.

[02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:22.100]
I told you that before, but you forgot.

[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:22.560]
What?

[02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:28.640]
Listen to him, West Palm says, Neil, I love Mad Dog and Joe Rose, but this Joey Porter stuff is a bit much.

[02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:30.340]
Big O said that Porter should get a suspension.

[02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:36.000]
Mad Dog answered by saying that Big O never played football, which is all beside the point that a player can't ignore it coaches orders.

[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:37.640]
I don't care how passionate he is.

[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:39.420]
What do you tell the next guy who does the same thing?

[02:32:39.680 --> 02:32:40.980]
I could imagine Shula's reaction.

[02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:43.800]
Mad Dog also had the best of war in Sape on the day.

[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:44.860]
I guess he had a minute to kill.

[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:47.100]
Turned over to 790 this morning.

[02:32:47.240 --> 02:32:49.980]
Ed Burlinter was hosting Gator Seminole's bashing each other.

[02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:50.680]
Kill me now.

[02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:55.780]
Not sure if Dicky Farco has a show, but he calls in every Saturday to an old-e show on 960 that I listen to.

[02:32:56.660 --> 02:33:01.740]
Don't know what Ron and Paul's ratings are on 98.7, but the company had to put him on there before he would sign a new contract.

[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:03.980]
They moved Bob and Tom who always do well to 94.3.

[02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:05.380]
Listen to him, West Palm.

[02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:05.980]
Thank you, Michael.

[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:08.780]
Joey Porter, my ass, man.

[02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:09.440]
What a jerk.

[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:10.980]
And then Chris is sitting here.

[02:33:11.060 --> 02:33:11.860]
In fact, Chris Defendigam.

[02:33:11.880 --> 02:33:12.920]
What's wrong with Joey Porter?

[02:33:13.340 --> 02:33:14.200]
Besides, he's an A-hole.

[02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:16.200]
I got a big mouth and get stupid penalties.

[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:17.420]
What's wrong with the mother and dad?

[02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:21.040]
Are you still defending the defenseless?

[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:21.920]
Well, no.

[02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:24.600]
I mean, like I saw Sparano telling someone to get off the field.

[02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:26.000]
I didn't realize it was Joey's.

[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:26.720]
It was Joey.

[02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:29.160]
And he waved him off like a screw you, man.

[02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:30.340]
Yeah, so I didn't see him wave him off.

[02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:32.020]
Screw you, you guinea bastard.

[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:33.420]
That's what he was basically saying.

[02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:33.700]
You know?

[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.640]
I don't like his altitude.

[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:36.680]
He's a real turd.

[02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:37.280]
Joey Porter.

[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:38.480]
A real turd burger.

[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:42.800]
And you know, it's the way the whole team like lost their cool at the end.

[02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:44.080]
They were just so embarrassed and humiliated.

[02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:47.380]
I didn't see the Patriots doing that the first time when the Adolfin just smeared them all

[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:48.580]
over the field up in Foxboro.

[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:49.240]
Did you?

[02:33:49.580 --> 02:33:49.700]
Nope.

[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:50.400]
No.

[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:54.000]
That's because the Patriots have two things.

[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:56.000]
Class and ass.

[02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:57.800]
The biggest name.

[02:33:57.980 --> 02:33:58.980]
That's a mass task.

[02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:00.200]
Is it your budget?

[02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:01.040]
Or a man?

[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:02.620]
The 5.60 QAM.

[02:34:02.820 --> 02:34:06.020]
The biggest name.

[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:07.260]
The best task.

[02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:08.660]
It's the man dog.

[02:34:09.260 --> 02:34:10.760]
Man, the champion.

[02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:12.480]
The 4.70.

[02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:14.040]
The 5.60 QAM.

The ب was born 24 years earlier than my sister was adopted as a child.

[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:03.900]
Starlight is...

[02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:07.080]
Starlight songs are on the strong side during the New Zealand, The Westị Square, 65 when,

[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:07.080]

[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:07.080]

[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:13.520]
on Crouch with pain.

[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:13.660]
Hey

[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:14.420]
the Panther's one

[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:15.680]
is a last but any interest

[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:17.540]
one thirty two and five sixty

[02:36:17.540 --> 02:36:22.140]
sixty one No hurry К

[02:36:22.140 --> 02:36:26.780]
And we have any Saturday.

[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:28.940]
No I'm talking about Monday

[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:30.180]
Two Friday weekends that we

[02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:31.320]
just right that off. Okay.

[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:32.860]
Okay, that's a lost loser.

[02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:38.260]
Oh, you know, here, this, this email, now I realize some of these may take a little while

[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:39.380]
before they come through, you know?

[02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:40.200]
Yeah.

[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:43.260]
This is the epitome of what the emails have turned into.

[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:45.260]
Subject, Sid.

[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:47.940]
Neil, don't let these people BS you.

[02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:50.300]
Sid is off right now because his wife just had a baby.

[02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:50.740]
Joe.

[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:54.260]
Oh, thanks for the bulletin, Joe.

[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:58.640]
We just got through talking like five minutes ago about all of this, but a beep, but a beep,

[02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:02.720]
but a bop and a wife had a baby, his second kid, and he's going to a serious in January,

[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:04.560]
in Yadda Yadda Yadda Yadda, all these other rumors.

[02:37:06.020 --> 02:37:09.180]
As if anybody really cares, you know, when you're doing ones and twos in the book, I mean,

[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:10.540]
it's like a gigantic loss.

[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:10.720]
No.

[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:11.180]
No.

[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:15.640]
A H. Oh, what great initials those are.

[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:20.080]
A H says, dear Neil, you were thinking of Alabera, a scapegoat, a travertress, a reporter,

[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:21.360]
is nice and eff you were nice kids.

[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:22.060]
Well, that's good.

[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:23.340]
They were nice kids.

[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:25.020]
It sounds like maybe they're dead or something.

[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:25.760]
They were nice kids.

[02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:27.800]
Maybe they're not nice adults.

[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:28.840]
I don't know what that means.

[02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:31.940]
The fake Larry King says, tell George to listen to the station.

[02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:33.960]
Mike Paxton does traffic on WQM.

[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:34.860]
I guess what we don't know.

[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:35.720]
No, no, no, no.

[02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:36.280]
We don't care.

[02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:37.860]
We don't want to.

[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:40.280]
Clarence Lotto was the W.I.D.

[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:42.140]
Jet Copter was the best.

[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:45.040]
Says the fake Larry King.

[02:37:45.780 --> 02:37:46.320]
Clarence Lotto.

[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:47.980]
Boy, that goes back a long ways.

[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:49.120]
I don't know.

[02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:51.780]
I'm wondering if Clarence Lotto also did traffic on.

[02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:53.280]
I don't think we had traffic on KAT.

[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:53.960]
I don't know.

[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:57.280]
But that name sure rings a couple of bells.

[02:37:57.460 --> 02:37:58.100]
Clarence Lotto.

[02:37:58.560 --> 02:37:59.800]
I wonder if he's kind of Trent.

[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.120]
I wonder if he's got pom-poms.

[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:03.180]
That was down 37.

[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:05.320]
It's like, yo, simmering it slow cook.

[02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:05.880]
It's okay.

[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.640]
Steve says, have been a fan since you were Symbol Cast in Tampa.

[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:11.500]
You are great entertainment.

[02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:12.780]
Yes, I am, Steve.

[02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:14.660]
I'm a hell of a stupid old fag.

[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:18.020]
I saw commercial on TV last night that made me laugh.

[02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:20.620]
Ford is offering two years of free serious radio

[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:21.720]
with the purchase of a new car.

[02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:23.580]
That will make me run out and buy a new explorer.

[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:24.180]
Thanks, Steve.

[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:24.660]
Yeah.

[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:28.240]
Two years, my ass.

[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:32.340]
I wonder if they want to guarantee that they're going to get the serious for two years.

[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:35.440]
Let's see how that serious stock is doing.

[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:36.500]
That was only down 44.

[02:38:36.620 --> 02:38:38.740]
It's like I said, it's marginal.

[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:40.400]
Click on that baby.

[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:41.360]
Let's see if it'll go through.

[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:42.480]
It's having a there.

[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:43.100]
It's crawling.

[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:43.680]
There it is.

[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:44.800]
15 cent.

[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:45.960]
Study is a rock.

[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:48.560]
Started the day at 17.

[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:52.380]
It's then went immediately down to 15 and it's steady as a rock.

[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:53.000]
That's right.

[02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:54.540]
15 cent.

[02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:57.300]
Anybody want to buy some serious today?

[02:38:58.400 --> 02:38:59.000]
I'm good.

[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:00.820]
I got another story in my pile.

[02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:04.360]
Oh, where the hell is it?

[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:06.260]
Oh, don't tell me I lost it.

[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:07.720]
That would know I didn't lose it.

[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.940]
Sirius XM, this was from a few days ago.

[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:12.900]
When it was 17 cents.

[02:39:13.140 --> 02:39:13.620]
Okay.

[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:16.520]
And it says this is from CNNMoney.com.

[02:39:17.020 --> 02:39:18.580]
Sirius XM at 17 cents.

[02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:19.320]
Look out below.

[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:25.820]
The satellite radio company has to deal with Detroit's woes, a tapped out consumer and its own debt.

[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:28.180]
So we've been at 20 cents a share of the stock's not a buy.

[02:39:28.340 --> 02:39:29.020]
And now it's 15.

[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:31.740]
Brother, can you spare a dime?

[02:39:31.900 --> 02:39:35.500]
It says during the Great Depression XSense, could buy a little something for those really hard up.

[02:39:36.220 --> 02:39:40.120]
During this financial crisis, asked for two dimes and you can get a share of Sirius XM.

[02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:41.400]
That's right.

[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:45.940]
The stock of the much-bally-hood satellite radio merger has plunged more than 90% this year,

[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:47.820]
and was trading recently at just 15 cents.

[02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:50.300]
It says 17, but that's 15.

[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:56.820]
And now several aimless wonder of Sirius XM will even be able to last much longer without a major restructuring.

[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:02.660]
The outlook for Sirius XM has grown increasingly worrisome at the current time looks bleak.

[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:05.120]
Said Frederick Moran and aimless with a Stanford group.

[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:09.620]
At this point, you have to question whether Sirius XM will survive 2009 in its current structure.

[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:12.800]
There is a likelihood that it could enter bankruptcy.

[02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:15.340]
Oh no, how are they going to pay? How are that 100 million?

[02:40:15.860 --> 02:40:17.540]
How are they going to pay CID the kid if he goes up there?

[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:22.180]
The company would not officially comment about its stock pricing concerns about bankruptcy.

[02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:23.400]
How did it get to this point?

[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:29.840]
Sirius XM was officially formed this July after the FCC finally approved the merger of the Asians only two satellite radio firms.

[02:40:30.260 --> 02:40:35.800]
The two companies which charge customers a monthly subscription have been losing money since their inception because of its many big expenses.

[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:38.700]
First there was the huge upfront cost to launch their satellites.

[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:41.440]
Both companies also spent heavily on marketing to attract customers.

[02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:45.380]
Finally and most notably, there's the huge price tag to lure talent.

[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:49.900]
Howard Stern for example has got a five year, $500 million deal at the beginning of January 2006.

[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:52.360]
Big three posed big problem for Sirius.

[02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:55.400]
The biggest problem is the company's reliance on auto industry.

[02:40:55.780 --> 02:41:00.100]
Sirius XM has got deals with all the major car makers that have satellite radio is pre-installed in their vehicles.

[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:03.380]
GM forward and crash through our begging Congress for that bailout.

[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:06.460]
And speculation is swirling that one or more of the big three may have to file for bankruptcy.

[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:08.560]
Is auto sales have plunged this year.

[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:15.340]
And while Detroit's Asian rivals aren't facing near-term cash crutches, it's not as if Toyota haunted Nissan or enjoying healthy demand.

[02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:20.200]
What's more the credit crunch has made it tougher for people who might want to buy a new cardigan auto loan in the first place.

[02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:24.000]
The automobile industry is collapsing and the banking industry is collapsing.

[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:30.040]
So if somebody wants to buy a car there's no money to finance such a purchase that April Horace and Amelist would Jan co-partners.

[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:33.980]
With that in mind Sirius XM said when it reported third quarter results last week,

[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.360]
an expected subscriber growth to slow in the fourth quarter this year and in 2009.

[02:41:38.980 --> 02:41:42.040]
The company now expects to win this year with 19.1 million subscribers.

[02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:48.820]
And next year with 20.6 million, that's only about 8% growth down from about estimated subscriber growth for 10% this year.

[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:53.820]
Horace said that the credit crunch is going to hurt Sirius XM in another key way.

[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:58.060]
She said consumers will be less likely to buy satellite radios for their homes and cars from retailers.

[02:41:58.500 --> 02:42:04.000]
The circuit city bankruptcy filing is a perfect example of how much demand for consumer electronics has fallen after all.

[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:13.760]
After all, what's most worrisome is that Sirius XM's got more than a billion dollars in debt maturing in 2009 with a 200 million dollar tranche.

[02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:15.960]
It was originally 300 million to February.

[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:17.340]
What the hell is a tranche?

[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:17.940]
Dota.

[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:20.000]
Like a tranche?

[02:42:20.220 --> 02:42:22.940]
TRAN-T-R-A-N-C-H-E.

[02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:25.280]
Installment.

[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:27.540]
Branch.

[02:42:28.660 --> 02:42:29.060]
Crunch.

[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:30.520]
Munch.

[02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:32.060]
Look at it up.

[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:33.740]
Look at it up, tranche.

[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:39.560]
A division or portion of a pool or a whole, an issue of bonds derived from a pooling of light up.

[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:41.860]
They got a big payment coming up.

[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:44.120]
Big fat payment coming up.

[02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:45.380]
Dig deep in your pockets, man.

[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:47.380]
Sirius Myass.

[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:49.060]
15 cents a share.

[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:51.200]
Oh, Neil, you belong on Sirius.

[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.240]
You know, just by accident, just the fact that my agent is totally inept.

[02:42:55.940 --> 02:42:57.140]
That saved Myass.

[02:42:59.260 --> 02:43:00.460]
Rock and roll Hall of Fame.

[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:01.880]
Ted Nugin is not in there.

[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:03.920]
It says 30 million recording sold.

[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:05.880]
6,000 sold out concerts.

[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:07.240]
Ted Nugin, you want to put him in there?

[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:08.540]
Sure, I'm sure.

[02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:10.740]
Sure, go ahead.

[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:12.240]
And here's another one.

[02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:12.940]
It says Ted Nugin.

[02:43:13.220 --> 02:43:14.420]
Two in a row, not from the same person.

[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:15.780]
And here's another one in Chinese.

[02:43:16.420 --> 02:43:16.900]
Ted Nugin?

[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:17.520]
No.

[02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:17.880]
Oh.

[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:19.380]
Just in Chinese.

[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:20.840]
Well, it's from my Apple.

[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:21.440]
It's from a Mac.

[02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:22.720]
Isn't that what you tell me those are?

[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:24.160]
Yeah, a lot of times it is.

[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:25.000]
Now, why does that happen?

[02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:28.260]
When people send me emails from a Mac, it shows up in Chinese printer.

[02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:29.600]
And like, it looks like Chinese.

[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:31.200]
Uniligible.

[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:33.120]
Why is that?

[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:34.000]
I don't know.

[02:43:34.220 --> 02:43:34.860]
Just the way it is.

[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:35.440]
I don't know.

[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:36.680]
It's just the way it is.

[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:38.260]
What a hell of an answer from our computer experts.

[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:39.200]
It's just the way it is.

[02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:40.640]
It's a different operating system.

[02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:42.400]
So sometimes stuff doesn't transfer over it.

[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:43.520]
Well, how do you like that?

[02:43:45.880 --> 02:43:46.780]
Smack the Mac.

[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:51.240]
Chicago's in first place.

[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:53.340]
They got 20 Metallica 15, Rush 14.

[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:54.940]
And after that, only double digits.

[02:43:55.140 --> 02:43:56.080]
Moody Blues 11 and Jeff.

[02:43:56.300 --> 02:43:58.880]
Jeff Rowe tells God 11, what is with you people?

[02:43:59.080 --> 02:43:59.200]
Wow.

[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:00.440]
Whoop!

[02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:02.040]
What's up, fast talent?

[02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:03.360]
You're with me, Roger.

[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:05.200]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:07.580]
The fourth leader.

[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:09.240]
So pick it up.

[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:10.520]
Just that talent.

[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:13.300]
If that's the Asia, we ignite from 8 to 11.

[02:44:13.380 --> 02:44:15.980]
For my power, I'm gonna offer you 560 QAM.

[02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:17.400]
The sports leader.

[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:19.820]
The U.

[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:24.880]
Time once again for Dan Quayel's family values theater,

[02:44:25.220 --> 02:44:28.020]
illustrating how to be traditional, even in the 90s.

[02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:29.900]
Why isn't that dinner great, kids?

[02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:32.960]
Yeah, Mom, those are the best hamburgers you ever bought.

[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:35.680]
Better than the pizza you had delivered last night.

[02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:38.520]
Well, what are you kids up to tonight, drugs?

[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:39.520]
No, Dad.

[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:41.120]
I've got my believe in group.

[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:43.380]
And tomorrow nights, lesbian, scout.

[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:44.060]
Uh-huh.

[02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:46.540]
Son, you need help with that scale model,

[02:44:46.740 --> 02:44:47.900]
serial killer you're building.

[02:44:48.180 --> 02:44:49.040]
Some other time, Dad.

[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:51.280]
Cindy and I are going shopping for condoms.

[02:44:51.420 --> 02:44:54.480]
Oh, sounds like you're getting serious about that girl.

[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:55.360]
Oh, Dad.

[02:44:55.800 --> 02:45:00.220]
Well, I think your mother and I will relax and watch some far know movies.

[02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:04.120]
Gee, you two are the best parents a kid could ever have.

[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:05.480]
Thanks, Dad.

[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:07.380]
Oh, that's quite all right here.

[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:08.260]
Thanks, Mom.

[02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:09.760]
That's quite all right, dear.

[02:45:10.140 --> 02:45:12.340]
Join us again next time for Family Values Theater.

[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:15.340]
Where life is a big window of the vice president's imagination.

[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:17.180]
Okay, 145 QAM.

[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:20.200]
I've just got an amazing email from the fake Norma Cant.

[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:21.040]
All right.

[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:24.240]
You'll be my devoted client Neil.

[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:27.480]
You'll be happy to know my efforts to get you syndicated our long-lasting bearing fruit.

[02:45:27.780 --> 02:45:28.860]
Please call me the minute today.

[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:30.700]
You're sure when so we can hammer off the details.

[02:45:31.140 --> 02:45:34.080]
Beginning Monday, December 1st, you'll be syndicated on the following stations.

[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.580]
W-W-O-N-A-M-930 Wainsboro, Tennessee.

[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:39.700]
K-B-E-T, Winchester, Nevada.

[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:42.200]
K-S-Y-L, Alexandria, Louisiana.

[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:44.120]
W-V-O-N, Burwin, Illinois.

[02:45:44.660 --> 02:45:46.540]
And W-V-A-A, and West Lafayette, Indiana.

[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:49.060]
There are drawbacks, but I'm sure I know affiliate partners.

[02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:50.640]
This will not be a problem with you.

[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:52.120]
Drawback number one.

[02:45:52.420 --> 02:45:53.640]
Your show will be taped to late in Nevada.

[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:54.860]
Drawback number two.

[02:45:54.980 --> 02:45:58.000]
The West Lafayette radio station technically belongs to Purdue University.

[02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:04.980]
As a result, your show will be filling in when the regularly scheduled student host failed to show up due to class, hangover, zapathy, or general mischievous.

[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:07.020]
Drawback number three.

[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:14.860]
Due to a licensing agreement with other radio stations in the Alexandria, Wainsboro areas, you can no longer play any comedy, but not produced by Volkabrion or some other internal show source.

[02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:20.840]
For drawback number four, no more Yiddish, and for Christ's sake, don't let them know you're a Jewish atheist, Obama supporting homosexual.

[02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:22.400]
Those are the only drawbacks.

[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:23.540]
At last, I've done my job.

[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:26.200]
We'll discuss my new commission shortly. You're as normal-cant.

[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:29.280]
Somebody took a long time to read out a...

[02:46:29.280 --> 02:46:30.160]
Swill, you know.

[02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:31.620]
That person took a long time.

[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:32.640]
What?

[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:34.160]
It's the same person.

[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:36.300]
Why do you say that?

[02:46:36.860 --> 02:46:37.860]
Because I believe it.

[02:46:38.220 --> 02:46:39.540]
You don't think there's like two or three?

[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:41.540]
Maybe two, but I doubt it.

[02:46:41.540 --> 02:46:45.320]
Oh, here's an idea for the poll. Best TV sidekick of all time.

[02:46:45.620 --> 02:46:46.360]
We've done it.

[02:46:48.180 --> 02:46:49.200]
Do you want to do it again?

[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:49.600]
Tonto.

[02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:50.500]
Robin.

[02:46:51.100 --> 02:46:52.180]
Let's put those two under.

[02:46:54.100 --> 02:46:54.900]
Artemis Gordon.

[02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:56.860]
Dano.

[02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:58.120]
Link.

[02:46:59.320 --> 02:46:59.760]
Lamont.

[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:01.880]
How about Lamont Cranston?

[02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:02.920]
How about Dave Lamont?

[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:05.900]
Speaking of farting guy, I don't think so.

[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:06.840]
We've done it a million times.

[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:07.740]
Sidekick.

[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:10.780]
How about John McCain?

[02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:12.760]
He was Bush's sidekick, corner of the campaign.

[02:47:13.100 --> 02:47:13.420]
Remember that?

[02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:14.040]
Mm-hmm.

[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:16.020]
He wasn't a maverick. He was a sidekick.

[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:18.980]
That was down 34 points and serious.

[02:47:19.140 --> 02:47:20.220]
He's hanging in there really.

[02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:21.060]
Rock solid.

[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:22.000]
That's 15 cents.

[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:24.300]
It's a buying opportunity.

[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:26.660]
I haven't heard from the fake Maria Barthoromo today yet.

[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:27.460]
No.

[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:29.100]
Because the market is like Comsi Comsa.

[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:31.100]
You know, it's like not this.

[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:31.900]
It's more like that.

[02:47:33.100 --> 02:47:36.180]
Someone who supplies marijuana to a patient who has a doctor's approval for it

[02:47:36.180 --> 02:47:37.660]
can be prosecuted for dealing drugs.

[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:40.540]
The California Supreme Court ruled yesterday in a narrow interpretation

[02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:42.640]
of California's medical marijuana law.

[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:47.260]
Advocates on both sides of the case agree the unanimous ruling will encourage Californians

[02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:51.820]
to obtain medical marijuana from patient co-ops which are authorized by a 2003 state law

[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:54.200]
rather than from an individual supplier like George.

[02:47:55.300 --> 02:47:59.700]
Ideally, it the ruling won't have a tremendous effect, say Joseph L. Fertilow for the Americans for Save Access.

[02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:01.480]
A pro-medical marijuana group.

[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:04.740]
Patients will now increasingly get their medications through collectives and co-operatives.

[02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:08.500]
The 2003 law provides an alternative outlet for patients agreed.

[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:11.220]
Deputy Attorney General Michelle Swanson, the state's lawyer,

[02:48:11.540 --> 02:48:13.940]
she said Monday's ruling applies only to a category of suppliers.

[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:16.720]
Those who are not the patients caretaker or fellow co-op member,

[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:20.740]
whom the voters never intended to protect when they passed Proposition 215 in 1996.

[02:48:21.820 --> 02:48:24.040]
But Lawrence Gibbs, attorney for Santa Cruz County,

[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:27.140]
man who appealed as marijuana dealing conviction, said the court made it much,

[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:30.060]
much more difficult for qualified patients to get their medical marijuana.

[02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:35.360]
Although patients can turn to co-ops or clubs give,

[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:39.140]
said the resulting centralization of colorations of fly will make raids and prosecutions

[02:48:39.140 --> 02:48:42.760]
much easier for federal authorities who are not bound by Prop 215.

[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:45.520]
President Elect Obama said during the campaign,

[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:48.240]
he supports the states right to legalize the medical use of marijuana,

[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:51.600]
but believes it should be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:52.380]
Well, what a shame.

[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:57.420]
The pop police are coming to a door near you.

[02:48:58.000 --> 02:48:59.140]
I'm going to knock it down.

[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:03.680]
Jason says, have a great turkey day.

[02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:05.320]
All the best. Hope you're around for years.

[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:07.360]
For next year's Thanksgiving, oh, I see.

[02:49:08.180 --> 02:49:09.780]
Put down the ice cream says Jason.

[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.780]
No. Then it says he puts the turkey in the basket.

[02:49:14.640 --> 02:49:17.160]
In closing, can you please put William Nelson on the pole? No.

[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:19.600]
Also, tick is a two-phase slime ball.

[02:49:19.700 --> 02:49:21.000]
Just walk away from that son of a bitch.

[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:21.660]
Is Jason?

[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:23.000]
I don't know why he's got to get tick.

[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:28.300]
Isn't tick one of the people that we've been given a spy report last couple of days now

[02:49:28.300 --> 02:49:30.340]
that we know that the guys across the street are like tourists.

[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:31.260]
He's one of them.

[02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:33.140]
He's one of the moles.

[02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:36.760]
And they got a lot of big yaps across the stream.

[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:40.220]
A lot of loose lips that sink ships, man.

[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:44.600]
Every time somebody takes a sloppy BM over their across the street,

[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:45.840]
we get wind of it right away.

[02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:46.780]
I do mean wind.

[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:50.420]
It's an ill wind that blows no good.

[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:52.080]
Is that how that saying goes?

[02:49:52.540 --> 02:49:53.040]
Something like that.

[02:49:53.140 --> 02:49:54.360]
The song was out for a little while before.

[02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:56.240]
Now it's murky and it looks like a wintertime.

[02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:57.780]
It looks dank and depressing.

[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:00.360]
Not good.

[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:04.040]
Pete from Boccas has been listening to you rave about the Godfather moving for years.

[02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:07.280]
I like you, like to love the first two, but the third not so much.

[02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:11.540]
Being of Sicilian descent, the movies have parts that touch really close to home.

[02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:14.200]
The winning, the food, the way the characters talk to each other.

[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:16.660]
And what I like best is that I don't have to read the subtitles.

[02:50:17.100 --> 02:50:19.680]
The Italian they speak in the film is really a Sicilian dialect,

[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:21.280]
which differs greatly from Italian.

[02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:24.680]
I don't know if anyone has ever translated what they're really saying in Sicilian,

[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:25.980]
but I'd be glad to help you with this.

[02:50:26.140 --> 02:50:26.780]
Oh yeah, Pete.

[02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:30.300]
Let's spend a few weeks translating the Godfather.

[02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:34.980]
The clip from the movie you played yesterday where Michael explains what a good husband will be to Apologna.

[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:38.780]
One of the men says the word manger that translates to trouser throughout English.

[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:42.320]
I will send more translations that I can't cross more dirty words.

[02:50:42.460 --> 02:50:43.980]
I can't remember them all right now, Pete from Boccas.

[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:44.740]
How do you like that?

[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:45.440]
Wow.

[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:50.080]
Menagela Mazzetti.

[02:50:50.260 --> 02:50:52.000]
I wonder if they say that in Sicilian.

[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:52.620]
I'm sure they do.

[02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:54.000]
Sicilian.

[02:50:55.880 --> 02:50:57.140]
Okay, let's take a look at the pool.

[02:50:57.240 --> 02:51:00.300]
I haven't had like a whole bunch of names put in here, and that's probably good,

[02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:01.680]
because then we'd have to look them all up.

[02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:06.720]
And then we'd probably find the most of them already in the rock and roll hall of fame.

[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:11.400]
Who should be, and you know, Mr. Radio vanished after I bitched him out

[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:12.740]
and I threatened to block him before good.

[02:51:12.740 --> 02:51:13.380]
Oh no.

[02:51:13.740 --> 02:51:16.920]
Send me those stupid pictures of all the dead, the QAIOD people.

[02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:18.380]
Why would anybody do that?

[02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:19.580]
What does it add to the show?

[02:51:19.860 --> 02:51:21.120]
Is the audience going to see them?

[02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:23.280]
Well, what is there to say about them?

[02:51:23.900 --> 02:51:27.340]
For a guy who comes to be a radio, no, seriously, for a guy who claims to be a radio groupie,

[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:30.500]
he doesn't understand that he sent me swill that nobody cares about it.

[02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:31.820]
It has no impact on the show.

[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:32.780]
Nobody can see it.

[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:34.000]
We're not doing television.

[02:51:34.540 --> 02:51:36.180]
This is Alex Bennett would say, television.

[02:51:37.900 --> 02:51:39.300]
And not driving a meada.

[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:40.600]
Oh, he was such a wimpy.

[02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:41.440]
And he's uncirious.

[02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:42.020]
Alex Bennett.

[02:51:42.020 --> 02:51:42.580]
Seriously?

[02:51:43.180 --> 02:51:43.520]
Yeah.

[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:46.120]
Who should be in the rock and roll hall of fame?

[02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:46.460]
Who's not?

[02:51:46.700 --> 02:51:50.820]
Chicago 24, Metallica 17, Rush 15, Jethro Dull 14.

[02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:59.180]
The Moody Blues 13, Deep Purple 10, Kiss 10, Dooby Brothers 9, Ed Solomon 8, Genesis 8,

[02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:06.180]
Alice Cooper 8, Yes 8, Journey 7, Boston 7, Steve Miller 6, The Carpenter 6.

[02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:08.460]
How can the Carpenter is not being there?

[02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:09.840]
I mean, that's just crazy.

[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:23.740]
The Guess Who Five, Rick Shaw 4, Hart 4, 3-Dog Knight 4, ELP 4, Billy Idol 4, Grand Funk 3, Pat Boone 3, The Monkeys 3, Bog's Skags 3,

[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:33.280]
Fifth Dimension 2, 2 for Super Tramp Ario Speedwagon, Neil Sinaca, ELO, Joe Cocker, Blood Sweat & Tears, Stevie Winwood, J. Black,

[02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:40.000]
One for Forerner, The Osmonds, Billow Withers, Brian Epstein, Kansas to Hollies, and none yet for Ted Nugent.

[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:41.540]
They all wanted him on there, but no votes yet.

[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:44.180]
Todd Rungren, Gary Puckett, The Union Gap, and The Association.

[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:47.300]
Gary Puckett and The Union Gap should be in the rock and roll hall of fame?

[02:52:48.180 --> 02:52:50.400]
Oh my God, please call the doctor.

[02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:52.120]
Good His Name.

[02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:53.080]
Please, Chief.

[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:56.980]
You don't listen to the Rajax 4.0.560 QAM.

[02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:58.760]
The Fourth Leader.

[02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:08.040]
It's Dave, Miami Town, at 5.6.0 WQAM.

[02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:15.920]
Way up in Tampa was a Crap's Day Morning Show.

[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:16.400]
Oh my God.

[02:53:16.580 --> 02:53:19.520]
Then in Orlando they ran at 2.

[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:24.600]
Now they can compete in Old Tampa Bay.

[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:30.100]
They're on in Jacksonville and they're to run and run.

[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:33.600]
They just aren't that funny.

[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:39.380]
If something tells me they make too much money, run and run,

[02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:43.760]
Boy they blow, run and run.

[02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:46.340]
Absolutely.

[02:53:47.420 --> 02:53:51.380]
All of the A's like to call them the bros.

[02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:56.240]
Bash the gays and the epics to you fairy.

[02:53:56.620 --> 02:54:00.100]
They're worse than sunny box or parvy shoes.

[02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:02.580]
Blasphite or my lo and even.

[02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:04.000]
Joey, too.

[02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:05.480]
Run and run.

[02:54:06.320 --> 02:54:09.180]
They just aren't that funny.

[02:54:09.720 --> 02:54:14.860]
If something tells me they make too much money, run and run,

[02:54:15.380 --> 02:54:18.500]
Boy they suck, run and run.

[02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:27.200]
You know these two losers show is a real snoozer,

[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:31.080]
But I must give credit where credit is due.

[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:39.700]
After five minutes of that bad radio makes me love that Chuck Myers morning show.

[02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:41.160]
Run and run.

[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:44.720]
They just aren't that funny.

[02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:50.440]
If something tells me they took lessons from sunny, run and run,

[02:54:50.740 --> 02:54:54.820]
Boy they blow, run and run.

[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:58.580]
Bash the gays and the epics to you fairy.

[02:54:58.580 --> 02:54:59.840]
Bye bye bye.

[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:03.020]
The biggest names of the best caliph.

[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:07.040]
And your home for Miami Dolphins football.

[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:12.200]
4 3DO 560 WQAM.

[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:15.200]
Miami on Lauderdale.

[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:16.560]
1 2 3.

[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:19.200]
1 2 3.

[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:21.300]
I'm happy.

[02:55:22.620 --> 02:55:23.820]
Under the rain.

[02:55:24.820 --> 02:55:25.740]
1 2 3.

[02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:28.460]
1 2 3.

[02:55:29.340 --> 02:55:31.380]
I'm counting and I like it.

[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:33.180]
Acceptable.

[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:34.420]
This is not going to happen anymore.

[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:36.200]
Anybody else does this on this team.

[02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:37.600]
Doesn't matter who it is.

[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:39.560]
If it's Joey again, they'll get suspended.

[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:40.200]
Is that what you do?

[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:42.720]
Do you send out the you fire out the warning shot?

[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:43.660]
Is that what you use?

[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:47.300]
Because there is no precedent set.

[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:49.040]
So now this is it right here.

[02:55:49.540 --> 02:55:51.700]
Here's the watershed moment.

[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:53.080]
Here's where you draw the line.

[02:55:53.440 --> 02:55:54.460]
Is that what you're going to do?

[02:55:58.040 --> 02:55:59.500]
Whatever we'll see anyway.

[02:55:59.980 --> 02:56:02.180]
So of course I'd love to hear your opinions on it.

[02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:04.200]
Everybody's got an opinion on that.

[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:07.420]
And I think again, we kind of talked about it this morning.

[02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:09.320]
We talked about it in the afternoon yesterday.

[02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:13.140]
It's one of those that when you have authority,

[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:19.100]
most of us kind of have to listen to it, right?

[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:21.020]
And you have to follow by the rules.

[02:56:21.900 --> 02:56:24.640]
And when you don't, there's a price to be paid.

[02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:29.480]
And that's the thing that we'll see what ends up happening here.

[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:31.420]
If that does end up happening.

[02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:32.340]
Anyway, 5.67.

[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:33.800]
05.60.

[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:37.280]
That's toll-free in date and broward in pound 5.60.

[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:40.940]
If you're an AT&T or Verizon wireless customer heat,

[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:42.440]
lose last night,

[02:56:42.740 --> 02:56:44.500]
poorest defense against Houston.

[02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:47.600]
Again, it's kind of a tough matchup for them too.

[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:52.500]
Because when you look at the guys that they're trying to defend,

[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:54.820]
not easy, my friends.

[02:56:55.260 --> 02:56:55.500]
Okay.

[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:59.580]
That's the problem right there that you look at the team.
