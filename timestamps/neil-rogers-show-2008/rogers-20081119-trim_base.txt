[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]
The music expressed on the previous program.

[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.580]
Ladies today, baby.

[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.140]
Uh-oh.

[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.600]
Oh, my God.

[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.140]
Oh, my God.

[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.520]
Hold on.

[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.040]
Hold on.

[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.380]

[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.380]

[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.380]

[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.400]
Hold on.

[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.500]
Hold on.

[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.720]
Hold on.

[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.760]
Hold on.

[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.860]
Hold on.

[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.560]
Hold on.

[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.580]
Hold on.

[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.580]

[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.580]

[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.720]
Hold on.

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.720]

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.720]

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.720]

[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.780]
Hold on.

[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.200]

[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.820]
Hold on.

[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.980]
Hold on.

[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.700]
Hold on.

[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.580]
Hold on.

[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.700]
Hold on.

[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.900]
Hold on.

[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.820]
Hold on.

[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.820]
Hold on.

[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:49.880]
Raise your hands.

[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.980]

[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.400]
Raise the hands.

[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.380]
Raise your hands.

[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.960]
Raise your hands.

[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.280]
Raise your hands.

[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.280]

[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.180]
Raise your hands.

[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.180]
Welcome to disaster California.

[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.420]
All right.

[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.000]
When there's not a quake, when there's not a quake,

[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.400]
there's a wildfire blaze.

[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.200]
And many have moved to be saved from California.

[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.860]
And we can't feel any time to feel.

[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.540]
You can find it here.

[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.740]
I'm right on the hear.

[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.680]
I'm right on the hear.

[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.140]
Bulletin, Bulletin, wildfires in California.

[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.200]
Every time they come out with it,

[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.880]
look, it's some, not like mudslides in California.

[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.700]
Isn't that a novelty?

[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.680]
Right.

[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.220]
10-1 at 5-60 WDQM, Happy Wednesday to you.

[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.740]
We showed up today in spite of the fact

[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.120]
that the trends are coming out today, July, August,

[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.740]
and September.

[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.620]
No, I take that back.

[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.100]
August, September, October.

[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.800]
Three months of the rolling numbers.

[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.720]
Now, there's the new thing.

[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.220]
And I tried to print this damn thing out

[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.960]
and it won't print out.

[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.080]
Do you ever have that when you try to print out

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.940]
a page in a world print?

[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.240]
Yes.

[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.560]
And I tried to highlight it and it won't do it.

[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.580]
It's on the Arbatron website, the portable people meter.

[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.140]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.960]
Electronic audience measurement with the portable people.

[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.560]
It's like the purple people leader.

[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.560]
What you, it won't let you print the selection.

[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.320]
It won't, it won't even sell.

[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.440]
Oh, no, now it did.

[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.900]
It just because you opened up a mouth.

[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.660]
I can't believe that.

[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.800]
That's Murphy's Law right there.

[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.740]
Wow.

[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.620]
How's Murphy doing, by the way?

[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.360]
Oh, he's just fine.

[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.700]
Kill the old son of a bitch.

[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.540]
Okay, now it's going to print out the selection.

[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.420]
And I can read all about how it's going to work.

[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.700]
And it's not in this market yet,

[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.320]
but it's going to be in the top 51 markets.

[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.260]
So it will be here.

[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.180]
And all these people that are trying to pretend

[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.100]
that they're listening to something else in the lie,

[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680]
the closet audience we were discussing here, the show today.

[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.380]
Guess what?

[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.000]
You're done.

[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.740]
You're finished.

[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.400]
Because the portable people meter,

[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.500]
the thing that goes on our signal, the purple people

[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.700]
meter, the purple people leader, goes on our signal.

[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.680]
And then if you're not listening to the show, it eats you.

[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.800]
It devours you.

[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.960]
It comes to your house like a letter.

[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.740]
Grim them.

[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.040]
Here's all the stuff, pages of it.

[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760]
It's way too ponderous and very interesting

[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.240]
because somebody sent me an email about that this morning.

[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.600]
Got some interesting emails, by the way.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.360]
So I'm really heavy duty stuff, including one

[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.900]
from the fake Rick Riley.

[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.720]
We got a follow up from a fan,

[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.880]
which I'm positive is Dan from Maryland

[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.500]
because it's just nobody else could be that neurotic.

[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.480]
You know, one day they love you, the next day they hate you.

[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.260]
They always start out they hate and then they come back

[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.020]
and they say, they say, they say, they say, they say,

[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.720]
they like you, they like you, you know, like that.

[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.680]
Jim and Chicago says just an interesting piece for you.

[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.620]
If you've seen it already, I apologize.

[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.740]
Well, I hadn't seen the gym.

[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.540]
I listened by the archives the next day.

[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.100]
So I'm always a day late and a loony short.

[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.680]
I can say that in Chicago, the PPMs from Arbitron

[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.140]
have unwired the numbers here.

[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.700]
Quick example, WGCI Urban Radio was second with the 6.2

[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.520]
in

[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.600]
and

[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.260]
Trump plus in the summer book, which was the last paper book.

[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.440]
For the October book, all books are monthly now.

[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.020]
It's 13th from second to 13th with a 2.7.

[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.380]
So they drop from a 6.2 and again, that's an urban station.

[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.240]
So PC, people vote for radio stations like they vote

[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.260]
for candidates in elections.

[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.700]
Right.

[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.780]
Diddo, diddo, diddo, diddo, all of diddo heads.

[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.960]
I'm sure they are.

[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.000]
Can I finish this?

[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.460]
Calm down now, just take a deep breath.

[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.980]
Unfortunately, the stations that have done well are all

[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.660]
Bonneville Mormon stations up here.

[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.860]
Since they play such awful music, including this,

[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.940]
and they'll kill some good time.

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.200]
Thank you, Jim and Chicago.

[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.800]
How do you like that?

[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.340]
I do.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.880]
Now, what were you going to say before you,

[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.280]
so sadly interrupted yourself?

[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.560]
I don't know, I forgot.

[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.160]
No.

[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.200]
New age for radio, electronic audience measurement

[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.680]
with a portable people meter system.

[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.220]
After years of research, field test and industry review

[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.580]
Arbitrons Revolutionary Radio Audience Measurement System,

[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.720]
the portable people meter, PPM, is now being ruled out

[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.040]
as a commercial radio rating service.

[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.460]
It will replace Arbitrons current diary based ratings

[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.020]
with passive electronic measurement.

[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.140]
Current plans call for the PPM to be deployed

[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.680]
in the top 50 radio markets by 2010.

[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.600]
At the same time, Arbitrons Exploring

[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.180]
will be testing in the field different approaches

[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.040]
using electronic measurement in markets ranked 51 plus.

[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.580]
You know, I'm trying to remember what station it was.

[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.200]
Oh, it was WTPS in Kalamazoo.

[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.640]
And some of the guys from the station

[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.960]
and we would go around like to shopping center parking lots.

[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.000]
And we would look in the window like in a passenger window

[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.180]
to the car to see what, of course, back in those days,

[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.900]
it wasn't digital.

[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.320]
You know, see, your dial was actually sitting on some spot.

[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.560]
Your radio dial?

[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.560]
I mean, is that stupid or what?

[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.060]
Yeah.

[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.240]
Why did we do that?

[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.740]
I don't know.

[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.580]
It was something to do.

[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.760]
The PPM system automatically reports audience exposure

[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.580]
to inaudible codes invented in a broadcast signal.

[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.100]
Like, yeah, that's...

[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.180]
Ars is going to sound like that.

[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.400]
So, starting when they...

[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.840]
when they start this in the South Florida market

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.900]
and you're walking around in a kitchen or in the office

[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.060]
and you hear that, you'll know that they're measuring you.

[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.700]
So to speak.

[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.360]
In the top 50 markets, including us,

[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.500]
Arbitram will provide PPM encoders free of charge

[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.500]
and report PPM audience estimates

[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.820]
for all FCC licensed AM and FM radio stations.

[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.140]
Boy, it's a good thing we got our license back,

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.120]
including non-commercial stations that wish to participate.

[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.560]
The PPM data, however, will only be provided

[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.240]
to those who subscribe to the PPM service.

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.660]
So stations like the light bulb, Jr. and Mr. Ego station,

[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.020]
all those...

[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.220]
They won't even show up...

[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.560]
Well, they still don't show up even now.

[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.680]
Arbitram recognizes the importance of accreditation

[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.680]
from the Media Rating Council for any new service,

[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.360]
Yadi Yadi Yadi, its ongoing,

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.700]
and our goal is to gain accreditation in all PPM markets

[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.340]
and et cetera and so on.

[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.420]
It says the PPM service gives broadcasts more choices

[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.720]
than ever before in determining their level of participation

[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.300]
and radio audience measurement at the local market level.

[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.520]
Since the PPM ratings are based on detecting

[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.920]
in audible codes hidden in broadcast systems and pastreams,

[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.440]
it's up to the radio broadcasts to decide

[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.620]
if they want their audience measured

[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.420]
and how many of their broadcast operations they want rated.

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.500]
Arbitram will provide two encoders and one encoding monitor

[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.480]
to all FCC licensed AMRFM stations at no cost.

[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.440]
Oh, no cost.

[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.020]
We like it.

[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.760]
We want it.

[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.140]
You think we want it?

[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.340]
Yeah, a lot.

[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.600]
And it goes on.

[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:22.560]
On.

[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.400]
On.

[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.220]
I don't really understand it.

[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.460]
Sure you did.

[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.580]
I don't understand it.

[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.380]
Of course you did.

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.040]
How can you not?

[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.720]
There's going to be an inaudible tone

[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.320]
like remember the cards, the trip tone,

[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.840]
the secondary tones, things like that.

[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.780]
I don't understand that part,

[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.160]
but how do they know who's listening?

[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.460]
The people need to record the tone.

[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.600]
So it hears it.

[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.380]
What does it have to do with these numbers?

[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.080]
I just got it.

[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.160]
Oh, you got numbers?

[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.000]
Are they good or bad?

[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.700]
Who gave them to you?

[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.340]
Clarence.

[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.440]
Is he smiling or laughing or grabbing his crotch again?

[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.760]
He was nothing.

[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:01.920]
Nothing?

[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.620]
Well, he hates us anyway.

[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.580]
So he wants the beast in the day.

[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.960]
And by the way, you people that are bugging normal,

[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.060]
those phony serious deals already just leave him alone.

[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.540]
He's, you know, he's an old queen.

[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.640]
He's under enormous stress.

[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.500]
Look at that.

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.960]
Charlie Bees for polls for the future are sitting in there.

[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.700]
And this one we're doing now is one of the worst polls we've ever done.

[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.560]
So what do you got?

[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.300]
Are you sending it to me?

[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.540]
What are we getting first, man?

[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.720]
Let 18 plus then person 25 54.

[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.000]
Okay, that's all I want.

[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.820]
Okay, let's take a look at yesterday's poll,

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.880]
which we concluded because we had over a thousand votes.

[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.360]
We had a thousand 55 and of course,

[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.140]
fatso will chime in and say, oh, no, a thousand 50 something else.

[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.320]
He didn't chime in.

[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.120]
Wow.

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.000]
10 to 10.

[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.440]
What should Americans be most ashamed of?

[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.840]
George W. Bush 268.

[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.440]

Got some numbers coming in, baby.

[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.680]
Oh.

[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.560]
Say a brook, say a prayer.

[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.580]
We need help.

Many 18 plus.

[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.740]
Now I don't understand where's the first page.

[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.240]
This starts with number nine.

[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.680]
Whatever.

[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.300]
Here it is.

Does anybody in look at that we're flat.

[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.000]
Although we went from 11th to time for 8th.

[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.460]
And this is of course including October, which is the start of the dolphin of the fall book, baby.

[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.200]
Dolphins.

[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.220]
We love the dolphins.

[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.400]
They win a lot.

[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.640]
Oh, and wait a minute.

[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.640]
We're on here twice.

[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.240]
Say what?

[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.840]
Look at this.

[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.760]
This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in an arbitraron deal.

[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.760]
We're on here.

[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.540]
We're number eight with a 3.0 and we're number 13 with a 2.7.

[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.340]
You see that?

[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.020]
No, I'm not looking at anything.

[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.300]
Oh, this is the morning.

[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.480]
What do you mean you're not looking at anything?

[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.320]
It's got us on its way.

[00:10:59.520 --> 00:10:59.880]
It's not looking.

[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.800]
It has QAM on here twice.

[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.640]
Waxi had a 2, 3.

[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.300]
Oh, that said man, he can't buy a number for for lover money.

[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.020]
Loudmouth said 2.3.

[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.140]
He's number 19.

[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.660]
At least he's consistent.

[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.280]
He was number 19 in the book.

[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.120]
And he's still number 19.

[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.340]
2, 2, 2, 2, 3.

[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.420]
We're on here twice.

[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.200]
Now which one is the correct number, man?

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:21.700]
I don't know.

[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:21.940]
Adam.

[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.180]
No, seriously.

[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.380]
I've never seen anything like that of you.

[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.200]
No, I don't know what to do with that.

[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.620]
How could QAM have beat?

[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.160]
Well, that's because we're so good, I guess.

[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.360]
It sure is not a typo.

[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.140]
What do you mean typo?

[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.340]
What does that mean typo?

[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.240]
A typographical error.

[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.460]
You see what I see?

[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:43.460]

[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.160]
Do you see what I see?

[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.680]
I don't.

[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.840]
Because it's in the machine, man.

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.820]
Where's the rest of this stuff?

[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.280]
In the machine also.

[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.240]
What day part do you see that in?

[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.560]
Oh, wait a minute.

[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.860]
This is all screwed up.

[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.760]
This is bizarre.

[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.640]
There's another page here.

[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.820]
I don't get it.

[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.880]
There's another page here that doesn't have us 13th.

[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.940]
It doesn't have the...

[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.900]
I don't get it.

[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.540]
There's a page in here that doesn't belong.

[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.600]
But it's as many team plus Monday through Sunday, 6 to 10 AM.

[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.440]
It's got the coast is number nine.

[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.080]
Where is this from?

[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:28.660]
What is this?

[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.740]
Is this like a clearance plane with our heads or something?

[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.560]
Oh, this is Monday through Sunday.

[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:33.560]
Ah!

[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.860]
You slipped a bogus page in there.

[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.800]
I just put them in as I got them.

[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.400]
You slipped a bogus page in there.

[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.740]
I even take time to look at them.

[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.420]
Oh, scared the crap out of me.

[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.940]
So let's see, where are we in the morning?

[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.480]
Well, 3-0 is better than 2-7.

[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.500]
Okay, so we'll take it.

[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.220]
From 11 to 8.

[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.140]
Where is the rest of it?

[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.520]
Where is the...

[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:58.960]
Where is the...

[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.360]
Where is it coming?

[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.600]
I stuffed everything in the machine, man.

[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.680]
What all happened to it?

[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.120]
If it didn't roll through, if there were like a double-dubbed up, then it would be fine.

[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.320]
Let me go and look at my machine here.

[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:08.740]
One moment.

[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.340]
Yeah.

[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.360]
Well, why don't you take the brakes since you're late for it already?

[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.320]
Receiving.

[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.740]
It says receiving page one.

[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.360]
Oh, here comes more crap.

[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.980]
Okay, let's, like I said, take the break.

[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.780]
Laying my hands.

[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.600]
The best talent.

[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.920]
You don't have no logic.

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.220]
4.30 AM 5.60 AM.

[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.120]
The fourth leader.

[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.440]
No portion of this program will be repeated.

[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.820]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.900]
The FWQAM Beats the broadcast group incorporated.

[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.020]
You did a wonderful thing.

[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.920]
By the way, sorry, sir.

[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.840]
I got you number wrong.

[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.960]
It's worse than what I said.

[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.080]
There's a sports hall.

[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.400]
Bang.

[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.620]
Real band.

[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.160]
U-A-L.

[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.120]

Goal 1-800-1-A-B and speak to our director of education, Mr. Lenny Marges.

[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.220]
So, you want me a boy cast off?

[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.100]
Oh, a boy?

[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.420]
A boy cast off.

[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.400]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.160]
Yes.

Boy cast off.

[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.660]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:20.660]

[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:20.860]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.920]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.080]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080]

[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.440]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.440]

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.440]

[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:44.460]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.580]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:45.620]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.620]

[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:45.740]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.780]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:46.960]

[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.020]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:50.540]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.080]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.900]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.380]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.060]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.800]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.020]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.280]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:58.960]
Boy cast off.

[00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.820]
Boy cast off.

[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.640]
Boy cast off.

[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.180]
Boy cast off.

[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.080]
Boy cast off.

[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.240]
Yes, I go on and see a set of deliverableăng.

[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.580]
and page 14.

[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.580]
Yeah, you can't have them in.

[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.400]
And uh...

[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.840]
No, that's what I want you to repeat.

[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.520]
And uh...

[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.900]
And uh...

[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.680]
And uh...

[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.680]
And those who eat this room,

[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.940]
they're gonna come and go see where they'll come.

[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.080]
Yes, it's the wonderful world of radio.

[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.000]
Ah, radio.

[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.000]
Where you can hear your own voice.

[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.480]
Let the WQAM school of broadcasting provide you

[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.320]
with the essential tools you'll need

[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.480]
to make your wet radio dreams come true.

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.260]
I mean a one-quam tool.

[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.460]
With more than those in the world.

[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.240]
10, 20, and 5, 60, WQAM.

[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.900]
So I finally got this all straight and new.

[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.880]
Good, I hope there are no missing pages of them

[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.160]
than that page one which I don't have.

[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.860]
Page one, what?

[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.540]
The very first page of the...

[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:22.960]
Oh, I got it.

[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.980]
...of the stack. You got it.

[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:24.680]
I got it.

[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.520]
How did you get it?

[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.980]
I don't know. You sent it to me.

[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.440]
Er, must have been magic.

[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.680]
Monday, Tuesday, Sunday, 6th and the midnight.

[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.540]
All right. I don't know what I got.

[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.500]
I just got just good.

[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.960]
Let that page really matter because we're on the other side.

[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.660]
But I got it.

[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.900]
It was stuffed in the middle of a bunch of other crap.

[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.240]
I do like that.

[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.420]
We're stuffing our crap, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.820]
Okay, let's take a look.

[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.440]
6 to 10 a.m. This is just men.

[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.760]
And I noticed the person's 25, 54,

[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.620]
I started to percolate.

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.520]
We went up a little bit midday, not much.

[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.460]
10 to 3.

[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.640]
And we went from 11 to, uh, tied for 8.

[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.980]
This is the jolly Jopele era.

[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.100]
We used to say, we're a number one, damn it.

[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.000]
Now we say, we're number eight, damn it.

[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.880]
And tied for 8.

[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.920]
Who are we tied with?

[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.460]
A life and power and Y100.

[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.120]
What?

[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.960]
How do you like that?

[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:12.640]
All right.

[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.000]
Y100 went way up from 2.4 to a 3.0.

[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.980]
Men, 18 plus.

[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.280]
Well, it includes like, you know, 18, 19 punks.

[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.120]
We don't have any of those people.

[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:24.560]
Do we?

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.140]
Not too many.

[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.380]
Not too many.

[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.860]
Okay, 25, 54 stuff is coming along.

[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.700]
See, I can't keep up with it this fast.

[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.740]
I'm getting old and people.

[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.920]
Now, let's see overall.

[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.940]
That'll give us a good indication whether there's going to be any bonus money for George who needs it badly.

[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.100]
I don't need it.

[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.440]
I'm loaded.

[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.060]
Let's see.

[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.040]
Person's 25, 54.

[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.040]
You know how we do this?

[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.680]
QIM, 25 to a 27.

[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:52.880]
Overall.

[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:53.840]
Right.

[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.800]
So in men's world, no, no, no, no, that's not the right, uh, what?

[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.320]
Is it it?

[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.000]
Huh?

[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.580]
No, I just attached it to the wrong thing.

[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.840]
You're sending me pages from just all over the place.

[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.140]
Okay.

[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.460]
They are.

[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.220]
All right.

[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.340]
This is 25, 54.

[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.420]
I have the first page.

[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.980]
And that's all I've got from the whole week.

[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.800]
And then now they're starting with the morning.

[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.040]
6 to 10 a.m.

[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.660]
I stuffed them in there just like I got them.

[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.860]
Or clearance must be taken extra minute musula or something.

[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.360]
Boy, he is really full of crap today.

[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:23.620]
God.

[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.720]
6 to 10 a.m.

[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.060]
Person's 25 to 54.

[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.520]
How one oh five number one within 8.6.

[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.960]
Disney is sitting over there.

[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.800]
Have another belt, Mike.

[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.020]
Get that nose nice and red.

[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.560]
Get it all glowing for Sandy Claus.

[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.000]
Radio on Moore is number two with a seven point.

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.260]
Oh.

[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.240]
This is mornings.

[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.860]
Person's 25, 54.

[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.760]
Let's see about us.

[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.380]
What about us?

[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.200]
I don't see us on here.

[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.400]
Where is Joe Rose?

[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.040]
Here we go.

[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.220]
1, 8 to 1, 9.

[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.300]
Making a little bit of movement.

[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.660]
Like a bomb movement there.

[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.700]
So that means in men 25, 54.

[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.780]
And we got about a 3, 8.

[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.160]
Just double it.

[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.780]
Because women we ain't got squat, you know?

[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:07.700]
That's my form.

[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.120]
And then it usually is fairly accurate.

[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.080]
Just double it and subtract by four and patch it around with it.

[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.680]
Throw it against the wall and see what slides off.

[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.260]
Oh, and I made a mistake by the way on the men 18 plus numbers.

[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.800]
I was looking at the whole week.

[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.360]
I said the kid want to apologize to him.

[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.460]
Because I said he was whatever he had.

[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.180]
He's as much worse.

[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.900]
He had a 2.0.

[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.500]
Although that's an improvement from his 1.8 in the summer book.

[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.560]
He went from a tie from 19th to 19th.

[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.140]
No, he's still a 19th all by himself.

[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.220]
A 2.0.

[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:38.300]
Oh.

[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.680]
Wait a 3, he had a 2.

[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.480]
Neither number, anything we get too excited about.

[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.260]
If you ask me, then, but then again, what do I know?

[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.420]
I know nothing about this crap.

[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.860]
Midday, are we on the first page?

[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.860]
Persons 2554, you bet we're not.

[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.180]
Oh, look at that.

[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.580]
We went from a 2.3 in the summer book to a 2.7.

[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.240]
And that's 10 to 3.

[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.280]
10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.160]
We had close to a 6-year.

[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.780]
There might be a little bonus money hanging out.

[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:01.940]
We do in November, December.

[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.640]
Everybody mark us down, okay?

[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.200]
Mark us down before you die.

[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.960]
That's not not good, but person will take it.

[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.120]
We'll take it to step in the right direction.

[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.180]
17 to 14.

[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.540]
Yes, it's a little step up.

[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.000]
Wow.

[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.840]
Of course, that's 10 to 3.

[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.040]
Maybe the big O is responsible for the hoose up there.

[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.520]
Because we lost jerks in October.

[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.620]
When did jerks leave?

[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:27.860]
Toby.

[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.780]
August, I believe.

[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.920]
August, I believe so.

[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.700]
Yeah, because it was just before his one year.

[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.560]
Oh, isn't that sad?

[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.080]
I mean, his show sucked watermelon.

[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.000]
I mean, it was horrendous.

[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:44.440]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.320]
It sucked their calories.

[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.420]
I know.

[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:46.600]

[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:47.880]
I know.

[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.380]
Sorry.

[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.020]
It sucked big time.

[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.680]
Whatever fruit you want to stick in there.

[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.200]
But nevertheless, I mean, shouldn't they let him at least finish out one year and then said, hey, you're fired.

[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.500]
Did it?

[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.200]
Afternoons 3 to 7.

[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.740]
Person's 25 to 54.

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.480]
Let's see how the mad dog did against labastered.

[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.280]
IOD 2.9.

[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.340]
Waxy 3.1 down to a 2.7.

[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.000]
Labastered.

[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.420]
He's slipping.

[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.580]
Where the hell are we, though?

[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.600]
Where's Qa-a-a-a-a?

[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.540]
Qa-a-a-a.

[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:17.440]
Oh.

[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:20.860]
Whoa.

[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.020]
Whoa.

[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.420]
From a 1-3 to a 1-4, though, that's an improvement.

[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.180]
So that means about a 2-8 in men's 25, 54 in the afternoon.

[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.700]
That is really nice move there.

[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.020]
Get rid of the Humper, by the way, Joe.

[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.520]
That was really good.

[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.660]
That was golden, you idiot.

[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.780]
That was funny.

[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.280]
God.

Let the sauna pass and we lost our job.

I really place it a flame on the new administration.

[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.240]
What the last eight years is hyperinflation.

[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.540]
It's a new administration.

[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.500]
The crazy things should be in the past.

[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.760]
With all the Republicans choosing your ass.

[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.300]
Black Dome.

[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.360]
All your bloomed stood crackin' once that great dust.

[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.280]
Here's a bailout check.

[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.820]
I have a great vacation.

[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.980]
U.S.A. is getting a chance.

[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.500]
And now the God is hyperinflation.

[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.000]
I'm dying on my hand.

[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.200]
North.

[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.440]
North.

[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.300]
You're going to water in sight, in front of the convenient future.

[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:12.500]
We are about to get to Cape andamebay, 5.

[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.060]
않...

[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.540]
Let's take a look at that schedule.

[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.260]
A huge hurricaneicking the ministry.

[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.060]
I thinklage 1.

[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.180]
Then from Georgia and say word.

[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:32.400]
No, four to seven. We got mad dogs seven to eight. It's a doffens tonight with the Kimba bowl camper and

[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.820]
then it's a Wednesday but we got the high school of good

[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.040]
I report from eight to nine because we can't put it on tomorrow because tomorrow night we got hurry Keynes football

[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.440]
Keynes and

[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.880]
Then 90 will have we got to the A show tonight the A by the way is

[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:52.020]
Below one again in purses 25 54 although he's got a oh point seven

[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.860]
So that means like a 1.4 in men

[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.100]
Why don't we just do transmit or maintenance my extrapolation here?

[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.620]
I figured we did close to a seven share in 10 to 2 in October men 25 54

[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.780]
Okay, well that would be a good start for the fall book mister. You're looking for that bonus money

[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.980]
I'm rubbing it right now. That's what I came back for from that the cushy summer schedule

[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:22.100]
The grab a hold of the reins and the rain on it and I'm gonna tell you something interesting

[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.720]
That's when we started doing the emails too and got rid of these stupid ass phone calls

[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.680]
Oh the phone calls are what make your show Neil interesting program. Yeah, right

[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.860]
Just because Jolly Bell wants to sit back and let a half a dozen a holes destroy the program

[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.220]
I don't want to do that Jolly Joe you moron

[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.480]
So that's why I had to come up with something new and different and exciting in fact

[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:49.900]
I've got some pretty interesting crap here on the email today that came in yesterday a fan is back and the fake Rick Rally is on there for the first time

[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:56.060]
Making an appearance and I've got some other crap. Well, I guess I can what would we need anything more from these ratings?

[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.580]
We didn't know anything more no

[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.820]
Anybody else we care about well, let's see how I OD did

[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.420]
Does this include any of the Jimmy Cifala show I

[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.040]
Would think so oh

[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:15.940]
My god, where the hell are they persons 25 54 where is W I OD the I love dreams baby? Where is it?

[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:24.860]
They just dropped slightly from a 2.2 from tied for 14th to 18th with a 2.0. Wow. That's pretty weak. What about in men? I know Jimmy likes his men

[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:26.760]
Let's see

[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.760]

[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.260]
Men 18 plus mornings you got it no all the numbers have gone I

[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.120]
Have nothing so surely I'm just stalling for time. Okay, it should be obvious to you after all these years

[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.280]
I see 10 to 3 3 to 7

[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.000]
7 to midnight what happened to my 6 to 10 a.m

[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.940]
Many things lost oh here it is right here right in my fat hand

[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:59.920]
Let's see w. I OD not on the first page. We got a 3.0 worth of bottom of the first page. We'll release around a first page

[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:09.560]
3 1 down to a 2 8. Uh-oh from 9th to tied for 12th with the coast and M.I.V

[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.140]
Dropping precipitously what about midday now that footsies gone huh 10 to 3 I OD

[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.600]
See all they care about here these goofballs of ours is across the street in us. They don't care about IOD

[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:30.140]
Ironsy they were a flat midday 3.0 to a 3.0. So I guess footsie was no great loss. Oh

[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.660]
No, that's persons 25 54 excuse me

[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.740]
They beat us in that but then again that includes rush. See that's rush

[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.200]

[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.020]
I'm just sick and tired of that fat fart already. No, I avoid them deathfully me too

[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.020]
Pill pop and fat fart

[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.180]
Comedian rush limbaugh is older man calls him. Let's see middays where's w. I.O.D. Are they on the first page? Oh, yeah

[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.400]
Look at that 5353 flat in men

[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.400]
Which means that the Nazis got a lot of diaries again here

[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.460]
Not good

[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:15.180]

[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.420]

[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.120]
Rather see the coast be number one anything

[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.440]
Then some no speaking English station

[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.180]
God you think we were working in a foreign country or something

[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.660]
No speaking English

[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.540]
Robertsons me a thing here. It's his gay or not gay a football team have come up with a cheeky new way to score from a free kick

[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.980]
Players from Italian side cut out Katania

[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.400]
Distracted the opposition goalkeeper by standing in front of him dropping their shorts and moaning him

[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.640]
The

[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:05.240]
Succeedion team from Italy's top flight series a carried out the maneuver to perfection as Giuseppe Mescara scored during a three to two and over Torino on Sunday

[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:12.900]
Katania chief executive Pietro La Monaco say yesterday. That's is a strategy that coach Walter something tries continually in training

[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.100]
former Italian referees chief Paolo Sessadin says it was unsportsman like

[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.340]
And Scotland's former top ref you Dallas agreed that Torino got a bum deal. Oh, is that a clever play on words or what?

[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:30.180]
However, he said the lowdown tactic was on unlike the to catch on in Scotland first though. I think it would just be too cold to do something like that here

[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:30.560]
He said

[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.040]
Maybe the dolphins can start doing that they can start moaning guys. What do you think? What do you think?

[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.020]

Yeah, but I mean this is Tuesday that this thing came in

[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.160]

2003 he was hired to become vice president general manager of Fox Sports Radio a unit of premier radio networks

[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:50.900]
He worked in Florida. He was the program director on this radio station once upon a time before muff came in

[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.940]
Before we came to the station didn't muff starts as the same time we did just before

[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.780]
Like just days before like yeah, well within a month or something like that

[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:04.640]
Remember that where did we have that lunch? It was at the place. It's not there anymore. It's taken out

[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:05.760]
No

[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.680]
Yes, they can now know it was not okay was all right

[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.340]
Stake and quail and Hollywood yeah, it's not there anymore. It's like no

[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:17.800]
I thought we had at ill-molino and plantase you might have had a lunch there

[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.720]
You know, I went to at least one with you and

[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.460]
I'm gonna do it right in the chair in a minute. You don't stop

[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.360]
I'm sure it was ill-molino but I was a good place to and it's not there anymore though

[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.920]
The original one of four laundry was still there by the gateway theater, but the one in the plantation no go no more

[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:40.580]
He was truly a valued mentor Andrew Asin the woods boss employee friend all around good guy who accomplished great things

[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.140]
From a radio network's president Charlie Rahili was quoted to sing on w.o.a. I's AM Webster about asked with

[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.340]
I am the pressure's building battle them going to go Joyce

[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.900]
He was diagnosed with cancer three years ago. We fought it to nationally telling friends failure is not an option

[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.160]
but

[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.120]
He failed

[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.480]
He was native of Elm Grove, Wisconsin was a lifelong green Bay Packers fan. Ah that explains it

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.700]
That explains it

[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.060]
Once Brett Farve came back and to put on that jets uniform. That was the info Andrew's ass in the woods

[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.120]
He graduated from oh my god. He graduated from Albeon College in Michigan

[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.780]
W.A.L.M Albeon Michigan. I worked there in 1975. How do you like that?

[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.760]
And I broadcast Albeon College football and basketball did you know that I do know like sure as hell did

[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:36.120]
The Albeon Wildcats that was the high school team. I don't remember what the football the college team was

[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.780]
We went to hope michigan and uh oh aliphate all these other little

[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:46.380]
Dorky towns he survived by his wife Sandra and the sisters and in Lori funeral arrangements are pending

[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.580]
I'm not going to tell that story about him and I'll leave it to Norma Kent to tell us someday

[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.600]
It would just be bad form you know when somebody croaks

[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.360]
It was certainly not something I would have ever told while he was alive and not that he's dead

[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.860]
I don't know I might as well. Now I'm not going to do it

[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.940]
The Dow is down 82 point you know it

[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.500]
Right I do

[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.200]
Now would you tell it on the air? I I don't know

[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.720]
Well come on I'm looking for a little assistance here a little ass in the woods all uh

[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.260]
No probably not no it would be

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.800]
And well what's the point of beating somebody up after especially died from cancer?

[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.680]
It was a young guy. If it wasn't your old just thinking about you know family members and things like that right that's right

[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.160]
Why do people need to know something?

[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.000]
Subrosal like that. I mean

[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.040]
Okay, here's the uphold so far

[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.060]
Oh well I'm getting old you know in my earlier days that I just blurred it or write out

[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:45.720]
To your question before yes, it looks like a Ron and Paul are on to 11 and then 11 to 2 is toast by himself

[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.040]
Oh my god to those guys sucker what toast yep

[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.140]
Toast wasn't young with the the the round table and blue Kenny and blow morning show

[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:56.700]
Oh

[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.820]
Get out all the good bits that we have in there and he just keeps bouncing back and forth war those flunky

[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.560]
Morning shows to another one toast somebody out of put him his ass in the toaster and put it on a high cook

[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.780]
What a he's the one that brought over that square table and crap from across the street

[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.580]
He's the one that sabotaged that great Kenny and blow morning show

[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.120]
Robert Creeper the grim reaper lord of the board

[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.660]
I'm telling you the minute I heard that I wanted to kill somebody

[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.420]
Probably Joe Bell

[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.640]
How do you most often eat ice cream as a Charlie B don't play me or Georgia or even fat Chris for this pull we had nothing to do with it

[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.740]
It just was the first one on the list

[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.920]
Let's see oh wait a minute

[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.140]
Oh the fake Greg Vue del Bubba's contract is up in January you blew it well. You know what too bad

[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:46.720]
I got a contract starts in January and you're tampering with my contract fake Greg Vue del

[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.160]
They just want to stop with his nonsense and they keep calling normal with fake phone numbers and fake names and yeah

[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.420]
But at least it keeps him off the streets

[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.020]
Of course if you were stuck in my comrie Alabama

[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.640]
You'd probably be looking for something else to do too all the time

[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:06.520]
I'm gonna be a joicing during the break good and then when we come back we'll read the results of the scintillating pull

[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.620]
There's a fairy

[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:24.140]
You're listening to sports radio 560 wqam

[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.860]
This is the neo-roger show

[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:31.720]
Your brain

[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.580]
Any questions

[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.020]
Especially look at the resources again

[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:01.660]
I'm not gonna close any doors of opportunity and the and the doors open for me to do so

[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.760]
It would be something that I am who I am though and I got like I see it in some of those questions, you know regarding

[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.680]
Okay, I'm not gonna close any doors that perhaps would be in front of me and with

[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.040]
I'm not gonna close any door there in terms of opportunity to maybe there in the future

[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.040]
My god hands if he's got doors open for me

[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.340]
Again, I'm not gonna close any doors of opportunity

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.100]
Don't get there up. We're almost out of time so quickly

[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.580]
Are you ready to run for the presidency is that something that would in I'm not gonna close any door there

[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:33.100]
In terms of opportunity that may be there in the future, but if it's right you don't run race to lose my goodness

[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:39.820]
Excellent, baby. I like that. Wow

[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:46.100]
I and I started to promote your appearance this weekend and then you interrupted or something. Yeah, I don't sorry. I keep doing that

[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.620]
Well don't do that or nobody else show up and they say oh jeez old man

[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.360]
You got no audience get paid to say

[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.760]
Uh comes he George the Saturday November 20th from what I'm interrupting

[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.960]
Oh, and by the way flees an idiot

[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:05.760]
You know yesterday, wait he's just another groupie of this show. He doesn't uh do his job

[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.220]
All he's interested in doing is sending me breathless emails

[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.940]
He says the word is that bubble love sponge is starting in 92 rock the beginning of the year. Oh my god

[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:19.880]
Oh my god. I bet he makes just as much of a big impact on the market is uh man cow remember that oh yeah

[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:24.660]
Who is bubble love sponge what who is that hey reject from Tampa oh

[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:34.780]
Who's on serious by the way and now this is this is the song and an answer that they're peddling me again with these fake emails

[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:39.460]
Oh, he's leaving the beginning of the year as contracts up and you blew it you had a chance to but you know something

[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:44.480]
Nobody negotiates through blind fake emails on the internet, okay?

[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:49.300]
I know that comes as a great surprise to the fake Greg Bidale and the fake fake sonny Fox and a fake

[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:53.220]
This one and that one but nobody negotiates with somebody by uh, you know

[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.460]
sending a bunch of blind fake emails. Oh, you really blew it this time screw them

[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.860]
I got a deal here five years and two a month and a half and I'm sticking it out

[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.680]
You see it? Oh look at that you must have good eyesight you

[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.960]
Yeah, exactly put it away. That's right

[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.360]
Sounds to me like people are contract tampering

[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.200]
I'm gonna sue the people that's serious for a trillion dollars then of course they ain't got it anyway 21 cents a share

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.720]
Who the hell are they kidding the does down 20 124 by the way

[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.840]
The Dow is down when it down bail them out

[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.400]
I have very ambivalent feelings about that whole deal

[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:36.580]
Of course the auto industry probably never get the money anyway probably a Hank Palson get a lot of it and then Bernanke you get the other half

[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.780]
12 and a half billion a piece

[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:43.320]
Sounds like a good parting gift even the Hollywood squares they never gave parting gifts that good

[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:53.500]
Come see George this Saturday November 22 from three to five and Metro PCS 282 northeast eighth street in a homestead for your chance to see the ultimate college football championship game experience

[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:26.100]
So Lee who yesterday couldn't be bothered to give us the correct information on the McDonald's promotion when we were desperately trying to find out for the audience

[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.980]
Who wanted to you know go and partake

[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.360]
And we're begging and pleading with him give us the information is it in Palm Beach is it in just in Dayton?

[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:38.480]
Broward is it in Monroe? Yeah, what's what's the story if I couldn't be bothered sends you some stupid text message

[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.040]
Oh does Neil want me to call in?

[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.080]
That's what you got I think basically he had the potential for bringing a pretty good guy

[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.960]
I said then hanging around for 10 years with jolly joe look what that did him turn him into a walking turd

[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.840]
Oh, you can you can smell him coming

[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.200]
So to speak a walking turd oh must be fleek

[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.740]
Smells like crap

[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.440]
Here's when it says our needle are you kidding? I'd rather do you than George any day

[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:12.500]
Lath my ass off left my effing ass off it says LM FAO not just LM aO

[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:18.340]
Well, when did that start all these uh shorthand texting is that what it was?

[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.160]
Texting especially in the very early days. I mean they would charge you by the letter and by the way Norma

[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.600]
Don't be a schmuck. Okay. Don't be returning fake phone calls. There's nobody wants me on serious erects M or BM maybe BM

[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.800]

[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:32.540]
I

[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.300]
Had a successful movement there man even the sink and floatly would it she did if she would have given me a

[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.140]
Siting ovation

[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.700]
I gave myself a sitting ovation as a matter of fact her old says

[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.960]
Giving some good emails now. I'm telling you this thing is going over bigger than freaking a six million dollar man

[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.420]
I still keep thinking of that scene in network

[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.760]
mm-hmm

[00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:00.480]

[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.020]
If I wrap it yeah, it's elephant

[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:12.440]
The thousand one sixteen. I just keep giving you that number so that a lot of you people can realize it's a selling opportunity and get out before it's too late before the

[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.620]
Number starts with a zero

[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:18.160]
I don't care what that pasty of bitch Maria says, you know get out

[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.520]
High neil. I prefer the email format myself not being a call in type. I left Florida long ago a few years before you came on the scene

[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:29.280]
I ended up touring with a singer songwriter actor for 30 years had a ball living in New York

[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.280]
San Francisco and Branson, Missouri

[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.040]
Before I felt the need to come back here to keep an eye and help out my dear ma who lives in cemetery village

[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.620]
I'm living in Hollywood never loved my amy much was happy to see in my rearview mirror

[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.460]
But felt it was the right thing to do to return

[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:49.160]
Anyhow I discovered your show around the alien Gonzalez time and it's helped tremendously with my attitude about being back here

There seem to be some author who don't realize how lucky they are to have your show to listen to it's as good as it gets

[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.460]
It's as good used to be as good as it gets now. It's as good as they let it get

[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.800]

[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.840]
somebody likes us

[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.760]
I got all kinds of really great stuff some of it came in yesterday another one follow up from a fan his response

[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:46.060]
I'm telling you it's got to be Dan from Maryland. There is nobody else that dysfunctional on the face of the globe

[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:52.400]
a fan with it with another phonia email address. How about a name it just make up a name would be good

[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.260]
I

[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:59.960]
Got another ass looking one here. Oh, we got the Gary Goldbart is bad. I was asking about him

[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:08.080]
Yeah, wasn't I yes you were about G Goldbart in New Orleans. What's the streaming? Where's the archives?

[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.480]
Thank you Eric he finally gets around to saying

[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.540]
Boy you really must hate me. Yes, we do

[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.460]
What

[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.420]
I

[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.660]
They're always winding complaint then they pretend they're not winding

[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:31.320]
It's almost a former psychosis for you after being a rabid fan for over 25 years and almost never calling until you went email a few months ago

[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:36.700]
To have me categorized as some type of chronic in a class with jamba and I'm your friend is outrageous

[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:44.660]
I sent you only about four or five emails. Oh my god four or five hundred emails all relating to just wanting to hear the show

[00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:45.940]
Is that really so bad?

[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:53.060]
He doesn't mention that they were costic psychotic hysterical like somehow, uh, you know, we were doing it to spite him or something

[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.360]
Anyway, after hearing myself being berated multiple times on Monday show for not writing. Thank you Eric immediately

[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:02.140]
I didn't know the archive was fixed until today

[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:07.100]
This was sent yesterday at 9.43 pm last night. Thank you. Thank you Eric

[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.420]
P.S. Please don't block my future emails

[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.960]
Believe me my crime I just wanted to hear the show shouldn't rise to that level of punishment

[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:18.140]
You never know I might have something interesting in the form of a feedback for uh listeners in the future

[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.920]
Thanks again Eric still live here in New Orleans GG. Oh

[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:23.940]
God

[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.820]
As if we care you know what I mean do we care he's still live in New Orleans?

[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.100]
Does it that warm your heart?

[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.020]
No, the concept of your heart would have been better heart is it hard dying over here

[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.040]
See people think that because they've been listening a long time and I'm not in grade

[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.720]
I appreciate people like when we did the appearance of golfing there were some people who went back to the KAT days

[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.920]
Have listened for like 30 years and then and then some and then and then this

[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.680]
200 E3 votes on that ice cream pool. Well, that's shocking

[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.820]
What's our goal in the bowl?

[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.000]
Say I just I just met my I just met my goal in the bowl

[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:08.460]
Oh, yeah, and I had a heavy heavy duty goal. What is it? I say 450 450 okay. That's what fat Chris says

[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:13.440]
And by the way, quit give me lectures about how I treat fat Chris and George and this and that I treat everybody just fine

[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.340]
This is a radio show

[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.160]
They'd like the abuse otherwise. They wouldn't be on here

[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.360]
Think with the kind of money these guys are getting paid if they didn't like abuse

[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:24.460]
They would be doing these jobs my god they can go out and pick grapes and make more than they're making this

[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:31.280]
Go out and work in the fields man with all those little aliens pick my nose and make more money now that's right

[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:37.300]
He could be picking digging for gold right now instead of sitting there listening all this hazer eye

[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:44.920]
Let me just take a quick peek. Oh good. There's no calls. I mean there isn't any reason why there should be but I'm just saying

[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.560]
Because you know me. I'm and that that that is one of my worst or here's the fake Barry Jackass

[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:57.260]
Muppet loves puns leaving serious at the end of the area syndication deal with Cox broadcasting. Well, that's great

[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.820]
Woo hoo. Oh, I hope he has a real good time with those people

[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.080]
Just wait till the first complaint comes in oh geez. We don't want that again. Oh, no

[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:12.940]
You

[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.400]
Here's somebody sends me an article about

[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.020]
Some homeless person. I don't even know what it is should I should I print it out?

[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:29.140]
I don't know if it's good. I don't know if it's good. I don't have it. See you don't understand how I do this I do but I never was

[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:34.020]
Even new email on me. Yeah, I click it open and I try to like get the the drift of it, you know the

[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:40.000]
The gist of it of it. Yeah, I heard what you said. Mm-hmm. That was down 99 by the way. It's under 100

[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.600]
It's under 100 on the down on the ass side

[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.620]
I'm now it's down 103 like I said. It's over 100. Sorry Maria. It looks like a selling opportunity to me

[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.260]
Get rid of that schlock stock

[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:55.540]
There's the president of the UAW. He's pissed off and 25 years. He says we want big money

[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.940]
We want billions and billions and billions and billions otherwise we're gonna fire all those people are all gonna lose their jobs

[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:06.580]
And then everybody's gonna have to buy like you know, it was good and what's gonna happen to my Corvette's if they closed down GM

[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.080]
Which isn't gonna happen. What would happen?

[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.660]
Nothing no more vets. I can't afford to be buying any more vets anyway

[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:16.200]
You kidding me?

[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:22.040]
They got a new one. It's like 110 grand or something like whether oh, it's just unbelievable. I haven't seen it yet

[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.940]
But I mean people have been describing it to me

[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:26.780]
Yeah

[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:32.040]
Maybe for Christmas maybe you're fed crystal by me a new vet say what you heard about that box

[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.260]
That's what the least you can do

[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.220]
The way I've gone to bat for you against all odds the way you treat clearance

[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:44.040]
The way you deny him every time he wants you on a weekend. I bet you jolly joe wants you on a weekend too

[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:45.700]
and the weekdays

[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.420]
These numbers weren't they weren't like god awful

[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.320]
You know, I mean we were dropping off for pretty weak months

[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:55.740]
But we must have done okay. We must have done especially men 2554 in October

[00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:00.780]
And that's because I got the emails now that's because I bailed myself on the one thing

[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.680]
And this is the truth the one thing I've done over the years is reinvented the show

[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:11.420]
From time to time. Mm-hmm like when I used to have those boring guests on oh my god

[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.560]
I want to apologize for those shows again

[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:14.520]
Sorry

[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:21.560]

I'm looking for doctor slowing boy's voice never be sent dead

[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:56.720]

[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:00.860]
That's what I want you for all right. I'll write that skimmy sponge

[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.280]
I'm returning you to psychus

[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.800]
Yeah, good luck to you, but I'm lost

[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.840]

Hey, are you gonna help me a kid cracking wise? All right make a life right

[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.080]

What up? I said

[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.740]
You know your door is a job

[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.040]
It's not a job it's a door

[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:38.780]
I'll see here's put on breath omos and I don't care if you're smear the road with brain cell

[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.480]
Hey

[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.820]
Like I hear he's in the wrong way

[00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:42.880]
Yeah, oh

[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:49.320]
He's playing chicken and I'll back down see show getting killed who is that guy?

[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.840]
Koby that you look like a jacks

[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.860]
Koby that's you

[00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:01.080]
Yeah, they're right, but never mind that you can go in and try like a man

[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:02.260]
Oh

[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.200]
Oh

[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:16.420]
Or

[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.500]
1119 at 560 wqa. I'm happy Wednesday to it, but I'll tell you I am really ready to go and it's nasty looking

[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:31.600]
It's really murky and gray and it looks like wintertime you wonder why it's gonna snow later. It is too

[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.620]
Well don't tell me it's snowing already

[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:37.780]
I'm looking on top of the bus

[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.940]
And it looks like snow

[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.300]
Yeah, that must not be you must not be from here

[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.820]
It must to come in from like orilia or somewhere like that or really

[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:52.580]
Oh really well, let me take a peek and see what the temperatures because I'm sure the castronovas take a notes

[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:56.260]
Especially now that they had that awful trend. Oh my god

[00:59:57.620 --> 00:59:59.660]
Minus four what that was at like 26

[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.780]
And it's gonna snow starting night and then overnight we're gonna have like five to ten centimeters

[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.120]
Ten centimeters like a couple of inches. Oh no

[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.640]
I sure wish I had a couple while anyway Thursday plus one sunny with a little more snow

[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.920]
And then Saturday minus two for a high

[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:22.500]
28 degrees for i but sunny all right. It's not windy. It's not so bad

[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.560]
That's called rationalizing now

[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.980]
Lex says I listen to sports radio religiously on 790 but as soon as 10 o'clock rolls around I switch to you guys

[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:35.760]
I would rather listen to my own screams of agony while having my fingernails pulled out and listen to my

[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:41.460]
Those debags and the other stationery and be tended to our long-lived and prosperous as Lex thanks Lex he says wow

[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.100]
That's what they're probably similar. They look at those numbers too. Wow. They really they went down

[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.500]
Down down. Got to got to go down and not up

[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:56.320]
Then of course that was just the very beginning of the dolphin of course the dolphin success story didn't start till uh november

[01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.180]
Pretty much right end of october and then november yeah

[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.600]
So why don't everybody's jumping on the bandwagon that should help push us through the roof and other fall book

[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:12.920]
Oh, I'm smelling big bonus money, baby. I bet your pockos got plans for it already. I mean I got plans for it already

[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:21.900]
What are you laughing about? Oh, I can't make any plans for my money because everybody else. I know he's already got plans. Oh, I know what that's all about yeah. I know

[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:30.120]
Look just in case Charlie Beel's still got those four polls listed up there and waiting

[01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.920]
306 votes on a pool. What do we say our goal was three ten and then we go home?

[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:40.400]
Yes, how do you most often eat ice cream in a but this is a horrible pool. How do you most often eat it with my mouth?

[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.600]
Yeah, oh there's that the fruitcake. There's that uh Ali uh

[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:49.260]
Feltcher on CNN. He's getting ready to articulate

[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.980]
In a bowl 142 that's where I do it in the bowl

[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.740]
Right out of the carton 70 that's me. I knew it and I eat it right out of the carton

[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.420]
I can't even remember last time I put ice cream in a bowl. What would be the point?

[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:05.540]
Well

[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.920]
To eat it huh to eat it. No, no, but I'm saying what would be the point when I know I'm gonna finish whatever's in the carton anyway

[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.080]
Well some of us don't do it that way people well

[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.460]
I know people who like eat a scoop or two and they put it in a bowl and they put the rest in the freezer. Yeah, I know

[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.600]
I don't put the rest in the freezer. He put it in your lap. I put it in my mouth

[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.700]
Right out of the carton 70

[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.080]
Nuke it and the eat it in a cone 30

[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.140]
How about a waffle cone? Oh those are good. They are good

[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:36.920]
Extra sugar man get you really get up talk about a buzz

[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:42.280]
Look around everything will be in a fuzz because you got such a buzz when you're eating that waffle cone

[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.400]
What about those little sugar cones? What about them? Those are good. They're good

[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.440]
But the waffle cones are the cats pajamas. Yeah, that's right. So waffle cones got like about 80,000 calories

[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.420]
Licking it off somebody's body 13

[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.620]
Boy, I wonder if Brady Quinn's gonna be in town this weekend

[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.740]
Fish food off of Brady Quinn's chest

[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.040]
Uh in a Sunday 12. I don't like ice cream 11 now. I don't believe that

[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.120]
Wasn't it cordist that said he wasn't an ice cream guy? Or is it fat Chris? I said, I don't know a crave it like you do

[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.760]
I know that see everything has got to be just like the stern thing. I wasn't comparing myself to sterner to anybody else

[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.760]
I'm just I like ice cream. I don't have it very often

[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.420]
Okay, there you go and you guy like you can't afford to have it very often me either except every day

[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:37.960]
I think I had some yesterday. I can't even remember. Oh, it'll be the devil life is like a blur of sugar

[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.840]
I'm addicted to azucada maybe and of course if Cedar cruiser come back and sing those sweet songs in my ear

[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.060]
I can probably pass it

[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:51.240]
Well, was she a nasty bitch? A nook at first eight see I taught the audience that you got a nook at first

[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.880]
Especially when you buy your ice cream like in a little convenience store

[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.800]
And it's been and the pint has been sitting in there for like seven months

[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.940]
You know, and it's just frozen up blocking jerry's is so dense, you know, it's not whipped

[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.640]
Like our management

[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:11.440]
They not whipped right so you look at first. I got a new guy. I like it, but I can't eat it eight on a stick eight

[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.680]
On a pie or in a cake five in a sandwich ice cream sandwich only one

[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.740]
Solamente uno and an ice cream sandwich

[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:24.860]
Carvella you stay those flying saucers. Oh, there's alley felching is taking your calls and listening to your concerns on his radio show

[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.220]
Let's listen to oh, yeah, let's listen into alley felching radio show

[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.880]
To me to ask the question to on the phone hi Sebastian. Hey listen

I suggest you hold on second. I just want to give you all the phone number. It's eight seven seven two six

[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:44.260]
This is a guy who's on CNN radio probably six thousand radio stations and he's had pumping the phone number

[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.440]
My god, he's probably got as many calls as we got

[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.140]
None

[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:54.180]
Okay, here's this story and nothing I want any calls. I got a whole pile of stuff here

[01:04:54.180 --> 01:05:00.340]
And the emails are just pouring in I can't wait to hear more from the fake Greg Vuelnell about how I blew it and we blew that serious deal

[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:05.700]
So serious wanted Neil, but he's too much of a coward to go branch out. He would have been so great

[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:10.840]
I'm so sick and tired of those people man. Oh, and I got to get to my fan. Oh, here's a good one

[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:17.200]
See rob in lauderdale and you've sent me so many of your ponderous emails and it's always DC rfm

[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.380]
And now he thinks because he doesn't put his name on the bottom of this one that I'm not gonna know who it is

[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.580]
His liver because he's got nothing else to say

[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:28.360]
Why do you cry when people repute but you have no trouble ripping fat Chris taking everyone else if you're gonna

[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.560]
Dish it out then be prepared to take it in I'm prepared

[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.220]
I enjoy it when I read it. Oh, I first of all

[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:40.220]
Nobody's compelling me to read any of that hostile mail on the air. I love it. That's my favorite

[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.320]
Rob

[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:46.620]
Get a new deal rob. Okay, you're not fooling anybody with that phony email address years

[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.800]
The sports radio five forty solid

[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:06.980]
Good morning, Americans. It's Paul Harvey standby for news

[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:13.800]
Willie is driving through Texas with his friend Scott. I'll say it again Willie and Scott driving

[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:15.340]
through Texas

[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:19.500]
Willie gets pulled over by a state trooper for speeding

[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.680]
The trooper walks up to the driver's side of the car gets out his Billy Club and

[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.560]
smacks Willie across the face

[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.420]
stunned Willie asks why did you do that

[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:40.620]
The trooper responds while you're in Texas now son and you have that license out and ready when I arrive

[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.460]
I apologize sir. I'm not from around

[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:45.960]
Here

[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:51.280]
The trooper then walks to the passenger side of the car and taps on the window

[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:56.780]
Scott rolls down his window and the trooper takes out his Billy Club and smacks him across the face

[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:03.640]
What was that for as Scott? I know your kind says the trooper about two miles down the road

[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.780]
You would have looked at your buddy and said I wish that son of a bitch would have tried that with me

[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:09.960]
Paul Harvey good day

[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.360]
Good day and did Paul Harvey say son of a bitch. Oh my god. You can't say that. I already know

[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.220]
Maybe of a bitch, but not son of a bitch

[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.300]
1132 at 560 WQM

[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:25.420]
We are having a party in our pants today because the ratings came out and we're still on the air

[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.820]
Woot. Oh, and I never did mention the number across the street midday

[01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:36.760]
Let's get that back on her because Jorge Sedano. He's a rising star of the future in the Neil wannabe a groupie

[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:37.960]
He's a groupie of mine

[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:44.040]
Let's see many teen plus we had a 3.4 10 to 3 so we had whatever we had

[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.160]
And where's Waxi are they on the first page? No

[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.060]
Are they on the second page? No

[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:57.800]
They're on the top of the third page though. They went from a 22 to a 23 well nobody wants to be running around with a 22

[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.640]
So they went from 18 to a tie for 17 tied with

[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:06.780]
Y 100 and on scare America at a 22. What Asia took a dive?

[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:13.900]
Now this would indicate to me that um not too many progressive liberal

[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.200]
Obama people are got the diaries again. Right

[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.180]
Because when scare America goes down. How do they do in the morning scare America?

[01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:31.300]
I mean, I have no idea what they've got on or who or what a shame what a waste of that 50,000-mots signal

[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.760]
17 down to a 1-2. See what I mean?

[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.580]
Now if the Obama people if they living and breathing people would have gotten the diaries

[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:42.520]
They would have gone zooming on up there with their progressive scare America's shwil

[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.060]
Mar part says this is another chronic a email or but they listen and if I call you chronic that does mean we don't want your emails

[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:55.840]
Okay, don't stop with emails because the emails are sure better than I'm your friend. I'm your friend

[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.340]
See September was I'm your friend all month and

[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.420]
And October was emails I see that that's correct

[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.260]
Nobody in their right mind wants to your I'm your friend

[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:13.640]
Wonderful program. No, nobody wants to hear that swill

[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:18.360]
For four hours much less four minutes Johnny Joe though is too stupid to understand that

[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:22.280]
Oh, well if Neil would just screen the calls Joyce talked to all these other talk radio stage

[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.800]
Well, guess what the other talk radio shows don't do what Neil Rogers did

[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.740]
Okay, I'm not interested in what other people do and then I get that that's what really cracks me up about these people

[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:37.360]
Oh, you know he ripped off how or you wanted me I never even heard howard when I changed my show at INZ never even had heard him

[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:44.020]
But I was doing howard show what what is it that I do that's got anything to do with how we're talking about boobs and

[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:51.160]
broad I have never heard the similarity none one absolutely not anything else George anything else

[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.060]
Yeah, I'm gonna start doing that at the end of the show you'll kill me

[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.800]
I'll fall right over

[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:58.680]
Mar parts is I usually eat ice cream blended in the milkshake

[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.040]
Can you add that to the pool you want to put milkshake that that's not ice cream. I mean it's it

[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.360]
But if you want to get technical about it. No

[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.280]
All that we put ice cream sandwich on there

[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.440]
That's more than what that is ice cream

[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.700]
And what about milkshake ice cream milkshake is more than just ice cream it's milk and and like a malt is god like malt

[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.040]
Hmm

[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.760]
Flutes I don't care put it in the shape floats

[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.620]
You want to put milkshake on there go ahead and put on there get more votes for fat Chris

[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.620]
Chris gets paid by the vote by the way

[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.520]
They like you. I don't know what it is with the on remember we took that poll a couple days ago and you came out last which was really first

[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.520]
Mm-hmm of all the people that they wanted to vote off the show. I was very proud

[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:46.180]
You should say it loud and say it proud in fact. How much of a jolly Joe gives you double the goods this weekend

[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:52.140]
W attacked that that was down 195 dollar and 30 cent

[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:53.520]
Wow

[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.060]
Let's just sit here and I'm gonna keep like you look at how it worked for Rick Riley

[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:02.100]
Oh, I have an email from the fake Rick Riley. Where is it?

[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:06.400]
I got to get to all these good ones including the one from my the fan

[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.280]
I'm saving that though

[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.320]
Here it is

[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.860]
Down 194 what did I just say minute ago?

[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:18.680]
I don't know what down 188's making a comeback Maria Maria's got her foot on the break

[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.520]
Give us a break Neil give us a break. Okay. We want to sell this crap

[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.800]
Put some lipstick on that pig

[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.760]
Best regards the fake Rick Riley now and for all I know might be the real one

[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.240]
I don't know like you said yesterday who the hell knows if any of these people are real

[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.200]
Right other than Johnny dork. I don't believe that any of them are real Johnny dork

[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.880]
Any of them none

[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:45.080]
Even the ones who are like they have a name if it's a bish

[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.420]
Even I don't believe it. No

[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:51.540]
That's funny you said that because I was just an a virgin saying ishk bivle. Yeah. I always say ishk bivle

[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:52.240]
Do you know?

[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.440]
The dow's down 203.82 cent

[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.560]
I wonder if that series is down to like five cent yet

[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.040]
Don't make any deals normal. Okay. They can't afford first of all. What the hell would they pay me anyway

[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.360]
Even with my grotesque pay reduction starting in January

[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.900]
They're never gonna pay me that kind of money in a million years. They don't aren't gonna do it

[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.720]
Because I'm not from New York and I'm not one of Howard's ass kissers

[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.020]
So

[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:22.920]
Bubba loves fun to coin to flee is starting on what what is that station 93 FM is that what used to be Zeta is that what they butchered up and turned into a

[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.340]
Piece of turd

[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.120]
93

[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.660]
That in the rock

[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.760]
station is our quote-unquote rock so-called rock station. Yes

[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.800]
what crock station

[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.140]
That's Cox

[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.240]
A hoist no it's clear channel

[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.560]
No, no, well the one he's going to is that says he signed a deal with Cox going to a flee flee will tell y'all about it

[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.460]
He's the radioienta all right, bubba, bubba, bub

[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:50.700]
In fact flee can probably tell you the date that the the beast is gonna take over mid-days here on Q i m but you can

[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:57.380]
Hey, if they want to keep paying us more power to you beast. Let's get teens intensive. You and Don Bailey jr

[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.860]
and maybe you can maybe like two three times a week thinking you have Joseph gacchi on the days that they don't have

[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.040]
Drew Rosenstein and the days they don't have direct jurestry

[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.960]
Well, I'm telling you those what what is this company ever gonna learn

[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:15.920]
What is clearance ever going to learn? They just sit back and let him keep making the same mistakes over and over.

[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:20.800]
Now let me ask you, Fett, Chris, is Manage doing guest now or what? Because I know he used to hate guests.

[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.240]
I know he would before the football season started, he would have like the play by play guys come on for each team.

[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.620]
But I'm not sure if he's doing like regular. Well he has Warren Saap on actually.

[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.880]
Once a week. That's Saap.

[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.900]
And let me ask you how can Shannon Sharp still be on my TV on a weekend? How can he be on there?

[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.620]
I think isn't there some kind of computer chip that they can run it to get and keep him off my set?

[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.180]
An S chip? Yeah.

[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.840]
Stands for Shannon not so sharp. Yeah.

[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.140]
I think that you just make you mad.

[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:58.300]
Well, I flip it real fast. I don't watch the pregame and post him all those and even Danny boy.

[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:05.380]
All in and Jimmy Johnson when I see him on here, I just want to get a shotgun when I see his ass on my TV.

[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.300]
The fake Rick Riley says, well I must have been I was a bit skeptical when I heard about you knew I found newfound obsession reading emails on the air.

[01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:15.780]
I thought it would be ponderous at best how wrong was I? This past week has been quite entertaining.

[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.540]
How often does one get to witness greatness descend into madness?

[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.940]
That's right. As a listener, I find myself wondering if you're conversing with real emailers, cranks, or just babbling to yourself.

[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.420]
Either way, it's great radio. You know something I could make them up.

[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.880]
I never really thought about that. I would have been able to make them up.

[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.380]
But I could do it. I could fast. I'm the one sending all the fake emails who else could pull off such a scam so masterfully.

[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.320]
Yes, it keeps us on our toes wondering if you finally lost your marbles or not.

[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:43.280]
Keep it up. Best regards are are. How do you like that?

[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.480]

[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:50.420]
Remember when they went to I and Z in the morning?

[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.680]
Yeah. Rick and Skud.

[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.660]
After I would be blue everybody out.

[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:59.000]
And then Rick decided he was a stock market maven.

[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.320]
And that is the end of Rick and Skud.

[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.920]
You mails with an inventory of emails.

[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.680]
I would get a familiar Mark Tarroma.

[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.440]
Biggest name.

[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.520]
The best town.

[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.880]
People with email projects.

[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.260]
Fort like you'll find sixty QAM.

[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.940]
The fourth week.

[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.740]
Howard David's a bitch.

[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.760]
Are you growing tired of sport already?

[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.560]
Oh, blah, blah, blah.

[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.140]
Well, we are too.

[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.880]
Let me just feel like.

[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.840]
Flea, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.260]
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.200]
How's that?

[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:53.420]
A management at 560WQAM finally grew a pair.

[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.500]
And we called on the Suds and Rick pulled out my floppy last night.

[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.420]
Oh, Kleenex.

[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:02.900]
Starting this Monday, 6010AM, it's the Suds and Rick show.

[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:03.560]
Jamit.

[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.360]
Only on 560WQAM.

[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.700]
145-560 WQM go to hell is right

[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.340]
What's all that noise oh they're drilling again mister? What now they're gonna finish with that erection?

[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.580]
Don't know the real Barry Macockner

[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:19.560]
You're what?

[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.800]
And why do you keep making me repeat that name?

[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:28.240]
Because it's funny. Well, that's what it's supposed to be. It's obviously a very what no very Mac

[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.100]
Why in hell does George think I see mailers aren't real?

[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.400]
I'm right by the way

[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.940]
You're gonna be very disturbed one time. I'm starting to get a scratchy throw

[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:41.160]
I am really good at these good days Friday. Oh geez. It's not I'm very upset what well Friday. We got a short show anyway

[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.540]
That's right 1245 we get out. Let me look at that again 45 with 35

[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.440]
35 I'm thinking like 12.05 sounds good to me

[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:55.320]
Let me take a puke at it okay because I've got the schedule. I've got your promo stapled of the schedule

[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:57.580]
So I can't see Friday

[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:58.880]
12

[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.080]
45 oh 45 see there's fat Chris again trying to shun work

[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.840]
He's just always trying to shy away. Yeah, cuz I'm only gonna be here for us 16 hours a day before so well

[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.060]
You know what quit your belly. Yeah, can you get paid by the hour? What else are you gonna be doing?

[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.860]
shoving ice cream down your tub. Yeah, exactly

[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:21.600]
Anyway, uh, Barry says I'm very upset over the revelation. I may not exist anyway. I love the show especially fat Chris and flea

[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:24.280]
That's not fake

[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:26.720]
That's fake. All right

[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.120]
Walt says about it and then I'm gonna get to um, ah geez

[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.240]
Here we go a fans response a fan

[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.420]
Number a fan I would read on the edge of my seat

[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:45.860]
Walt says like ice cream way too much can't eat it can eat it but won't that Schmidt will kill you but damn it

[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:49.420]
It tastes effing delicious. Don't think there's a bad flavor wrong about that

[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:53.580]
Then in juries makes lots of bad flavor since they sold out. Oh

[01:18:53.580 --> 01:19:00.160]
God they make the worst and then cookie dough remember Rick rallies to be obsessed with cookie dough cookie dough. I hate it

[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.580]
What was that song used to play all the time?

[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:13.540]
Yeah, you do keep singing it no

[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:20.700]
Butter beginner strawberry or peach makes me have my party in my pants as well. Well good mix them all together have some neopolitan in your pants

[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.860]
You ever have a neopolitan in your pants just this morning in Napoli

[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:31.540]
You know, I sure don't want to go to Naples man all the slippers are there. Okay. Here's a fans response Jay font

[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.780]
Who I'm positive I I would I'd say 95% chance is still a

[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.040]
Dan from Maryland

[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.900]
Hey, Neil I heard you read my email this morning Sarah

[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.520]
I could be spark couldn't be spundering your show hours as I do have a job in life

[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.620]
I'm like a lot of your crank calling butt sucking listeners

[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.140]
Sorry that I ruffled your feathers with my email you didn't ruffle my feathers at all

[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:57.540]
Your response shows that I hit a nerve in that there was a lot of truth my statements see they always say the same thing

[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:03.040]
Because I responded and I lashed out and the ripped it to pieces therefore it shows you hit a nerve

[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.960]
You didn't hit any nerve not even the funny bone

[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.800]
Before I go on I want to know I've listened to your show for more than 20 years

[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.180]
I think you have a great deal to tell enjoy listening to the show

[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:18.000]
I also admire the fact that with all the roadblocks you continue to deliver an entertaining show four hours a day

[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.080]
I'm sure it's a tough task to do now my response. Yes, it is a tough task to do

[01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:27.620]
It's a tough task just to motivate myself to get out of the sack and waddle in here in the morning and do all the

[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.300]
Cootraments that go along with the getting ready to do the show beforehand

[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.400]
like shave and shower and I

[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.580]
Never said you were not I intended an opinion on how it's turned you have you right to express an opinion as do I or anyone else

[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:46.020]
However, an opinion can still make you look foolish if I was to say I think a wopper is better tasting than a Ruth

[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:49.220]
Chris ribeye steak it would be my opinion, but people would know I was full of crap

[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:52.100]
See I didn't say anybody was better than Howard or worse than Howard

[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:57.180]
I wasn't comparing him anywhere. I was just expressing my opinion about his show and what he delivers. They're on serious

[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:01.900]
As opposed to what he used to deliver years ago. I wasn't comparing him to anything now

[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:05.120]
So where did that wopper come from and I don't want it

[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.800]
Listen, I'm on your side. I listen to you every day

[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:12.540]
I think your show is running at 30% capacity is still better than anything else on at this time

[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:18.980]
My only way and I'm waiting to hear this all right my only wishes that one day Howard will have you as a guest on his show

[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:22.060]
Announcing your new show where America can see your talents with no restrictions

[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.040]
It would be dynamite how it isn't gonna have me as a guest on his show

[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.200]
I don't want to be a guest on his show and I don't have an ego, okay?

[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:37.500]
And here comes one of the great lines of all time maybe Bob a Booey can take George out for lunch and teach him how to be a top notch producer

[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:44.360]
I only wish you a best friend. Hope that you have a great show today. I'm having a great show today

[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:48.220]
PS thank you so much for educating me on the difference between a jockey and a driver

[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:53.240]
I'm sure that that better wisdom will enhance my life somehow once again take care. Wish you the best a fan

[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:54.720]
Well, at least he had the

[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:59.660]
Decent seat to respond to follow up, you know like I requested but I'm sure it's a Dan from Maryland

[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:06.260]
Because it's the same thing the first time the first one ripping and tearing and shredding and then sucking up and looking and looking

[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:10.300]
And then you know the show is free the price is right you like it great. You know like it

[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.340]
That's great to have a lot of people listen who don't like it

[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:17.060]
Because they're massacres because they want to say man they want to bitch about how bad they think it is

[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:23.920]
The douse down 182 or bitch about the things I say on the air like about religions of pile of crap which anybody with a brain knows is true

[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:31.600]
Sure was funny yesterday near when you played fat Rosie and it had the gd word in it

[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:37.640]
I immediately said uh-oh and the second lady you said oh no and I fell in the floor laughing. That's a great sounding bit

[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:41.520]
I pasted this 18 new story

[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:50.500]
About these supposed new Buddha they see this guy has not drank or eaten anything in months. Well, that's great. Okay, delete

[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.980]
I don't read news stories. Sorry. I mean unless it's like you know real quick and to the point

[01:22:55.980 --> 01:23:00.700]
Johnny Rotten in Orlando says left Orlando money morning and when we hit the turnpike

[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:03.820]
I hit the radio to am the signal was crystal queer

[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:11.160]
Unbelievable we reached our home in West Palm Beach the signal was scratchy and heavy with Cubans in the background

[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:16.320]
Why is it so clear 250 miles away? I scream in the bowl damn it since Johnny Rotten

[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.240]
Also says love you lots

[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.140]
That's for you Johnny dip

[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:27.940]
I don't want to uh let's see. I don't want to work is the song used to play. Oh yeah, I don't want to work

[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:36.300]
I just want to sit him on my ass all day. Isn't that you know the one that's right. Is that what it's um? I don't want to work. I just want to yeah

[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:42.980]
The moral says death to flee. I hate flee like poison. Please have somebody break his knees

[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:49.120]
Also, I was at the Coliseum last night. I saw Joe Bell in fact Chris sipping down some

[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:54.800]
Apple teenies then when the song its raining men came on they removed their shirts and started dirty dancing

[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.480]
I noticed they had each other's name tattooed on their chest

[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:01.640]
Then out of nowhere they took their pants off and started doing the electric slide

[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.860]
We're wearing nothing but speedos to a wham song. It was very disturbing

[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:15.200]
And I noticed that rob from Lauderdale by never fed stuff to that the caustic email from before I'm onto your ass rob and you're enjoying it

[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:23.360]
Just when I thought they couldn't get any worse. They embarrassed they embraced in a long passionate kiss and fact Chris's speedo started to pitch attempt and Joe Bell

[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:25.720]
Oh, no, I'm not gonna read that

[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:33.600]
He led Chris off the dance floor into the dark. I immediately started to dry. He death to flee says the mole

[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.660]
So flee never came in and give you the allot on my tunnels and that whole deal. No, of course I didn't ask

[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.020]
Well, why not you don't care because I don't care

[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:47.300]
You just don't care about too many things no wonder your wife wishes you would cry just dying a fiery crash

[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:51.380]
She does and a blazing iron. I know that I don't make things like that up. That's too serial

[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.460]
Oh, Niels going to serious the next time start the room where he's going to series the great great

[01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:03.020]
$1.00 is getting them on air and sunny fox and all the other fakers the fake Adam Kirschner the fake at Andy. What was the name?

[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:05.780]
Cald Cald

[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:12.100]
I had a mental block at a brain fart on Andy kelp go as like tiny had a brain fart a real fart

[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.840]
dropped a little number on the floor and Andy's definitely into it. Oh, yeah, I don't know about that

[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.360]
That was my favorite. That was one of tiny's greatest moments

[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.840]
I'm back listening again now that the elections are over and you don't talk about

[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:32.140]
President Bush anymore. I've been listening since the WIO D days says Ricardo by the way stern is a copycat

[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.920]
Keep up the good work. See now just gratuitous shots in my good friend Howard

[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:37.760]
Copycat

[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.260]
Who's he copying?

[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.540]
Don't ask me everybody in his business gets accused of copying somebody else now Joey Reynolds of course

[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:49.300]
He he stole everybody's material just like cast and over does

[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.560]
But as far as being a copycat

[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.380]
I don't really know any I mean do you know anybody who's like a Phil Henry copycat or does voices?

[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.800]
I don't no

[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.200]
Although Stan major was kind of like a

[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.920]
Copycat how'd that work out for a Stan?

[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.080]
I think that's show on the Milky Way dark on the candy bars and the watches

[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.380]

To come out of the closet robin waterdale remember why I taught I caught him my red handed with that little shot. He took it me

You still suck George. Uh-huh

[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:55.520]
Now rob is one of those names that's pretty uh, that's like an erotic name. You know, I mean rob may be ugly as sin

[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.740]
But rob is like rob blow, you know

[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:00.480]
Yeah

[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:03.680]

[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.320]
I

[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:29.420]
Don't want to give me work. I want to bang on the drum all day and umpa umpa umpa see my my idea of Rick Rick Riley's

[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:35.040]
My impression of his interpretation of what he show was was umpa umpa like that, you know

[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:40.200]
No, that doesn't make any sense to a lot of people, but I think you relate you understand what I'm saying. No

[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.180]
No

[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:45.260]
Like kind of a circus thing, you know, I see

[01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:50.140]
Oh

[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:57.660]
Jamis

[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:05.940]
Well, I can't help it if you don't like it. I got it in the squad

[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:09.640]
I

[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.260]
Oh

[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:25.260]
That's

[01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:53.110]
I like Todd Runker.

[01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:54.470]
I like him just fine.

[01:31:54.990 --> 01:31:55.390]
Remember NAS?

[01:31:56.750 --> 01:32:01.250]
No, was he with the NAS, the song I saw the light was that time Runker and the NAS,

[01:32:01.410 --> 01:32:02.050]
that was just by himself.

[01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.750]
I saw the light.

[01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:04.470]
That was a good song.

[01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.750]
You got it?

[01:32:07.570 --> 01:32:08.610]
No, not that.

[01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:12.270]
He's a crap like that you got, but I saw the light, which is a great song I thought

[01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:12.430]
about.

[01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:14.110]
And NAS?

[01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.930]
And the father.

[01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:15.730]
And NAS without NAS.

[01:32:16.710 --> 01:32:17.350]
Without NAS?

[01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:19.510]
Yeah, those who know I'm saying he's without NAS.

[01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:21.490]
He Todd.

[01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:22.350]
You can go ahead.

[01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:23.310]
This was a big hit.

[01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:24.430]
You know?

[01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:25.470]
That means I have it.

[01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:28.230]
If it was a big hit, I have it.

[01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:33.210]
I didn't even have to be a big hit.

[01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:33.210]

[01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:35.410]
But it had to be something.

[01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:38.550]
I don't know.

[01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:39.710]
I don't know.

[01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:39.850]
I don't know.

[01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:40.290]
I want to guess the year?

[01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:43.630]
Oh, 68.

[01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:44.890]
Oh no, way out.

[01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.290]
72.

[01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:46.770]
Wow.

[01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:51.110]
Randy placed that song all the time on our show.

[01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:52.110]
Love the show, Steve.

[01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:53.330]
How do you like that?

[01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:54.690]
Randy is playing that song.

[01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.310]
Which one?

[01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:56.310]
This one here or the other?

[01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.750]
The other one?

[01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.470]
The third one.

[01:32:57.930 --> 01:32:57.930]

[01:32:57.930 --> 01:32:58.250]
The third one.

[01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.950]
The third one.

[01:32:59.450 --> 01:32:59.610]
The third one.

[01:32:59.670 --> 01:32:59.870]
The third one.

[01:32:59.870 --> 01:33:00.370]
The third one.

[01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:01.210]

[01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.350]

[01:33:02.150 --> 01:33:02.470]
The third one.

[01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:03.050]

[01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:09.750]
I was wondering if they had saved him.

[01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:11.050]
Oh!

[01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:14.350]
This is an election morning.

[01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.350]

[01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.350]

[01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:14.350]

[01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:16.130]
十 two people.

[01:33:16.130 --> 01:33:16.290]
That wouldn't be John.

[01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:16.290]

[01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.090]
Some people have been going around me since I was a kid.

[01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.450]
And someone cracked the affects you

[01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.450]

[01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.450]

[01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:18.170]
ask them to keep those thoughts in the hanq.

[01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:18.430]
I don'totional about it either.

[01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:18.670]
Why, one mind?

[01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:18.670]

[01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:18.670]

[01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:18.670]

[01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:29.330]
You don't count.

[01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:32.790]
Remember?

[01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.870]
れた…

[01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:33.030]
Just let me walk you.

[01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:32.890]
Are you interested.

[01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:36.930]
on a show compared to the FCC imposed and joy scene imposed restrictions on your show.

[01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:41.450]
His show is akin to rectal itch you can't reach more of an annoyance than anything.

[01:33:41.970 --> 01:33:45.150]
He couldn't do the show that you have to do with all the ridiculous parameters placed

[01:33:45.150 --> 01:33:45.530]
on you.

[01:33:45.810 --> 01:33:48.410]
And this includes Bobbibu is producing skills versus George.

[01:33:48.730 --> 01:33:49.250]
How do you like that?

[01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.830]
Thank you, Larry.

[01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:50.490]
Thank you, Larry.

[01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:54.330]
Larry, who's just got his tongue so far up our collective ass that it's going to come

[01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:55.230]
out of our ear one day.

[01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:57.930]
You know, I feel horrible for all the lousy guests that I booked for your show.

[01:33:58.190 --> 01:33:58.530]
Yeah.

[01:33:59.470 --> 01:34:01.870]
And where the hell are all those celebrities with those great celebrities?

[01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:03.110]
It was very John Stamos.

[01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:06.170]
He's old enough to be sorely inadequate.

[01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:11.410]
John Stamos was really something when he was on TV, General Hospital.

[01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:16.050]
What was the character he played on General Hospital?

[01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:16.570]
Asked me?

[01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.170]
Yeah.

[01:34:17.170 --> 01:34:18.890]
How much the gay ass America is?

[01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:19.350]
New York soap operas?

[01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.690]
I don't know.

[01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:21.410]
How much it does?

[01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:22.430]
Spick soap up right now.

[01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:23.010]
Blacky.

[01:34:23.130 --> 01:34:23.350]
Blacky.

[01:34:23.670 --> 01:34:24.730]
You just came to me.

[01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:26.370]
And the name too.

[01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:31.090]
Fake clearances after one of my 1000 meetings with Jolly Joe yesterday, we decided to put

[01:34:31.090 --> 01:34:33.030]
some limits on QAM.

[01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:36.070]
One, oh, I hear you're a thing there.

[01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:36.350]
Yeah.

[01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:36.890]
Is that normal?

[01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:37.570]
No.

[01:34:38.290 --> 01:34:39.530]
I told you what his response was.

[01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:44.270]
Yeah, he's getting sucked into all that phony.

[01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:46.250]
It's all a big scam, normal.

[01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:48.230]
Okay, go to court and save somebody, General.

[01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:51.330]
You're querying about all this serious crap.

[01:34:52.890 --> 01:34:56.050]
One, limiting big old only 20 times on ear each week down from 50.

[01:34:56.630 --> 01:34:59.590]
Two, the amount of spots your rose can do each hour from 200 to 199.

[01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:00.270]
We love money.

[01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:04.710]
Three, the amount of times mad dog can take vacations per week from three to one.

[01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:08.250]
Four, the amount of times fat ass, crisp and locked lips with Jolly Joe each day.

[01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:11.470]
Jolly Joe can't get any work done because Tubby won't stop kissing ass.

[01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:13.770]
With more changes, Pennay, I hope you passed these long.

[01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:15.090]
Sign the fake clearance.

[01:35:17.230 --> 01:35:18.150]
How do you like that?

[01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:20.190]
Fatso?

[01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:24.370]
The person who has eye on you believe you.

[01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:26.930]
He's got his eye on you and that's because you work on his show.

[01:35:27.690 --> 01:35:29.370]
See, he was trying to wean you off the show.

[01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:31.750]
That's why he kept sticking on around the weekend with the football games.

[01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:35.550]
He's trying to wean you off the show in hopes that maybe someday he can actually like

[01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:37.310]
you a little bit.

[01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:41.350]
Shocking Stan major information from Sam.

[01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:45.110]
Neil, it seems SM has an internet talk show.

[01:35:45.670 --> 01:35:50.430]
This is the lies from his site could be ponderous.

[01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:51.190]
The lies.

[01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:56.750]
Stan Mages have been broadcasting late night radio five hours a night, five days a week

[01:35:56.750 --> 01:36:01.330]
for the last six years it says Stan is going to strong rapport with the audience as he

[01:36:01.330 --> 01:36:03.610]
gives his listeners commentary on the hot topics of the week.

[01:36:04.050 --> 01:36:07.850]
For instance, the UPS strike was just it'll just before Stan show and UPS workers were

[01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:10.130]
able to call in all night to talk about it.

[01:36:10.810 --> 01:36:14.810]
Stan was also talking about the body found in the houseboat of Miami Beach hours before

[01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:18.670]
his broadcast on network news, possibly ending the Andrew Kunen and search for many.

[01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:23.770]
Stan offers the best in late night talk with issues, comedy and phone calls.

[01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:28.530]
Stan Mages has been broadcasting late night radio five hours a night, five days a week

[01:36:28.530 --> 01:36:31.770]
for the last six years and then it just repeats the same thing.

[01:36:33.930 --> 01:36:37.930]
Stan offers the best in late night talk with issues, comedy and phone calls, but he's still

[01:36:37.930 --> 01:36:39.770]
not paying enough to pay Neil back the two grand.

[01:36:40.130 --> 01:36:40.570]
Signed Sam.

[01:36:42.150 --> 01:36:43.590]
I just thought I'd throw that in there.

[01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:47.930]
Now you don't think he's ripping off anybody stuff do you?

[01:41:00.290 --> 01:41:02.710]
that embarrassing humiliating performance from the first meeting.

[01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:05.090]

We got a couple of spots that are just loaded with dead air there's that one where there's a long long pause in the guy from some moment even like long before you ever walked into this building.

[01:45:28.210 --> 01:45:33.050]
That was one of the first things that I noticed my first day is that dead air meant nothing to these people.

[01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:37.970]
The thousand down to 15 know as long as the transmitter is the tubes are glowing the final tubes.

[01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:45.290]
Oh I got a hostile email from the real Johnny dark I worked with Howard you couldn't hold a candle to his ass.

[01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:44.330]

Isn't he gone from there now?

[01:47:04.710 --> 01:47:05.830]
What's he doing now?

[01:47:06.370 --> 01:47:08.550]
Maybe he's holding a candle to Howard's ass.

[01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:11.750]
Maybe he's just looking Bob the booze ass.

[01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:12.170]
I don't know.

[01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:16.050]
You couldn't hold a candle with him. Well good I don't want to hold a candle to him or you either just.

[01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:22.570]
Here's the poll how how do you want stuff in the ice cream and even the wording of a desolquered it's a horrible poll Charlie.

[01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:30.810]
But thanks for that pile of polls man I like it and I'm taking George's advice and now I just email him directly to highlight whichever one I want and I email him right there.

[01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:31.890]
I don't have to fax him.

[01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.170]
Right.

[01:47:32.210 --> 01:47:34.870]
And Eric is right on top of it man. There you go just forward it along.

[01:47:35.290 --> 01:47:35.610]
Yeah.

[01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:38.890]
Well I'm you know I'm not so slow to learn.

[01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:43.290]
Oh you finally decided to use emails on the show.

[01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:53.950]
I use you as an example all the time when people when people have a signal here irrational fear of learning something new I say if that old fart Neil can figure this out.

[01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:54.430]
That's right.

[01:47:55.830 --> 01:48:00.450]
I'm on this computer all end by the way I'm not watching any porn on here either I'm too old for that.

[01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:03.610]
I'm not.

[01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:11.970]
I mean once upon a time I was like kind of yeah well I checked out what was on it most of it is so bad like the thing that lemon what was it lemon grass.

[01:48:12.170 --> 01:48:17.950]
Oh my god I'd rather I'd rather stuff an elephant.

[01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:20.350]
I'm out and then look at that again.

[01:48:21.210 --> 01:48:24.450]
How do you most often need to ask him how do you eat it.

[01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:29.650]
432 votes on the poll how many you got under tummy.

[01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:37.490]

[01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:38.610]

[01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:48.030]
All right in a bowl 186 right out of the cart 92 in a cone 41 I like it but I can't eat it 17 in a Sunday 15.

[01:48:48.230 --> 01:48:50.730]
There's nothing like a hot fudge Sunday on a good flavor.

[01:48:51.570 --> 01:48:52.530]
Not on vanilla.

[01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:57.230]
It's so boring like McDonald's you know I mean they got the idea right with the little Sundays you know.

[01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:59.670]
But why doesn't it have to be on that vanilla soft serve.

[01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:03.290]
Why can't it be like I'm chocolate soft serve.

[01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.530]
Good.

[01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:14.370]
Yeah what's wrong with them because actually in my old age I'm starting to get electing from Mickey D's since that old bag said I mean you want this senior diet coke.

[01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:21.110]
And I went like that I knocked her Chinese head right off her Chinese neck.

[01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:23.650]
I don't like ice cream 14 I don't believe that.

[01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:40.130]
You're not Dave Halberstam you're an imposter.

[01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:42.790]
No I'm not. I'm Dave Halberstam.

[01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:45.830]
If you're Dave Halberstam then do me.

[01:50:46.110 --> 01:50:49.390]
I can't do you in essence I'd be doing myself.

[01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:53.070]
I'll prove to you that I'm the real Dave Halberstam.

[01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:58.190]
Bimbo brings the ball up he spots rice over the minor inside the cycle.

[01:50:58.590 --> 01:51:01.430]
He shoots no good rebound spider Sally.

[01:51:01.670 --> 01:51:05.790]
He jams at home good and the heat are on fire.

[01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:12.770]
The heat laid 79 the 71 here on the heat radio never.

[01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:14.850]

[01:51:14.850 --> 01:51:18.210]
Hey get out of here I don't need a partner you're no good.

[01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:25.870]
I'm good no good.

[01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:27.630]
I haven't played that in a hundred years.

[01:51:27.810 --> 01:51:29.450]
I have no idea who the hell those are guys were.

[01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:30.590]
There you go.

[01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:32.230]
Who was that Scotty Mac?

[01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:35.670]
Oh how could I not know that I know.

[01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:39.050]
Sonility Scotty Mac well I'm trying to forget him.

[01:51:39.150 --> 01:51:40.710]
I'm hyperventilating.

[01:51:40.710 --> 01:51:41.890]
Yeah there's that voice.

[01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:44.110]
There's that squeaky voice.

[01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:45.150]
I did that one time.

[01:51:45.610 --> 01:51:46.830]
It was about 15 years old.

[01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:51.050]
Hinesmos macho guilty or Scotty Mac.

[01:51:52.090 --> 01:51:53.250]
Remember that trip to Vegas.

[01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:56.490]
I'll never forget with a silly string the green silly string.

[01:51:56.730 --> 01:51:58.170]
Yeah and the stink bombs.

[01:51:58.890 --> 01:51:59.970]
I don't remember the stink bomb.

[01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.590]
You don't?

[01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:01.050]
No.

[01:52:01.890 --> 01:52:03.010]
They have on the plane.

[01:52:03.170 --> 01:52:05.590]
Yeah they set stink bombs off on the plane.

[01:52:05.650 --> 01:52:08.430]
You have the sulfur ones the ones that come in the little glass things that too liquid.

[01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:08.850]
Really?

[01:52:09.130 --> 01:52:11.270]
It makes the sulfur smell smells like rotten eggs.

[01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:14.050]
I thought maybe a Scotty Mac just farted real bad.

[01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:14.530]
No.

[01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:20.350]
I'm not going to say the dows down over 200 points because this next email or get a lot of emails today.

[01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:20.770]
It's great.

[01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:22.970]
This is what it's all about.

[01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:28.430]
I never even mentioned we've been on two and a half hours that that slime ball Ted Stevens got beat in Alaska.

[01:52:29.690 --> 01:52:34.490]
47.8 to 46.6 with 99% of the precincts in Mark Begich beat him.

[01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:36.270]
Ted Stevens lost his seat.

[01:52:36.330 --> 01:52:37.330]
There's another one for the Democrats.

[01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:39.210]
So that's what 48.

[01:52:39.490 --> 01:52:39.950]
That's 58.

[01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:43.910]
58 and of course a Minnesota and Georgia.

[01:52:44.150 --> 01:52:45.050]
They're still up for grabs.

[01:52:45.330 --> 01:52:46.730]
They're still trying to grab it.

[01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:52.430]
By the way, too much speaking of a Minnesota and Norm Coleman too bad about sitting the kid there across the street.

[01:52:52.450 --> 01:52:53.290]
Man what bad numbers.

[01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:56.810]
I guess he just got bad luck or maybe really bad show.

[01:52:57.810 --> 01:53:01.450]
Maybe he suffers from that LOT that seems to infect most of them across the street.

[01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:02.490]
LOT you know what that is?

[01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:03.530]
Lack of talent.

[01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:03.950]
Oh.

[01:53:05.610 --> 01:53:08.370]
Stop with the stock market updates is no speaker.

[01:53:09.630 --> 01:53:11.170]
I've listened to you since the bird days.

[01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:15.290]
I met you in Tampa while you were in the market here at the Clearwater Mall with blob for a promo.

[01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:16.770]
That was incredible.

[01:53:16.930 --> 01:53:22.650]
We had 5,000 people show up in Clearwater on a Saturday afternoon.

[01:53:22.650 --> 01:53:23.690]
That was amazing.

[01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:30.090]
But I purposely turned off the news when the stock market report comes on because my 401k plan is in the schmitter.

[01:53:30.090 --> 01:53:31.790]
You're making me sick with the updates.

[01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:34.390]
I want to smile and forget all the crap for just a few hours a day.

[01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:35.450]
Just stop already.

[01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:39.530]
Say how do they have the former lady in the bridge tender?

[01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:41.130]
Dead question mark.

[01:53:41.250 --> 01:53:42.110]
I'm sure he must be dead.

[01:53:43.290 --> 01:53:47.650]
And of course so is what must be what we can only hope.

[01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:51.150]
And unfortunately so is she happy for him.

[01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:53.530]
Another tough yoking.

[01:53:53.690 --> 01:53:54.770]
Another tough yoking.

[01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:56.650]
Don't take any bulls**t from him.

[01:53:56.850 --> 01:53:57.850]
Thanks for calling.

[01:53:58.150 --> 01:53:58.350]
Yeah.

[01:53:58.350 --> 01:54:00.510]
Have the season pays off.

[01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:02.990]
She was great and once he died man, that was the end of our show.

[01:54:03.210 --> 01:54:03.690]
Yes she was.

[01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:06.150]
Mike says fact Chris is a moron.

[01:54:06.210 --> 01:54:06.750]
How do you like that?

[01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:08.230]
They know all of your fat ass.

[01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:10.190]
What did you know?

[01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:13.650]
Fat Chris works on the Dolphins Fagship station.

[01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:17.810]
Doesn't even remember that often score was 38 to 13 blowing out the Patriots.

[01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:22.490]
Yeah, well I'm not a sports hole that you know why not dedicate my whole life to it.

[01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:27.350]
So maybe Chris was passed out and died by the coma with a bag of ice over his rectum thanks to Jolly Joe.

[01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:30.190]
And I wasn't working that a that game at the time.

[01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:35.070]
So no, where did it watch it some a back on TV and revel in every moment of it.

[01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:36.770]
I watched it and I loved it.

[01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:40.330]
That performance that day by that New England team was so humiliated.

[01:54:40.350 --> 01:54:41.430]
It was even well, I don't know.

[01:54:41.650 --> 01:54:42.390]
I don't know what was worse.

[01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:45.890]
The first half of the Jets game, which is they to showed up at all.

[01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:49.370]
They would have won that game or they entire game against the fish.

[01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:52.150]
They seem to have this thing about folding against the fish.

[01:54:53.170 --> 01:54:57.330]
But then again, like I said when and it's not an excuse to just affect anybody knows anything about football.

[01:54:57.330 --> 01:55:04.470]
Oh and by the way, how come a fan didn't apologize for his intemperate comments about my football allegiances?

[01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:09.390]
Maybe I don't I'm not like a trained monkey in spite of what most is.

[01:55:09.690 --> 01:55:12.510]
I don't like the root for teams on command.

[01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:14.330]
I don't do shows on command.

[01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:19.830]
You know, because I get some email or some stupid phone call, I'm going to like jump up and hop.

[01:55:20.270 --> 01:55:22.610]
Like some kind of a house Negro.

[01:55:23.850 --> 01:55:24.410]
Right.

[01:55:24.970 --> 01:55:29.430]
Whoever that was, if you want to get mad, I don't remember any of the cane scores of Syria that I've worked every game.

[01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:31.070]
Yeah, but who the hell would remember that crap?

[01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:34.130]
My God, talk about a little girls teams.

[01:55:34.650 --> 01:55:35.290]
The Canes.

[01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:36.290]
Oh, it's the Canes.

[01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:37.710]
There's Johnny Bauer, my favorite.

[01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.350]
That's right.

[01:55:38.730 --> 01:55:39.810]
That's a lot of money.

[01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:40.430]
A lot of money.

[01:55:40.710 --> 01:55:40.710]

[01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:46.230]
Now, when when you go in to talk with Joe Bowen and Johnny Bauer,

[01:55:46.810 --> 01:55:48.830]
what more than that's like dying and going to him.

[01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:50.930]
It's 50 years of least, man.

[01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:53.650]
You think about it change my allegiance, all of a sudden, because they suck.

[01:55:53.650 --> 01:55:54.250]
They stink.

[01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:54.730]
They go.

[01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:57.630]
And what are they sign in Brian Burk by the way already?

[01:55:58.150 --> 01:55:59.010]
Get out with it.

[01:55:59.150 --> 01:55:59.510]
Get out with it.

[01:55:59.510 --> 01:56:01.410]
And and hope you come out with a couple of things.

[01:56:01.410 --> 01:56:01.810]
So what do you want?

[01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:03.010]
Hockey or horse racing?

[01:56:04.190 --> 01:56:05.250]
Hey, do we have to choose?

[01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:05.670]
I have enough.

[01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:06.510]
Young guys and enough.

[01:56:06.650 --> 01:56:08.250]
There's a hockey with some other players.

[01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:08.970]
The national network.

[01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:11.610]
That panthers, Louis, three nothingly.

[01:56:11.690 --> 01:56:12.190]
Didn't tampon.

[01:56:12.210 --> 01:56:12.550]
How do we know?

[01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:14.110]
Oh, that's embarrassing.

[01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:16.850]
We from Dippity running the second spot, fleeting storm.

[01:56:16.930 --> 01:56:17.790]
Up and on the pace.

[01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:18.950]
Fire outside.

[01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:20.530]
Deep down is rating along.

[01:56:20.610 --> 01:56:21.810]
Here's the first region of the world.

[01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:23.130]
In Maryland.

[01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:25.250]
I bet you'd been from Maryland's been a Laurel race track.

[01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:25.990]
I never have been.

[01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:31.330]
I've driven through Baltimore, but I've never been any time in Maryland.

[01:56:32.170 --> 01:56:34.330]
Did you ever go to Baltimore and hang out there?

[01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.650]
No.

[01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:36.050]
How about you, Faso?

[01:56:36.490 --> 01:56:36.970]
Just driven through.

[01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:38.590]
Yeah, just drove through there.

[01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:39.770]
Real fast as a matter of fact.

[01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:42.310]
And we looked like a really smarmy place.

[01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:43.230]
Same with St. Louis.

[01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:44.770]
Oh, wow.

[01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:47.950]
Now maybe the highway in St. Louis goes through a real bad hood or something.

[01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.350]
I don't know.

[01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:49.730]
But whoa.

[01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:50.990]
Whoa.

[01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:52.110]
St. Louis.

[01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:53.030]
I'll pass on that.

[01:56:55.190 --> 01:56:57.130]
A lot of Catholics there too, by the way, St. Louis.

[01:56:57.330 --> 01:56:57.850]
What are we going for?

[01:56:57.850 --> 01:56:58.950]
We got 457 on the border.

[01:56:58.970 --> 01:56:59.990]
Yeah, we already passed 457.

[01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:00.430]
So let's go for five.

[01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:01.550]
Let's go to KMOX.

[01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:02.850]
Let's take the show to KMOX.

[01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:04.770]
I'm sure that the old guy Bob, whatever his name was.

[01:57:05.010 --> 01:57:05.910]
I'm sure he's dead by now.

[01:57:07.810 --> 01:57:09.910]
They kept trying to hire me and then he kept having a secretary.

[01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:14.050]
Is it true that you make comments against the Catholic church on the air?

[01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:15.990]
And I'd say, what differences it make?

[01:57:16.190 --> 01:57:17.490]
I mean, don't you people understand?

[01:57:17.650 --> 01:57:18.610]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:23.950]
They wanted to hire me, but they wanted to make sure that I didn't knock the Catholic church on the air

[01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:25.650]
because too many Catholics in St. Louis.

[01:57:25.930 --> 01:57:27.190]
I'd have been great on KMOX.

[01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.710]
Can you imagine?

[01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.510]
No.

[01:57:29.110 --> 01:57:32.230]
With that big 50,000-watt signal, I probably heard like an 80 states at night.

[01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:32.650]
Ooh.

[01:57:35.890 --> 01:57:37.190]
Here's one from T. Gain.

[01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:40.250]
How Brenda Snipes Accuser Post is Broward Supervisor of Elections.

[01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:46.110]
She gets Alan Lamberty to arrest her opponents, including anyone, who tried to exercise the public's right to observe the final accounts.

[01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:52.330]
When it comes to elections in Broward County, or most anywhere in Florida, be afraid, be very afraid since T. Gain.

[01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:54.430]
And you like that?

[01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:55.110]
I don't.

[01:57:56.010 --> 01:57:57.910]
Jackie says, I don't want to work.

[01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:59.310]
I want to bang on the drum all day.

[01:57:59.750 --> 01:58:00.870]
So Randy plays that too?

[01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:04.150]
If that's true, that would be so embarrassing.

[01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:05.590]
I'd be humiliated for her.

[01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:09.050]
You know, and it's one thing to play like that.

[01:58:09.870 --> 01:58:12.590]
Or like the Schmuck across the street with no ratings playing.

[01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.330]
Roy!

[01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:15.070]
And keep dropping that in.

[01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:17.950]
Now, where did he get that stuff?

[01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:22.390]
And of course, that's a stupid question, because all of our people have been schlepping back and forth across the street.

[01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.590]
Right.

[01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:23.010]

[01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:26.990]
Geldy and jerks and this one and that one, like a revolving dormant.

[01:58:27.190 --> 01:58:27.810]
There's a tram.

[01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:29.030]
Mm-hmm.

[01:58:29.630 --> 01:58:34.510]
There's a 24-7 jam right in front of the building, and it just keeps taking people back and forth across the street.

[01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:39.210]
Ticket QAM, QAM, Ticket, back and forth, back and forth, ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket.

[01:58:40.610 --> 01:58:44.490]
And notice in this trend, there are some day parts you put both numbers together and you still have a crappy number.

[01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:51.070]
Oh, but if we just had 600 sports stations, it's going to bring a lot more people to sports talk radio,

[01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:54.330]
court the genius the ever-observant Ray Perry.

[01:58:54.590 --> 01:58:55.750]
Oh my God.

[01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:57.170]
The best name.

[01:58:57.650 --> 01:59:00.490]
The best name is Neil Rogers, 4356QAM.

[01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:02.870]
The sports leader.

[01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.930]
The sports leader.

[01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:06.370]
There are off sluggish start for our Christie Lee.

[01:59:07.290 --> 01:59:12.130]
He's looking as fast as the way from the extreme outside Minnesota Mary Show's good early speed.

[01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:16.170]
From between forces and season double maker with the more I can't talk to him.

[01:59:16.170 --> 01:59:16.790]
I'm a piece in quiet.

[01:59:17.010 --> 01:59:19.030]
Man, I don't need to listen to Barney Fag.

[01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:24.150]
Barney Frank, Rangin in my ear because I made a few bucks off a book I worked on.

[01:59:26.170 --> 01:59:27.190]
You fairy.

[01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:35.210]
He lives on queer street.

[01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:38.990]
Linger's rounds on queer street.

[01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:43.010]
He has a house and garden.

[01:59:43.590 --> 01:59:47.130]
I would love to see what happens.

[01:59:54.210 --> 01:59:58.150]
H's toes and pets is monkey.

[01:59:58.950 --> 02:00:01.810]
Women's clothes make him look real funky.

[02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:07.990]
He has a whizz whizz and knows what to do.

[02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:14.990]
He wants me and me.

[02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:17.970]
Not you.

[02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:24.610]
He lives on queer street.

[02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:28.710]
Here at Thor for all the creature's feet.

[02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:32.770]
I wonder what they're doing in there.

[02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:36.250]
He said he liked the juxtapine.

[02:00:39.810 --> 02:00:40.630]
He's a juxtapine.

[02:00:40.630 --> 02:00:40.930]
He's a juxtapine.

[02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:46.250]
He's a juxtapine.

[02:00:48.110 --> 02:00:48.950]
He's a juxtapine.

[02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:54.650]
He lives on queer street.

[02:00:55.330 --> 02:00:58.370]
Linger's rounds on queer street.

[02:00:58.990 --> 02:01:01.930]
He wants to hop the levy about the wind of the eye and neck from paint has been cream.

[02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:04.790]
There's a second from Harris Chester.

[02:01:05.010 --> 02:01:06.510]
Are you excited about that or what?

[02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:07.030]
No.

[02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:08.070]
I'm not either.

[02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:11.190]
Here's one bank hold times.

[02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:13.950]
Neil is much better than the president takes in the US and then wire to Canada.

[02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:18.710]
See these people I guess assume I'm putting my paycheck into bank here or something like that.

[02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.990]
No way Jose.

[02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:26.350]
If I want to put cash in my Canadian account, I'll write a check off my Florida account.

[02:01:27.090 --> 02:01:31.430]
Hold fund policies of Canada's major banks for checks drawn on a US institution.

[02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:38.590]
I know this is somebody Canadian because it says CHE QES checks how British how Canadian A.

[02:01:38.850 --> 02:01:42.370]
TD bank minimum 15 minutes days maximum 30 days.

[02:01:43.130 --> 02:01:46.690]
BMO bank of Montreal maximum 30 calendar days C.I.B.C.

[02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:50.210]
Normal 15 business days maximum 30 minutes days.

[02:01:50.930 --> 02:01:54.290]
Scotiabank maximum 20 minutes days and we're all back of Canada 25.

[02:01:54.290 --> 02:01:55.990]
They just do whatever the hell they want.

[02:01:57.210 --> 02:01:59.690]
Here's one from Johnny Dark and it says retire.

[02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:04.970]
Oh funny.

[02:02:05.770 --> 02:02:06.170]
Retire.

[02:02:06.570 --> 02:02:06.710]
No.

[02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:09.070]
You're worst than I'm worst.

[02:02:09.850 --> 02:02:12.570]
You could have been on the flagship post and Howard's second channel you idiot.

[02:02:12.890 --> 02:02:13.090]
Yeah.

[02:02:13.630 --> 02:02:14.390]
Sure I could have.

[02:02:14.930 --> 02:02:22.030]
Just keep sending me more sputum okay more because I know that if I wanted to hire somebody I would do through a bunch of anonymous fake emails with all kinds of different people's names.

[02:02:23.250 --> 02:02:24.430]
That's how I would hire somebody.

[02:02:27.130 --> 02:02:29.030]
I guess Johnny isn't doing much these days.

[02:02:29.070 --> 02:02:31.230]
He's got a lot of time to sit around and write stupid emails.

[02:02:32.190 --> 02:02:32.550]
Retire.

[02:02:33.170 --> 02:02:33.530]
Retire.

[02:02:33.810 --> 02:02:33.810]

[02:02:33.810 --> 02:02:34.970]
I guess Johnny did retire huh?

[02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:36.110]
Plus to.

[02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:37.910]
Is he working anywhere does anybody know?

[02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:38.270]
I don't know.

[02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:41.010]
I was wondering if he's like owned some radio station somewhere you know.

[02:02:41.170 --> 02:02:42.610]
Get out of here that one in Maine.

[02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:43.350]
Yeah whatever.

[02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:43.990]
Pidly stuff.

[02:02:44.110 --> 02:02:44.770]
I don't know what he's got.

[02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:48.770]
You hear the sirens coming as soon as I mentioned Johnny Dork the sirens stirred out there.

[02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:51.270]
You hear him loud loud and queer baby.

[02:02:52.710 --> 02:02:57.210]
Here's one that says Neil why do they keep that fat ass Joe Bell around the guy's not even good to use is a bad example.

[02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.870]
Oh.

[02:02:59.410 --> 02:03:01.470]
Serious stock by the way 17 cents.

[02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:02.410]
I just looked it up.

[02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:03.130]
I just Google it.

[02:03:03.190 --> 02:03:04.370]
I'm sorry I'm talking about stocks.

[02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:06.450]
But I'm not talking about the market now.

[02:03:06.590 --> 02:03:07.730]
What do you think about that email?

[02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:09.450]
I think it's a service.

[02:03:09.450 --> 02:03:15.010]
I think people want to know I mean I'm not going to do it in a rick Riley and be going to become a stock market maven or put the name gambling channel on.

[02:03:15.190 --> 02:03:17.610]
Although I can't put the gambling channel on you want to hear it power lunch?

[02:03:17.610 --> 02:03:21.850]
No saying and you know it's theater so you know they're saying it for their constituents.

[02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:28.690]
Some of our favorite lines so so far don't put your last turn a kid on a dead man right maybe they should have jet pulled to Washington.

[02:03:28.770 --> 02:03:29.310]
New verve.

[02:03:29.590 --> 02:03:38.070]
Yeah don't put your last turn a kid on a dead man what a great line that is I like that use it on a dead man when some of the people in the market see those ratings.

[02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:47.470]
The down the oil is 54 and a half bucks a barrel roll out the barrel and the loony is down to 80.55 cents just over 80 cents for the loony.

[02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:54.410]

[02:03:54.910 --> 02:03:56.690]

The mystery of Niels law salary that starts January 1 at a radio station near you.

[02:04:53.950 --> 02:05:00.570]
Especially coming up here they told you they put you're like in this little cocoon and you're like sealed in there like a prisoner and they're playing with your

[02:05:00.570 --> 02:05:06.830]
boarding card and they're passing it around and their wife and each other's asked with an it's just ridiculous and you're you're stuck in there then.

[02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:15.350]
Then when you finally get out of there they sit you down and you take off your shoes and your pantalones and your armpits and you know and they swab you down kind of like jolly jo and Chris.

[02:05:17.770 --> 02:05:26.790]

[02:07:09.570 --> 02:07:13.190]
On the airman right on this damn radio show we had it on here that's months ago.

A penny for your thoughts wouldn't be something that goes down like in single digits.

[02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:37.510]
Like about five cents mm-hmm 17 cents.

[02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:43.430]
Rocky says why would you want to go to serious I don't understand why everyone wants you to go to satellite radio since how it's

[02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:13.190]
Oh they had the Versace family on the biography last night it was marginally a boring.

[02:09:14.670 --> 02:09:19.130]
And they showed that thing with Andrew Kuhnann in the house but you know they were slept in the body out and made me think

[02:09:19.130 --> 02:09:25.210]
because I was down there that night and I was thinking of the news coverage and remember that cops through the stink bombs in there.

[02:09:25.650 --> 02:09:25.810]
Yes.

[02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:31.970]
And it was like real like fog you know nobody could see anything and they come out breathlessly to tell us on local

[02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:32.690]
local television.

[02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:34.650]

[02:09:39.850 --> 02:09:47.090]
Come on you call that police work they come out and the local breathless TV reporters are telling the audience there's nobody in there.

[02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:50.610]
When you heard the handyman come that day.

[02:09:50.810 --> 02:09:53.010]
They got in his mouth and bought a thing that was the end of him.

[02:09:53.150 --> 02:09:53.810]
These days they paid.

[02:09:54.210 --> 02:09:55.230]
Andrew you fairy.

[02:09:56.530 --> 02:10:01.610]
Singer and reek ate glacius has been kicked out of his Florida home by girlfriend Anna Cornelholy after a row over his pet dogs.

[02:10:03.490 --> 02:10:05.290]
Sanoo he was a good guy he's a dog lover.

[02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:11.930]
The hero hitmaker who's been dating the former tennis star for six years moved out of the house.

[02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:15.150]
They share in Miami after he did argument over the poochies.

[02:10:17.130 --> 02:10:17.850]
Poochy coo.

[02:10:19.050 --> 02:10:20.010]
Where's the poochie poo.

[02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:24.550]
Now what kind of a dog are they getting they're getting a hairless Mexican airless at the White House.

[02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:26.430]
I don't know I'll send him right down.

[02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:31.950]
But the Spanish unconscious the Paris still together says he'll move back in as soon as Russian Cornelhova agrees.

[02:10:32.370 --> 02:10:33.890]
He tells Britain's hello magazine.

[02:10:34.150 --> 02:10:37.110]
We were living together for six months but she kicked me out and they had a fight.

[02:10:37.390 --> 02:10:39.430]
We did make up but she didn't let me move back in.

[02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:41.550]
It was a stupid fight something about my dogs.

[02:10:41.710 --> 02:10:43.250]
I'm move back in when she lets me.

[02:10:43.570 --> 02:10:44.550]
Oh what a whoo.

[02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:50.130]
He'll move back in when she lets him Anna Cornelholy that big dike with legs like tree trunks.

[02:10:53.490 --> 02:10:55.290]
Here's one from Bacho and Dallas.

Macho Bacho.

[02:10:58.130 --> 02:11:00.330]
482 on the pole we got fifth we got 500 licked.

[02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:01.450]
Pretty good.

[02:11:01.690 --> 02:11:03.250]
You might think we have an audience out there you know.

[02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:04.030]
What do you think?

[02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:04.970]
I heard.

[02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:09.730]
This is the big month baby you people out there with your arbitrage diaries you keep listening.

[02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:11.630]
I'm not telling you how to fill them out but you keep listening.

[02:11:12.490 --> 02:11:16.930]
And listen all the time listen all day on QM maybe we'll get that extra bonus you think.

[02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:20.970]
Remember that I think it happened twice in 11 years.

[02:11:21.590 --> 02:11:25.970]
Then we got the double bonus for the station being number one and us being number one and both times we had this humongous.

[02:11:26.710 --> 02:11:34.790]
Oh and by the way I might just I just mentioned this in passing for the Yoko sales manager and the Yoko general manager and for the promotion director you're good friend flea.

[02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:42.950]
In this trend which show had the highest rating on the station by far deal could it have been 10 to 2.

[02:11:43.150 --> 02:11:45.370]
Oh my god could it have been.

[02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:47.030]
Oh god yeah I think so.

[02:11:47.550 --> 02:11:53.750]
I just mentioned that in passing because it's against the law for the sale department to sell the show or even discuss it in sales or promotion meetings.

[02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:54.170]
Right.

[02:11:54.370 --> 02:11:54.990]
Makes sense to me.

[02:11:55.230 --> 02:11:55.910]
The business.

[02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:56.690]
The best talent.

[02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:57.350]

The biggest news.

[02:12:04.690 --> 02:12:05.530]
The best talent.

[02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:11.250]

Governor I won't do with the people of Alaska want me to do my life isn't God hands and he's got doors open for me.

Okay I'm not going to close any doors that perhaps would be in front of me and and with.

[02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:07.050]
What a story.

[02:13:07.050 --> 02:13:08.790]
Again I'm not going to close any doors of opportunity.

[02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.810]
Don't get there up.

[02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:12.510]
We're almost out of time so quickly.

[02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:26.650]
We're going to waste the cash out of this close now.

[02:13:27.110 --> 02:13:27.790]
All right.

[02:13:42.050 --> 02:13:42.590]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:42.590]

[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:42.590]

[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:42.590]

[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:42.590]

[02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:42.830]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.850]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:42.850 --> 02:13:43.690]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:43.690 --> 02:13:45.190]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:46.410]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:47.970]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:48.010 --> 02:13:50.550]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:51.610 --> 02:13:56.390]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:56.650 --> 02:13:57.770]
I'm going to go back in the middle of the day.

[02:13:57.770 --> 02:14:01.330]
The same guy who is too busy yesterday responding to show because he's got a job and he's got a life.

[02:14:01.630 --> 02:14:02.530]
But he felt compelled.

[02:14:02.690 --> 02:14:05.970]
The spirit of Christ compelled him a fan on being a fan.

[02:14:06.650 --> 02:14:08.150]
Would lecture about my sports teams.

[02:14:08.290 --> 02:14:08.450]
Okay.

[02:14:08.650 --> 02:14:10.870]
Is if that's any of his business what teams I root for and why.

[02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:14.190]
Neil, I never said you had to root for the home team.

[02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:16.630]
However, as I recall, you were at one time where Dolphin fan.

[02:14:16.810 --> 02:14:17.210]
That's right.

[02:14:17.230 --> 02:14:19.750]
And I spent a lot of money on my own tickets before I got him from any station.

[02:14:20.690 --> 02:14:22.570]
Fat rich and I used to go to the games all the time.

[02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:25.910]
And because of the organization and the fans and the whole ambiance with it,

[02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:27.490]
I said, fat hell with this.

[02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:28.610]
Screw them.

[02:14:29.530 --> 02:14:31.970]
They treated us like garbage in that stadium, man.

[02:14:32.110 --> 02:14:33.010]
Like subhuman garbage.

[02:14:33.370 --> 02:14:37.370]
But anyway, matter of fact, you were a cubs fan in baseball and now are a Pat's fan in football.

[02:14:37.690 --> 02:14:38.050]
That's right.

[02:14:39.330 --> 02:14:40.970]
Because I'm from Rochester, New York.

[02:14:41.130 --> 02:14:43.450]
And the Rochester Red Wings are a triple A baseball team.

[02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:45.870]
And Rochester Amherst are a minor league hockey team.

[02:14:46.070 --> 02:14:48.570]
And I don't have any like a home team to root for it.

[02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:50.790]
How many teams are you a fan of?

[02:14:51.010 --> 02:14:52.610]
I'll tell you right now, fan two.

[02:14:53.850 --> 02:14:54.650]
Leafs, Patriots.

[02:14:54.650 --> 02:14:55.170]
That's it.

[02:14:56.650 --> 02:14:57.070]
That's it.

[02:14:57.230 --> 02:14:57.590]
That's enough.

[02:14:59.010 --> 02:15:00.690]
Oh, but what about the Spartans, man?

[02:15:00.850 --> 02:15:01.430]
I don't care.

[02:15:01.770 --> 02:15:02.250]
Not interested.

[02:15:04.610 --> 02:15:07.190]
I mean, even though it's, you know, another one of those big 10 schools,

[02:15:07.190 --> 02:15:10.910]
they don't have to kind of obsession with winning at Michigan State.

[02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:11.470]
They do like it.

[02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:11.790]
Michigan.

[02:15:12.090 --> 02:15:14.130]
Well, how about that season for Michigan, by the way, Fat Chris?

[02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:14.930]
Oh, yeah.

[02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:15.330]
What do you lose?

[02:15:15.410 --> 02:15:15.830]
100 games?

[02:15:16.190 --> 02:15:16.750]
I think they're what?

[02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.990]
Three and seven or something.

[02:15:18.150 --> 02:15:18.470]
Wow.

[02:15:19.210 --> 02:15:19.530]
Michigan.

[02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:21.690]
I bet you know, maybe that's why Matt dogs off his feed.

[02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:25.330]
You and my friend are the Bennett, our Bennett and our LaFantasy.

[02:15:25.330 --> 02:15:26.790]
This is definitely Dan from Maryland.

[02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:28.890]
One minute, kissy, kissy, kissy, kissy.

[02:15:28.890 --> 02:15:31.470]
And the next minute, ripping and chewing and tearing as if.

[02:15:32.130 --> 02:15:32.890]
But it's good material.

[02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.570]
Oh, keep it coming.

[02:15:34.210 --> 02:15:36.550]
The only team you've been a constant fan of are the Maple Leafs.

[02:15:36.730 --> 02:15:38.570]
Let's hope the Red Wings don't get a pretty boy goalkeeper.

[02:15:38.690 --> 02:15:39.830]
As you'll be a Red Wings fan, as well.

[02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:40.230]
Take care.

[02:15:40.430 --> 02:15:41.930]
And Red Wings had Stevie Izerman.

[02:15:42.290 --> 02:15:43.050]
And I couldn't give a crap.

[02:15:43.050 --> 02:15:44.210]
Plus I hate the Red Wings.

[02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:45.610]
What do you know?

[02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:49.410]
And my favorite ball players, Ugly Assin Hank Bauer,

[02:15:49.410 --> 02:15:51.550]
when the Yankees was my favorite baseball player back in the day,

[02:15:51.850 --> 02:15:54.090]
and Johnny Bauer and Papa Bauer, Nistva,

[02:15:55.110 --> 02:15:57.250]
what you know about sports, a fan.

[02:15:57.370 --> 02:15:58.550]
I could stick on a thimble and have,

[02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:00.130]
and what you know about my fandom.

[02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:01.270]
Now let's see.

[02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.910]
What's this game?

[02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:02.930]
Maple Leaf Classics.

[02:16:03.130 --> 02:16:04.170]
They're in commercial break now.

[02:16:04.730 --> 02:16:09.410]
Oh, Black Cocks, Ethel Leafs, November 18, 1967, with Bill Hewitt.

[02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:11.230]
Oh, and Greg, the fake Greg Biel says,

[02:16:11.230 --> 02:16:14.150]
Bubba, a staff of about 10, Cox is putting him on 93 rock.

[02:16:14.370 --> 02:16:14.910]
You know something?

[02:16:15.190 --> 02:16:15.790]
I don't care.

[02:16:17.150 --> 02:16:17.890]
I don't care.

[02:16:18.130 --> 02:16:20.010]
Hopefully he'll be on Rights Mac in midday, you know,

[02:16:20.110 --> 02:16:21.930]
or at least overlapping part of our show.

[02:16:23.570 --> 02:16:25.490]
I guess I'm supposed to like pee in my pants

[02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:27.450]
because they're going to put Bubba Loves fun in this market.

[02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:27.970]
Who cares?

[02:16:28.050 --> 02:16:29.170]
They put man-calender market.

[02:16:29.230 --> 02:16:30.050]
He got a point.

[02:16:30.210 --> 02:16:31.510]
They got Bill O'Reilly.

[02:16:31.690 --> 02:16:32.390]
Bill O'Reilly on the radio.

[02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:33.230]
He's got a point.

[02:16:33.330 --> 02:16:33.470]
Oh!

[02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:34.870]
Still don't show up on that station.

[02:16:37.490 --> 02:16:37.850]
God.

[02:16:39.330 --> 02:16:40.570]
All these radio Yenthas.

[02:16:40.570 --> 02:16:42.530]
That's why you know who these are from.

[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:44.350]
Radio Yenthas.

[02:16:44.430 --> 02:16:45.410]
People with no lives.

[02:16:46.290 --> 02:16:47.090]
Absolute incorrect.

[02:16:47.390 --> 02:16:48.230]
I have no life.

[02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:48.450]
Right.

[02:16:49.010 --> 02:16:50.850]
Enrique says not that Enrique.

[02:16:52.730 --> 02:16:53.910]
One of our listeners says,

[02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:55.630]
How come we can bail out large corporations

[02:16:55.630 --> 02:16:56.950]
on helping a school budget crisis?

[02:16:57.350 --> 02:16:58.850]
Can I have the government pay me out of my bill?

[02:17:00.310 --> 02:17:01.850]
We went to the Luis Miguel Concerter.

[02:17:01.850 --> 02:17:02.270]
It was awesome.

[02:17:02.390 --> 02:17:03.650]
Sorry, your mister, we'll send you pictures.

[02:17:04.090 --> 02:17:05.090]
Take Kieto Enrique.

[02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:08.690]
Take Kieto Mutual Enrique, whoever you are.

[02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:10.310]
Not an Enrique, the greasiest.

[02:17:10.670 --> 02:17:11.730]
Although he might be listening.

[02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:12.910]
Might be.

[02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.810]
Oh, here's the game.

[02:17:14.010 --> 02:17:14.370]
I got the cover.

[02:17:15.350 --> 02:17:18.530]
Down the ice comes Wayne McEater Settler.

[02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:20.450]
I wonder if Wayne McEater was kind of cheeky.

[02:17:20.710 --> 02:17:21.410]
I can't imagine he won.

[02:17:22.690 --> 02:17:23.690]
Peer, pull up.

[02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:24.750]
He's doctor.

[02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:26.050]
He's going to be a panel in here.

[02:17:26.630 --> 02:17:27.650]
I can't believe he's right.

[02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:29.530]
Tim Horton, man.

[02:17:29.630 --> 02:17:30.250]
Let's dig him up.

[02:17:30.330 --> 02:17:31.470]
He was a hell of a defenseman, man.

[02:17:31.570 --> 02:17:31.950]
Number seven.

[02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:34.270]
You want to go to Tim Horton's for some lunch?

[02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:35.430]
Sure.

[02:17:35.510 --> 02:17:36.310]
What are your feelings on dessert?

[02:17:37.010 --> 02:17:38.090]
Can't do any lunch today, man.

[02:17:38.090 --> 02:17:40.390]
I got my pantaloonies and my shirt on already.

[02:17:40.490 --> 02:17:42.130]
Got my shoe sitting over here off to the side.

[02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:44.430]
It's Woodbine Wednesday, man.

[02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:46.190]
I'm going to go there and win a zillion dollars.

[02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:49.690]
Maria Bartiromo, my good close personal friend, says.

[02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:51.010]
Good afternoon, Mr. Rogers.

[02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:53.610]
I did not hear you open to show this morning saying

[02:17:53.610 --> 02:17:55.550]
how the market ended up 150 points yesterday.

[02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:58.110]
Pre-market capitalism is the best path of prosperity.

[02:17:58.450 --> 02:18:00.490]
It will always defeat your close-minded socialists and views.

[02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:03.350]
Socialista, socialista, communist.

[02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:06.350]
I love that scene in Godfather too,

[02:18:06.350 --> 02:18:09.190]
where up on the roof at a casino, and it's

[02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:10.630]
Heim and Roth's birthday.

[02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:11.070]
Right.

[02:18:12.210 --> 02:18:14.450]
And he's going on and on about we have a friendly government

[02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:16.870]
and knows how to do business and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:18:17.130 --> 02:18:19.610]
Michael, dollar for dollar with a teamster.

[02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:21.350]
There's a dollar for dollar basis.

[02:18:21.590 --> 02:18:22.130]
He's great.

[02:18:23.490 --> 02:18:23.930]
He's great.

[02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:25.930]
He's dead.

[02:18:27.390 --> 02:18:28.310]
Who is it again?

[02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:30.070]
Leo, Lee Strasberg.

[02:18:30.350 --> 02:18:31.150]
Lee Strasberg.

[02:18:31.290 --> 02:18:31.650]
He's dead.

[02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:33.230]
He was really good in there.

[02:18:33.390 --> 02:18:35.430]
And Al Pacino who went to his acting school,

[02:18:35.430 --> 02:18:36.330]
he got him in the middle of the night.

[02:18:36.330 --> 02:18:36.730]
He was a big fan of the movie.

[02:18:38.010 --> 02:18:38.550]
Good choice.

[02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:39.710]
What great casting, huh?

[02:18:39.850 --> 02:18:40.630]
At least in the first two.

[02:18:40.770 --> 02:18:41.850]
The third one, a little week.

[02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:47.050]
A little week on the casting in Godfather 3.

[02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:49.230]
Dead, dead.

[02:18:49.890 --> 02:18:51.350]
I bet you everybody gave a sitting ovation

[02:18:51.350 --> 02:18:52.430]
when she got shot, you know?

[02:18:53.090 --> 02:18:54.050]
In the theater we did.

[02:18:55.010 --> 02:18:55.790]
Everyone applauded.

[02:18:56.590 --> 02:18:58.630]
On another subject, my agent is Don Buckwell.

[02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:59.830]
So not only do I have a real agent,

[02:18:59.950 --> 02:19:00.850]
but I have insight and information

[02:19:00.850 --> 02:19:03.190]
that your rant's about serious is just a cross-promotion

[02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:05.850]
for the beginning of your show in 2009 and Howard 101.

[02:19:05.850 --> 02:19:06.630]
Oh yeah.

[02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:09.870]
So Maria is the same radio goofballs, the fake Maria.

[02:19:10.670 --> 02:19:12.110]
Like you said, it's probably all one person.

[02:19:12.770 --> 02:19:13.870]
I'm probably Johnny Dork.

[02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:16.110]
Over for a Makita, backed by Ruff.

[02:19:16.690 --> 02:19:17.190]
Ruff, don't go.

[02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:18.070]
Dwayne Ruff, man.

[02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.950]
Could he play or what?

[02:19:19.090 --> 02:19:19.350]
He sucked.

[02:19:20.550 --> 02:19:22.710]
That Stan Makita though, he used to really piss me off.

[02:19:24.090 --> 02:19:25.170]
500 votes on the pool.

[02:19:25.290 --> 02:19:25.890]
How do you like that?

[02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.670]
Got a leg.

[02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:29.610]
Don't you like it?

[02:19:29.770 --> 02:19:30.170]
I love it.

[02:19:32.010 --> 02:19:32.510]
Let's see.

[02:19:32.650 --> 02:19:35.510]
Oh, and now here's the anachrono holia.

[02:19:35.510 --> 02:19:36.150]
Is that Enrique?

[02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:37.710]
Yeah, looking at her butt.

[02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.590]
Yeah.

[02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:40.090]
Yeah.

[02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:41.650]
What is that hand of his?

[02:19:43.410 --> 02:19:45.370]
Enrique, your hand is not above the deck.

[02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:46.330]
Yeah, no.

[02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:47.690]
The deck, I said.

[02:19:47.970 --> 02:19:49.450]
I know what you said.

[02:19:50.310 --> 02:19:51.150]
And I know what you were thinking.

[02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:52.150]
I'm the same thing I'm thinking.

[02:19:52.490 --> 02:19:53.370]
And for what it's worth, you know,

[02:19:53.410 --> 02:19:55.350]
of all the things that you've ever been wrong about,

[02:19:55.470 --> 02:19:56.030]
which is a lot.

[02:19:56.210 --> 02:19:58.410]
I just don't know what you're seeing when you see her legs.

[02:19:58.550 --> 02:20:00.630]
She's got skinny little twigs.

[02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:02.050]
Three trunk for legs.

[02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.690]
Let's see.

[02:20:03.810 --> 02:20:04.230]
Here's one.

[02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:06.090]
It has the Schuumburger.

[02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.830]
Yeah.

[02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:07.110]
Okay.

[02:20:07.210 --> 02:20:07.430]
Great.

[02:20:10.850 --> 02:20:12.750]
It's a link from Johnny G.

[02:20:12.970 --> 02:20:14.130]
Go away, Johnny G.

[02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:15.070]
I don't do links.

[02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:17.630]
It really stinks when people send me links.

[02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:19.450]
You should know that because you're chronic, Johnny G.

[02:20:19.810 --> 02:20:23.170]
Neil, I'm surprised about what you were talking about yesterday

[02:20:23.170 --> 02:20:27.830]
that the reason you stay in Toronto in the cold is because you are

[02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:29.470]
scared of encountering your crazy listen.

[02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.830]
Yeah.

[02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:30.430]
You guys know what I said?

[02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.670]
Yeah.

[02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:34.710]
I'd always assume that it was that because you don't have the caulons

[02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:37.430]
to do your show in the studio and you have to encounter the same people

[02:20:37.430 --> 02:20:38.170]
you rip all the time.

[02:20:38.430 --> 02:20:40.330]
Even though, of course, I was there for years and years and ripped them

[02:20:40.330 --> 02:20:42.890]
just as much as I do now, which you seem to forget.

[02:20:43.310 --> 02:20:44.490]
Now, which break is this from?

[02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:46.130]
Oh, note.

[02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:46.470]
Note.

[02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:47.450]
That must be a note.

[02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:47.570]
No, no, no.

[02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:51.670]
To you know, just keep in common, baby.

[02:20:51.870 --> 02:20:53.570]

[02:20:53.710 --> 02:20:54.890]

[02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:58.590]
Neil, can you translate to non-Jewish people what a Yent is?

[02:20:58.590 --> 02:21:02.010]

Bird dog scrawgons.

[02:21:09.090 --> 02:21:11.330]
He sounds like what's wrong with the world, you know what?

[02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:14.630]

A gossip.

[02:21:19.630 --> 02:21:21.370]
Somebody who can't keep their trap shut.

[02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:49.470]
Joseph, as I enjoyed watching Jimmy Cifullus play for The Dupfants,

[02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:53.670]
He did score an impressive touchdown against the redskins in the Super Bowl, but that's where it ends

[02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:56.330]
He does not belong behind a mic during the Finns games

[02:21:56.330 --> 02:22:00.910]
He attempts to sound his attempts to sound dramatic on big plays are so fake and wimpy

[02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:05.590]
Rick Weaver was the best at all fins ever had that they're both correct Joe. Thank you Joe

[02:22:06.290 --> 02:22:12.310]

Yeah, Jennifer's never really spoken out about this, but now some four years later. She is

[02:22:50.410 --> 02:22:54.770]
Yeah, I guess that'd be kind of embarrassing, you know, that was four years ago

[02:22:57.950 --> 02:23:02.670]

[02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:51.110]
And you know when your stock is 17 cents a share you don't have an awful lot of money to put on the table when you're losing your ass

[02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:53.490]
losing your ass

[02:24:55.170 --> 02:24:59.770]
The fake Adam Kirschner says Scotty Mac with the producer a goldberg a night on w. I did you think he's a mole

[02:24:59.770 --> 02:25:03.890]

[02:25:05.250 --> 02:25:07.490]
Now was he a were you tight with Scotty or what?

[02:25:08.130 --> 02:25:13.030]
Let's see when you fight yeah, we had a couple of social occasions outside of work

But I don't have any problems with Scotty some of this line

[02:25:15.710 --> 02:25:16.730]
You'll Rogers good

[02:25:17.430 --> 02:25:19.170]
George Rodriguez no good

[02:25:19.170 --> 02:25:23.790]
As a matter of fact he cut that just recently when he was taking a tour through the studios here

Anyway, so what does this mean is he a mole? What is he is he still around? Is he still hanging around?

[02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:59.490]
No, he's the one maybe he's the one that's sending all the emails. He's like an Atlanta or something really

[02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:04.530]

Any disagreement no, oh, that's not an insult though

[02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:16.430]

Matt says asked George or Chris about a thing called a shout box instant message program

[02:26:32.050 --> 02:26:35.650]
The listeners can just enter a thought and send right from a website

[02:26:36.330 --> 02:26:40.530]
Just a thought to get more interactive with your more intelligent listeners, and it says ha ha ha ha

[02:26:40.530 --> 02:26:41.090]
Miss you can man

[02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:43.550]
I have an idea for this thing

[02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:47.730]
You know call the telephone where you pick it up and you talk to the host on the air and it's a

[02:26:48.370 --> 02:26:52.350]
conversation and I think you could make a show out of that and call it a talk show. Oh, oh, that's done

[02:26:52.350 --> 02:26:54.670]
I told you we've done a long time ago you didn't believe me and

[02:26:55.610 --> 02:27:00.250]
Then people kept insisting oh, well, I think you really ought to give it a shot. You know take some screw it

[02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:02.150]
Yeah, you know, maybe once in a while

[02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:09.310]
How about a talk box? How about a talk box you pick your box up and you talk into it and they hear you on the radio a squat box

[02:27:09.310 --> 02:27:11.450]
Yeah, Mary had a little lamb

[02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:13.830]

Elizabeth says yesterday at about the shows and you were commenting and wondering with Chris about some jox name

[02:28:17.490 --> 02:28:21.230]
I'm about as football savvy as George. I don't remember the name, but I think I can help

[02:28:23.050 --> 02:28:27.350]
I'm a teacher have become familiar with about 200 very diverse names a year in the past

[02:28:27.350 --> 02:28:30.770]
I've learned that some of the more interesting names are in fact made up

[02:28:30.770 --> 02:28:34.390]
A lot of my students from Opalaka have these types of names

[02:28:34.390 --> 02:28:41.210]
It's usually the combination of the mother's name and the dad's name like Sharon and Travis have a child and they name it Trabon

[02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:45.910]
Lynn and Jeremy have a child and they name it linemy or Jerelyn

[02:28:47.050 --> 02:28:52.650]
Listener for life. I love you man and sir Mora as looking here. Love to George and Chris too, but not Brandon and Zach

[02:28:53.850 --> 02:28:54.930]
What is that all about?

[02:28:56.690 --> 02:29:00.450]
What's Elizabeth got against Brandon and Zach? Well, I know what she's got against Zach

[02:29:01.690 --> 02:29:02.410]
He's evil

[02:29:03.370 --> 02:29:07.650]
What he's doing to that morning show see they got that those wired diaries in the last trend

[02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:10.990]
18 to 18 to no it was a 25 to 34 man

[02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:15.870]
The big go in the morning and the joke got some a bunch of wired 24

[02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:20.510]
24 and the reason you know they're wired is because they didn't listen to any day part the rest of the station

[02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:24.570]
Not me not the a two to four not the mad dog not not nothing

[02:29:25.530 --> 02:29:28.170]
wired that's what we need is a whole bunch of wired diaries, you know

[02:29:29.130 --> 02:29:33.710]
I'll say I think I'll start working on you once they start that people meter thing man

[02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:38.710]
Oh, yeah, they're gonna find out there's a whole lot of people listening right now who would never put it down the diary

[02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:41.710]
Just like all these people that send this hate on the email, you know

[02:29:42.570 --> 02:29:46.310]
I'm a fan. I've been a fan for 20 years, but your taste in sports teams sucks

[02:29:46.310 --> 02:29:47.770]
Maybe if there was some cutie pie

[02:29:48.330 --> 02:29:51.450]
Like Luke Shen on the red wings for Luke Shen's on the Leafs

[02:29:51.450 --> 02:29:56.370]
And I wouldn't care if the Leafs were all ugliest in and generally speaking. They are it's not a not a pretty team

[02:29:56.370 --> 02:30:01.650]
You know you think back red Kelly and bird homestead and Johnny Bauer all those old craggy looking guys

[02:30:02.210 --> 02:30:06.850]
Foster and bill a hewitt. I mean these were not pretty people at any point even as children

[02:30:08.510 --> 02:30:12.490]
You know what I'm saying no what he said. I'm saying that these are all the same people. You're right

[02:30:12.490 --> 02:30:17.790]
Aqua Drace three no minutes to post. They're going to the gate. I wonder if Durkin's working on a Wednesday

[02:30:20.810 --> 02:30:23.270]

[02:30:24.350 --> 02:30:27.610]

Don't stick your neck on

[02:30:32.270 --> 02:30:36.190]
Then they won't put us on serious or maybe then they would put you that serious if we start talking dirty, you know

[02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:42.870]
All these people obsessed with all this serious crap in a stock is $0.17 a share my god

[02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:47.890]
Starting gate. They're at the post Durkin. I told you the great Tom Durkin. He's no Trevor Denman, but he's damn good

[02:30:48.390 --> 02:30:51.330]

[02:30:51.330 --> 02:30:51.770]
haha

[02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:57.930]

[02:31:27.490 --> 02:31:31.250]

and so he didn't really have to work that hard anymore you don't have to really do

[02:31:46.970 --> 02:31:50.510]

ckl w

[02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:03.990]
was the bad guy who is extremely homophobic

[02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:05.510]
and he was concerned for his image you know

[02:37:05.510 --> 02:37:07.370]
because he had a big deep balls of his voice

[02:37:07.370 --> 02:37:09.750]
he just he wasn't comfortable being on a show

[02:37:09.750 --> 02:37:11.010]
with some faggot like me you know

[02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:12.930]
and mistakenly

[02:37:12.930 --> 02:37:13.370]
who would be

[02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:14.910]
you

[02:37:15.490 --> 02:37:16.670]
somebody desperate for a paycheck

[02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:17.670]
yeah her fat Chris

[02:37:18.970 --> 02:37:21.050]
so anyway the fake time jica says wqm

[02:37:21.050 --> 02:37:23.090]
has been the same since ed and hank were forced out

[02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:24.630]
see at the track time

[02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:25.270]
not

[02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:28.230]
one thing about the racetrack

[02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:31.230]
uh... fishing out of his man they all the other birds of feather that plunge

[02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:32.110]
her cousin together

[02:37:33.170 --> 02:37:34.770]
the really uh... tight

[02:37:34.770 --> 02:37:35.830]
very tight

[02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:38.550]
so the fake time jica says serious mistake

[02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:43.290]
over the last couple years radio host bubba loves bunch with his cult like

[02:37:43.290 --> 02:37:46.170]
following has become an afternoon fixture and howard one oh one

[02:37:46.730 --> 02:37:48.370]
with only twenty shows left in this contract

[02:37:48.370 --> 02:37:50.930]
this is a fixture and that now more than ever

[02:37:50.930 --> 02:37:53.290]
serious should be looking to lock into a long-term agreement

[02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:55.010]
like him or not

[02:37:55.010 --> 02:37:57.370]
bubba has the kind of show that puts subscriptions on the books

[02:37:57.370 --> 02:38:00.610]
and is personally the kind of guy gets his team together to tour around the country

[02:38:00.610 --> 02:38:02.610]
grassroots promoting serious xm radio

[02:38:03.390 --> 02:38:06.630]
with subscribers already screaming out an anger related latest latest channel

[02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:09.850]
stirrup serious xm is on the verge of making a huge mistake

[02:38:09.850 --> 02:38:12.470]
if they choose to let bubba go obviously they did because he's

[02:38:12.470 --> 02:38:14.350]
starting the first of the year with cocks

[02:38:15.450 --> 02:38:18.950]
it seems clear that the decision makers at serious xm have no idea what kind of

[02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:21.810]
talent they have with bubba all anyone has to do is take a look at the number of

[02:38:21.810 --> 02:38:23.090]
websites the cover news about him

[02:38:23.090 --> 02:38:26.150]
the number of users on the countless message boards devoted to him and then

[02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:28.970]
check out how he can move the numbers at google like only a very few like

[02:38:28.970 --> 02:38:31.270]
howard's turn can do what more do they need

[02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:35.490]
it's time for serious xm to step up to the plate or get ready for a back last

[02:38:35.490 --> 02:38:36.730]
like nothing they've seen to date

[02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:38.910]
that stock will be down to two cent

[02:38:39.610 --> 02:38:39.970]
wow

[02:38:41.210 --> 02:38:45.350]
that's from the fake tom jico is obviously the same as the fake all the other

[02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:45.590]
ones

[02:38:47.070 --> 02:38:49.210]
not the fake johnny dark though that's the real one i think

[02:38:49.830 --> 02:38:51.990]
i hope so i hope he's just forming at the mouth

[02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:55.970]
got to do something besides hangout at doodas i think doodas out of business

[02:38:55.970 --> 02:39:01.210]
are they oh yeah wow look at this gay ten wilton manners how new house

[02:39:01.210 --> 02:39:05.210]
silly is the new qm contest where grown men call in the Joe Roe show and try

[02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:06.850]
to give their best manage impression

[02:39:07.350 --> 02:39:12.250]
according to qm website the contest is called bark like the mad dog and then when it gets to hang with

[02:39:12.250 --> 02:39:16.210]
the mad dog and big dog before the often patriots game and gets to event

[02:39:16.210 --> 02:39:21.130]
with the broadcast or visit the broadcast booth to visit jimmy syphilis Joe and Jim

[02:39:21.690 --> 02:39:25.570]
why would a grown man want to go out of his way to win a concert where he gets to

[02:39:26.590 --> 02:39:30.990]
visit and spend time with other men all of this sounds very gay to me how about you

telling him to become a republican because he was no democrat about a month after

[02:40:34.370 --> 02:40:38.410]
the committee asked me to join them on a visit to his office which i turned down

[02:40:38.410 --> 02:40:41.270]
because of my angry letter or within a year shelby to become a republican

[02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:45.510]
he was one of those Reagan democrats afraid of civil rights he's a yahoo

[02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:49.230]
my husband turned me on to you and we move back to florida nineteen ninety

[02:40:49.230 --> 02:40:52.630]

i'm still polluting the environment steven of jerseys says these incessant

[02:40:57.790 --> 02:41:01.550]
emails comparing you and stern and suggesting obviously false on air

[02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:05.770]

[02:44:51.290 --> 02:44:51.630]
mornings

[02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:56.050]

[02:45:04.730 --> 02:45:07.530]
you know i don't follow the career is closely as i used to await

[02:45:09.090 --> 02:45:10.150]
i never did

[02:45:10.150 --> 02:45:13.490]
the fake mason Williams who obviously has too much classical gas

[02:45:14.490 --> 02:45:17.650]
says your logic of uh... not paying for radio makes no sense i pay for my

[02:45:17.650 --> 02:45:19.690]
radio you pay for cable tv you do

[02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:22.850]
and please shut up if you enjoy something only makes sense to pay for

[02:45:24.250 --> 02:45:28.390]
i got news for you would have to be something so hysterical so compelling

[02:45:28.390 --> 02:45:30.330]
so entertaining for me to pay for radio

[02:45:30.770 --> 02:45:32.790]
i mean cable tv how do you make a comparison

[02:45:33.310 --> 02:45:36.270]
between all the different choices of movies not good stuff on cable tv

[02:45:36.270 --> 02:45:37.650]
the sporting events etc

[02:45:38.810 --> 02:45:43.210]
but they got the hockey games on uh... x-ray well one-one one-one listen to hockey

[02:45:43.210 --> 02:45:45.790]
games under radio when i can see them all on my tv

[02:45:45.790 --> 02:45:49.910]
i paid for it but why don't i want to listen to it when i can watch it

[02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:53.290]
and that's why radio is a dinosaur okay work i mean we're eating out of living

[02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:54.690]
on a dying medium

[02:45:55.650 --> 02:45:57.850]
that's why people are going to that satellite crap

[02:45:58.410 --> 02:46:02.090]
all you can say that they want you are full of energy they want you guys

[02:46:02.090 --> 02:46:06.050]

[02:46:15.570 --> 02:46:19.090]
doesn't suck as it blows but you don't have to tell me whether isn't life

[02:46:19.090 --> 02:46:22.730]
no wife is not about whether that's all about the everybody living in the

[02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:27.390]
good and besides when it's cold outside you got to do things to warm up and

[02:46:27.390 --> 02:46:30.370]
alleviate the board there he goes again when that's sexual innuendous

[02:46:30.370 --> 02:46:30.730]
right

[02:46:31.430 --> 02:46:34.510]
you'd be perfect on serious you can say the effort just over and over here

[02:46:34.510 --> 02:46:36.750]

to a every time i say it won't be gratuitous

[02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:47.230]

more than once but the said that guy mimey is cool right he speaks highly of you

[02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:54.090]

[02:46:57.710 --> 02:47:00.810]

[02:49:17.010 --> 02:49:17.530]
well

[02:49:18.050 --> 02:49:22.090]
so here's that story about the junella spears in sweet home or a gone

[02:49:22.090 --> 02:49:23.050]
oh boy

[02:49:24.130 --> 02:49:27.950]
junella spears and she thinks he's a sucker in easy mark besides a work as a

[02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:28.510]
registered nurse

[02:49:28.510 --> 02:49:31.470]
spears in relation to the well-known pops there also teaches cpr

[02:49:31.470 --> 02:49:34.110]
is a reverend who is married many couples he's a reverend

[02:49:34.110 --> 02:49:36.310]
a preacher she also communicates with lightning

[02:49:36.970 --> 02:49:38.430]
fast languages with her here

[02:49:38.430 --> 02:49:43.690]
so how did this otherwise lucid intelligent woman and the send nearly half a

[02:49:43.690 --> 02:49:46.430]
million dollars to bunch of con artist running what has become one of the best

[02:49:46.430 --> 02:49:47.770]
known internet scams in the world

[02:49:48.470 --> 02:49:51.870]
spears fell victim to the night jirian scam which is permitted almost anyone

[02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:53.310]
who's ever had an email account

[02:49:53.310 --> 02:49:55.030]
or are we familiar or what

[02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:58.990]
the email pictures from a bit of most people by now a long lost relative or

[02:49:58.990 --> 02:50:01.490]
desperate government official in a war torn country needs to shuffle some

[02:50:01.490 --> 02:50:04.570]
funds to you say around ten or twenty million if you could just help them out

[02:50:04.570 --> 02:50:07.230]
of it you get to keep ten or twenty or thirty percent for your trouble

[02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:11.330]
all you need to do is send x amount of dollars to pay some fees all that cash

[02:50:11.330 --> 02:50:14.510]
will suddenly be in your check me out putting you on easy street or on queer

[02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:18.650]
street by the way please send the funds through an unpressible wire service

[02:50:19.810 --> 02:50:23.370]
by this time not many people fall for such an outrageous pitch and the scam is

[02:50:23.370 --> 02:50:26.710]
very well known but it persists and for a reason every now and then it works

[02:50:27.530 --> 02:50:30.870]
for spears it started as it almost does with an email a promise twenty million

[02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:34.250]
and a case the money was supposed to left behind by our grandfather jb

[02:50:34.250 --> 02:50:37.370]
spears with whom the family has lost contact over the years that's unusual

[02:50:37.370 --> 02:50:38.710]
because it actually had her name

[02:50:39.350 --> 02:50:41.590]
usually most of these are to undisclosed recipients

[02:50:42.490 --> 02:50:42.850]
right

[02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.870]
