[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]
The music expressed on the previous programs are those of the host guests and

[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.520]
maybe ludicrous but I'd rather hear that cramped in Kirk Church Street I'll tell you that

[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.480]
The biggest thing is music

[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.620]
The best talent

[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.500]
You're running the sports radio

[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.240]
4.560 WQAM

[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.240]
I mean how's Joe Sixpack doing huh?

[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.520]
Joe Sixpack's going on and having a blue with the Stera

[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.080]
Tonight's the night baby

[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.980]
Oh yeah

[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.120]
I can't wait

[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.900]
Let's move the clock to the throat

[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.960]
560 WQAM presents the Neil Rogers

[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.040]
I bet Joe McKean is talking to me while bloody dials are on

[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.320]
No, why all they indeed?

[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.320]
Oh oh in other counties?

[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.420]
Cold cold free

[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.780]
87775 Neil

[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.280]
Or pound 560 on your 860

[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.580]
It's passed the day by by the wireless market as the opinion is expressed

[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.020]
All by Neil his guests or his colleagues

[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.760]
Do not represent those of WQAM management

[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.360]
No!

[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.600]
4.560

[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.060]
Now the Neil Rogers show

[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.560]
I'm 560 WQAM

[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.940]
I'm sorry

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.640]
Sorry

[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.640]
In a place that smells just like the bad day at the zoo

[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.880]
It's back dressed and dragged that drink that we need to do

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.860]
Yeah, it's gonna bring the circle band later to a day

[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.800]
It seems all you gotta do is just ask the enemy

[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.400]
Why does this ask what sound it's a Taliban?

[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.380]
H girls, but don't wear pants that's a Taliban

[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.820]
And Taliban, we'll take you back cause it's belly butt crack

[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.100]
Bill Whitt's out

[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.320]
Welcome

[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.860]
I found this blue for the world

[00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.680]
But you got me and I'm the first

[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.200]
Highlight, it shows

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.940]
He's here

[00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.920]
Jazz reports coming out tomorrow that experts predict will show our nit.

[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.180]
straight month of job loss. Nine straight months of job loss.

[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.780]
He had just two weeks ago John McCain said the fundamentals of the economy were strong.

[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.980]
I don't know what yard sticks in the McCain uses, but where I come from there's

[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.080]
nothing more fundamental than a job.

[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.000]
Here you go, you're telling Barack. Well anyway, it's 10.0.2.5.60 WTQAM. Happy

[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.560]
Thursday to you, October 3rd. Thank you.

[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.620]
Oh, brother. It's going to be quite a day today. It's going to be a long Thursday. I can smell it.

[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.840]
Why?

[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.100]
I don't know. Well, started out kind of screwed up. We had a fused blow down there in the

[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.240]
QM studio. The fused blow confused. And so I could hear George this morning,

[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.740]
but he couldn't hear me. I was feeding him my TV stuff, but you couldn't hear it.

[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.020]
Nope. That's just maddening. And of course George pulling the old same old stuff.

[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.700]
Oh, check your this and re-brew your boot, others and re-know that if we call an

[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.380]
engineer without doing everything that we can do on our end. Well, it was all fine on

[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.640]
this end. Okay, there's nothing wrong with my end. It's not what I heard. Well, trust me,

[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.740]
my end is just fine for an old goat. So we found out who died. Somebody just emailed me that.

[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.760]
By the way, the emails are dead as a door nail this morning. I don't know what's going on.

[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.420]
Don't tell me this is going to be the day the email died. And for that right wing

[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.420]
goofball that sent me this stuff. See, I made a mistake and I replied to this idiot.

[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.140]
And then he sends me another one this morning using my real last name.

[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.260]
You know, like, well, congratulations. You know, my name right off the bat. I should have deleted it.

[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.980]
Who's this on that? Yeah. Big deal. Good thing they don't know my real name.

[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.540]
Mr. Big Shot. You, you know, you stick with your right wing fascism and continue

[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.440]
while you're deluding yourself into believing that you're a great, oh, and he's

[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.440]
assigned it with the name and a proud South Floridian. Well, if you're proud to be

[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.340]
in South Florida, well, that says it all. That tells me what I need to know.

[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.720]
You know what the translation of that is? What? That's like Sarah and her Joe

[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.520]
six pack. Same thing. She is dumber than sawdust, man. You notice that, huh?

[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.380]
Dumber than sawdust. I'll let me take her. Katie Kirk is throwing her marshmallows

[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.700]
and she can't even catch him much less roast him. God.

[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.260]
Closener, like what, when you get your news, what magazines do you? I love them.

[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.020]
I love my bed. She can't give a direct answer to anything.

[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.320]
What Supreme Court decision other than Roe v. Wade, did you disagree with?

[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.800]
Well, so many like Roe v. Wade.

[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.080]
This was John McCain's first serious decision, like any other candidate, you know,

[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.580]
selecting the running mate. And he picked this trailer trash dumbass bitch.

[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.660]
That should tell you about his judgment.

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.660]
Carmage a nasty hostile mean tempered old man. That's him.

[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.400]
Tonight's the big night. Tonight's the debate.

[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.520]
Palin Biden. Joe Biden ought to chew her up and spit her out like chewing tobacco.

[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.680]
Why the guys chew tobacco? Can you answer me that question? What's that all about?

[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.720]
I don't know. You put a pinch between your gum and she, he could pinch.

[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.520]
She had pinched this for effect. For effect? Yeah. That effect for like a turn off effect.

[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.340]
I mean, can you imagine? Can you imagine? You know the breath of like smokers breath.

[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.380]
I don't have to imagine. Can you imagine the breath of guys at Chattabaca?

[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.280]
I've known many. You have? Sure.

[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.580]
In Montana, everybody has a pig. Oh, in Montana, well, that's a better carol.

[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.540]
And in North Carolina, it's different to the back of that.

[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.580]
That's Joe Apeck in Montana. That's the baseball player, big old Watt-a-chaw in North Carolina.

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.180]
Well, we got some bad news to get you started. Mr. Clean is dead.

[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.160]
Oh, no, who? House Peters, Jr. dead in 92.

[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.720]
I mean, up until this time, I never heard his name until he croaked.

[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.260]
House Peters, Jr. TV actor became the original Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean in Procter and Gamble's commercials.

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.960]
For household cleaners died Wednesday. The yesterday was 92. That's plenty old enough.

[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.140]
92. He died of pneumonia. At the motion picture and television font hospital in L.A. said his son, John Peters.

[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.760]
The elder Peters most memorable role came as Mr. Clean, a muscular man with a bald head, a hoop earring, and a no-nonsense.

[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.880]
I thought Mr. Clean was like a cartoon character.

[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.780]
Eventually.

[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:57.040]
And a no-nonsense attitude toward Dirt and Grime. From the late 1950s, in the early 60s, Peter's Jr. helped advertise the famous household cleaning with the trademark jingle.

[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.780]
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean.

[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.840]
Peter's Jr. played many supporting roles through his career, including working with Roy Rogers and Jean-Opry on their TV shows.

[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.260]
He also appeared in Perry Mason, Gunn Schmoke, the Twilight Zone, and Lassie.

[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.720]
Lassie, here girl.

[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.460]
Lassie must have been really confused because they kept calling Lassie a girl, and I think that the dogs that played Lassie were all guys.

[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.660]
Right? Then I read that somewhere? Yes, he did.

[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.400]
I wonder, Lassie, new John's... Joe, John's expect.

[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.220]
He always played the heavy, John Peters said, referring to his father's customary roles as a villain or brawny character.

[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.000]
Brawny.

[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.060]
I don't think they have Mr. Clean, but it's nothing to have a role of brawny, you handy.

[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.320]
I wonder if Rosie's dead, yes she's dead.

[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.960]
The quicker picker-upper?

[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.000]
Was that bounty?

[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.720]
Yes, yes.

[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.340]
Oh, what are you at with time and for? She was, that's a long time ago.

[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.360]
Even though he wasn't happy about being cast in those roles, he really worked hard at it, said John.

[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.880]
His father's acting career span, 1935 to 60, 70, also wrote an autobiography.

[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.780]
Another side of Hollywood, which he describes growing up the son of an actress and silent film actor in Beverly Hills.

[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.080]
His father, Robert House Peter Sr., has a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.160]
Never heard of him, did you?

[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:13.380]
No.

[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.620]
Robert House Peter Sr., but in my house, not to be confused with Joe Mars Jr., and the Ray Fisher Jr.,

[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.880]
Peter's Jr. was never a leading man to play it in Wally, Maccammory Jr.,

[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:33.380]
never a leading man to play many character parts in Cuba and movies won't want to golden boot award in 2000 for his lifetime kind of vision of the Western genre.

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:39.900]
He was born in Newark, New York, and a survivor of his wife, a daughter, another son and four grandchildren.

[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.640]
He's dead, 92, it's pleniroled off.

[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.820]
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean, Mr. You know, isn't it amazing how television?

[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.300]
I mean, music is in your brain.

[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.220]
You know, the music you grew up with and the music of life.

[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.880]
But television is so much more because it's not just audio, it's just visual.

[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.220]
Correct.

[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.220]
But so much of the audio from TV, the Jingles, Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean, like that.

[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.700]
Call for Philip Morris.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.080]
That's before you were born when they used to advertise faggots on TV.

[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.700]
I've seen those old newsreels.

[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.020]
Call for Philip Morris.

[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.900]
Hey, Johnny, his name was Johnny, I think.

[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.800]
You know, he had this really bizarre outfit on.

[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.660]
He looked kind of gay, he asked me.

[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.260]
Here's an email.

[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.820]
We're not getting, well, I haven't checked it here since we came on, but it's looking pretty grim.

[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.700]
If we don't get a million of them today, I'm not going to be in here tomorrow.

[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.000]
In fact, I'm not going to be here tomorrow anyway.

[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.780]
George is going to be here with Fleetamoural.

[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.240]
No fat Chris and no fat in the room.

[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.380]
Nope.

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.660]
It's a no fat Friday tomorrow.

[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.960]
And I know Zack's starting with that singing craft again with that rap garbage.

[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.240]
Like a god of god, a move up and up and down.

[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.020]
That was the beginning of the end for our morning show and he won't stop now.

[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.520]
Well, it's ludicrous in the house.

[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.480]
I don't give a crap.

[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.020]
That's ludicrous if he acts me.

[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.540]
Ludicrous is in the house.

[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.620]
So am I supposed to get excited about that?

[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.060]
Of course.

[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:02.900]
Fish is.

[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.360]
Yeah, shizzle my whistle.

[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:05.960]
Your whistle?

[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:06.660]
Yeah.

[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.740]
A whistle.

[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.020]
How he says, I was taking my usual morning walk wearing my Obama OAT shirt.

[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.060]
An old gentleman was walking toward me, stopped and asked why Obama.

[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.800]
I told him that I wanted to present it with a vision for the future, not one who would repeat mistakes of the past.

[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.840]
I wanted a president who was common cool under pressure, not a hot-headed ill tempered blowhard.

[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.560]
I told him that I wanted a president to put the people first, not one who was in bed with lobbyists.

[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]
I wanted a president who thought enough of this country that he chose the second and commanded would actually take over for him.

[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.540]
An honest beat.

[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.100]
I told him I wanted a president who would get us out of a rack sooner than later or not at all.

[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800]
I told him that I wanted a president who was self-confident.

[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.360]
And I won with the illusions of grandeur and bloated self-importance.

[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.460]
I told him I wanted Barack Obama to be present.

[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.900]
I told him that I had a nice day and continued to my walk.

[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.480]
I hope he got his answer.

[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.220]
Well, nice work there, Holly. Good going.

[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.180]
You go, girl. Maybe the guy was Joe Sixpack.

[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.680]
He talks like an absolute moron.

[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:15.480]
And anybody out there, male, female, neuter who defends this bimbo, this silly-ass bitch, who is buying this act, has got to be done.

[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.120]
And I was saying with Chris, we were discussing this while you were out doing a choice.

[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.540]
The reason so many people gravitated to a George W. Bush was because he was dumber than they were.

[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.560]
At least they felt that way.

[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.080]
Yield.

[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.240]
And the same thing with her. She is the dumb factor.

[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.400]
That's what's attractive.

[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.700]
She's not bright. She's not smart. She's not intellectual. She doesn't read. She's not curious.

[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.900]
She's got no clue where anything in the world is.

[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.240]
She's, you know, up until the year ago, she never even had a freaking passport.

[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.760]
Hey, she knows where Russia is.

[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.780]
Oh, yeah, she can see it right off her window.

[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:53.160]
And Poon Tang was flying over one day and he opened the window of the plane and yelled out, hey, Sarah, I want to come and force you.

[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.540]
Thanks, but no thanks. Here we are. It is ugly.

[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.760]
When she says that.

[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:57.920]
Thanks, but no thanks.

[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.460]
It just, it makes me want to just crawl under the bed and never come out.

[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.000]
How anybody can take this bitch seriously just as way beyond me.

[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.300]
But nevertheless, TV is peddling her to in the beginning, boy. They were peddling her.

[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.560]
I'd rather have Tina Favourite. At least she's got a sense of humor.

[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.320]
What magazines, what newspapers, where do you think you're from?

[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.520]
Oh, you know, whatever they can't run on me.

[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.160]
Oh, I'm, yeah, I'm.

[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.260]
Whatever the question is, oh, I'm never a specific answer on anything.

[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.080]
I think that she's been schooled to do that.

[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:41.160]
I just give glittering generalities. Well, what day of the week it is that well, one of the good ones, you know, what time is your speed?

[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.640]
Oh, I don't know what Joe six pack puts his feet up on the thing.

[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.280]
Wow.

[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:53.780]
Providing the funding our automakers need to retool their factories, make fuel efficient and alternative fuel,

[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.420]
alternative fuel cars and trucks.

[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.060]
We've made some progress.

[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.420]
We've got some guarantee, long guarantees passed out of Congress, but we're going to need the next administration.

[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:12.880]
The portion is through fast to be firm, to be serious, to not wait six years before he meets with the auto leaders in this state.

[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.160]
We need somebody who's engaged and focused on making sure that the company has engaged.

[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:18.920]
I thought he was married.

[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.900]
1013 at 560 WQAM.

[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.020]
No portion of this program, within detail.

[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.020]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.780]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.980]
Anybody have a heart or a liver?

[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.320]
No.

[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.200]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.020]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.680]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.540]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:54.020]
I am mohar with the day of the profit and the mansion, all over my old face on blue and red,

[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.220]
is for full face.

[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.000]
I don't know why they hate me, or why they always hate me.

[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.620]
It must be because I can't be full with red, is for full face.

[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.140]
A main part, on my arm, like a random alley map, a locker wand.

[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.160]
I got beans on my nose, and nobody knows that under my clothes I wear fancy hoes.

[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.820]
But that don't mean that I'm gay.

[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.840]
If you think my arms have aired, you ought to see my legs.

[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.940]
I might as well keep on smoothing, shaved, to show a little clasped the next time I'm raping it.

[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.360]
I can go through a surgeon, but that gives me to shivers.

[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.440]
I would not want to walk on looking like Joan Rivers.

[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240]
Where am I?

[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.860]
I buy a little beast, the fat little freak.

[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.220]
I get him a favor now again upon the heat.

[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:35.440]
The reason I dismiss that stinkin' fat bastard is because he wouldn't shut up, and he can't play conestin'.

[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.060]
Hey, somebody talkin' over there, nobody talkin' over there.

[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.380]
I rap, then you talk.

[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.580]
Look at me, I'm hit, I ain't no square.

[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.620]
I'm a ding-dong daddy, man.

[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.580]
I'm really dead.

[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.400]
I buy a ready what I want, I don't care.

[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.500]
First of all, if they make me flip my wig made a smelly green hair,

[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.500]
I get fired myself and even happens to the grapes.

[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.380]
Westwood once said you'll get out of here whilst we break your legs.

[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.220]
So now I sit by the pool, life's as good as it gets.

[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.760]
With my paladin cocktail, placing bets on the gents.

[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.320]
In paradise, paradise, I don't kiss companies' ass in paradise.

[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980]
Do do do do do do do.

[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.240]
I'll be shoving out the screwkins when I get the chance, but the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants.

[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.220]
How long does it take?

[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.540]
I've been calling for place, it was just a little thought.

[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.020]
So what I left this day, and you think that's funny when I knock the sandwich buddy?

[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.300]
I can do what I want, but the management loves me.

[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.520]
Can I tell you something, Mo? Something you oughta know.

[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.780]
But a long, he's time, I wanted you to be my home.

[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.940]
You wipe my tight pal, now I ask for it, help me.

[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.620]
Who, who, who, who do you do?

[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.720]
I won't take no for an answer.

[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.100]
Put it out, put it out.

[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:34.600]
Not you.

[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.600]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.180]
I'm a bitch.

[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.860]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.380]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.600]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.240]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.820]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.400]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.700]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.320]
Put it out of there.

[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.440]
10, 19 and 5, 60 WQAM.

[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.640]
Happy Thursday to you.

[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.660]
Who the Akeens playing this week, Chris?

[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.020]
That would be FSU.

[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.080]
Well that's right, CFSU game.

[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.520]
Excuse me, I had a brain fart there.

[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.160]
That's gonna be another loss for the Akeens.

[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.100]
What are you talking about?

[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.660]
If they could lose to a girl school last week

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.880]
without their quarterback, they could lose to anybody.

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.160]
You'll see.

[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.360]
And the fish were the fish plan.

[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.580]
San Diego.

[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.480]
Oh, that's right, the charges.

[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.580]
Oh, that's gonna be ugly.

[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:19.940]
Woo!

[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.040]
Okay, I changed the poll.

[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.060]
Is that okay, FATSO?

[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.680]
No, I want you to go back to it.

[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.380]
Too late.

[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.000]
We had a thousand and twelve votes on the previous poll.

[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.960]
And George and Chris, they pulled off a last minute

[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.620]
when Chris had nothing to do with it.

[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.080]
Like I said, George pulled it out like a rampant out of his ass.

[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.100]
What was the best acting performance by a singer?

[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.900]
I like food when the poll 160 was a very late addition, right?

[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.880]
Sure, I send it to the show.

[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.200]
It moved.

[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.400]
I like food, beat them all.

[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.560]
And you know what, I never got a chance to vote for it not even once.

[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.780]
Well, you didn't have to.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.540]
It won hands down your pantaloons.

[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.120]
Frank Sinatra from here to return to the Inmanctuary in Canada,

[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.280]
which is just totally inane that Sean put on two of them

[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.440]
for the price of one hundred thirty nine for Sinatra.

[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.740]
And that's because there's two movies listed.

[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.240]
Stupid Mark Wahlberg, Boogie Knight's 97,

[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.060]
share for Moonstruck 68.

[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.980]
I like the sequel, better cockamoon struck.

[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.320]
Bet Midler, the row is 54, Dwight Yokem,

[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.900]
Slingblade 43, ice cube, boys in the hood 38,

[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.560]
Ludacris, who's in the house.

[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.640]
Yo, yo, crash 36.

[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.260]
You know, that whole business like in football.

[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.840]
He takes it to the house.

[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.220]
That is, if there's anything that makes my skin crawl,

[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.060]
that kind of crap is where it's at.

[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.120]
Takes it to the house.

[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.500]
Oh my God.

[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.580]
What kind of swill is that?

[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.820]
I bet you're, I bet you're, Chris likes that.

[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:42.760]
Huh?

[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.520]
Takes it to the house.

[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.980]
That's like, you know, Manny goes yard.

[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.700]
Yeah.

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.960]
Manny goes yard.

[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.980]
Sammy goes yard.

[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.840]
And Ricky goes nuts because Ricky's got the urge.

[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.560]
He's trying to resist the urge to light up that's right.

[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.640]
Smoke a big fat one.

[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.460]
Take the herald and roll up that baby and just light it up.

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.760]
Like a Hanukkah bush.

[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:09.680]
And they're done that.

[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.340]
I'm sure recently, just this morning.

[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.060]
M&M 8 mile 32.

[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:14.840]
Let me say it again.

[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.640]
Stay out of Detroit.

[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.220]
If you've got a half a brain, stay far away from Detroit.

[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.000]
That's about the only negative thing

[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.440]
beside the damn wintertime here.

[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.200]
It's being too close to Detroit.

[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.760]
And it's about 300 miles away, I guess.

[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.160]
I don't know.

[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:25.980]
Not far enough.

[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.860]
Don't go anywhere near Detroit.

[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.860]
Don't even go to Windsor.

[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.280]
Don't go to London, Ontario.

[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.720]
And definitely do not go to Ishtba Ming, Michigan or if it's the landing.

[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.380]
Neil Diamond, the jazz singer, 29.

[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.560]
Jérrely Doe, Requiem for a Dream, 24.

[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.240]
Hey, Jérid, how's he doing?

[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.560]
Haven't seen him enough, no lately.

[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.360]
I haven't seen him in a long time.

[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.220]
Maybe he's busy with his music.

[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:48.720]
Maybe.

[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:49.820]
What's the name of the band?

[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:50.780]
30 seconds to Mars.

[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:51.660]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.760]
Tina Turner, beyond Thunderdome, 24.

[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.440]
Queen Latifist, Chicago, 24.

[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.820]
Why does a lot of them on here?

[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.000]
We were just getting in and dated with CREP.

[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.120]
It was like the pole building on the phone.

[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.580]
I'd go one for the pole.

[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.540]
And then that was it.

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.800]
That's all we had all day yesterday.

[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.520]
Burr lives, cat on a hot tin roof, 23.

[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.420]
Alamartino, the godfather.

[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.760]
Alamartino, Johnny Fontaine.

[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.480]
You cannot talk to a man.

[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.180]
What do I want to go?

[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:17.600]
19.

[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.600]
Harry Connick, Jr.

[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.600]
Copycat 18.

[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.320]
Courtney Love, the people versus Larry Flynn 17.

[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.660]
I can't believe you haven't seen that.

[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.320]
Sorry.

[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.760]
You've got to see it.

[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.420]
OK.

[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.920]
Because one thing about America, this isn't brand new.

[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.080]
This fascism under Bush.

[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.760]
They just carried it.

[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.140]
You know, they just extended it further than ever has been before.

[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.060]
But the idea that anybody can be outspoken and really Larry Flynn,

[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.660]
they took care of him pretty much.

[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.400]
He's not sounding too good.

[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.220]
Eliza Manelli for Arthur 17.

[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:46.960]
Hey, Eliza.

[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.080]
Have another belt, Eliza.

[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.600]
She's just, I don't know.

[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.520]
Just like mommy, another fag-hag.

[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.700]
Maybe it runs in the family.

[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.480]

[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.700]

Madonna, Dick Tracy 12.

[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.220]
Elvis Presley, Charro 12.

[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.500]
The idea that anybody would vote for Elvis

[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.600]
for the best acting performance by anything alive is just so.

[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.280]
Ben Crosby, the Belzer St. Mary's 10.

[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.200]
Kenny Rogers, the gambler 10.

[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.060]
I told you, Kenny Rogers was sitting across from me

[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.660]
at my table at Pompeno Park one night.

[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.700]
Very quietly, I forget who he was with.

[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.240]
He was not with the Dolly Parton.

[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.020]
Was he with his brother?

[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:31.740]
He looks just like him?

[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:32.800]
I don't know.

[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.340]
But he was now gambling a little bit

[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.300]
and also a Jim Leland was there one night.

[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.440]
They were Jim Leland, Chris, former manager of your Florida Marlon.

[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.200]
Yep, Chainsmoker.

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.660]
And a big gambler, big plunger.

[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.100]
Mac Davis, North Dallas 40-10.

[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.100]

Sting in the bride 3.

[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.260]
Wow, 2012 votes.

[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.940]
Got a very important email here now.

[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.920]
From Jolly Jo Bell.

[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.800]
Who changed his name since the first two fake ones

[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.120]
which were sent what from New Mexico?

[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.480]
Well, someone guessed.

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.400]
Now he's got a new email address,

[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.540]
jolly.jo.bell at gmail.com.

[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.500]
Oh, Mr. Rogers, how are you, Neil?

[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.380]
I'm emailing you this address because this is a matter of needs immediate attention.

[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.960]
We've received a cease and desist order from Mr. Howard David Adid's lawyer.

[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.580]
They are suing clear channel for a slander and defecation of character.

[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.500]
Please stop immediately.

[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.520]
Don't test me, Neil.

[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.080]
I'm a vascular and indenno.

[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.620]
Jolly, Jolly, Jolly, Joe.

[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.900]
Oh, what's this?

[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.460]
A vascular and indenno.

[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.980]
Defecation of character.

[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.660]
Well, sounds.

[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.920]
Don't be to me.

[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.140]
Yeah, it looks like that one here, PC,

[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.800]
had looked like somebody defecated on his head.

[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.680]
I wonder who the doctor was who performed the surgery on his own.

[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:06.200]
Ah.

[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.380]
When's Jolly on again?

[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.020]
I sure missed that squeak, my stu-not.

[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.520]
When's that little pipsquake going to be on again?

[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.720]
Let me look at the weekend schedule.

[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.860]
I think I've seen him in a while. That's a good point.

[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.300]
Really?

[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.020]
G-L-D. Maybe they couldn't take it.

[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.280]
Well, let me take a puke.

[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.400]
Um, I don't see Sunday night.

[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:26.600]
No.

[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.720]
I don't see his name anywhere.

[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.520]
Sunday night.

[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:28.860]
On what?

[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.640]
Oh, that's right.

[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.520]
Q-A-M prime time with G-L-D.

[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:32.840]
730-10.

[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.100]
On Sunday night.

[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.240]
That's a good time for him.

[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.120]
Does anybody else have you, you know, watching 60 minutes or getting late or doing something constructive?

[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.940]
Having a great dinner?

[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.460]
And we got G-L-D on Sunday.

[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.920]
Fat worse than death.

[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.340]
Got a few emails here in this anxious quizzling.

[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.200]
I thought you said something about the L-Way.

[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.200]
No, I never said nothing about L-Way.

[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.620]
I said that some queen went out there to see him play in Denver.

[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.940]
Some queen who used to be a big hurricane fan.

[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.560]
The biggest name.

[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.920]
The only thing is to L-Way.

[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.260]
One of the squeaks of Josh.

[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.220]
Four-trigger five.

[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.040]
That's what you think.

[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.180]
I think, fourth, leader.

[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.240]
New, good.

[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.140]
Justice.

[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.240]
Across examination, no G Simpson's robbery and kidnap in trial today.

[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.580]
Simpson said he was only trying to recover stolen personal property.

[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.640]
Listen to what he said.

[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.740]
I just want the knife that I killed the cold and long.

[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.560]
Did I hit it out loud?

[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.280]
I'm meant to say.

[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.420]
I just want the small bean butter knife I used to butter my crooked skin.

[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.120]
All of my favorite fruits and blood stains on the liver.

[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:31.860]
Justice.

[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.940]
10.30 at 5.60 WQ-A-M, whatever it is.

[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.200]
It's October the 2nd.

[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.060]
Did I say October turn?

[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:37.740]
I'm sure I did.

[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.480]
And, of course, immediately I got to hate email from Brandon.

[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.620]
Not the regular Brandon.

[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.160]
Not that one.

[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.800]
Brandon LaFave, probably another phony name.

[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.820]
Send all the emails with all the phony names you want to be my guest.

[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.460]
Jolly Joe, Rolly, Jolly Joe, all those others.

[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.220]
Keep them coming.

[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.460]
The fake Roger Magglin, remember that yesterday?

[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.520]
Sure do.

[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.180]
So this Brandon LaFave, probably a frog with a phony name.

[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.020]
Hey, Neil.

[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.520]
First of all, it's October 2nd.

[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.500]
You've seen I Lowell Fool.

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.320]
By the way, I heard you talking about Freddie Mercury yesterday.

[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.960]
So he got the joke about Freddie Mercury, the sick joke, which I'm not going to read on here.

[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.700]
Keep up the mediocre show while the diabetes eats away.

[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.120]
You're already decrepit body.

[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.080]
Have a good one, Neil.

[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.340]
And I wrote back, I love you too, loser.

[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.120]
You're an idiot, Brandon, whoever you are.

[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.120]
But thanks for listening.

[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:27.940]
Yeah.

[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:28.780]
The decrepit design.

[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.400]
That's the thing that really cracks me up.

[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.500]
All the negative people.

[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.080]
They are there like clockwork when they wouldn't miss a second.

[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.460]
And just waiting for me to respond.

[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.580]
Or, nearly, I wouldn't read that.

[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.860]
But since we have such a dearth of stuff on here today.

[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.060]
Oh, for the new poll, let me get to the new poll.

[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.120]
It's already 10.32.

[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.880]
We've only got three hours and 20 minutes to kill.

[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.180]
56 votes on the new poll.

[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:49.980]
Not too shabby.

[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.740]
How about adding, engaging in buggery to the poll?

[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.780]
It isn't still illegal?

[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.140]
In a lot of states, yeah.

[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.060]
And I think Florida is one of them.

[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.140]
Florida is one of buggery.

[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:05.760]
Sure.

[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:06.920]
What it ought to be.

[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.140]
What it ought to be.

[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.620]
Well, anyway, the new poll is not including drug or alcohol offenses.

[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.800]
I break the law most often by blanks.

[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.820]
Speeding 27.

[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.100]
Downloading music or video illegally 10.

[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.380]
Not wearing a seatbelt.

[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.140]
I put that on there because when I'm in Florida, I don't wear a seatbelt.

[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.500]
Here, I wear one religiously.

[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.840]
Because the really pristikity about it here.

[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.800]
But when I'm in Florida, I never wear a seatbelt.

[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.220]
I refuse.

[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.200]
Now, why do you think that is?

[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.700]
I don't know.

[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:33.760]
I don't want to.

[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.580]
Right?

[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.920]
I hate seatbelts.

[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:36.760]
But here I don't mind.

[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.620]
I'm used to it by now.

[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.740]
I never break any law of 60.

[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.460]
I like the story.

[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.900]
Having sex in public three.

[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.740]
Not picking up dog poop three.

[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.040]
Running red lights one.

[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.240]
Littering one.

[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.320]
Carrying a weapon illegally none.

[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.080]
Smoking and non-smoking areas.

[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:50.720]
None.

[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.120]
Out of the first 61 vote.

[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.140]
On the brand new poll.

[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.080]
But from Bugsy.

[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.780]
Thanks, Bugsy.

[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.160]
68 votes now.

[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.140]
Speeding 28.

[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.000]
Michael says to add this one.

[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.520]
Tax evasion, but not me personally.

[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.260]
Of course he says.

[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:04.360]
Tax evasion.

[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.100]
Get that on there.

[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:05.700]
Pubby.

[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.060]
Whatever happened to tummy boots.

[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:08.660]
He's still dead?

[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:09.740]
Yeah.

[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.700]
I'll be damned.

[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.180]
Maybe his body got eaten away ravaged by a diabetes.

[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.300]
And then, anxious quizzling.

[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.320]
Did you see Jikka's blog post about footy?

[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.380]
Yeah, read it on the ear.

[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:21.800]
Unxious.

[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.400]
Get with it.

[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.900]
Talked about it at length.

[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.700]
Read a whole bunch of the comments off of there too.

[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.320]
Footy got canned at IOD.

[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.260]
Big deal.

[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.920]
Jimmy Crack corn too.

[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.460]
And he sends me an article about John L. Wai.

[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.000]
Why would anybody care about this?

[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.760]
Denver Broncos' Hall of Fame quarterback John L. Wai's engaged to a former Oakland Raiders cheerleader.

[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.980]
The Rocky Mountain News reported that the two-time Super Bowl winner proposed a 41-year-old

[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.140]
page green during a tip to Italy last week.

[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.320]
L. Wai told the newspaper was looking forward to a long life together with green.

[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:56.820]
The 48-year-old L. Wai was previously married to gendered L. Wai for 18 years.

[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:57.620]
They got four children.

[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.180]
L. Wai made green during a celebrity golf tournament three years ago.

[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.940]
And rumor has it that they're doing the old in and out, in and out, in and out.

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.640]
That's the rumor.

[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.280]
It could be wrong.

[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.200]
And Unxious starts out.

[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.000]
I thought you said John L. Wai was and I'm sure he's thinking like that.

[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.180]

[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.980]
But I never said that, nor did I ever imply that.

[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.920]
I said that the guy from UM, not from UM, but the big UM groupie,

[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.080]
gave me that line.

[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.820]
But oh, I want to go.

[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.560]
I'm going to Denver. I want to see this L-way kid.

[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.620]
Now, what kind of a person says that no matter how much of a jockstown for you might be?

[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.940]
No, head of a sexual male flies from Miami to Denver to see some kid play a college football.

[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.180]
That's back when he was in or no, wouldn't have been college.

[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.100]
It would have been the Broncos.

[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:41.800]
Well, whatever.

[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.240]
Am I right, Chris?

[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:44.920]
Correct.

[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.000]
That would be like saying, I'm going to go,

[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.440]
I'm going to go travel to South Bend to see Brady Quinn.

[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.540]
I want to see this kid play.

[00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.320]
Yeah, you want to play with this kid is what you're trying to say.

[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.600]
I should use the guy's name on the ear.

[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.040]
His first name was John, by the way.

[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.140]
I'm not going to use his last name.

[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.040]
It's a big UM groupie.

[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.700]
I find out a lot of those UM groupies were.

[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.540]
Yeah, Queens.

[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.360]
Michael also says maybe if they put the newspapers on the bedroom ceiling around her headboard,

[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.260]
meaning Sarah, she'd read more.

[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:19.540]
She seemed to have spent a lot of time on her bed, on her back, or maybe facing the headboard.

[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.680]
He also says the pull numbers for Obama looking very good, but it's still close enough to steal.

[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.740]
No, it really isn't.

[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.100]
Not right now.

[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.500]
He's winning Florida and even Virginia.

[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:38.400]
He's got 11 point lead in Virginia, which hasn't voted Democratic since LBJ in 1964.

[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.180]
Virginia.

[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.240]
Way ahead, Obama.

[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.420]
Way ahead.

[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.980]
In the battleground states, he's got a good lead in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 15 point lead.

[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.020]
What's not to like?

[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.500]
Here's another fake.

[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.060]
Fake email.

[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.000]
Niko, it's your buddy, Paul Castronova.

[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.940]
Ron and I were sitting here fingering each other in the studio wondering what the weather's like up there in Toronto.

[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.860]
Cole, sunny and cool, baby.

[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:03.920]
Love you, Paulie.

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.140]
P.S. Toast says.

[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:07.740]
Toast.

[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:07.740]

[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.140]
Is he back?

[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.060]
Is he on that show again?

[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.600]
He's over with, yeah.

[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:11.520]
Paul on.

[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.460]
Now let's see Toast, who am I confusing him with?

[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:17.960]
I don't know.

[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.080]
The other one named...

[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:19.480]
Omelette?

[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:20.460]
Omelette.

[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.040]
That's it.

[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.640]
Omelette.

[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.020]
Whatever happened to Omelette?

[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:23.540]
I don't know.

[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.300]
I always confuse him with breakfast burrito.

[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.060]
Oh.

[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.520]
I confuse him with I like food.

[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:32.940]
Yeah.

[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.040]
Omelette.

[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.160]
He kind of vanished, didn't he?

[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:37.820]
Yeah, the thing he did.

[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.300]
So Toast keeps reappearing.

[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.280]
After he screwed up the Kenny and Blow morning show, that could have been a great show like with different hosts and different material.

[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.380]
Other than that.

[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.000]
Other than that it was different stuff to do.

[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.680]
It was...

[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.300]
Kaka, man.

[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.300]
Crap.

[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.600]
Kenny and Blow morning show.

[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.160]
And these people are writing me stuff like this Brad, whatever his name was, Brandon Guy.

[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.420]
Oh, it's October.

[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.820]
Oh, you made a mistake.

[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.160]
You're like from the micro-ocean-thaw school if I have no life.

[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.040]
Oh, George sent me something.

[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:04.700]
Would you send me?

[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.280]
Picture.

[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.800]
I'm a picture of what?

[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.100]
Somebody sent me that.

[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.260]
So I'm sending it to you.

[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.080]
Oh, now I got to open up the attachment and all that stuff.

[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.700]
It should be right there.

[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.840]
You know, you just scrolled down to it.

[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.160]
There it is.

[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.920]
It's a serifice present for dummies.

[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.420]
That's cute.

[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:18.800]
I sent it to the website too.

[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.340]
Just in case you want to put it up there.

[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.200]
Yeah, get it on there.

[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:21.860]
Get it on.

[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.760]
You forgot an obvious one using Potter or other illegal drugs.

[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.420]
Well, I hate to break the news to you, Shirley.

[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.720]
The pulse is not including drugs or alcohol offenses.

[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.480]
I break the law most often by.

[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.560]
But thanks anyway, Shirley.

[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:34.860]
God.

[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.840]
Jesus, God.

[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.840]
You made a mistake.

[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.740]
You made a mistake.

[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.220]
That's the world, man.

[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.820]
Just looking to find your Achilles heel.

[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.580]
Or your Achilles.

[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.800]
Brackum-ass.

[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.740]
You made a mistake.

[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:50.920]
You left one out the pole.

[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:51.560]
So obvious.

[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.540]
We also left off I love food.

[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.020]
Do you want to put that on there?

[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.120]
We could put something else just as stupid.

[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.040]
Yeah, I won't come up with something later on.

[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.020]
I don't wear a hat.

[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.720]
I'm a Joe six pack.

[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.400]
There you go.

[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.800]
Seriously, when she starts talking to try to talk about Joe six pack,

[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.520]
I just, I want a cocka, man.

[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.780]
I just want to take a big dump right on my sofa.

[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:15.660]
God.

[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.020]
And Tommy T who's been listening to me since 77 at WNWS,

[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.900]
which is interesting because I didn't go to WNWS till 78.

[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.780]
But nevertheless, maybe Tommy is psychic.

[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.540]
Tommy T.

[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.920]
He says, is there any decent news shows anymore?

[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.820]
MSNBC, Obermann on and on with six packs, Sarah.

[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:36.900]
Obermann's great.

[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.720]
I watched him in his entirety last night.

[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.960]
And then what's your name, Kimon Rachel?

[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.100]
Maddo Dow.

[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.900]
Then after that, his illegitimate son, Rachel, Tommy says.

[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:45.920]
Enough already.

[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.580]
We all know with the exception of McCain that Sarah blows.

[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.540]
CNN, Pupra blows.

[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.540]
Luke can't get the leaf floor out of his ass.

[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.740]
And Mr. Blitzer is gone.

[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.300]
Maybe for good.

[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.560]
Mr. Blitzkrieg ain't gone.

[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.660]
He even worked on Russia's show at WNWS.

[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.560]
How do you like that?

[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.120]
Boy, talk about going to burn in hell.

[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.940]
Let's get this thing over with already says,

[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.980]
Tommy T. Go Obama.

[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.560]
Tommy, you need some medication.

[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:11.920]
Is what you need.

[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.400]
George can help you out.

[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.200]
Okay?

[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.180]
102 votes on the new poll.

[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.120]
Not too shabby there.

[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.080]
In fact, maybe we will change it and put a different one on

[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.980]
before the end of the show.

[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:22.420]
What do you think?

[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.600]
Oh, and George has got to come up with a poll for tomorrow.

[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.440]

You failed.

[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.460]
You got hit a bomb.

[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.060]
And took a hit then Woody.

[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.000]
I'd like to teach him some.

[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:09.760]
Absolutely.

[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.520]

No fun in heaven is your store.

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.460]
How come Cheetanne taxes is not a pull?

[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.320]
Didn't we all put her on there?

[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.160]
Come on, Fats.

[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.000]
I'll get with it.

[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.460]
So Brandon Lafayne, another phony name,

[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.220]
is just, he's gonna be one of these chronics, which is fine.

[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.080]
Keep him coming, Brandon.

[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.820]
It's a Kalei's tendon.

[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.640]
Not a Kalei's heel.

[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:44.980]
Wrong.

[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:52.980]
wrong. He's talking about apples. I'm talking about oranges. When you have a

[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.440]
weak spot, it's your Achilles heel. Correct. Your Achilles tendon. Correct. We have it.

[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.180]
Achilles like an injury. A jock injury. Okay. Just to prove your own

[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.180]
sonility, Neil, you really should settle down. You don't want to have a diabetic

[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:09.760]
episode. I heard Canadian EMS isn't that great. What is that EMS? Emergency

[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.340]
services. Emergency medical services. Whoa, he heard. Don't want to have a diabetic

[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.940]
episode. Oh, Neil's getting all rattled and upset. Yeah. We were talking about

[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.960]
that before the show today. Some of you people out there that's if we give a crap

[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.440]
about what you think about these stupid emails and can't calls. Oh yeah. That's

[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.220]
what my life is all about is these emails and the phone calls. It's a different

[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.840]
time that guy took writing that email that long as I might as well have been

[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.640]
shouting into a coffee can. Now which one you're talking about? The guy that's

[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.840]
sending the thing that's going to be helpful. Yeah. Congratulations to that

[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:44.320]
right wing loser by the way. You know my real last name. Congratulations. You're

[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.340]
not so much about Sarah Palin. She's not running. Yeah. She ought to be running.

[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.240]
She ought to be running right across the illusion islands. Hip, hip, hip, he

[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.040]
hopped. Maybe she could meet Joe six pack and the Vladimir Poon Tang on the

[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.280]
other side. Paul takes the time to send to me. You made a mistake. You made a

[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.740]
mistake, which I didn't make this mistake. I make a lot of mistakes. L.A. went to

[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:10.240]
Stanford. How did I say that this queen from UM was going to Denver? Yes. Yes.

[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.080]
And why was he going to Denver? Where did John L.A. play in the NFL? He's

[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.560]
in Denver Broncos. That's right. So he wasn't going to go see him play in

[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.980]
college. He was going to see him play in his like first year in the NFL or

[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:26.140]
whatever it was. You made a mistake. You made a mistake. You're having a diet

[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.440]
better. Campos. Yeah. The love. Feel the love. Can't you feel the love from

[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.460]
South Florida? And at idiot the last night with a long email. Oh pro.

[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.500]
Those proud to be yourself for it. Well, you know something you fit in like a

[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.960]
glove right in somebody. Oh my god. And wouldn't surprise me if that's where you

[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:47.300]
got your finger now in your own ass. God. Just keep him coming. Keep all the

[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:53.000]
hate speed one baby. Keep all the fake emails. It's great. Because the one good

[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.920]
thing about this, you can pick and choose. Oh, it's somebody else died. Also

[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:06.260]
did from my childhood TV commercial days says somebody Paul. Jan Miner,

[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:13.000]
Madge, Pomol of commercials. You're soaking in it. Oh, yeah, man. You're soaking

[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.940]
in it. That green mung. Nancy Walker, Rosie and the body commercials, the

[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:22.100]
quicker, thicker, upper Dick Wilson, Mr. Whipple, charming commercials. Please

[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:28.620]
don't squeeze the charm. Basically a bunch of busy bodies. Muah. That's you. It

[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:35.940]
says muah. Well, that was sweet. They're bullying you with kiss. Paul's

[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:40.700]
blowing me a kiss. Yes, he is. He loves you. Paulie. So this. Let's see.

[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.680]
Sit now. What is this? Links. I don't want links. Okay. Daisy Liam Myers,

[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.020]
in Miami Beach, send me a link. I don't want it. It's a video. It's a YouTube.

[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:54.100]
I don't want to go. I don't got time for it. Oh, here's a cute one. Somebody

[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.720]
standing in front of Wall Street with a big size jump. You efforts. That's cute.

[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.920]
Like that. The doubt by the way is down over 200 points. They are not impressed

[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.800]
the last night. They're waiting for the house tomorrow. If the house don't pass

[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.120]
it tomorrow is going to be a blood bath, baby. It's going to be I would run for the

[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.600]
hills. If I were you, if I were dumb enough to have money in stocks, which I

[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:22.360]
once upon a time did, and I will never do it again. Here's one from Mr. David

[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:27.140]
Adid, another fake from Howard David. I've listened to some of your show today.

[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.160]
You're continuing to make fun of me after Joe Bell and my lawyer have instructed

[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:37.520]
you not to. This is unacceptable. As you've heard by now, I'm suing you for

[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.160]
defecation of character. I don't want to sue you, Neil. I love you so much. And

[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.740]
you let me eat all of your pizza, but I feel that I must because I can't find a job

[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.480]
because of you. I'm willing to let this lawsuit slide. If you send me a check for

[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.160]
$100,000 within the next week, if you don't write this check within the next week,

[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.440]
then me and my hair piece will see you in court. Love Mr. David. Now see, that's

[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.560]
the kind of stuff. PS Guilty is very upset with you as well. You've

[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:08.200]
had you bastard. Good. And that's classic. That's a keeper. Right? Indeed it is.

[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.260]
It's good stuff. It's better than that the brand and LaFave or whatever's

[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.200]
naming. We're speaking of brand and more than hell is Brandon. Don't pop on

[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.840]
their brand. Maybe I got my aim closed. I don't know. Yeah. You need to improve

[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:24.880]
your aim. No. You got me confused with Peter North. Joey Pinto. Oh, Joey Pinto

[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.080]
Reynolds. Another fake email. I am that hemorrhoid with my nose up

[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.260]
Niels Aces. Well, let's see. Let me let me print this one out. It's fairly long.

[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.400]
It might be worth the reading. At least we didn't get anything from Bill Marshall

[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:43.520]
yet. Yet. And that's it. There's a link. I don't want links. If I wanted links,

[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:50.220]
I go get breakfast sausages. Okay. I get some sausages. Cannabis is less harmful

[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:57.980]
than drinking or smoking says a new report. A research charity today calls for a

[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.300]
serious rethinking of drug policy. This is in London. The Beckley Foundation

[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.600]
charity, which members, which number senior experts and other academics among

[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:11.040]
its advisors said banning cannabis has no impact on supply and turns users into

[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:18.660]
criminals like George. Criminal. Oh, yeah. Although cannabis can have a negative

[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.880]
impact on health, including mental health in terms of relative harms, it's

[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.420]
considerably less harmful than alcohol or tobacco says to report by the

[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.200]
Foundation's Global Cannabis Commission. The government is pressing for

[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.100]
cannabis to be reclassified in law as a class B drug compared with its current

[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:37.820]
less serious class C classification. The Brits, those silly as Brits, and that

[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.520]
Gordon Brown knows. Authorities are concerned notably by the growing prevalence

[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.540]
of the potent scum form of the drug. About 80% of cannabis seizures are of this

[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.640]
strain said to be linked to mental health problems official figures show.

[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:57.120]
Sculk. Give us smell. Sculk. Oh, the tongue. I bet. Just this morning. El Stinco. The

[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.400]
Beckley Foundation, a charitable trust claimed only two deaths worldwide have

[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.300]
been attributed to cannabis while alcohol and tobacco used together till

[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:09.040]
an estimated 150,000 people in Britain alone. Many of the harms associated with

[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.220]
cannabis use are the result of the prohibition itself, especially the

[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.700]
social harms arising from arrest and imprisonment it said. It's only through

[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.720]
a regulated market we can better protect young people from the ever more potent

[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.120]
forms of dope it added. The decision to be classified cannabis upwards into the

[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.800]
more punitive class B category which includes amphetamines as a U-turn for the

[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.900]
labor government. Cannabis was downgraded from class B when Tony Blair was

[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.260]
Prime Minister. But Gordon Brown announced to review of its status soon after

[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.180]
taking over in June last year. An earlier review of the cannabis

[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.560]
classification at the time of the last 2005 general election resulted in a

[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:52.620]
remaining class C C for cannabis S for skunk C for crap. How we doing on the new

[00:41:52.620 --> 00:42:02.740]
poll? Did you put the cheating on your taxes on there? Yes. 145. Look at that

[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:08.440]
Virginia Obama 53 McCain 44. Nine point lead in Virginia of all places

[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:13.740]
Virginia Redneck Heaven baby sure. Here's one that says dear Uncle Neil is

[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.860]
we needed more evidence of serious lack of intelligence and insight. This

[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.800]
wanted to share an excerpt of this article I noticed by Jonathan Kepart

[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.800]
regarding judge serious decision declaration and homosexuality is a choice.

[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.960]
Thanks Paul. Been there done that. Then we do that the other day. Yeah yesterday. Yep.

[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.660]
Oh my sexuality but she's got a good lady friend who's a dyke.

[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.640]
Joey Pinto Reynolds another fake email it says good morning Neil I was sitting

[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:50.540]
here having a circle jerk with Bill Marshall and Russ Oasis when I began

[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.500]
thinking about the late cockamoon lady was the cockamomelady the same woman who

[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.520]
left two classic voice mails in the early 90s ripping your show no the first

[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.460]
one went along to lines of big time ratings tell him to stick it up his ass he'll

[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.180]
always have them boy wish we had that drop and that was great remember that oh

[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.640]
yeah and the second one went along the lines of I didn't even have to tune in

[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.960]
heard this show yesterday same old belching same old farting come on you'll

[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.780]
give us a break that might have been that wasn't a cockamoon lady though she

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:21.860]
loved the show she wasn't some nasty old bitch that's right was this the same

[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.960]
person you still have the drops in the system I think this is a side by side

[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.320]
comparison of these drop-ins along with the cockamoon lady are in order right this

[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.460]
also reminds me do you still have the drop-in of the old w u f i f i u radio

[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.280]

like the calls we may have to take a whole bunch of calls today

[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.240]

Sarah palen may be bright

[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.400]
but she displays no intellectual curiosity

[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.540]
why is not a word she uses she cannot or does not connect the dots says Rick

[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.960]
she may be bright why would anybody assume that she's bright

[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.080]
because she can see a she can see Russia from her porch with her binoculars

[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.360]
because she thinks Vladimir Poon Tang flies over Alaska when he flies when he goes

[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.480]
to Washington New York

[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.980]
which he does not

[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:05.840]
she's bright

[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.880]
she just can't connect the dots

[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.000]
she's a moron

[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.300]
she's a simpleton she's a Yahoo trailer trash

[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.980]

[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.800]
i raced to the door

[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:13.660]
so you can take your quarter shlottas mister and stick him in your shlott

[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.280]
break them

[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.320]
don't stand up fast though because they'll all fall out real quick

[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.820]
like make green they used to be her problems used to make money but she'd stand up real quick

[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.940]
when all fall on the floor

[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.020]
roll down the hall that i was you

[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.940]
shouldn't have kept it there

[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.260]
well

[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.140]
you know

[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.320]
should get it in the order some hate

[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.400]
nobody knows what that you're talking about when you keep repeating that nonsense about hate and south Florida

[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.340]
well that's interesting because i took a poll that were a couple weeks ago

[00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.120]
and one of the things they hated the most was the hate in south Florida

[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.400]
so it's only me

[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:46.540]
i suspect that you're the only one who feels it considering you're probably one of the most despised people in south Florida

[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:49.540]
it's no wonder you're in self-imposed exile in shmitty toronto

[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.000]
or is that because you don't have the balls to sit in the same studio

[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.680]
is the people you regularly trash

[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.120]
of course your audience will regurgitate whatever crap you spew

[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.960]
as Gerbil said if you keep repeating something enough especially on tv or radio becomes true

[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:01.680]
no matter how preposterous

[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.380]
especially with your audience scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of intelligence

[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.400]
which includes whoever wrote this obviously

[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.480]
that's why he's always cracked me up

[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.920]
scraping the bottom of the barrel

[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.480]
but you can quote chapter inverse

[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.460]
chapter inverse and don't have the balls to sit in the same studio

[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.280]
this this sounds like Kimba Bo camper

[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.700]
although he's not articulate enough to write this

[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.400]
remember that

[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.480]
yep hiding behind your skirt up there in toronto

[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.200]

[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:59.260]
and it says from Douglas Castillo

[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.940]
that sounds like a really good British name doesn't it?

[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:02.260]
sure

[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.160]
Douglas Castillo

[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.320]
Castle Sun at hotmail.com

[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.940]
for anybody who wants to communicate

[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:15.160]
tell them to blow out his ass

[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:16.980]
the Brits

[01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.280]
we can't stand the Brits

[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.860]
anybody with a brain knows that the Brits

[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:20.840]
the Brits we had a fight

[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.780]
a damn war to get away from the Brits

[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.040]
and then of course

[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.220]
Las Malvinas I mean remember that business

[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.980]
they ain't what they used to be the Brits you know

[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.180]
yeah

[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.540]
after they butchered all those people in Inja

[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.060]
in South Africa and Australia

[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.720]
all over the world all around the world

[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.380]
butchered them

[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.920]
and of course left their great British cuisine behind too

[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.200]
let's see what John McKay this is another one

[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.400]
from Jim

[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.580]
John McKay and Sarah Pailin

[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.760]
I keep thinking of them as the two best comedy characters

[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:53.180]
from your show. Firstly there's the grumpy old man

[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.940]
who blows off his top a lot and is pretty condescending to everyone

[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.740]
then there's this young squeaky voice one who likes hockey

[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.040]
Mo Wengelis is Jim in England

[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.060]
Jim in England you believe that?

[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.440]
I believe that

[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.800]
well Jim's name is O'Sullivan so he could be in England

[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.080]
it's not Castillo

[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.360]
speaking of cheating on taxes

[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.380]
the IRS is probably going to come after you

[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.720]
you're legally required to self-report any gambling

[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.760]
we're winning worldwide about $1200

[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.480]
I'll doubt your document yesterday

[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.600]
now see I have to document gambling winnings above losing

[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.660]
see that that's what you declare tax on Schmuck

[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.960]
here's another know it all

[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.700]
or away from the rest of what is it any from the rest of the past years

[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.740]
oh yeah

[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:34.740]
sure

[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.700]
Nio, Shaq, this is Geldie

[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.940]
Fat Astrali, Raleigh Jo and Mohawar David

[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.780]
did to have informed me there's a lawsuit in the works against you

[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.440]
I'm going to join in on the lawsuit

[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.960]
you have ruined my career

[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.140]
damn you Nio you're going to die in a wheel of wicked death

[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.740]
I'm going to come to Toronto and steal Paco away from you

[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.740]
I'm a better lover than you could ever hope to be

[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.660]
I'm not well in doubt but I know the motion of the ocean

[01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:59.960]
maybe I could show you one day

[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.420]
please Nio I love you

[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.620]
sleep with me and fulfill my fantasies

[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.720]
sign I love you

[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.300]
Shaq, did he send the picture?

[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.140]
no

[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.400]
and then the bottom of just his Geldie

[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.020]
oh I see he's saying I love you Shaq

[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.220]
but it's signed Geldie

[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:15.700]
whatever

[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.800]
oh so lame so weak

[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.520]
weak

[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.540]
I mentioned I lost 20 grand at Woodbying yesterday

[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.920]
nope these people give me a sign at these experts

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.840]
oh what you have to declare what England is

[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.420]
yeah right

[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.060]
let me say it again there are no taxes on gambling winnings in this country

[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.940]
none zero Zippity Duda

[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.920]
unlike the USA

[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.340]
there are no taxes

[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.980]
worldwide, countrywide, continent wide

[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.420]
they don't exist no such thing

[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.780]
by the way I need to look on OLGC and see if somebody won the lot of last night

[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.120]
I want to I got 45 bucks

[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.340]
losing by the way not winnings

[01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:58.660]
they're losing

[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.360]
when you spend 200 on lottery tickets

[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.280]
you look at 45 the jackpot was 35 million last night

[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.460]
no taxes

[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.360]
okay let me go to OLGC's dot CA

[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.660]
and see if anybody won I forgot to check it I know I didn't

[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.540]
somebody won damn it is back to 4 million for Saturday

[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.380]
well that sucks

[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.580]
who the hell wants to allow Z4 million right

[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.340]
right and let's see how many winners there were here

[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.600]
let me click on the happy face

[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.440]
one winner 35 million

[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.200]
$363,719 no sense

[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.260]
one were and they write a check

[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.200]
no tax

[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.120]
35 million plus

[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.400]
that would solve a lot of problems you know it

[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.000]
you

[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.380]
not me though I didn't win it

[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.400]
you think I'd be here if I won 35 million no

[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:51.440]
of course then you'd have to declare a tax on it

[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.340]
nearly on the right blow out your ass get lost get a life

[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.340]
stick your nose and somebody else's ass

[01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.500]
it is normal for states to periodically review

[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.200]
list of voters and remove any who have moved

[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.920]
died or been convicted of felonies however with no national standards to control this

[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.400]
process it's become chaotic riddled with inaccuracies and vulnerable

[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.020]
to manipulation for partisan purposes those are the conclusions of a new

[01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.800]
report from the Brennan Center for Justice obtained by CBS news Brennan Center

[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.720]
executive director Michael Walman told CBS officials are making tons of errors

[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.320]
and it's all happening in secret without public accountability

[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.720]
boy what a novelty huh

[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.660]
WQI am hello

[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:33.360]
I'm your friend I'm working I'm your friend you're my buddy I'm glad you called me

[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:37.180]
I'm glad I called you I'm proud I've done bye everyone I'm fine I'm well

[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.160]
he packed a lot it's that call

[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.860]
oh let's go home now one problem that's previously been noted is that some voters

[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:49.200]
are being improperly removed from the roles because of clerical errors or small

[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.460]
mismatches and names or addresses it may not even find out to lay show up an

[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.080]
attempt to vote

[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.680]
however in addition to accident layers there's also a possibility of voter

[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.420]
purges being use selectively to target minorities or groups

[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:04.780]
for partisan purposes well what a shock that is we don't know all the problems

[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.560]
but we know that there's a huge potential for partisan mischief Walman said

[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:12.480]
although exact figures are difficult to obtain the report notes that one election

[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.380]
official Mississippi was recently found to have purged 10,000 voters from

[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.340]
our home computer another 21,000 voters have been purged in Louisiana

[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.600]
increasing the concerns another study cited by CBS has found that 19 states

[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.540]
are ignoring a federal law banning systematic purges within 90 days of a

[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.840]
federal election blogger Brad Friedman comments so CBS news is noticed

[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.800]
where the hell are all the Democrats and why aren't they raising hold a hill about

[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.740]
all this stuff everywhere in the meantime Republicans are out with phony reports

[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.920]
and lawsuits damn near every day and not just on Fox News declaring evidence of

[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.440]
completely non-existent voter fraud by Democrats in the meantime the Democrats

[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.460]
continue to bring a knife to the gun fight and as we've noted many times

[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.720]
the late seem to have no clue they're in a war on democracy and be waged by their

[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.560]
GOP opponents but a week for the move that about once

[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:01.840]
part of the course Democrats winp they like to winp winp winp out they winp

[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.800]
out can't wait for that debate tonight can you I think that's what everybody's

[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.620]
uh... in the suspended animation for the everybody just poised they're all

[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.620]
sitting back hold on their breath yeah like that

[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:17.880]
well here's one email they're coming at one of the time simple question how

[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.300]
or are you voting that's for the poll

[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.320]
is that a question for me or question for the audience clarify

[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.180]
i don't know what that means

[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.000]
we all know how i'm voting and by the way i got my absentee ballots already

[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.220]
it's already it's in the other room

[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.500]
how do you like that and i'm going to do is i'm going to like duplicate it

[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.760]
four five thousand times and send them all in this week

[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.360]
the best out of people with no rejects

[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.520]

[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.140]
and the sports leader

[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.360]
sports leader

[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.120]
like it thank you for attending today's conference on how to deal with the

[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.100]
why-to-care problem i would like to announce the development of a new

[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.240]
software system which will be year two thousand compliant

[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:07.700]
this program is known as millennia year applications software system or

[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:12.380]
my ass next monday there will be a meeting in which i will show my ass to

[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:16.340]
everyone we will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all

[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:20.000]
employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at my ass

[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.860]
we have not addressed networking aspects yet so currently only one person at a

[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:29.720]
time can use my ass this restriction will be removed after my ass expands

[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:35.520]
last week my secretary said to me i'm a little nervous i never put anything in my

[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:39.540]
ass before i helped her through the first time and afterwards she admitted

[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:43.320]
that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it

[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:49.180]
again and was even ready to kiss my ass as you begin using the program feel free

[01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:55.080]
to put anything you want in my ass as my ass grows larger we envision a time when

[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.080]
it will be commonplace for supervisor to hand work to an employee and say

[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:04.240]
here stick this in my ass it will be a great day when we need data quickly

[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.540]
and our employees can respond here it is i just pulled it out of my ass

[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.760]

the NFL labor situation

[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.920]
gene upshot in the current NFL season

[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.700]

currently he's president CEO of the

[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.900]
professional business and financial network

we would not be interested

[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:28.000]

[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.280]
they obviously have no concept of what the show is all about

[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.240]
any interest in interviewing Ryan McNeil in studio

[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:36.100]

[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.880]
what they got that alley felching in there with a headset on that i think

[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.300]

[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.820]
who've been hoarding their money like speedy a financial expert he's the maven

[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.760]

Not just a game. This thing is already over here on the scene and running reality. This live get away like this if a cow's okay. Alright

[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:18.820]
it's a disease. It's an obsession. It's a fetish to religion. Oh, it's way beyond that.

[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.100]
Let's see. We got a couple of a smattering of email. Not that's what we do today. A smattering

[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.360]
and splattering. Not too heavy duty. I'd have to actually take a couple more calls later on.

[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.940]
Ron says, high-neil, they're saying you should count how many times CERA will use the word

[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.000]
liberal tonight. If they're so conservative in spending, why do the Republican Party

[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.280]
spend $79 trillion of taxpayers money? They're about as conservative as the Republican

[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.880]
Commissioners were spending taxpayers money for a ballpark for the Marlins. The Marlins.

[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:56.660]
There's such tremendous interest in the Marlins as in none or next to none. I hear some

[01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:05.240]
email from CERA. Okay. Dear Mr. Rogers, I don't appreciate your constantly making fun of

[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.680]
me, the Republican Party, and our esteemed president. You are a bad, bad man. Do you

[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.040]
know that I'm a hockey mom from Alaska? Haven't you seen my lipstick? Let me tell you

[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.480]
something, fellow. I can see Russia from my front porch. Can you say that, fat man? I'm

[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.620]
a whole lot closer to a foreign country than you are there in Toronto. I can almost

[01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:25.960]
see Lake Ontario from my window, but not quite. I know stuff about a lot of things that

[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:31.760]
are important by present, presentive matters. I know how to balance a small toy budget

[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:36.420]
and how to coach Udsocker. Your radio show is a bad thing for our country. As the assistant

[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.500]
president, I'll make it my mission to get shows like years off the year. We will be

[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.860]
hiring Joyce's director of the FCC. In conclusion, remember, these are very important points.

[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:50.520]
Hockey mom, lipstick, Russia from my front yard, Alaska president, lipstick, knocked up

[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:54.600]
daughter, horror. I think I've said too much. Old man McCame will be mad at me and turn

[01:20:54.600 --> 01:21:00.140]
me over his knee again. For now, yours is advised, presidentia, Sarah Palin, aka, US

[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:07.980]
vice hockey mom. Sorry, Sarah, not bad. Sarah's pissed off at me. What do you get

[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:13.400]
to do? You made a mistake. You're old and you're dying of dying, baby. I don't know.

[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:19.540]
I feel pretty good today for all these people with their nasty projections that's just

[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:29.560]
wishful thinking. We hope you die, you old fag. Let's see. Here's one. What is this? This

[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:35.400]
long story here. Oh, people that send me all this long stuff. Stephen, no jersey. I'm

[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.760]
just going to print out the selection like George always taught me to do print selection.

[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:47.780]
Right print. I do that all these all the emails. It's printing sounds. Neil, these people

[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:51.060]
are total morons. I'm pretty sure that the window sounds they're hearing are coming

[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:55.040]
from a promotional spot for the station. I can't listen to rest really so I can't confirm.

[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.660]
Yep, we do have buzz at least one, maybe two spots that have those sound effects.

[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:03.680]
It seems that the only time you hear those sounds are when you're playing that one certain

[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.120]
spot, I think it has something to do with picking football games against Danny Boy. I tend

[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.920]
to zone out when I don't hear your voice. So I can't be too sure. What the hell is wrong

[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:16.200]
with these people says Paul from Tampa and says, I hope I'm not becoming too chronic.

[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.420]
No, we need your help today. Paul, there's nothing on there now. There's not a one. Neil

[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:25.500]
Roger's dot com very weak Thursday, man. Very weak and that's because they're all

[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.720]
pent up with this damn debate nine hours, 10 minutes and eight seconds before the debate.

[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:34.680]
They're counting down on CNN. They're counting it down and look at that big blow there on

[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:38.220]
a west coast of the state. Pick up, but the heaviest snowfall we're looking back is actually

[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.340]
going to be into the Rocky Mountains. Oh, that's on a west coast of the country. I thought

[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:51.020]
there was a Florida. It's talking about snowfall snowfall in Tampa. Oh, oh, God. What's the

[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.740]
use? You know what? What's the use? I think I'm going home.

[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.640]
Steve Jersey says also a fan of overman, although we often stumbles over his own words trying

[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.380]
to get them out. No, I don't think he does. I think he's very articulate and I think considering

[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:08.900]
the tremendous amount of verbiage on that show, he does a damn good job as opposed to Rachel,

[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:12.380]
who stumbles and bubbles over everything she says. She fumps.

[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.620]
And the dike they forced on us after we show his unwatchable, so Steve, that's correct.

[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.960]
Don't miss the phone calls. Frankly, yours is the only voice most of us tune into here.

[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.100]
Well, God, I can't see you.

[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:31.400]
Anyway, just returned in New Jersey after we can West Palm. I realized the difference between

[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.360]
here and there is that Schmidt heads here know that they're such and the ones in Florida

[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.080]
don't even realize they are a more clueless society I've never seen. As I learned from living

[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:45.540]
there in the 90s, the culture and the root system are the same. An inch deep and a mile wide and

[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:51.020]
falls over easily in a breeze. Not sure if you saw the below. Priceless. Keep up the great

[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:54.860]
radio. Thank you, Steve. In Jersey, he's got an article here about a St. Lucie firefighter who

[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:59.840]
moved a man severed lower leg from a vehicle crash site. He resigned. He removed his severed leg.

[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:05.460]
Not a good idea. I'd like to like when I beat up that homeless guy and he stole his wheelchair.

[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:14.200]
That was not good. David says, I have listened to you for years in spite of your continuous and

[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.280]
relentless Republican bashing. I actually found it quite amusing that someone could spend so much

[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:22.900]
time and energy bashing Republicans not to mention religion day after day after day after day. Well,

[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:28.060]
guess what? You finally done it. Yes, you have opened my eyes and finally got it through my thick

[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.060]
skull. You've provided the cure to my political party herpes, which has been growing and oozing

[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:37.340]
for years. I can't wait to change party affiliation and wipe my hands of this deception. I will

[01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:41.000]
be voting for Obama regardless of my father rolling over in his grave. Neil, you are God,

[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:45.640]
forever grateful. Keep up the good work, David. By the way, last time oil was 95 dollars a

[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:50.400]
barrel. Do you know how much gas was? Certainly not what it is now. By the way, too, your email

[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:58.600]
address on the WQM side doesn't work. What are you chartling about? We've been talking about that

[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:07.000]
for years and we don't have WQM emails. What I would turtle about is why do we need to worry about

[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.140]
whether any other one works when we got Neil at NeilRodgers.com and that's all you need to know and I

[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:16.180]
just got that email right there. We don't need the QM website. Oh, by the way, I think this weekend

[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:23.180]
I might send that check to courtess. Okay. And for the smart ass out there who's all whipped up

[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:26.460]
about, oh, you didn't pay any taxes on the money you want to would buy. Let me ask you this.

[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:32.600]
Prove it. See, there's no record like in Vegas or any American casino like, you know, if you

[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:38.360]
win over, I think it's $1,200 on a $2 bet, they bring a form that you fill out, which I haven't

[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.620]
filled those out too many times in Vegas or Atlantic City or any place else a couple times.

[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:47.660]
And they bring the tax form and you fill it out and they have a record of you winning the money.

[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:54.620]
But when they come and pay you cash and there's no record of it, prove it. Maybe I won $80 billion

[01:25:54.620 --> 01:26:00.840]
it would buy, huh? More likely I lost $80 billion, but maybe I did. Maybe I do. None of your business.

[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:09.180]
Maybe I do. 284 votes on a pool. Let's see if there's any more emails or a couple. Andy Calb.

[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:15.860]
Oh, this is this is hysterical. This is some funny stuff. Let me print it out.

[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.860]
Andy Calb. I got even with him when I brought Tiny in the studio that day and Andy stepped in

[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:27.120]
Tiny's little pile. That was funny. That was very, very, very funny. And then Disney got all

[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.840]
upset. Oh, how come he's bringing his dog into the station? Remember, what a what a hole you are

[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.200]
Disney? God. Humor that that's what happens when you drink that much. Your nose gets red and you

[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:43.460]
get a really sour attitude about life. The math on Paul McCartney and Heather Mills divorce somebody

[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:52.620]
sends me no interest. Sorry, whoever sent that. Sorry. WKNR. Let's say Ron sends me a thing. It's

[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:58.260]
the logo from Keener 13. I hear you mentioned WKNR every now and then grew up listening to Keener

[01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:02.900]
myself. I thought you might like to peruse the above website. Still listening to Michigan says Ron.

[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:09.460]
Thanks, Ron. Keener 13.com. I'm going to look that up. I bet you they got Jay Michael Wilson and

[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:14.680]
Rodney the Rodin and all that good stuff on there and Dick Burton. Remember, we used to get those

[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:21.660]
calls from Dick. Sure. Andy Calb allegedly says just wanted to let you know Chuck Meyer will be

[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:26.340]
available for phone interviews beginning noon today. He'll be granting 15 minute on air blocks.

[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:30.800]
I thought of this you first when this very important matter came to light. Next week we hope we

[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:35.720]
hope to get avail from Tom Hopkins and Kevin Courtney Jennifer Rem is whipping Dick Cheney in the

[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.320]
dungeon. It will be unavailable till further notice. Andy Calb who's still wiping off his shoe.

[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:46.940]
Just a lick of the best talent. He don't give me no projects. Sport radio 560 QAM.

[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:58.120]
The fourth leader. The biggest news. The biggest news. You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.

[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:08.480]
This is Coach Dineshuler and I sound like Bob Hope on acid. And I want to tell you it's the 12-1 hour or whatever it is.

[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:16.340]
Today on TMZ workers filed out of Lehman Brothers with a history of their careers in their arms.

[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.580]
The investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Sarah Palin banking firms are going bankrupt.

[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.180]
Houses are going into foreclosure. If you are in the White House, what would you do to get the

[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:30.540]
economy back on its feet? Do things better. Okay, that's good.

[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:38.340]
Could you be more specific? We must do whatever it takes. More specific? We have got to have all

[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:44.720]
options out there on the table. And what are those options? Whatever it takes. What? There have been

[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:49.800]
mistakes made. Right. There have been flenders along the way. And what would you do differently?

[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:56.720]
We must do whatever. Oh please. Okay, I'll ask you a really simple question. Is Russia close to

[01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:00.980]
Alaska? Yes. You can actually see Russia here in Alaska.

[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:06.440]
All right. I was busy throwing Schmidt-Kan in some stuff. Okay.

[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:09.560]
Okay. Good. Not the kind of papers you're thinking about.

[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.520]
Oh, and I'll tell you there's another one. It's an ad-packs.

[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.160]
Microsoft says, I'm going to have to go do a choice. Really?

[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.780]
When you screwed up my whole not you, but I mean that place screwed up my whole schedule.

[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.800]
The morning? Yeah. My bodily. It'll do that. It sounds like a lawsuit to me.

[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:30.700]
What? It'll do that. Well, no, I was in there shaving this morning. And of course, the first thing I do

[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:36.300]
when I get up every morning about 10 after 8 is I come in here and I turn on the lights and all

[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:40.200]
the stuff. And then I turn the TV on and I open up the pots so you can hear the audio like

[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:45.600]
I said presidential. Okay. Like that. Oh, hopefully not Tony Harris. And I'm standing at the in

[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:51.960]
the bathroom shaving with a with a face full of edge. Although I should have been using body wash.

[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:55.480]
I'm almost out of body wash. I think after woodbinder, I'm going to go get some body wash.

[01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:04.500]
I'm almost out. Yeah. Anyway, so my blackberry buzzes and it's a message from you.

[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.240]
Right. Saying, are you feeding any making any noise up there? I should have said, yeah,

[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.400]
I make a lot of noise. You ought to hear it. No, I said yes as usual.

[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:18.040]
The TV audio was being fed down to you. And of course, that began all that technical.

[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:22.760]
So naturally I got to brush my teeth and finish shaving real quick and jumping a shower.

[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.360]
I didn't get a chance to do my morning choice.

[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:32.600]
Well, I'm somebody who's like pretty damn regular every morning like clockwork. Sure. Orange.

[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.700]
I remember I had a doctor, Dr. Joe Rock in Rochester. Doctors used to make house calls

[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:45.960]
those days. And as a kid, you know, I had all the childhood ailments, you know. And he had,

[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.280]
doctors would be like like a big black case, you know, with all the pills in it.

[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.280]
Do you know what I'm saying? Right. The doctor bag. I had a friend who had one of those

[01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:00.560]
to take the parties. This is part of the deal. Rock. Can you believe I remember that? God,

[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:08.980]
what a memory for crap. Three page ad facts, web design essentials. You bastards. God,

[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:12.680]
you ought to rot and hell. You people sending ad facts is especially here.

[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:19.240]
So anyway, he, one time, once upon a time, I forget what I had, what my ailment was. He gave

[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:28.520]
me some pills, some antibiotics to take. And they made my, my waste material purple. Okay.

[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:34.240]
My feces, purple feces. I've heard of purple haze, but this is ridiculous. Look,

[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:39.120]
Rich will make it green. Oh, geez. In fact, a bit small, make it black, right? Black.

[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:46.220]
Oh my God. Maggie says you are too funny. I had to tell you, I listen to sports talk as often

[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:50.860]
as listen to your show and being a huge dolphin fan. I am. I name my new kitten Ricky. Have a great

[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:54.560]
day. Love your show. Thanks, Maggie. Ricky, Ricky, Ricky. I wonder if her cat's going to be

[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:59.100]
smoking the big fat one or have the urge at least anyway. Seriously, the fact that that was a

[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:04.240]
news story in a Sunsental and a Hero yesterday, that should warn everybody out there that the

[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.680]
final days might become and maybe Sarah's got a point because there's one thing we all know.

[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:11.320]
The media is sick and they help badly. By the way, she's still dead. Tammy,

[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:14.160]
what's Larry going to do now? Oh, sorry. Wait.

[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:19.180]
Jeff and Lottordale by the sea has got a nice, nice short,

[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:26.060]
asked, oh, so anyway, let me before I get to his email. Somebody sent me a thing,

[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:30.120]
overweight diners have it's a Chinese buffet. They're revealing. And the look kind of interesting.

[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:34.540]
There's a whole article here. And I was going to highlight it, but it was going to take too much

[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:39.460]
effort, you know, highlight and select and print. So I just figured, well, let me just try

[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:44.080]
printing out the whole page. Not only did it print out the whole page, but without any of the

[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:48.640]
chop-offs in the right hand column that I get when I do select and print. Okay. How do you like that,

[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:54.380]
Mr. Smarty? Hands. Very proud of you. Isn't that great? Well, did you know that?

[01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:00.060]
Maybe. No, you did not. You're the one that's always given me, oh, select and print, select,

[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.480]
which I do agree with you sometime that that's necessary when you only want to print out certain

[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:09.320]
crap. What I discovered, now I'm not sure if this is going to work on all the emails, but I'm

[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:14.580]
going to try to, from now on, and it saves an extra step too. Give it a shot. What? I said, give it a

[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:19.080]
shot. Boy, this next break may come up a little early, Chris, you'll know I'm making a wild run.

[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.640]
All right. You're going to give it a shot. Not as fast as the run I made to the New York City when

[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:28.120]
I won the $80 billion it would buy. You better declare those taxes, Mr. You're going to go, yeah,

[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:33.060]
right. Go to hell. Jeff in a lot of day about the season 18-year-lister just checking in. Love the

[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:37.900]
show, be it emailers or callers, ditch mitts, callers. Keep up the good work and don't retire. Thanks

[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:44.800]
of piles, Jeff. Lot of day about the season. Don't say thanks of pile. Oh boy. No, you know how that's

[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:51.480]
that mind body game. Yeah. Mind body connection. Like when you're like going to explode and then this

[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:55.400]
is what generally happens to me, those four or five times in my life when I've had accidents in my

[01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:00.580]
pantaloonies. Mm-hmm. We could witness what right now. What? We could be witness to one of those

[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:05.740]
famous accidents right now. Your witness? Mm-hmm. How about... Rackdom. Ask witness.

[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.480]
300-300-3 votes on the pool. I'll get to the overweight diners habits. I don't want to read that one

[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:17.400]
right now because it might stimulate my innerds. No, you the whole dealer screwed up my day.

[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.680]
Oh look at this. Here's a few emails. That's good. The punchline on the St. Lucy stories that the

[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:27.060]
firefighter who stole the leg trains could dab or searching dogs. She apparently wanted fresher meat

[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:32.780]
than the more it could supply. After the leg was missing a week, could not be reattached. The leg

[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.900]
owner is understandably pissed off. Yeah, after was missing for a week, they couldn't stick it back on

[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:46.780]
her again. What a crazy bitch stealing somebody's leg. Right? That's right. What a slut.

[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.640]
And here let me let me just try printing this thing out. I don't really need to. I could read it off

[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:56.020]
the screen. But this is just a test. This is a test of the emergency faxing system.

[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:05.940]
John from Sarasota. Oh how about those make-believes, huh? How about the Kujo? He thinks he couldn't stop a

[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:14.940]
bowling ball from 10 feet away. He couldn't stop a... What do they call those things? What? Those things?

[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:21.380]
Juggernauts? He couldn't stop nutting. Kujo. He's a hundred years old. Nice go on make-believes. You guys suck.

[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.920]
Anyway, look at this. The right hand still chopped off.

[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:32.820]
John from Sarasota. Long time listener. Way back to the WSU end days. How sad. I think Rachel

[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:37.820]
Maddo isn't that bad. Now see, here's how it works, John. I don't think she's that bad. Not I think

[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:44.540]
she isn't that bad. At least compared to Morning Blue, I mean Joe on the MSNBC. Yeah, Morning Joe. He

[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:50.420]
obnoxious, pasty-faced Irishman right wing pretending to be more moderate than he really is. When push

[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:56.500]
comes to show or the fascist news network, pick any show on Network John says. Think to the best

[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:09.160]
bits on the show are this is Eddie Guy and party. Oh. Now that's under party. Yeah, it says just

[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:12.760]
played the endless loop with generous portions of the Buffalo Bill and Moe Howard throwing. Have a great

[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:17.920]
life says John look out for the Bruins this year. Yeah, look out for him is right. Bruins suck

[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:25.180]
and the Leafs. Oh my god, they are so bad. Tragic. Gonna be a long year in Toronto. People are

[01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.320]
going to be jumping off tall buildings. Let's see if the game is on again from last night.

[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:32.360]
Getting the playoffs. It's really giving him a chance to win. Oh, there this will be for the

[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.420]
read all his energy. Remember they had won the cup the year before. Yeah, cup this. Okay, so that's

[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:43.480]
John from Sarasota. We got his crap blank Sarah Palin book getting sales spike with upcoming

[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:48.180]
debate. The complete book of the collected wisdom of Sarah Palin. It's just the empty pages.

[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:52.280]
Interview request. Russell Blackstone. Here's a phone number. You want to call Russell? Will

[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.660]
interview him? No. Just a bunch of empty pages. Nice scam. Moron, you know that all Americans are

[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:01.500]
required to pay taxes in all worldwide and come gambling or otherwise just because you think you

[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:05.860]
can get away with it. Doesn't make it legal. I hope they arrest your ass at YYZ and you disappeared

[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:10.820]
to Guantanamo. No record of anyone by the name of Neil Rogers. We never arrested anyone by that name.

[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:20.820]
Prove it. Cute. Oh, I'm shaking in my boot. Das boot. Oreo cookies also make it black.

[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:29.080]
But there's nothing like the great daily birth. Daily birth.

[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.280]
I don't know what that means. I don't want to know what that means before. Somebody talking

[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:40.700]
about taking a dump. Daily birth. If that just got born, what I dropped in the bowl then oh, kill it.

[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:50.140]
Kill it. Oh, here's one from Chris. Really? Well, it's the fake Chris. Please do not go on

[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:54.440]
here with this. Please stop calling me fat. You are ruining myself as demon. I wake up every morning

[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.500]
scared to come to the station. I know that I'm a fat type of fat, but I can't help it. I get so

[01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:04.880]
excited when I pass by the pizzeria ice cream parlour, sizzler, etc. I really enjoy working on a

[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.800]
show. I feel that I can't continue unless the ridicule stops. Please Neil, I'm sorry that I'm

[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.060]
a fat slab of a man. I also have a small penis. Please Neil, help me get better and stop making fun of

[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:25.340]
me. Thanks Chris. Okay. Oh, it's the fake fat Chris, not to be confused with. Let's see. Adam says,

[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:29.900]
I just don't get it. The Leafs haven't done Schmidt in 40 years and yet there are silly people,

[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:34.260]
not after night willing to pay insane amounts of money for a Schmitty product. I don't understand

[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:38.100]
whether they can't have three, four or five teams in Toronto, I'll on New York. You can't tell me

[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:41.360]
there are more hockey fans in a place like New York than in Toronto and surrounding areas.

[01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:50.280]
IMO, what does that mean? IMO in my opinion. Oh, see I'm learning every day. Toronto hockey fans

[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.160]
ought to be pissed off and fired up yet year after year they put up with the same old volstment. IMO,

[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.320]
if investors Canadian ones especially love hockey so much and it's supposedly our national game.

[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:02.060]
Why haven't people like Rogers or Gretzky said, okay enough is enough we're gonna have three or

[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:05.960]
four teams with an hour or two of Toronto increasing profits and driving ticket prices down.

[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:10.580]
Anyone who explain this to me, I hate being in Toronto. I love Unials as Adam. Oh yeah,

[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:19.020]
likely story. See if the Picklebeer Adam, not the Pickle Patch. Now that's where Sarah hangs

[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:23.720]
up in the Pickle Patch. I'm gonna go to Los Angeles. Chris.

[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.360]
This is Neil Rogers. George.

[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.960]
Neil 560 QAM. The fourth leader.

[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.180]
The biggest names. The best talent. It's the mad dog.

[01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:36.380]
You have to manage. Afternoon. Sport a seven.

[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:40.520]
The sports radio. 560 QAM. The sports leader.

[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:45.560]
Holy mackerel. This is Joe Bowen the voice of the Toronto May beliefs and you're listening

[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.860]
to the hockey authority Neil God.

[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:54.860]
I'm dying on the hands.

[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:02.360]
Clay is gay. No one was shot. He said he goes that way.

[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:11.920]
But now it's official that Mr. Aiken prefers the bacon on his buffet.

[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:21.840]
Clay is gay. It's not a big surprise we have to say.

[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:31.360]
Hopefully now that these out, he can relax about his back wax. It's the cliche.

[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.280]
No body really gives us glass.

[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:44.160]
Cause we knew we before spam a lot.

[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:50.160]
I'm so glad he finally came clean.

[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.200]
Cause he's known since 1813. Play his gay.

[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:01.220]
He's taking off his head a road to pay.

[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:11.320]
When he took the stage on idle, we all knew that in season two it wasn't gray.

[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:20.820]
Clay is gay. Now he can join a bathhouse in the bay.

[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:30.540]
There's no more worry about hiding his life or lack of a wife and that's okay.

[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:40.420]
All of his stress is behind him. Replace fire.

[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:49.220]
Head some guy near cheer. Now they can walk the streets hand in hand.

[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:54.880]
Or even join a boy band. Clay is gay.

[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:56.160]
You're fair.

[01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.900]
Hit it. Pull it.

[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.060]
Yes. Clay is gay.

[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.880]
Come 17 at 560 WQAM.

[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.640]
Here's another email from Chris.

[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.880]
Now listen, these could be from him.

[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:14.420]
That's right. I see him over there typing.

[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.780]
Is he tapping and typing?

[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:16.480]
Feverishly.

[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.540]
I think it's the something international.

[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.400]
The big race Saturday.

[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:20.800]
It would buy.

[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:22.060]
Maybe that's why the hopper is going to be here.

[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.920]
Some big international race.

[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.160]
Maybe a Frankie Detroit will be here.

[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:29.960]
It would buy.

[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:32.680]
I know Justin's style will be there.

[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:33.160]
Hey Justin.

[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.460]
Oh sorry.

[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.740]
Fat Chris says, why did you go on here with it?

[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:38.320]
I'm so embarrassed.

[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:39.000]
I hate you.

[01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:39.380]
Die.

[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:40.360]
Love factors.

[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.180]
That's pretty good.

[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.040]
You've got his voice down.

[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.600]
Now here's here's the email address.

[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:53.960]
Chris dot waelin dot wqam at gmail.com.

[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:56.440]
Oh okay.

[01:42:57.340 --> 01:42:58.520]
That's your new email address.

[01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:58.900]
Okay.

[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.640]
Oh we're going to be great.

[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:02.200]
These are great.

[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:03.520]
Just make a bunch of crap up.

[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:03.780]
Sure.

[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:04.840]
I'm going to start doing that.

[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:05.520]
Fox noise.

[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:06.720]
It's good enough for us.

[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:11.280]
Neil did you talk about the fact that the S-bag

[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.560]
Republicans including Lauren S.

[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.220]
Lambert crying over when I full being picked as moderator for the debate?

[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.460]
No I didn't rob in modern day because it's not even worth.

[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.020]
I wouldn't even waste my time.

[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.100]
My co-operman said last night her book in July.

[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.320]
The book came out about blacks and politics.

[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:28.720]
So it's no great news bulletin but they're just grasping desperately

[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.820]
for something new.

[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:30.520]
Oh geez.

[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.120]
They're results of bias.

[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.660]
They're going to be picking on Sarah.

[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:35.220]
Like that moron there.

[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:37.080]
Robyn why stop picking on Sarah.

[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:37.660]
Remember that idiot?

[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:38.320]
Uh huh.

[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.040]
Edward Schmecken who's still listening by the way.

[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:42.800]
Every now and then he'll get all whipped up and get a bunch of anger

[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.200]
whipped up in his ass and send me another one of those

[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:45.720]
caustic.

[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.040]
Oh you've got to retire.

[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.640]
Let's let the oh here we go.

[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:49.500]
Maybe this is him.

[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:52.960]
I've listened since before Zeta the show is very stale.

[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.000]
You just go through the motions.

[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:55.520]
There's no energy left in you.

[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:56.300]
George's boring.

[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:58.040]
Your low numbers reflect this.

[01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.160]
Your politics are offensive.

[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.280]
You don't care anymore.

[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:02.040]
The beastly should pay you a lot less.

[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.060]
Oh no worry they will.

[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.580]
George should pay them to work there but have a nice day.

[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.740]
You were the great one once upon a time.

[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:08.500]
So was I.

[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:09.460]
I retired.

[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:10.800]
Maybe it's time for you to go too.

[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:12.320]
Says Julie.

[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.820]
Blow it out your ass Julie.

[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.900]
And she's still listening though obviously.

[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:22.440]
Oh and I hear you now let me let me print this one out.

[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.720]
I'm going to do the same thing I did before without highlighting.

[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:25.980]
It takes too much extra time.

[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.200]
It's your fault.

[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:27.780]
I know.

[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:29.520]
Just like that thing this morning.

[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:31.760]
Oh so anyway during the break I went in there and I tried.

[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:32.900]
No luck.

[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:33.920]
Oh no.

[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:35.460]
Mind over splatter.

[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.580]
Well I don't think I needed to.

[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:38.220]
Right.

[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.300]
Was it just a fart?

[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:41.700]
Not even that.

[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:42.340]
Wow.

[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.700]
How disappointing.

[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:50.220]
Okay let me there are a couple of these and today they're all like

[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.020]
combative 99% of them are like combative and like that which is good.

[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.880]
We don't need a whole bunch of ass looking although one at once in a while

[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.420]
and ass looking emails okay you know like liquid liquid liquid.

[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:05.380]
Riki Riki Riki Liki Liki Liki like let's do this one.

[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:10.360]
I heard you criticize in the herald and sun sentinel for publishing the story about Riki.

[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.440]
I agree that both papers are rags but I disagree with this particular criticism.

[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:24.460]
Even in the no I'm looking at a picture on here there's a picture on a side note

[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:27.720]
of you've seen the new photo of Barry Jackson in the updated herald website that's not

[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:28.560]
Barry Jackass.

[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.540]
But anyway.

[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:36.360]
Even in the midst of the offseason after the worst season in dolphin's history every dolphin

[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.980]
story on the herald sun sentinel and Palm Beach post shoot up to the most red stories on the

[01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:44.200]
paper's website no matter what or when they write about the dolphins the story instantly

[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.740]
shoots up to the most popular list the public clearly cannot get enough dolphins coverage.

[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.700]
They're giving the public what they want by covering even the smallest dolphins minutia.

[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.920]
Oh god give me a break.

[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.320]
Riki had a urge he he was tempted.

[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.880]
He was tempted.

[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.520]
That's a news story.

[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.400]
See see that's the public for you.

[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.340]
Here's Pat or Dan or whatever's name is he says hey guys why you busted my balls on

[01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:13.260]
our first and constructive suggestions about the show.

[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:13.840]
Oi.

[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:14.500]
Oi.

[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:18.180]
Yeah yeah I know hate is great and it pays the bills a started listening to you when I moved

[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:21.520]
to coconut creek back in 96 on i.o.d still enjoy listening to your show.

[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:25.300]
Don't let up on that phony cake makeup we're in two faceline arrogant back to the McCain

[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:28.720]
his choice for pale and for VP just goes to share what empty sooty really is.

[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.520]
I like Obama since he represents change but there's mess we live and won't really change

[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.860]
anytime soon we need to start now carry on Neil you're the best Neil God and then it says

[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:39.760]
Dan five I don't know I don't know what that means.

[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.840]
Like we're supposed to know what he's talking about.

[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:48.560]
Dan five oh Dan oh I don't know I don't know what he's even like the world we guess is out of here.

[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:50.100]
What that's it what?

[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:51.620]
Say what?

[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:52.560]
What?

[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.240]
Must be something from yesterday if he thinks you remember yesterday.

[01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:56.620]
Well there's nothing in there now.

[01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:00.580]
Neil at nearodgers.com it's been pretty spotty on emails today very disappointing.

[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.620]
I think I'm going to take tomorrow off just as a protest

[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.100]
and that bitch that sent me that hostel.

[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:11.260]
Oh your show is a shadow what it used to be in your dog is mailing it in and just going

[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:12.660]
through the motions and George blows.

[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:16.680]
Why are you listening bitch that's my question okay I don't want to be silly.

[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:18.560]
I don't want to be hostile.

[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:23.920]
Why are you listening bitch that's my question right?

[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.660]
Right it's like a dog barking at the moon.

[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:29.280]
Guess what the moon ain't going anywhere and neither are we we're going to be here another

[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:31.160]
five and a half year five and a third years.

[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.800]
The good lord Willem as Jerry Wisson used to say now he's dead.

[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:37.300]
I guess the good lord wasn't so willing.

[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.620]
Peter says Peter from Boka.

[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.700]
Have you ever wondered what the influence of the pharmaceutical industry is playing

[01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:44.620]
in the mindset of the public.

[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.960]
More and more Americans today are taking drugs like Zola, Prozac and Zanax.

[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:54.220]
These drugs along with similar other over prescribed mind numbing scripts have turned most

[01:47:54.220 --> 01:47:55.460]
voters into vegetables.

[01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:58.600]
That can be the only explanation is to why people in general just aren't reacting

[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.440]
to the state of current affairs with any fear or concern.

[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.540]
This is one of the scariest times I've lived through.

[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:04.640]
The economy is critical.

[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.520]
The warlingers, the press aggastas through the roof,

[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.920]
McCain and Palin are actually considered viable candidates.

[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.500]
And the possibility of severe meltdowns in healthcare and social security are looming.

[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.220]
These are trouble times indeed and the public just doesn't seem that concerned.

[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:17.920]
How is this possible?

[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.640]
The only explanation that makes sense is that most people are dopes.

[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:22.440]
I mean doped up.

[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.880]
I remember hearing a news report a few years ago about the British government

[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:26.980]
conducting an experiment.

[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:30.380]
They actually put drugs like Prozac and the public drinking water supply.

[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.920]
I'm going to sneeze in a second.

[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:43.240]
I really think that this report was very telling.

[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.800]
When government seriously thinks they can influence the public state of mind with policy like this,

[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:47.920]
what does the future hold?

[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:48.800]
Death.

[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:50.240]
The Bush.

[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:52.700]
The Bush.

[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:53.260]
Yes.

[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:54.360]
The Bush.

[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.800]
This covertly America does this on the British.

[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.680]
Do this covertly America does it openly.

[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.460]
Every night, farmers and companies promote these drugs and the benefits they provide.

[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.600]
The results are the same.

[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:07.560]
A population of doped up monkeys that have no decision capacity at all.

[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.900]
This explains why sealant elections is safe,

[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:13.680]
along with all the other insane policies that just skate by the public with zero outcry.

[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.020]
How about the 4,000 dead American soldiers and a war based on lies?

[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.340]
Based on lies?

[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.120]
The weapons of mass destruction.

[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:24.700]
Oh, Saddam was in there with, he was taking showers with the bin Laden.

[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:25.660]
All lies.

[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.680]
And nobody cares.

[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.700]
Maybe this will help explain why most people react like dopeds.

[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:33.180]
They are dopeds, all doped up.

[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.540]
Love you and you'll keep up the great work.

[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:38.180]
So deep pressing, I think I'm going to take some Prozac and I might bring like everybody else.

[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:38.660]
Prozac.

[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:39.860]
Pete from Boca.

[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:40.380]
Prozac.

[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.420]
I'd take a caller too if there might be one.

[01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:45.120]
QAM, hello.

[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:47.660]
We were once a purple species.

[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:51.260]
All of you out there were also purple species.

[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:53.160]
Thank you, Madame Chairman.

[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:57.920]
Isn't that sad?

[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:00.680]
It is.

[01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:06.100]
I mean, it's just the, the North to describe it.

[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:14.780]
Taking a, a, an old, old bit, not even a bit.

[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:18.660]
Everybody who's for abortion.

[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:22.060]
Anything in on it was at one time themselves the species.

[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:27.400]
So, and that includes all of you out there.

[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:29.520]
You were once a species.

[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.240]
So we thank you, Mr. President.

[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:37.760]
And now, dinner will be served.

[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:38.600]
Oh, what?

[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.020]
The biggest name.

[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.060]
The best talent.

[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:44.760]
You don't get no rejects.

[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.740]
Fort rate of five sixty QAM.

[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.560]
The fourth leader.

[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.280]
I dumped the bitch right now.

[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:53.200]
It's a new, are you smarter than ever?

[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:53.700]
Great.

[01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:56.960]
Tonight, are you smarter than ever?

[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:57.440]
Great.

[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:57.920]
Hi.

[01:50:58.220 --> 01:50:59.900]
The mother of all contestants.

[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:04.360]
Our family has the same ups and downs as any other.

[01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:07.880]
The same challenges and the same joys.

[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:11.300]
Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.

[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:16.620]
The first ever Westbound Pony Express delivery started in Missouri

[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.480]
and ended in what US state.

[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.600]
The great state of Alaska.

[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:25.500]
Not smarter than a fifth grade.

[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:29.080]
Which of the following is a country in Africa?

[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:33.880]
Albania, Argentina, Algeria?

[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:38.820]
Canada, Mexico, and then, yeah, that trip that was a trip of a lifetime.

[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:40.860]
And we've got to keep an eye on Russia.

[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:43.520]
Not smarter than a fifth grader.

[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.620]
There are next door neighbors.

[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:48.960]
And you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska.

[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:50.720]
I am so sorry.

[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:53.540]
Not smarter than a fifth grader.

[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.980]
You know, that last email that I read, it's true.

[01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:59.840]
People ought to be like just throwing things out the window

[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:02.840]
and just going crazy over what's going on.

[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.120]
But nevertheless, oh no, whatever, whatever the media tells them is acceptable.

[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.740]
Oh yeah, well she's just wonderful.

[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:10.900]
The S&P is down 31 and a half points.

[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:18.120]
Even though the Senate overwhelming the 74 to 25 passed their version of the bailout bill last night.

[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:21.820]
Even though that was down 255, George.

[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.100]
And the boy stacks down 59.

[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.780]
And the S&P I'm sure is down 31 and a half point.

[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:30.500]
The S&P is down near the S&P.

[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:31.580]
Where's that A hole?

[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:33.240]
You probably killed himself.

[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.200]
And you know what, thank God.

[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:38.680]
Overpopulation, man, that's the biggest problem in the world today.

[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.180]
Too many babies crawling around.

[01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:43.200]
Oh, but it said the newborn baby.

[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:44.360]
She's got a baby.

[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:46.120]
Oh, she said so many babies.

[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:48.580]
That's because she's busy screwing her brains out all the time.

[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:49.560]
Sarah.

[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.800]
Hey, Sarah, you're fairer.

[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.440]
So this guy who sent us the very Jackass, he sends it again, the picture.

[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:00.060]
I don't want to see very Jackass, Pally.

[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.060]
He says, what's the story with Fat Hank?

[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.120]
I saw him doing his ESPN broadcast from a new location.

[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:07.160]
It looks like he's doing it from a slum.

[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:10.060]
I guess he had to move to a trailer park now, no longer,

[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:11.720]
another no longer has any income from radio.

[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.560]
Or maybe he just made a bad bet on a horse.

[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:16.300]
He said the swallow of his product, except that a pay cut,

[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:18.220]
or at least he could have maintained some of his lifestyle.

[01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:20.600]
And my opinion his radio show was unlistable anyway.

[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.380]
So what are you talking about him then for, huh?

[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:25.020]
See what I mean about these negative, sorry, people.

[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:27.400]
Hate.

[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:31.300]
Why even bring up the comment if you didn't,

[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:33.060]
and why were you watching him if you don't like him?

[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.480]
I'm going to see him on Saturday and I'm going to snitch on this guy.

[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:39.500]
I'm going to say this guy is an A-hole ripping you a fat ass.

[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:39.960]
I'm sorry.

[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:41.480]
How did he look yesterday?

[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:44.160]
You seen, say as usual, say as always.

[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.160]
Not as fat though.

[01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:48.300]
Yeah?

[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:49.680]
It's fat.

[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.940]
I thought when I saw him on one of the racers last time, he lost.

[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.380]
I didn't lift him.

[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:55.020]
I didn't pick him up.

[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.860]
I'm an ass-gave you, lift him.

[01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:58.620]
Can't you give just a civilized answer?

[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.180]
Do you always have to be a smart ass?

[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:00.480]
Yes.

[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:03.060]
I think some of these e-mailers that are ripping you an ass.

[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:04.140]
Or the ripping me too, but.

[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:05.920]
I think they have a point.

[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.360]
I think we're both nasty and wrong.

[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:11.400]
You know when people are fat like you, Chris, Hank, you know, 20, 30 pounds,

[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:12.720]
you know, I can't tell the difference.

[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:15.720]
What does that mean?

[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:18.060]
He didn't look any different from the last time.

[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:18.680]
What about Zach?

[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:19.840]
What about Zach?

[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.920]
Does he look any better than he did last time I see him?

[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:23.400]
He's actually lost some weight, yeah.

[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:25.260]
Because he's lost like a ton.

[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:28.120]
So now he only weighs two ton.

[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.220]
Right, he only has one extra chin now.

[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:30.960]
I see.

[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.940]
Gotta gotta move up and not down.

[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.240]
He was doing that the ludicrous crap again this morning.

[01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.500]
He's killing that Joe Rocho.

[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:40.100]
Zach, he thinks that because Mo is long gone,

[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.480]
that he's got a free pass now, he's got a free ride.

[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.080]
And because he's servicing clearance on the weekends,

[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.220]
he thinks that he's got a free ride.

[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:47.680]
Gotta real surprise for you.

[01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:48.760]
Better watch your back, Zach.

[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:51.060]
There's a lot of fat producers, you know?

[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.260]
I wouldn't be surprised if that Chris,

[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.820]
if that Chris volunteers to do Morning Show and our show.

[01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:57.240]
Huh?

[01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:59.580]
Imagine all the extra cash you'd make.

[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:00.240]
Oh yeah.

[01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:03.020]
No, no.

[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.600]
You don't want to do the Joe Rocho?

[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:05.240]
No.

[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.380]
You don't want to be the one who calls what's his name?

[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.380]
Jerk Jerk Street on the phone and puts him on the air?

[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:09.840]
No.

[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.660]
You get to Shmoos and Luz with Jerk Jerk Street.

[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:13.720]
That's okay.

[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.700]
Here's Adam who's chronic, who says,

[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.020]
what do you think of these talking hits saying that Biden will have to watch out

[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:21.380]
and be careful that he doesn't get too mean with Paylon,

[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:22.800]
disenfranchised female voters?

[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:24.340]
I think that's a big load of Schmidt.

[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.640]
And Biden ought to stand up there and tell Paylon to her face

[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:28.440]
that she's a health-hating Nazi bitch

[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.960]
who has no business being that close to the leader of the flea world.

[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:33.920]
Also, don't forget to switch over to the Canadian leader's debate.

[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:34.620]
No thanks.

[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:35.900]
I don't need any help to sleep.

[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.800]
And watch that frog, Deon,

[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:39.120]
Parley has weighed down his Schmitter.

[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:40.540]
For once, I'm really excited

[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:41.880]
to see the Green Party candidate

[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.940]
is finally being allowed to get in debate.

[01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:44.540]
What we do?

[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:46.500]
Green Party, my ass.

[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:48.660]
Oh, and by the way, for our friend, the Jane and Deerfield,

[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.000]
I'm still using body wash in the plastic bottles.

[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:51.560]
No.

[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:52.380]
You bastard.

[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:54.080]
I'm not recycling, okay?

[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.840]
And the thought of using a barra soap to take a shower with,

[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:59.600]
just a thought of it now is so Nazi

[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:01.840]
that it may be a one of them, it's just from thinking about it.

[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:05.780]
Neil, if you're having trouble shmitting a big giant spear of a spergus

[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:07.100]
sticking your toes to says,

[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.300]
keep what you're doing.

[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:10.460]
You're the best thing to happen to do in the last 100 years as anum.

[01:56:10.660 --> 01:56:11.160]
Thanks, Adam.

[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:14.320]
And as far as the spergus is concerned,

[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.080]
rectum makes your piece smell bad.

[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.580]
I do like his spergus, though.

[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:19.460]
Yeah.

[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:21.080]
You know, I do.

[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:22.440]
Aspiraji.

[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:25.580]
See, when it comes to eating a Chinese buffet,

[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.740]
his normal weight diners have much different approach

[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:28.820]
from those of obese patrons.

[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.540]
Customers who aren't heavy are more likely to browse the buffet

[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:35.900]
before serving themselves, use chopsticks instead of forks

[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:37.560]
and sit with their backs to the food

[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:40.500]
to study by Cornell University's food and brand lab shows.

[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:44.520]
Researchers had 22 trained observers watch 213 patrons

[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.200]
at 11.

[01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.820]
All you can eat buffet is a Chinese restaurant

[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:47.580]
around the country.

[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:50.020]
And that's what they found.

[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:54.040]
71% of normal weight diners browse the food offerings before serving

[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:56.560]
themselves versus 33% of obese patrons.

[01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.200]
Yeah, the not fat people, they take their time and they look around

[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:00.400]
there.

[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:01.720]
Oh, maybe I'll have a little bit of this.

[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:04.220]
The fat people, we just dive in there.

[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:06.620]
Man, if it's edible, we just pile it on a plate.

[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.160]
Anytime you go to a buffet, you see, I mean,

[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:12.520]
a bunch of normal weight people,

[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:16.800]
but then you also see a bunch of really big, big, huge,

[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.180]
porky people disgusting.

[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.800]
27% of normal weight people show seats facing the buffet

[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:26.160]
versus 42% of obese diners.

[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:29.580]
38% of normal weight patrons said it a booth rather than a table

[01:57:29.580 --> 01:57:31.420]
compared with 16% of heavy diners.

[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:34.220]
And 24% of normal weight people use chopsticks,

[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.120]
only 9% of heavy patrons did.

[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.360]
I don't use chopsticks as I don't know how to use them.

[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:39.240]
I don't lie in O'Lama.

[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:40.420]
Do you use chopsticks?

[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:40.820]
Yes.

[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:41.680]
You do?

[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:42.320]
Yes.

[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:43.220]
A whole.

[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:44.180]
I what?

[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:45.260]
What about you, Chris?

[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:45.900]
You use chopsticks?

[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:48.460]
Sometimes I'm not very good at it or something.

[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:53.840]
Overweight people said in average a 16 feet closer to the buffet

[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:56.320]
than normal weight people.

[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.360]
I love that.

[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.200]
That's funny.

[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:01.320]
Normal weight people chew each bite at an average of 15 times

[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:03.220]
compared with 12 times for obese people.

[01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:05.020]
Start counting the times that you chew it.

[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:07.680]
Wow.

[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:10.880]
Anything that made the food more convenient to

[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.480]
be tended to be things that obese people did.

[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:13.820]
They said closer to the buffet,

[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:16.520]
used a fork instead of chopsticks and chewed fewer times.

[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:18.640]
Many of these patterns of behavior could lead to

[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.320]
overreating without them even realizing it.

[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.300]
Colin Payne, papers co-author and assistant professor

[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.440]
of marketing at New Mexico State University,

[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.420]
Lauscrusus says,

[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:29.080]
the take-home messages from the buffet study can apply

[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:29.800]
to other environments.

[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.180]
Thinking about what you're going to eat before you scoop it

[01:58:32.180 --> 01:58:34.260]
on your plate and taking the time to chew your food

[01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:36.020]
thoroughly may help you control your weight, he said.

[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:39.180]
Like nook in your ice cream, man.

[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.360]
I think that's very commendable on my part.

[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:46.220]
It takes that extra 85 seconds to nuke in my pint of ice cream.

[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:51.120]
Oh, and the hogan does came out with a new Mayan chocolate flavor?

[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:51.860]
Yearn?

[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:53.740]
No, not urine Mayan.

[01:58:53.820 --> 01:58:53.960]
Oh.

[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:54.880]
Mayan and urine.

[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.520]
Mayan chocolate, it's pretty damn good.

[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:58.060]
It's unusual.

[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:00.200]
It's got like some swirls of mung in it.

[01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:01.540]
Some string.

[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:02.160]
It's pretty good.

[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:02.820]
Different, different.

[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.800]
Because it was just regular chocolate, I'd say,

[01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:06.000]
yeah, I'll pass.

[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:06.120]
Yes.

[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:11.100]
Neil, Sarah Pailin is qualified to oversee foreign affairs

[01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.860]
because she can see Russia from her house.

[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:14.580]
Well, I can see the moon from my house.

[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:16.280]
Does that mean I'm qualified to work for NASA?

[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:17.040]
Excellent.

[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:17.760]
Good point, Peter.

[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:18.240]
Yes.

[01:59:19.380 --> 01:59:20.060]
Sign them up.

[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.720]
He can see the moon from his house.

[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:24.980]
George says, this is from George Rodriguez.

[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:26.620]
Oh, what do I say?

[01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:28.100]
I really think that was Chrissy Mealing you.

[01:59:28.180 --> 01:59:29.180]
He looks like he's going to cry.

[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.140]
Keep calling him fat.

[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:31.560]
I'm sick of working with him anyway.

[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:33.720]
He sweats a lot and smells really bad.

[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:35.520]
I think it's him.

[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:36.300]
The bus!

[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:37.920]
No, it's Neil Rogers.

[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:39.800]
Fortleg, you're 5'60 km.

[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:42.140]
The fourth leader.

[01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:45.200]
And now it's time for our long-distance dedication.

[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.480]
It's from Hank Goldberg.

[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:48.420]
Any rights?

[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:51.280]
Please play the air that I breathe.

[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:54.800]
And dedicate it to my Kim Bassinger blow up doll.

[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.700]
Very to an Eskimo.

[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:09.020]
Fortleg from Alaska.

[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:11.440]
A hot Kimoffimbo.

[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:16.780]
Sarah Sumpol through some colleges after leaving Idaho.

[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:22.540]
She met a guy named Pa, who's a drunken Eskimo.

[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:28.460]
She modeled in her bathing suit in a local beauty show.

[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:34.200]
Then she got a big and the media broadcasting force for old.

[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:39.540]
She ran to be the mayor in the town of 52.

[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:45.260]
Then became the governor of the state when the girls are few.

[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:51.000]
She kept the money for the care mark that she got up through.

[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:56.140]
And Sarah named her children trick and track and dignity,

[02:00:56.940 --> 02:01:03.260]
where the battles are filling up with cranked in Wasilov.

[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.300]
Fortleg from Alaska.

[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:07.600]
Very to an Eskimo.

[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:11.100]
Oh, Fortleg from Alaska.

[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:13.520]
A hot Kimoffimbo.

[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:15.680]
Fortleg from August 3, 1985.

[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.200]
I love that, and that great.

[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:18.280]
That was wonderful.

[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:20.560]
I give that 85 stars on a skill of five.

[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:22.160]
That's how good that is.

[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:24.200]
Uncle's quizzling is back again.

[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:25.720]
Not much action on those emails.

[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:26.480]
I'll tell you that.

[02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:29.140]
Got a call here, though.

[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:29.860]
Q-I-M. Hello.

[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:31.040]
Hi.

[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:32.600]
I got a jingle for needle.

[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.520]
Hi, Leo Jingle.

[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:35.840]
Hi, Leo.

[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:36.600]
Pa, Leo Jingle.

[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.020]
How's that?

[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:37.760]
One.

[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:39.280]
Hi, Leo.

[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:40.380]
Pa, Leo Jingle.

[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:43.560]
Yeah.

[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.120]
And.

[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:50.940]
Sorry about.

[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:53.300]
What is it?

[02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:54.600]
I'm sorry.

[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:55.440]
Of course they have.

[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.400]
You ought to be.

[02:01:58.160 --> 02:01:59.340]
Oh my god.

[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:02.560]
Anyway, Uncle's quizzling says the printing and outlook express

[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:04.400]
is controlled through Internet Explorer.

[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:05.580]
Oh my god.

[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:07.020]
Internet Explorer.

[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:07.940]
That thing is still around.

[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:09.460]
You can't get rid of it.

[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:11.280]
I'd like to.

[02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:12.040]
Me too.

[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.560]
If you would like your emails to automatically print in a larger font

[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.480]
or set margins so they don't get cut off,

[02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:20.420]
you need to change the setting in Internet Explorer.

[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.980]
I can send you more detailed instructions if you'd like.

[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:27.740]
I've done that change the setting of the margins 8 million times.

[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:28.780]
It doesn't do squat.

[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:31.000]
The right hand margin.

[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.880]
It just still wants to chop off.

[02:02:33.780 --> 02:02:35.240]
Now when it chronicles out,

[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:36.800]
when I print emails out.

[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:38.460]
We'll play with it Monday morning if you remember.

[02:02:38.860 --> 02:02:41.800]
We'll play with your margins on Monday morning if you want.

[02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:42.700]
Oh my god.

[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.480]
Are you start with that stock talking end word?

[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.560]
Look what it is for Rick Riley.

[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:49.040]
The fair value is that.

[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:49.720]
Like that.

[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:50.220]
Like that.

[02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:51.980]
What an idiot he is.

[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:52.320]
You know what?

[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:56.660]
I mean, I'm not going to knock him but he's an idiot.

[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.420]
But then again, he was in this business so you can't,

[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:02.920]
you know, he can't knock too much.

[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:09.540]
265 points on the downside for the Dow.

[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:10.820]
Aren't you depressed?

[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.080]
Oh, what are we going to do?

[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:14.500]
The sky is falling.

[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:16.280]
My bank is going first.

[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:16.980]
My money.

[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:22.060]
364 votes on the pool, not including drugs or alcohol offenses.

[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:26.620]
I break the law most often by speeding 157.

[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:27.340]
I bet you do.

[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:30.860]
Here it is like 1% of the population at speeds.

[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:35.200]
2% that go to the right speed and 97% go too slow.

[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:36.400]
Purple.

[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.440]
Oh, just enough to frost your ass.

[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:44.240]
Speeding 159, I never break any laws 53.

[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:45.740]
Yeah, likely story.

[02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.680]
Not wearing a seatbelt 51.

[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:50.280]
Downloading music or audio illegally 34,

[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:51.760]
cheating on taxes 17.

[02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:54.100]
Not picking up doggy poopy 16.

[02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:57.200]
Having sex in public 13, like out on the street corner.

[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:01.900]
Running red light 6, littering 6, buggery 5.

[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:04.640]
Carrying a weapon illegally for it,

[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.060]
smoking and non-smoking areas only 2 out of 366.

[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:10.820]
What's our goal for this stupid ass poll today?

[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:11.260]
450?

[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:13.160]
Okay, yeah.

[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:14.200]
What do we do on the first one?

[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:16.080]
Are we doing over a thousand, thousand and 12, I believe?

[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.140]
Actually, we got to 1021.

[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:20.940]
1021.

[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.440]
So we've got damn near 1400 now.

[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.400]
Our goal for the day is 1500 for the day.

[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.660]
That would be a real barn burners.

[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:32.060]
But if you're a very weak response on the email, very weak.

[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:33.440]
WQ I am.

[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:33.700]
Hello.

[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.040]
Neil.

[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:35.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.060]
Today I called my Republican mother.

[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:40.120]
It was really sweet, but still a Republican.

[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:42.720]
I said, Mom, what do you think about McCain's plan to

[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:45.860]
invest, saw all the social security in the stock market?

[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:47.960]
You think you'd be doing well right now?

[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:50.100]
And I got to hang up.

[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:51.380]
Really?

[02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:52.220]
Yeah.

[02:04:52.980 --> 02:04:53.880]
Well, here's another one.

[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:59.200]
Well, I mean, he, you know, he's getting used to that sound.

[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:00.500]
How do you like that?

[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:01.620]
Mom hung up on him.

[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:03.100]
Nasty, hateful old bitch.

[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:06.500]
Let's face it, you don't want to vote for some sparsher.

[02:05:06.580 --> 02:05:07.380]
That's what it's all about.

[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:09.220]
Then that's the bottom line with so many people.

[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:09.860]
Yep.

[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:13.060]
He'd be 60 points ahead right now with all the stuff that's

[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.720]
gone on and the way McCain made a jackass of himself last night

[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:18.340]
with a bailout rescue and Russian back in suspending his

[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:20.100]
campaign, which was a lie in the first place.

[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:24.040]
And then you know, cancelling on Letterman and saying that he had to go back to

[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:25.980]
Washington to be the one to help bail it out.

[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:27.320]
And then putting out an announcement,

[02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:31.440]
congratulating himself for getting the bailout passed on the day that it got

[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.060]
defeated.

[02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:36.420]
A total jackass he made of himself, not to mention the Sarah Factor.

[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:42.440]
The Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Pailin had difficulty naming

[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:46.620]
a specific Supreme Court case she disagreed with beside Roe v Wade and a long

[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:48.660]
way to clip CBS News aired Wednesday night.

[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:54.720]
I mean, every clip they show of her is so embarrassing and they can't be making it up.

[02:05:54.820 --> 02:05:55.660]
You know, it's actually her.

[02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:56.820]
It's not Tina Faye, it's her.

[02:05:58.200 --> 02:06:01.060]
The comments first before it by political came in an interview with CBS News

[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:03.140]
anchor Katie Kourk tape last week.

[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:05.440]
Well, let's see.

[02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:07.760]
There's of course, in the great history of American rulings,

[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:10.580]
there have been rulings that's never going to be absolute consensus by every

[02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:11.480]
American bailin said.

[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:15.180]
And there are those issues again like Roe v Wade where I believe are being held

[02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:16.420]
on a state level and dressed there.

[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:18.940]
So, you know, going through the history of America, there would be others,

[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:20.940]
but can you think of any Kourk interjected?

[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:25.220]
Well, I could think of of any again that could be best dealt with on a more local level.

[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:27.080]
Maybe I would take issue with Pailin responded.

[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:28.300]
But you know, as mayor,

[02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:31.200]
then as governor and even as vice president, if I'm so privileged to serve,

[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:33.060]
wouldn't be in a position of changing those things,

[02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.220]
but in supporting the law of the land as it reads today.

[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:37.800]
Bap bap bap.

[02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:38.720]
She's like Al Kelly.

[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:39.840]
She's a double talker.

[02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:41.480]
Remember Al Kelly?

[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:42.080]
Yep.

[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:47.380]
Pailin's comments came in the same interview during which he gave a widely

[02:06:47.380 --> 02:06:51.100]
pan answer on the economic bailout bill and had trouble describing John McCain's record

[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.660]
on regulation of the financial industry.

[02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:55.900]
When Kourk posed the same question to Joe Biden,

[02:06:56.540 --> 02:07:00.320]
he said he disagreed with the ruling that invalidated a portion of the violence against women act.

[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:03.380]
He is going to make mints me to her tonight and this business about,

[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:07.160]
well, he's got to be careful not to come across as being sexist and putting your dog

[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:09.200]
because she's a woman, you know, below any.

[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:12.340]
The gender isn't supposed to make any difference.

[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:13.200]
That's the whole point.

[02:07:13.660 --> 02:07:14.440]
That's the whole thing.

[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:18.220]
Whether she's male, female or whatever, she's supposed to be one thing.

[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:18.800]
You know what that is?

[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:19.480]
Qualified.

[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:22.680]
Which she is eminently unqualified.

[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:26.000]
And of course that means that her mentor, John McCain, who barely even

[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.140]
knew her before he got, come on, before his aides came up with her name.

[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:32.780]
I mean, a stunt, a gimmick.

[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:36.100]
Oh, he always puts the American people first right.

[02:07:36.300 --> 02:07:38.480]
It's strictly his political ass that he puts first.

[02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:39.420]
Brackum.

[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:41.060]
And believe me, I'm sure I don't want to see that.

[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:42.000]
I neither did any of you.

[02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:43.480]
Do you want to see his political ass?

[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:44.740]
Oh, no, thank you.

[02:07:45.020 --> 02:07:45.920]
Oh, my God.

[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:46.620]
What a thought.

[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.060]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:51.280]
Neil.

[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.000]
Yes.

[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:54.140]
What do you feel angry about, sir?

[02:07:55.500 --> 02:07:56.560]
I mean, you mean what?

[02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:59.500]
Hey, Neil, we've been listening to waiting for two weeks to hear from the

[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:00.840]
first like that you hung up on them.

[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:01.540]
What's that all about?

[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:03.920]
You were waiting for two weeks?

[02:08:04.540 --> 02:08:05.580]
Yeah, we were waiting for two weeks.

[02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.000]
Are you his boyfriend or his hand?

[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:07.980]
Are you his hand?

[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:08.900]
You hung up on him?

[02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:09.600]
Yeah, right.

[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:11.680]
What's the deal with that?

[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:12.820]
What's the deal with?

[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:13.660]
We don't want to talk to him.

[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:14.100]
That's the deal.

[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:15.980]
Well, he's a jerk.

[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:17.360]
He's a jerk just like you are.

[02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:18.440]
Well, come on, Neil.

[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:18.920]
That's not fair.

[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:20.560]
Not, listen.

[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.960]
It's not very nice to be a jerk, but that's what you are.

[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:27.020]
Anybody who's calling up to give me a song and a dance about why I won't talk to the

[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:28.220]
quarter-shlock guy, his boyfriend?

[02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:30.640]
Gets yourself a new boyfriend, man.

[02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:31.900]
Somebody that's got a little bit of sanity.

[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:34.380]
Get up to the 50 cent schlock guy.

[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:36.920]
We don't want to push you all the way up to the dollars yet.

[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:40.440]
Do you think that's about his level of 50 cent schlock guy?

[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:40.660]
Yeah.

[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:43.500]
WQA, I'm Hello.

[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:44.820]
Hey, Neil.

[02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:45.760]
Yes, sir.

[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:50.100]
This whole couple of things, this whole bailout that they're trying to do,

[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:53.500]
I was listening to a show guy who's kind of a little bit dry, but he went through the whole

[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:58.240]
history of the Great Depression and he was talking about how Herbert Hoover, and it was kind

[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:02.920]
of another real estate bubble that led to that, he was going to try and do the exact same thing

[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:08.160]
back then, was give the money to the banks, let them figure it out, and Roosevelt came in and

[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:11.800]
totally flipped that, gave the money to the people, and that's what actually stopped the Great

[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:12.340]
Depression.

[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:15.420]
And here we are following history the wrong way.

[02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:21.420]
You know, it's that whole saying that they say if you forget the pasture, doing to repeat it,

[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.500]
we did that with Vietnam, and here we are in Iraq.

[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:27.220]
You know, it's amazing how we just keep putting our foot in it.

[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:31.640]
And I think that's exactly.

[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:36.140]
And you know how they try to scare you and say that if Obama wins, you know, you can

[02:09:36.140 --> 02:09:38.680]
be the first black guy, it's going to be a dangerous thing for him.

[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:40.520]
I think McCain's more in danger.

[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:44.080]
Imagine if he wins, he's got his pale and fanatic.

[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.680]
Oh, yes, Sarah's a hell of a good shot.

[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:47.280]
He's a better shot than Cheney.

[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:48.320]
Oh, yeah, exactly.

[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.760]
And you've got these people with so-

[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:54.420]
kill abortion doctors, they blow up the, this like, McVeigh, they, you know, these are

[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:58.860]
Christian terrorists here that they do anything to put her in the presidency, including taking

[02:09:58.860 --> 02:09:59.440]
out McCain.

[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:02.260]
So I think he's more in danger than Obama would be.

[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.060]
What do you think?

[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:06.320]
I think we're all in grave dangers, but I think,

[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.160]
call out to the bed.

[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:08.520]
We'll let you know what it's safe to come out.

[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:09.200]
See you.

[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:09.840]
Good luck.

[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:11.540]
How do you like that?

[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:14.400]
McCain's in grave danger.

[02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:15.720]
He's going to croak pretty soon anyway.

[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:17.660]
He looks like death on two legs.

[02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:18.160]
Hey.

[02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:19.940]
384 votes.

[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:21.500]
What do we need for 1500 for the day?

[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:22.020]
Come on, Chris.

[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:24.540]
Put your, uh, quit sending me those stupid emails.

[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:25.460]
Oh, I was.

[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:28.020]
Then put your thinking crap or cap on.

[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:29.960]
There's nothing in the thing, by the way.

[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:31.000]
There's no emails.

[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:34.340]
We got through.

[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:34.900]
What did you say?

[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:35.540]
We had 10 what?

[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:38.060]
1021 and 384.

[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:38.360]
I do.

[02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:39.240]
You're slow.

[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:40.600]
Oh, 1405.

[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:42.700]
We need 95 votes in the next hour and seven minutes.

[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.340]
We can do that.

[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:48.140]
We need 95 vote to give us 1500 on the day,

[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:49.660]
which would be a spectacular total.

[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.540]
I bet you that they beat near hearts out over there.

[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:53.860]
Ken Charles probably be killing little babies over there.

[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:54.780]
It's the cheap channel.

[02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:57.560]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:58.020]
Lees bed.

[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:00.300]
Look what they did to poor footy.

[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:04.180]
God, I good close personal friend footy.

[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.880]
Just because he sucked on here and he had no numbers.

[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:08.440]
I mean, is that a good reason to fire somebody?

[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:09.580]
Times are tough.

[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:11.240]
People can't afford to be listening to jobs.

[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:12.080]
And today's economy.

[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:12.880]
That's right.

[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:13.920]
And today's economy, guys,

[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:15.700]
just because they're show sucks and they got no ratings,

[02:11:16.020 --> 02:11:17.320]
can't afford to be put out on the street.

[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:20.160]
Especially a goofy old guy like footy,

[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:22.320]
he looks like he, he looks at least today over 125.

[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:25.060]
He looks bad with that red nose and that red pus.

[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:28.320]
Too bad you can't check out his website anymore.

[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:29.280]
I guess he still can.

[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:30.460]
It's probably still on there somewhere.

[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:33.340]
His head is red as a beat.

[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:35.360]
WDQAM Hello.

[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:39.300]
QAM Hello.

[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:39.620]
He'll.

[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:40.520]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:43.280]
I'm calling because I was thinking now,

[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:44.340]
whatever happened to that guy,

[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:46.840]
that was a co-host with Kim Volkamp.

[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:48.600]
Can he walk her?

[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:49.480]
Right, right.

[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:50.360]
He's still doing that.

[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:51.240]
He's on the post.

[02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:56.540]
He's reading, he's reading three by five card liners on the coast.

[02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:58.420]
Wow, wouldn't surprise me.

[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:00.660]
I was thinking because he used to do the hozzoffing games.

[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:02.480]
He used to be like the announcer on the, uh,

[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:04.520]
he's the PA announcer at the Dolphin Stadium.

[02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:05.020]
That's correct.

[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:06.500]
Awesome. He's still doing that, huh?

[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:08.380]
He still sucks amazing.

[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:10.460]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you, um, I need to dolphins.

[02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:11.820]
Hopefully they'll win this week.

[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:13.240]
I mean, you know, they're the sleepers.

[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:14.400]
No, no chance.

[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:15.940]
No, all right.

[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:16.760]
You'll see he'll see.

[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:17.040]
Okay.

[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:17.760]
I'll see.

[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:20.040]
You'll see.

[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:22.620]
See, that's the one thing about the Dolphin fans is that,

[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:24.460]
you know, they always come up with this crap.

[02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:27.220]
Now, the Patriot game, they all said they were going to lose,

[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:28.900]
just like I said, because nobody in their right mind

[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:31.160]
thought that the Patriots could possibly be that bad,

[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:31.660]
but they were.

[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:36.020]
I mean, how many, how many times can you run the same trick play

[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:37.820]
in the same game and have it work?

[02:12:37.980 --> 02:12:39.480]
But, you know, Bella Chick was taking a nap.

[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:42.340]
And Matt Castle, why he looks pretty good.

[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.480]
He's, uh, he's a grade school.

[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:44.580]
He's a first grader quarterback.

[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.120]
What I do with those pictures of him.

[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:48.180]
Oh, don't tell, I, I schmit candem.

[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:48.760]
Oh, no.

[02:12:49.300 --> 02:12:51.840]
Not those naked pictures where he had that thing hanging out.

[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:54.660]
Now they're gone.

[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:56.720]
I lost my naked pictures of Matt Castle.

[02:12:56.940 --> 02:12:57.500]
Oh, no.

[02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.240]
Yeah, somebody else could have gone.

[02:12:59.460 --> 02:13:00.000]
No, I gotta go.

[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:00.440]
I gotta go.

[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:01.780]
Oh, my God.

[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:02.760]
And I threw the garbage out.

[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.760]
The maid came yesterday and she threw all the garbage out.

[02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:09.380]
So I gotta go retrieve, I gotta go down to the dumpster,

[02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:10.780]
downstairs in the bottles of the building,

[02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:12.120]
and retrieve the garbage bag.

[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:15.260]
Oh, you're so sick.

[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:15.700]
Yeah.

[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:16.600]
And that's why you're listening.

[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:17.060]
That's right.

[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:18.200]
Because I'm sick.

[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:20.220]
If I was just a boring guy like footy,

[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:21.520]
I'd be out on a beach right now.

[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:22.860]
I'd be over down on Lake Ontario.

[02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:24.680]
Spare some change, mister.

[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:25.400]
How's it going?

[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:27.180]
A boy, those leaves really suck, eh?

[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:28.940]
Pick his name.

[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.080]
The best talent.

[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.400]
You're his new projects.

[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.700]
Sport radio 560 QAM.

[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.500]
The fourth leader.

[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:37.460]
The biggest names.

[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:38.980]
The best talent.

[02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:44.700]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.

[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:47.200]
I am Miami for Lutterdale.

[02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:48.240]
I am all a Spadano.

[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:50.060]
Since Phyllis neither has one.

[02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:52.800]
Natasha and I no longer have to look for a motion squatter.

[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.740]
Instead, we listen to the near-roger's fairer and balanced one to two hour.

[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:03.980]
After blicklessly heeded staring at the dossier between Russia

[02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:06.420]
and then go here and fight presidential mononiseira Payway,

[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:07.880]
Russia's top operatives.

[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:09.000]
After three huts are made.

[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:11.320]
Natasha.

[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:13.660]
Oh, there you are, darling.

[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:17.720]
Seriously, this is via being spied on by Governor Milf from Alaska.

[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.460]
Darling, that's not hard.

[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:20.040]
Perhaps.

[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:22.060]
But we don't like being stared at.

[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:24.280]
She looks from a window on the island.

[02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:25.520]
Don't worry, darling.

[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:26.140]
worry.

[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:28.040]
She is about to take Washington.

[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:30.100]
Anybody can take Washington.

[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:32.660]
Yes, but I have a plan.

[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:33.540]
And that is?

[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:35.080]
Allow me to introduce.

[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.600]
Exploding snowshoes.

[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.600]
What do we do next?

[02:14:38.980 --> 02:14:43.820]
We hire Musa Square as laviest to give snowshoes to Governor Milf as gift.

[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:47.820]
But precisely, having a snowshoes work, I must figure out.

[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:48.540]
You will.

[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.500]
Perhaps if I put them on like this.

[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:56.460]
We'll go for one, hello, through with our plan.

[02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:58.260]
Okay, Jones, who are next at the show.

[02:14:58.920 --> 02:14:59.840]
Sarah, through the looking glass.

[02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.620]
Or Alaska, Palens.

[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.140]
And the Kingdom of the Crystal Net.

[02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:05.640]
We'll got another email from Fat Chris.

[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:07.400]
Oh, boy, he's chronic.

[02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:11.160]
Neilin and George, I'm glad the two of you find this amusing.

[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:13.460]
Let's see how bad you feel when I jump out the window.

[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.020]
I'm sorry if I smell George, but when you're as fat as me, it's impossible to wash airy orifice.

[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:20.120]
I think that's Salami.

[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:21.660]
I stuffed in my shorts also doesn't help.

[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:23.380]
Please stop being fun to me or I quit.

[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:24.720]
This is Fat Chris.

[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:28.020]
I got a weiner here.

[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.000]
I saw him out here later.

[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:31.660]
Schneider's weiner, I just nuke.

[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:34.780]
It's okay.

[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:37.960]
What do you guys have in there for lunch today?

[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:38.440]
Nothing.

[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:39.740]
Why is that?

[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.420]
Because we don't have lunch here anymore.

[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:44.020]
Let's see.

[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:45.480]
Why is the big one twice a day?

[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:45.860]
He sucks.

[02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:46.880]
Thanks, Joe Bell.

[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.240]
Big fat sports loser, it says here with a phone number.

[02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:50.940]
How to name?

[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:55.440]
Can he grahamers back hot dogs outside Philadelphia baseball

[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:56.760]
stadium because bomb scare.

[02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:58.640]
Well, I got to print that out.

[02:15:59.320 --> 02:15:59.960]
Do you think?

[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:01.060]
All right.

[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:05.560]
I never realized that all the OLD people are such big groupies.

[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:05.820]
Did you?

[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:06.260]
Yes.

[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:07.100]
You did?

[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:07.480]
Sure.

[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:09.160]
Even Andy Cal, but the fake Andy Cal.

[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:11.080]
The fake one, yeah, not the real one.

[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:11.540]
No.

[02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:13.560]
Where did he wind up?

[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:16.180]
Didn't he like the president of ABC Newsmaking?

[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:19.180]
A lot of money and in charge of a lot of people.

[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:20.580]
He's a lot of...

[02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:20.600]
He's a lot of...

[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:20.600]

[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:20.720]
He's a lot of...

[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:21.100]
He's a lot of...

[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:24.720]
He's like in charge of the...

[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.440]
Like ABC radio either the news department or...

[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:28.560]
Or just ABC radio.

[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:29.460]
You're actually kidding me.

[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:32.940]
He works on top of skyscrapers and a big fancy office.

[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:34.600]
That's a little suckhole, Andy Cal.

[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:35.000]
I'm sure.

[02:16:35.220 --> 02:16:35.320]
Yeah.

[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:36.040]
Yes.

[02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:37.700]
I hear his one.

[02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:39.120]
It says that this video made me laugh.

[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:39.900]
You got to watch it.

[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:41.980]
Clip of...

[02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:43.020]
While still a commission meeting.

[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:43.780]
Okay, well thanks.

[02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:45.140]
But I'm not going to watch it.

[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:50.160]
Well, there's some really bizarre stuff coming here.

[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:52.340]
The ZAR.

[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:53.740]
Oh my god.

[02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:55.900]
And let's see what this one is.

[02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:58.080]
I'm so tired of hearing about this controversy.

[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:00.140]
To all you right-wing Bible Thumbna Gavius,

[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:01.540]
Roe v Wade is legal.

[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:02.240]
Get over it.

[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:02.880]
It says...

[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:06.240]
From somebody called the King of...

[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:06.680]
Swishful...

[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:07.320]
A wishful thinking.

[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:11.920]
Okay, let's see what we got.

[02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:14.300]
After a...

[02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:15.740]
Can I finish my Weiner first or what?

[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:17.640]
You can do it both at the same time.

[02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:19.080]
Or I can't talk with my mouth.

[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:19.760]
Sure you can.

[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:20.400]
You've got it for...

[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:23.280]
Because your bell will send you another email.

[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:27.140]
How come I crossed...

[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:27.300]
I don't know.

[02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:27.880]
I didn't do it.

[02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:30.980]
I thought I crossed out the first break already in this hour.

[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:35.060]
I got stuff to do, man.

[02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:38.640]
I got to take that damn Pontiac into the dealer

[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:39.620]
to have that thing fixed.

[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:41.660]
That's two o'clock.

[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:43.760]
And I hate driving that car.

[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.020]
Even in it really.

[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:46.060]
Even in pristine shape.

[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:46.720]
I just don't like that.

[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:47.640]
It looks kind of a crypt.

[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:49.140]
I haven't been on the inside of one.

[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:49.380]
But...

[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:51.180]
No, I'm not talking about the size of it.

[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:52.360]
I don't have a problem with that.

[02:17:52.420 --> 02:17:53.120]
I'm not that fat.

[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:54.340]
Like fat crystal.

[02:17:57.240 --> 02:17:58.460]
I don't know.

[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.700]
It's a four cylinder first of all.

[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:02.000]
Shouldn't that tell you something?

[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:02.820]
It's a pig.

[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:06.860]
I don't like it.

[02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:09.120]
I mean, if I didn't have the vet here,

[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:09.900]
then I wouldn't mind it.

[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.300]
You know, it'd be a novelty.

[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:15.840]
But I got to take it, even though I don't want it.

[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:17.780]
And after a bomb skewer,

[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:19.200]
he filled it off his filly's ballpark.

[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:23.240]
I thought he's pointed the finger at a fuzzy green suspect.

[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.320]
The filly finesse.

[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:24.320]

[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:24.320]

[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:24.320]

[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:24.320]

[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:24.540]
It's a dramatic.

[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.780]
Hours before the filly's Atlanta Braves game last night,

[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:30.080]
a film crew shot a commercial in the mascot.

[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:32.200]
Smooth.

[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:33.080]
What does it say?

[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:36.660]
Something heavily wrapped hot dogs from a launcher.

[02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:37.180]
Oh, shooting.

[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:38.540]
Heavily wrapped hot dogs.

[02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:41.580]
But someone inadvertently left three of the duct tape hot dogs

[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:44.220]
outside the ballpark, sparking security fears.

[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:47.160]
Oh, stadium employees were evacuated.

[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.000]
And the bomb squad was called in.

[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:52.640]
See, this fits right in with my life.

[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.240]
See how life works?

[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:55.780]
Right.

[02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:57.300]
That's my last winner, too.

[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:05.580]
Only after the packages were blown up.

[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:06.580]
What?

[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:10.300]
Did authorities realize they just exploded some sausages?

[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:15.420]
We saw something that looks suspicious, said Michael Styles,

[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:18.120]
filly senior vice president, administration, and operations.

[02:19:18.940 --> 02:19:20.480]
We did the right thing and turned out to be nothing.

[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:23.400]
We could have gone over and picked it up and thrown it in the trash and been done with it.

[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:26.800]
But if we had been wrong, somebody might have lost an arm or a leg.

[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:29.040]
And then that bitch would have come along and taken the arm or leg home.

[02:19:30.700 --> 02:19:32.440]
After the detonation, the game went on a schedule.

[02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:35.940]
I'd rather blow up some hot dogs or some catch-up in mustard and relish

[02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:39.280]
that have it be a real bomb, really, or something in Durban.

[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:39.740]
What's his name?

[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:42.040]
Sid.

[02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:42.760]
I'd never forget.

[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:43.100]
Sorry.

[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:44.380]
Something in Durban.

[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:47.700]
Well, I thought maybe a fat Chris would know, but Durban, no idea.

[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:50.080]
Dick Durban, Illinois.

[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:53.920]
Bob B says, how do you attack a buffet?

[02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:55.640]
Remember that?

[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:56.100]
Uh-huh.

[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:58.880]
Neil, how do you attack the buffet at the Emerald Coast, Neil?

[02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:00.000]
How do you attack the...

[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:03.320]
Oh, what are these people trying to tell us?

[02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:03.920]
I have no life.

[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:05.100]
Oh my God.

[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:09.040]
How do you attack the buffet?

[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:14.500]
Listen to some of my old CDs, Bob, says this weekend, I thought of a pool subject

[02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:16.620]
that may or may not be of your liking.

[02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:19.380]
Who's your favorite and not to who do you think is the best?

[02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:21.360]
Who's your favorite guitarist of all time?

[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:24.760]
Short list of mine in no particular order says Bob B.

[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:25.440]
Short list.

[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:27.120]
Dwayne Alman, Jeff Beck,

[02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:29.500]
Eric Clapton,

[02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:30.720]
Al Demiola,

[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:34.560]
Eric Johnson, Jimmy Page, David Gilmore,

[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:36.500]
in relation to Doug Gilmore,

[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.540]
Pink Floyd, David Gilmore, Neil Sean from Journey,

[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:41.440]
Mark Farner from Grand Funk,

[02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:43.620]
Josiah Trionney, Steve Vai,

[02:20:44.580 --> 02:20:46.240]
V-Vesmer, V-A-I,

[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:47.240]
Steve Vai.

[02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:49.860]
Bye-bye, Steve Vai.

[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:51.620]
Bye-bye, Steve Vai.

[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:52.380]
Oh, I can hear that.

[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:54.700]
Frank Zappa, Dwayne Zalzappa,

[02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:56.760]
I'm sure your listeners have their favorites to add.

[02:20:56.900 --> 02:20:58.440]
You like that greatest guitarist of all time?

[02:20:58.740 --> 02:20:59.180]
Yeah, why not?

[02:20:59.280 --> 02:20:59.700]
We haven't done that.

[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:02.440]
What about that Latin American guitarist, Andres Sagovia?

[02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:04.780]
Okay.

[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:05.760]
No?

[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:06.860]
Whatever.

[02:21:07.660 --> 02:21:08.460]
Andres Sagovia,

[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:11.620]
back in the day, was considered to be the greatest guitarist of all time.

[02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:12.600]
What about Les Paul?

[02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:15.000]
With the 8-Merry 4.

[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:15.000]

[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:15.300]
There you go.

[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:16.220]
There you go.

[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:19.060]
Vai Con Dios, remember that?

[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:19.380]
No.

[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:20.600]
Wait before your time.

[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:23.220]
Les Paul was the one who invented that,

[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:26.440]
what do they call the electric guitar?

[02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:27.940]
The electric pickup.

[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:31.280]
But also the, where they do with their double tracks.

[02:21:32.580 --> 02:21:33.020]
Okay.

[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:36.060]
You know what I'm talking about, multiple tracks.

[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:36.900]
He did.

[02:21:37.020 --> 02:21:37.960]
The Carpenters used to do.

[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:39.440]
Like everybody does.

[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:40.460]
Oh, look at this.

[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:45.280]
Bro, can you lend me 15 large to son up for the Columbia School of Broadcasting?

[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:46.540]
Word is,

[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:50.480]
WKBW is looking for some voice over talent.

[02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:51.600]
That's got a picture of footy.

[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:52.060]
Footsy.

[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:56.160]
Footsy with that red push.

[02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:57.880]
Red is a beat.

[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:02.440]
Not embarrassing?

[02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:03.880]
Quite.

[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:10.400]
And here's some clown holding up a poster that he

[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:10.560]
made.

[02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:11.960]
It's got Bush and McCain.

[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:15.000]
And they're holding up a sign that says Bush equals McCain more the same.

[02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:19.240]
And this group ball is staying there by the 8-26 by the Palmetto.

[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:20.740]
Somebody taking a picture.

[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:21.580]
Isn't that great?

[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:22.700]
Yep.

[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.560]
Well, thanks for the memories.

[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:27.420]
That's all that's in our, in my thing there.

[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:30.280]
And we got 52 minutes to kill.

[02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:33.440]
That's pretty weak, pretty lame if you asked me for a Thursday.

[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:36.700]
I could understand, you know, the Jew holidays are over for Krenna allowed.

[02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:38.200]
Until we get to Yom Kipper.

[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:38.860]
When's Yom Kipper?

[02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:39.820]
The 8?

[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:42.360]
The 7th?

[02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:42.860]
He's looking.

[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:44.680]
8th.

[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:45.020]
On Sunday.

[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:45.100]

[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:45.640]
Next Wednesday.

[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:46.120]
Next.

[02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:46.700]
What?

[02:22:46.820 --> 02:22:47.420]
Sunday on Wednesday?

[02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:48.940]
Yes.

[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:49.180]

[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:51.520]
So Yom Kipper is almost a week away for Krenna allowed.

[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:52.380]
And that's an excuse.

[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:54.180]
Even the Goyam are Jewish and the Jew holidays.

[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:57.600]
Neil at neorongers.com.

[02:22:57.740 --> 02:22:59.180]
Waiting for your persprication observations.

[02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:00.800]
We got that big, great debate tonight.

[02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:02.620]
Biden and Palen, Palen and Biden.

[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:05.540]
I guess maybe they're just Biden their time, you think?

[02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:07.660]
WQAM, hello.

[02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:09.340]
Hi, Neil.

[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:11.380]
This has been Krenna Kipper's mother.

[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:15.200]
Police not picking up out of there because he looks like

[02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:17.020]
Peter's the puppet babies.

[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:18.600]
He also has...

[02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:20.580]
WQAM, hello.

[02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:21.080]
Not there.

[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:23.320]
WQAM, hello.

[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:26.920]
Ciguba, a form, a goss...

[02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:27.780]
Yeah, speak it in English.

[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:29.900]
Okay, speak it in English, banana boat boy.

[02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:30.340]
Get lost.

[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:34.740]
Call up Radio Mom Bee and start the Hakanah Trinak.

[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:37.780]
How are we doing on the poll?

[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:41.640]
40...

[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:42.660]
5... 6...

[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:45.260]
405...

[02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:45.840]
406.

[02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:48.480]
Yeah, pick up sticks, 406.

[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:54.020]
1021 and 406 is 1427.

[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:54.500]
Correct.

[02:23:54.680 --> 02:23:56.380]
We still need 73 votes for 1500.

[02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:57.140]
Not going to happen.

[02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:59.520]
In 50 minutes, not a chance.

[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:03.380]
And you want to know why, and that's because the emails...

[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:05.520]
because the emails are like dropped off to nothing.

[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:09.820]
Maybe we ought to spin some wax.

[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:12.360]
Anybody play?

[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:12.860]
How many do I am, hello?

[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:15.040]
Neil, how are you today?

[02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:16.220]
Good, great.

[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:19.660]
I do miss the phone calls, but not that much.

[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:21.160]
It was... I had an idea.

[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:22.940]
I'm one of the fans of some of the old bits,

[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:25.580]
and I know you can't play them, and that's about obvious.

[02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:27.700]
But it's possible for a book of Brian,

[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:29.200]
maybe to get a flash of an idea to put

[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:31.060]
pieces of the old bits.

[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.660]
It's kind of like a reminder of some of me.

[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:35.840]
Like I was listening to one of your old CDs the other day.

[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:37.120]
Like a backpipe.

[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:39.400]
If you just came up like we're like velvet,

[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:42.300]
you know, we would all be remembered up the good times.

[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:43.020]
No.

[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:46.540]
I'm desperate. That's all I got to go for.

[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:48.760]
I really miss the old bits.

[02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:50.040]
I think I really made a lot of you show.

[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:52.360]
Well, we can't play them, like you just said.

[02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:54.120]
I know, but just a little reminder,

[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:55.280]
it's like a little tip of them.

[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:56.100]
What do you mean, little reminders?

[02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:57.480]
I'll tell you what, here we go.

[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:00.080]
I don't need Tick-N-Tick to do that.

[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:00.940]
I can do that.

[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:02.140]
Hi there, boys and girls.

[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:03.780]
Okay, there's playing backpipes.

[02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:06.220]
Here's sofa, King.

[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:07.140]
Here's a little that.

[02:25:08.300 --> 02:25:09.040]
Listen to me.

[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:10.940]
There's your standbinds need for sofa, King.

[02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:11.600]
There you go.

[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:12.920]
What, what else?

[02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:18.200]
Prison bitch, you were playing that this morning

[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:19.100]
when we were trying to communicate.

[02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:19.460]
Right.

[02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:20.000]
What is it long?

[02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:24.880]
But that's it.

[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:26.120]
What else?

[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:27.140]
What else can't we play?

[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:31.440]
Oh, you really want me to do this?

[02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:32.660]
What's that?

[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:33.380]
I have a folder.

[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:34.980]
What's the M&M one?

[02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:36.460]
Am I minus?

[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:37.280]
Yeah.

[02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:39.320]
No, not Uranus, Mayanus.

[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:40.740]
Uranus?

[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:43.720]
That's it.

[02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:45.020]
I have a forbidden folder here.

[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:46.320]
Let me try this out.

[02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:49.200]
If you love geometry and the assorted G,

[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:49.940]
I can't play that.

[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:50.320]
Yeah?

[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:51.100]
Right.

[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:51.460]
No way.

[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:53.540]
What else?

[02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:56.940]
Oh, here's the one.

[02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:00.560]
We can't say the titles of some of these things.

[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:01.200]
That's right.

[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:02.860]
I woke up this morning.

[02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:03.440]
That's it.

[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:04.080]
It's all we can play that.

[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:04.920]
And we just silly.

[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:07.100]
Bring back the memories of the stuff

[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:08.180]
that we can't play anymore.

[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:09.540]
What is that?

[02:26:11.540 --> 02:26:12.240]
Let's sit around.

[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:12.680]
Wow.

[02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:13.620]
Wow.

[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:15.640]
We can't play this anymore.

[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:18.900]
Hey, that's not fun to live.

[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:20.660]
She doesn't know about my home.

[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:20.820]
I don't know.

[02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:21.660]
I can't play this much.

[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:22.860]
We can't play him.

[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.580]
The fourth leader.

[02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:26.380]
The biggest names.

[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:27.740]
The best talent.

[02:26:27.980 --> 02:26:29.640]
It's the big dog, Joe Rose.

[02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:31.320]
Weakly morning, 7 o'clock.

[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:33.060]
Sports Radio 5.

[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:33.380]
6.

[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:34.400]
Q.A.M.

[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:34.800]
Z.

[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:35.600]
Sports.

[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:37.560]
What is Potsnap good?

[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:38.080]
It's great.

[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:50.400]
Don't bow guard the joint.

[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:51.860]
One breath.

[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:55.600]
Pass it over to me.

[02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:00.440]
Don't bow guard the joint.

[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:01.920]
My friend.

[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.240]
Pass it over to me.

[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:11.400]
Roll up this other one.

[02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:16.700]
Just like the other one.

[02:27:18.140 --> 02:27:21.500]
This is saying to be a pocket friend.

[02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:26.180]
And I need another year.

[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:30.740]
Don't bow guard the joint.

[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:32.200]
My friend.

[02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:35.520]
Pass it all around.

[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:40.820]
Don't bow guard the joint.

[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:42.460]
My friend.

[02:27:43.620 --> 02:27:45.620]
Just bad and old now.

[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:07.400]
Roll up this other one.

[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:13.400]
Just like the other one.

[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:18.020]
This will see you about spending.

[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:22.900]
And I don't have another sense.

[02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:27.940]
Don't bow guard the joint.

[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:28.900]
My friend.

[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:31.120]
Pass it over to me.
