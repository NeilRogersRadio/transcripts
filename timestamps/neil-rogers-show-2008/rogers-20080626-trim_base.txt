[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]
No, the strongest program of the VKT is the classic best-come remissions of WQM VKT.

[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.800]
What do you think?

[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.780]
About what?

[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.300]
The biggest VKT is the best talent.

[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.020]
Many people think your last name is just 430560W.

[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.340]
I think you all have the power to make a safe, as well as your color there.

[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.480]
No.

[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.840]
What?

[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.600]
That's what they say.

[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.680]
It's next week already.

[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.400]
On nature.

[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.280]
Yeah.

[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.840]
Madden.

[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.080]
What word did you say?

[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.400]
It's not.

[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.180]
Look at this line.

[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.880]
You can do what?

[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.520]
I don't know.

[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.200]
You're so surprised.

[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.940]
You know what you're saying?

[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.060]
What's going on, Chris?

[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.400]
To talk to Neil, dial 5, get the 8.5.

[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.960]
Kill us, the end day and brow.

[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.360]
You can order count on.

[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.380]
Call for our free.

[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.740]
87775.

[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.740]
Let me call you a news again.

[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.360]
I mean, kill your pound 560 on your AT&T.

[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.100]
Oh, I was fine.

[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.740]
It's all right.

[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.800]
The opinions expressed by Neil, his guests or his collars,

[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.020]
do not represent those of WQAM management, staff or sponsors.

[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.880]
Now the Neil Rogers show.

[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.180]
Oh, what a sorry.

[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.440]
WQAM.

[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.940]
Hey, dude.

[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.280]
Oh, that's obviously sick of blowin' by those.

[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.260]
It's all red and irritated.

[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.240]
Well, then you need new poons, stud strips.

[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.700]
Yeah?

[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.860]
Go here, try one.

[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.220]
You just take the strip and push it in.

[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.840]
Fine, you're a no.

[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.620]
And then you leave on a malpours minimum day.

[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.740]
You have seven guys.

[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.780]
And then you have to take it.

[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.420]
Oh, you can see where all the stuff goes.

[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.740]
Really?

[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.280]
Wow.

[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.340]
Let me see.

[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.260]
Oh, look at yours.

[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.260]
That's pretty gross.

[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.540]
New twins, Mr. Jensknot strips.

[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.040]
Now available in big schnauzsizes.

[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.860]
You can pick your friends, but don't, well, you know.

[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.460]
Yeah, we know.

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.400]
Anyways, 10-I-1 at 560 WQAM.

[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.020]
Let's do that.

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.440]
Oh, that.

[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.940]
I'm going to cough up a big brown and yellow and green.

[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.060]
Right.

[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.400]
All day.

[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.340]
But, I've got to have my hanky here to get rid of it.

[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.180]
Oh, I don't want to swallow snuff.

[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.540]
You ever stop thinking about that?

[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.660]
Yeah, and I try not to.

[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.320]
It doesn't come up from there from your intestines,

[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.780]
but nevertheless, you get to see that it does.

[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.020]
And if you swallow it, it's going to go right back where you just...

[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.980]
As long as it doesn't leave your body and then go back, it's not as gross.

[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.440]
Yeah, we keep your body and then go back inside.

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.780]
Never see people spit up into the air and then hatch it.

[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.300]
No, you just don't get around.

[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.020]
No.

[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.520]

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.900]
No.

[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.920]
We totally go to the party.

[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.540]
I wonder how Ellie felt she ever saw that.

[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.380]
I'll see you then.

[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940]
Okay, here's the schedule for today on QAM.

[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.280]
Anybody here to hear us today?

[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.440]
I keep reading these things about a horrible signal.

[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.420]
Even the blog thing that I'm going to read.

[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.320]
It's not really all that good.

[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.860]
William S. James, but I appreciate it so much.

[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.720]
Somebody actually wrote something on the internet.

[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.640]
Very positive about me.

[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.600]
Very asked-looking.

[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.620]
But he mentions the crappy signal and about how.

[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.700]
And it's horrible.

[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.880]
Anyway, we got there the jerk show from 2-4 this afternoon.

[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.180]
Mad Dog gets Shula's steak 2 from 4-7.

[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.340]
What happened with the Amarlin 10 minutes?

[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.920]
We don't got that tonight. Aren't they playing?

[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.880]
They're playing at 12.

[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.920]
The NBA draft show from 7 to midnight with Curtis and DA had rivals

[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.940]
and an ESPN radio overnight when everybody goes to sleep.

[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.200]
We hope because certainly nobody is going to listen to that.

[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.160]
So we got the NBA draft show tonight.

[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.100]
Maybe they can bring back-

[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.000]
There you go.

[00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.700]
Guess who died.

[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.860]
I got two celebrity deaths.

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.280]
Okay.

[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.660]
How many told you about?

[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.180]
I want to-

[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.740]
George Carlin.

[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.340]
Will George Carlin?

[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.640]
I love words.

[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.480]
I think if you're hearing my words, I want to say-

[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.020]
Okay, I'll tell you.

[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.640]
Wilbur Hardy, a farm boy turned grilled cook who went on to open the first

[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.280]
Hardy's hamburger stand in 1960.

[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.480]
Starting a chain that now has nearly 2,000 restaurants in the U.S.

[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.520]
and overseas died Friday at his home in Greenville, North Carolina.

[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.260]
He was 89. That's old enough.

[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.680]
Cost was a heart attack.

[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.320]
His daughter Anne Hardy rigged said.

[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.940]
Heart attack. He's dead.

[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.200]
That was a QAM, hello.

[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.900]
Yeah, I think 50% on your home monitor is in here.

[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.920]
It was on an empty lot of Greenville near East Carolina College that Mr.

[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.420]
Hardy opened the first hamburger stand on September 3, 1960.

[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.060]
There was no dining room, no drive-up window, charcoal-broad hamburgers,

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.380]
and milkshake sold for 15 set of peace.

[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.520]
There were now 1926 Hardies restaurants mostly in the southeast of the Midwest,

[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.520]
most of them franchises of CKE restaurants which bought the Hardies

[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.400]
chain in 97.

[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.500]
Last year the Hardies Division which specializes in thick burgers weighing from

[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.220]
a third to two thirds of a pound and costing up to $449 had revenue of $1.8 billion.

[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.460]
Although he would hold an interest in more than 80 other restaurants during his career

[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.620]
Mr. Hardy did not make much of a profit as founder of the Change It Pairs' name.

[00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.340]
He sold his share what was then a five franchise operation in 1963 for just $37 grand.

[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.360]
Back in the 60s it was pretty good money and Hardy rigged seven, but not that much.

[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.400]
Last year they had revenue of $1.8 billion and in 1963 he sold his share for $37 grand.

[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.260]
You think he died with any regrets?

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.480]
About it.

[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.620]
Born in Martin County, North Carolina Mr. Hardy was one of five children while we don't care about that.

[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.760]
Not interested in the family corn tobacco farm, the young Mr. Hardy got a job as a grill cook

[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.240]
at a local eatery.

[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.020]
W.W.W.2 he was a Navy cook in a Pacific while home on furlough in 45 he married Catherine Robuck.

[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.900]
His first wife died in 1980 and 1986 he married Helen Galloway and in addition he's survived by a whole bunch of people.

[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.340]
After W.W.W.2 he returned to Greenfield open a restaurant he and his wife lived in the back.

[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.480]
In the back of the restaurant by 60 when he opened his first burger stand he already owned 15 restaurants.

[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.360]
He took on two partners Jim Gardner and Leonard Rawls not Lou in 61 they opened a second hearties in Rocky Mountain with Carolina.

[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.000]
But typically these with his partner soon let him to sell his share.

[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.680]
I'm gonna be doing that all day.

[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:22.840]
But Mr. Hardy later started another burger chain called Little Mint which eventually had about 25 franchise locations in North.

[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.600]
What a green and South Carolina North Green.

[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.400]
No green not.

[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.600]
The hardy's chain grew by Leafs and Bounds in the 70s held helped in part by its jingle.

[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.360]
Hurry on down to Hardy's where the burgers are charcoal broil. I never heard that.

[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.000]
Did you? Maybe not.

[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.980]
And Hardy's rake setter father never failed to get a kick out of seeing the red and white sign of the hardy's chain.

[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.920]
Anywhere he'd go he'd probably see his name up there.

[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.360]
She said.

[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.520]
Kind of like us with all those billboards we have.

[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.520]
Aren't you proud as you drive around to see all those billboards for this show as perch.

[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.600]
Right. WQYM. Hello.

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.280]
Yeah.

[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.580]
Can I hear some sports in this radio station today?

[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.700]
What are you talking about?

[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.400]
Well you don't ever talk about sports you know.

[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.140]
Parts?

[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.480]
That's leading your headlines and you know give us some.

[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.580]
No parts.

[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.140]
No. No sports.

[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.400]
Yes sir.

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.100]
No. No chance.

[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.760]
All right. Have a good day.

[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.500]
Get a life.

[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.680]
Can we hear some sports?

[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.860]
Oh my god.

[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.200]
Will you?

[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.980]
Jesus.

[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.000]
He's only kidding.

[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.900]
Another guy that we have ever heard of.

[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.120]
Who?

[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.240]
Comet Love.

[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.920]
The costume designer helped puppeteer Jim Henson create big bird other sesame characters.

[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.980]
He was 91.

[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.380]
Plenty old enough.

[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.900]
He died from congestive heart failure Saturday in Pocipsi.

[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.620]
There was home in Stanford, New York.

[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.920]
His longtime partner Christopher Lyle told the New York Times.

[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.540]
His longtime partner.

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:57.840]
Yay.

[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.260]
Sounds like it to me, doesn't it?

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.140]
Okay.

[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.100]
In addition to his work with Henson Love was a designer for some of Ballets, most prominent choreographers including

[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.940]
Pryla Tharp, Agnes DeMille, Jerome Robbins and George Balanchine, Cheen.

[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:18.240]
Sesame Street Public Television's groundbreaking effort to use TV to teach preschoolers premiered in 69.

[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.860]
Henson designed the original sketches of Big Bird and loved and built the 8-foot-to-inch yellow feathered costume.

[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.880]
It was Rosadina and a few feathers designed to fall off to create a more realistic feel.

[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.840]
Oh yeah. There's no point in having feathers unless you're going to fall off.

[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:32.600]
That's right.

[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.920]
Here's your poll for me as today.

[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.080]
567 votes.

[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.500]
The suckiest aspect of my workday is my Paltry Paycheck 97.

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.160]
Dealing with customers of the public 70.

[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.960]
I see George Curtis in a waste of time cashed in that check.

[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.500]
I bet he lost all that money already.

[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:54.660]
Probably.

[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.240]
Well, why do you say that?

[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.460]
What do you say?

[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:57.720]

[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.200]
Yeah.

[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.520]
If he invested it wisely, he could make about 47.

[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:01.920]
Yeah.

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.100]
I think he's open to eliminate stand with it.

[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.200]
Dealing with customers of the public 70.

[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.320]
The commute 54.

[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.500]
I'm unemployed 51.

[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.120]
Work interferes with my list of the show 44.

[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.880]
Well, I didn't know that we're not going to accept that.

[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.500]
Quit your job right now.

[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.660]
I like everything about my job 42.

[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.140]
Oh, those 51 to say they're unemployed, that must be the callers.

[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.400]
My boss 38, sitting on my asshole day 28.

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.020]
My colleagues 23.

[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.540]
My workload 19.

[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.240]
The hour 17.

[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.280]
They use cameras or computer program to spy on a 16.

[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.660]
My employees 13.

[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.240]
My tiny workspace, cubicle or office 12.

[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.960]
Having to go back home afterward 10.

[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.600]
Having to wear professional garb 10.

[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.400]
Being on my feet all day 10.

[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.200]
Schmitty office equipment 5.

[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.660]
Two little time for lunch 5.

[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.600]
And having to go through a metal detector or security scan 3.

[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.920]
I like the one we have a QAM.

[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.120]
Just to keep out the pain in the ass invaders.

[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:56.440]
Yeah.

[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.920]
WQAM, hello.

[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.500]
Neil.

[00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.540]
I am doing today.

[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.040]
Okay.

[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.340]
I was listening to you mentioned the QAM schedule.

[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:09.060]
And I was just thinking I'm almost tempted, almost to listen to that draft show to see what they could possibly talk about all night.

[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.100]
For five hours.

[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.760]
For five hours.

[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.740]
They're going to draft one player and they're just going to go on and on and on.

[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.460]
It's almost going to move up and not down.

[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.800]
It's almost tempting.

[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.320]
Got to move up and not down.

[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.920]
Got to move up and not down.

[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.340]
That thing is just, I can't even find, I mean, I like Zach a lot as you know.

[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.400]
But it sounds like something that they would be playing across the street.

[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.740]
It's amateur hour.

[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.380]
You know what I mean by that?

[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.500]
Yeah, I know it even.

[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.800]
Like a bunch of little kids took over the radio station.

[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.000]
That happened a long time ago.

[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.980]
Oh, I see.

[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.880]
Much a little sport nerds.

[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.860]
Got to move up and not down.

[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.520]
Got to move up and not down.

[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.100]
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.940]
But Joe keeps playing it, which is good.

[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.360]
One thing about me, man.

[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.020]
I don't interfere with anybody else's deal.

[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.340]
You know, whatever their deal is, good, good for them.

[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.780]
More power to them.

[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.300]
Got to move up and not down.

[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.200]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:01.760]
That was that.

[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.920]
Precisely what I was going to say, but I don't want to take any chance because it might, uh,

[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.560]
some speed of might come out of there.

[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:07.900]
I don't know.

[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.560]
But that nearer I just, is always so full of hate and venom and speed of them.

[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:11.900]

[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.040]
Yeah, a venom.

[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.780]
You can hear the venom in his voice.

[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.280]
My favorite call of the whole year so far was that one on Tuesday,

[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.180]
that real dull sounding.

[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.400]
Are you ever happy?

[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.680]
Are you ever, yeah, when I hang up on eight holes like you.

[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.140]
And that's exactly what I told him.

[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.860]
Makes me, makes me, please just punch.

[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.280]
To, to listen to these idiots show their ass to the world and then just punch that button, man.

[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.620]
Punch their ass right out.

[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.980]
Are you ever happy?

[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.860]
You're so unhappy.

[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:38.420]
Yeah.

[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.060]
Yeah, you should have my problems, okay?

[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:41.680]
Idiot.

[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.140]
New portion of this program will be reproduced about the express written permission of WQAM

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.440]
Dude, welcome back to the Joe Roach show.

Rock'n'-round the clock tonight.

[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.580]
Rock, rock, rock, rock.

[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.760]
I love singing jingles.

[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.180]
Welcome back to Joe Roach show.

[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.180]

[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.200]
You see, uh...

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.060]
See the USA in your shed, relate.

[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.420]
Here comes our Gary Von Rass number one deal.

[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.860]
Blood, blood, fist piece.

[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.140]
Oh man, what a relief it is.

[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.600]
D'oh, I was here for kaboops cereal, man.

[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.080]
It has nuts, little bits of marshmallows, and all kinds of crazy things.

[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.380]
Yeah, you deserve a break today.

[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.160]
Hey, dude, thirsty?

[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.140]
Kabo-lai.

[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.400]
During the Pepsi generation.

[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.000]
It's a Joe Roach show, man.

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.840]
And I'll be back after this word.

[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.760]
Just a feel.

[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.940]
Hey, have I told you like a good neighbor?

[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:13.080]
Winston tastes good like a cigarette chorn.

[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.760]
Limits will never be the same.

[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.340]
We'll be back with more of the Joe Roach show, but first...

[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.080]
What will you have?

[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.680]
That's blue ribbon.

[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.940]
What will you have?

[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.780]
That's blue ribbon, dude!

[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.080]
What will you have?

[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.520]
That's blue ribbon.

[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:39.720]
That's blue ribbon, beeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:43.000]
Wonderful world of air condition shopping.

[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.580]
Lauder Hill Mall.

[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.420]
Lauder Hill Mall!

[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.740]
Goes ahead and leaves the middle of an orio first and sings the chocolate on the outside

[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.820]
for last!

[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.360]
I'll be back to rap things up after these few words.

[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:06.060]
Tum-tum-tum-tums!

[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.620]

[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:19.260]
Dude, Chaffer, is the one to have if you're having more than...

[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.460]
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.880]
You could take the elevator to the country but...

[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.320]
Exactly, I forgot this.

[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.100]
What I don't the bitch right now.

[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.260]
18 at 5.60 WQM is still a little scratchy with this head cold, but it's on the way out. I'm not dying yet

[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.300]
Which I know a lot of people out there for upset about that too bad. You're gonna die soon. You're gonna die. Yeah sure

[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.640]
Here's the pull for today. We have 494 votes and I bet your cris things we're gonna make 500 easy. Oh

[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.960]
I'm doing yes

[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.580]
2008 is already half over what's the policy don't forget gotta move up and up

[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:05.960]
Got it. It's just I don't I just I don't know why I just don't understand anything that's going on anymore

[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.140]
Get off

[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.360]
Oh

[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.820]
Okay, it's enough

[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.280]
2008 is already half over what's the most surprising thing that's happened so far this year

[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.940]
That's the whole question and of course this is a Charlie B pull

[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.200]
It's not a bad pull, but the problem is as usual with Charlie be it's too Neil centric you know I mean by that?

[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:43.520]
Yeah much about me and that's because Charlie is a groupie. I mean just a shameless shameless ass sucking groupie

[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.780]
That's fact. Oh my god Charlie get a freaking life would you please I have no luck god almighty

[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.460]
Most surprising thing happened so far this year Neil accepted a pay cut and re up with WQM

[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.720]
Winning hands down your pants 164 votes. Mm-hmm a

[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.660]
Black one the Democratic nomination 101

[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.120]
Gas it four bucks a gallon 63

[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.040]
Here's another Neil Neil actually surfaced for a rare public appearance 54

[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.160]
Charlie B was there right at the S. End of it. Thank God. Thank you. They're early

[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.300]
He is strange really strange. Am I right? Yes, yes, you are

[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.240]
He's not a lecture combination of Ikebog Crane and Rumpel Stiltskin

[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.540]
Okay, we didn't

[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.920]
Just picture in that. Hillary didn't win at 43 Tim Russell died 30

[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.840]
But 30 man all in his kid now, you know

[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:40.840]
He seems like a nice kid and he used to look really good, which he doesn't anymore because he's getting fat but

[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.240]
Larry had him on last night. I was channel surfing because I never watched Larry

[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.020]
I want to see somebody on there really like his Larry's full of crap and

[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.680]
Most of it's seeping into that bag

[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.020]
Larry's probably the only personality on TV that you can smell through the TV screen

[00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:00.040]
But anyway, he had among his other panel the panel look russered on

[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:07.200]
Going on about John McCain this and this what are his qualifications to be articulating his

[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.160]
Political opinions and crap other than the fact he was Tim Russell's kid. That's it

[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.040]
I'm sorry. I just I maybe it sounds insensitive, but it's just ridiculous

[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:23.760]
His his famous dad just died so now let's keep schlepping him around and put him on TV to open up a mouth like he knows something

[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.280]
Tim Russell died 30 George Carlin died 25 words. I think if you're hearing my words

[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.880]
The primary is lasted that long 13 and Joel Feinberg ditched the ticket only one

[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.320]
Nobody cares about you Joel

[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.080]
They just don't give a crap

[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.520]
So how the yesterday go George

[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.240]
What do you mean?

[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.220]
You mean the show yeah, oh, you know same as usual like pulling teeth

[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.700]
But I mean by that there weren't a lot of calls you have a lot of really articulate you're the one that gets the intellectual colors

[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:02.400]
Oh, yeah, I got them all don't you know, I sure don't know I get the kid that wants to produce

[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:08.540]
Sell his insurance to whatever it is and what was most of the other guy talking about I don't know

[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.700]
You remember Chris I took a second collar there and it's I don't remember yeah, I don't know

[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.800]
Not that we're ignoring your calls or anything like that, but it must have been so insignificant. I don't know

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.880]
I really can't I can't remember what the other guy I remember the first one because it said punky kid again the

[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.740]
Save 50% on your insurance guy. Yeah, that's his stick right I wish he was that's it. That's it

[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.680]
That's the only of his material

[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:38.200]
It worked for a long time on these things do they oh, yeah, he's probably working on it right now team effort 500 tree votes on the pool

[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:44.540]
Now William S James who's obviously a groupie. I have no idea who he is has a blog

[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.360]
Called

[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:47.660]
Called

[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:53.980]
The freedom to blog I don't know if that's the name of the blog or what the deal is the freedom to blog and

[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.800]
Yesterday he writes neo-rodgers liberal star at often bleak sky

[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:06.020]
But he like that, okay, it's I'll read it short. It's not it's I don't know

[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.380]
He says although he would probably say I'm cursed to live in such a cesspool such as South Florida

[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.040]
Radio Towshoe host neo-rodgers is one of the reasons I'm glad I live here

[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:23.380]
Rogers midday radio show is broadcast on 560 WTQ a sports a.m. Talk radio station to provide listeners with such a weak signal

[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:29.720]
That their attention is often tried to the limits and often interfered with by bleed over from a Cuban radio station 90 miles away

[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.360]
Oh such a weak signal. How do you like it?

[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.760]
But we still we listen he says

[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:41.980]
Rogers provides his distaste for the South Florida lifestyle and its inhabitants by broadcasting from his apartment broadcast studio in Toronto, Canada

[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:48.020]
So why do we listen while I can't speak for the rest of his audience who have consistently kept him in the top percentiles of the male

[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.060]
25 to 54 demographics until Joe Bell came along that is English speaking that is for myself

[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.600]
I've had extremely liberal leave it leading my entire adult life

[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.660]
I don't believe that we're labeled as such in my own mind till I start listening to you about 25 years ago

[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:04.960]
But more than anything else entertaining or least used to be anyway before Joe Bell came to town

[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.640]
I was first attracted to the produced comedy bits as show is always featured

[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.560]
But later realized that his rants were actually the opinions of an intelligent caring individual

[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.340]
Many who listen to him especially those who don't share his views but can't seem to turn him off might say he's nothing more than a bitter old queen

[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.520]
Those may be his own words if not a direct quote certainly in context. That's right. I'm a bitter old queen

[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.280]
They might even say his man who hates American everything it stands for

[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:32.820]
I would have to strongly disagree because very within those raves and rants are the words of man who cares

[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:40.660]
A great deal about his country and someone who tries to expose injustice in a quality intolerance bigotry and loss of liberty in an unfair and often bizarre hateful world

[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:49.500]
Neil God often ridicules the newest breed of media gods and goddesses and outwardly denounces the power and influence held by organized religion

[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.840]
As well as the evangelism attempted persuasion self-archives opinions of the followers of the various faiths

[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.920]
One of his book of Bryan standards is the hilarious my religion sung by stereotypical members of the various faiths

[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.300]
The tune of the calibration commercial song my dogs better than your dog

[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.560]
God and we move up and out

[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.900]
Catchy isn't it no it's annoying

[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.080]
Extraordinarily annoying. I mean enough to just make me go mad

[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.900]
Sometimes labeled a shock jock

[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.620]
I would only agree in the sense that the peer truth and nothing but the truth can be shocking and well

[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.920]
I think personalities of that genre are often manufactured acts and Uncle Niel's case the shocking aspect of his show is just

[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.500]
Nearages being himself

[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.880]
Bit of old queen I think if Neil ever met me probably wouldn't like me

[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.840]
And if he ever read this he'd probably find it offensive and accuse me of having no life

[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.520]
I have no life, but that's okay because Neil if you've taught me anything over a quarter of a century

[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.380]
It's not to take yourself too seriously

[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.940]
I like that for some real heavy duty ass-looking very nice

[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.660]
No, it was nice. Thank you. What do you miss James whoever you are?

[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.360]
And I'm not offended by anything like that

[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.200]
For today the giant speed the Patriots in the Super Bowl. No

[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:18.900]
That's just another

[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.120]
Dolphin

[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.720]
Wish her I think you might actually win three or three or four games this season

[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.440]
You know the big tunas in there the tuna and we all know what tuna smells like

[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.800]
What what pit is it and oh that's in that cage a bit

[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.780]
We all know what tuna smells like smells like hell. Oh my god

[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.160]
Especially when it's out there and baking in that hot sun. Can you imagine?

[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.900]
Ooh big tuna bacon on the 50-yard line what bacon

[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.080]
I don't have any now if you would be nice. I go to the store right now and I'd be back in 10-15 minutes much sense somebody

[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:59.340]
There's nobody here to send. I don't I don't have like um, you know gofers. I see who you're thinking of proud me

[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.800]
I guarantee you sound asleep at this moment. Okay. Wasn't thinking of anyone in particular

[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.660]
I just don't know who the hell else would it be the gofers were cheap

[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:07.580]
um

[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.820]
519 votes on to pull our goal is 525

[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.140]
26th June man right in the middle of dog base and you're expecting to do a show today here

[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.520]
I know that the lord even loves Neil Rogers

[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.820]
Tonight on Let's Watch Animal Screw

[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:41.200]
It's a dicey situation for the intrepid wildlife crew as they inadvertently interrupt a wild gorilla into mist orgy

[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:49.800]
Soundman Richard is made with a 500 pound silverback male follow the couple as they register at macy's and pick out a flatware pattern

[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.140]
It's all on tonight's Let's Watch Animal Screw

[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.400]
Can't wait now maybe you hear something in the background. You know what it is drums. No

[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.660]
It's gonna be

[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.740]
Oh, it was a hard roll little mo's chest. I'm not gonna close the door this time though. I think it adds a little something

[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:12.620]
I it's either that or gotta move up and out down gotta move up and out that

[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.160]
I just I don't know I mean

[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:21.280]
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the exact version that we got I go wrong. I don't have that you know I might think

[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.600]
Why not give me a minute. What's wrong with you

[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.440]
You got it in there you got it in the oven for it to come away found what

[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.060]
You hear how loud that is today. That's right

[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.120]
You're gonna have to go close that door. Why? I'm just kidding. You don't have to

[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.420]
It's nice. What do you think? Richard? I close it or not only goes down for about a hundred hours

[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.640]
He uh he ran out of here to go find that rat for you because I know we want to play it all day long

[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.640]
Oh, yeah, I think what we ought to do is play that since I still got a scratchy throat a little bit of this mucus

[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.500]
Uh, plate gotta move up and out cuz especially in honor of tonight's NBA draft. Mm-hmm

[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.680]
Aren't you gonna be tuned in for that what you'd be daft to mr. draft. I'll be busy

[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.640]
Doing what doing who that's right? Who knows

[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:13.100]
Oh, yeah, I saw this on Keith Obernol last night San Francisco to vote on George W. Bush sewage works. That's cute

[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.020]
In San Francisco

[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:20.160]
They're gonna hold a vote on whether to rename one of its large it. I gotta close the door. It's too loud even for me

[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:30.840]
Okay

[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:39.720]
Hey

[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.980]
What word did you say?

[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:54.500]
One two three four get the heat easier roast gotta gotta go up and not down gotta gotta go up and not down

[00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:00.160]
One two three four get the heat easier roast gotta gotta go up and not

[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.380]
Gotta go up and not down. I used to like him a lot

[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.940]
Zach I used to think he was really a good guy and a friend of ours and you know

[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.880]
They always like to know a good producer has to do what's expected on whatever show they're working on

[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.260]
but but

[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.200]
It looks and it's way better than what the other stuff that they're doing on that show now

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.780]
Why are you saying that nice? See now you make it seem like we're not in Joe, which I love Joe

[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.960]
Roe. I love Joe Roe because he knows it too. He's got a lot of exciting things to talk about. He just never does on the air

[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.800]
You've Christopher come back. I want to play that yeah

[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:45.740]
Now what do you think of what the George's puke puke out now? I don't know knocking the Joe Roe show

[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.620]
That's our strongest leading in a hell of a long time. I'll say to that. Yeah, it ain't like

[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.120]
Like that

[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.060]
And I'll tell you one thing that it definitely is not like I'll take your children

[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.040]
Sell them to some Haitians like that

[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.860]
Yeah, I think you know something

[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.660]
What got him move up and out down. I think that combined with a whole bunch of forl

[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.080]
Sure, I think they get us a 90-year. Please don't pay the effort. I know that's the wrong F

[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.500]
Anyway getting back to this thing San Francisco will hold a vote whether to rename one of its largest sewer treatment facilities after George

[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.840]
W Bush and what supporters describe as a fitting monument to the president's work

[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.480]
Every time I conflict that I just lied some uh, snot goodness

[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.320]
Not a lot of snot a little tiny bit

[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.220]
More than any five hundred signatures have already been gathered in support of the plan

[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.400]
13 there are more than the minimum required to get it on the November ballot. Well, that's very fitting

[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.420]
It's very apropos

[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.220]
Now can you hear that in the background or not? Yes

[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.880]
But not loud though not like before because they're out the dough closed

[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.560]
Nobody Q.A.M. Hello

[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.880]
You know who I am a mole green. I was making my phones when you're going out cheerly to

[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.620]
Nobody Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, good morning, Palli. Yes, sir

[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.800]
Yeah, I know where to put a good use to that wrap song next time you're about to poop your pants just sing it

[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.380]
Gotta go up and not down. Yeah, good point. All right, buddy. Take it easy. Okay, Palli

[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.760]
Okay, sweetie

[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.100]
Oh, brother, I'm gonna say I'm gonna have a rough time today

[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.340]
But

[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.380]
What I've been told oh look at that nice and dark green that's always a good sign

[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.740]
The dark green is the stuff that's been in your body the longest did you know that I bet you did probably I mean it makes sense

[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.180]
Huh it makes sense. Why is that?

[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.260]
Well, just that does the darker the older

[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.260]
That's

[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.940]
That could be wrong, but it just when you're old part like me when you're bitter old queen like me

[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.700]
You probably got flim in your body. It's been in there for like 60 years probably all of a row of a child. Uh-huh

[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.900]
Nobody Q.A.M. Hello

[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.620]
W.Q.A.M. Hello

[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.160]
You don't have any service for your listeners

[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.980]
I make you a M. Hello

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.280]
Two A.M. Hey, Neil. Did you see the Supreme Court ruling on the hand done?

[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.260]
Well, yeah, I got it right here now. Yes, they ruled it was unconstitutionally gun abandoned Washington. Yes

[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.260]
Yes, and now we get we're gunna

[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:36.080]
That's right because Ann and Scalia wrote the majority opinion and Ann and Scalia's a crazy son of a bitch. Yes

[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.420]
I'm sure we'll be looking for

[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.080]
Don't get your piece, okay, you know, 440 want to go by a few

[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:50.240]
Wow, see I shouldn't even work today. Oh, no, don't start. Don't start what?

[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.720]
You're you're you're like set yourself up to slack the rest of the day. I can just feel I'm not all right

[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.720]
But during the next break I'm gonna go get someone at the betley's cough syrup men

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.400]
So good there ads even say it's the worst tasting stuff in a world but it works and does work you probably don't have any

[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:05.880]
Hot

[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.680]
No, I've got to have any cold soup hot and sour or something like that

[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.880]
I could order some it's too early though. They're not open yet

[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:19.760]
You

[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.940]
You let's the pre-court rule today that Washington DC sweeping bad and hand guns is un

[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.140]
constitutional

[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:32.280]
The justice is voted five to four against the ban with justice and in Scalia that Nazi son of a bitch writing the opinion for the majority

[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.980]
I think they're done with my fired drill sounds like it

[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.800]
I have your attention, please. I have your attention. No, I'm busy

[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.040]
No, he's mumble now

[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:56.500]
I issue in district Columbia versus hella was whether the cities ban violated the second member right to keep in their arms not preventing individuals as opposed to state militias from having guns in their homes

[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.500]
And of course the supreme the constitutions has nothing about individuals owning guns

[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.680]
But not nevertheless

[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.860]
DC officials argue they had the responsibility to impose reasonable weapons restrictions to reduce violent crime

[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.760]
But several Washingtonians challenged the thirty-two-year-old law

[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.140]
Some said they've been constant victims of crimes needed guns for protection

[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:24.300]
In March to win and went before the justice is with starkly different opinions on the handgun ban

[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.180]
Ah, it's long I could read the whole thing but I better now not a lot of reading today when you got a coffee and puke and scratching

[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.740]
I think I'm gonna drink the whole bottle of that Bentley's that should do it

[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:43.120]
You ever drink that I think it's a Canadian product. I'm not sure. I like you know. I like the vix you know

[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.180]
Vix what

[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:45.940]
Formula 44

[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.560]
Oh, I can't find that. I'll call I do have Vix I could smear on my throat though

[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:57.260]
I do that when I go when I have a cold when I go to bed at night I smear Vix on my throat and under my nose you bet

[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.800]
You see how it helped yep

[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.240]
543 votes on a poll once we get to 600 Georgia's are gonna finish the show

[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.340]
ah

[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:07.340]

[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.440]
Get now.

[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.960]
Gotta blow up a thousand new projects.

[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.320]
420-560-QAM.

[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.140]
The Force Leader.

[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.860]
The biggest name.

[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.320]
The best talent.

[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.380]
It's the mad dog.

[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.600]
And a man that's captain Alan's 470.

[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.340]
This is radio 560-QAM.

[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.780]
The Force Leader.

[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.560]
Neil.

[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:30.620]
God?

[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.980]
You're no one.

[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.440]
You're the greatest decision ever.

[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:34.840]
How about it?

[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:42.800]
Packed my pizza and shoved it into my checkered pants.

[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.200]
Duh, duh, duh, duh.

[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.800]
Now you can't kick mo' without mo' mo'

[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.400]
All that makes got my mind so worried.

[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.640]
The best years of what remains of my life.

[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.620]
I gave to this place.

[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.020]
Just for old times I think I'll go in here on the views

[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.180]
of the blissfully pertinent room.

[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.160]
I've had enough for you to die.

[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.500]
Not using as the nobody I hate.

[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.440]
You've bested the struggle to leave your dead end.

[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.240]
You die.

[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.520]
You're no one.

[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:40.420]
Gonna stay home far away from here.

[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.640]
I'll hand my kids back to Ford and Carden.

[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.480]
I drove on cars.

[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.940]
I go to my orifice and lean out my desk.

[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:02.440]
That is if I only had an orifice or a desk.

[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.440]
I slept up to both Godhood of all weeks.

[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.520]
And watched the shoppers from a bench.

[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.260]
Let's go.

[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:18.520]
I wonder if Wayne in the mirror felt this way

[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:24.020]
when he got to end now for a day he did.

[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.040]
George, George, George, George.

[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:36.460]
George, George, George, George, George, George, George, George.

[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.540]
George, George, George, George, George, George.

[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.700]
I've been here but use for old queues.

[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.760]
They boys have left to me.

[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.220]
Who can win?

[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.780]
5-5-5!

[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.160]
10-46-14-4-11 at QAM.

[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.920]
See how that Bentley's just working all the way?

[00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.040]
Sure.

[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.180]
That is the Fowlest tasting crabbit.

[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.800]
It tastes like battery acid.

[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.140]
Ooh, that's how you know it's good.

[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.720]
Ooh, God.

[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.980]
Probably just...

[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:11.500]
Eats out all your innards.

[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.620]
Like, um, Drain-O.

[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.240]
Maybe that would be good.

[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:16.720]
Sure.

[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.280]
Liquid Plumber.

[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.140]
And I take back what I said about Liquid Plumber that I mentioned that doesn't work.

[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:20.780]
Yes, you did sucks.

[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.060]
Now, did you just fax me this thing about

[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.700]
Update Anchor Sports Radio opening at QAM?

[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.120]
I did.

[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.800]
Someone found it in fact that it's us and I, uh, passed it along.

[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.040]
Thursday June 19th, it's dated.

[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.620]
We can go today.

[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.700]
It says WQAM is looking for a full-time update anchor.

[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.480]
The ideal candidate must have on-air experience,

[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.020]
ability to communicate quickly and clearly,

[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:49.960]
and be able to prioritize local sports news and national sports news in a concise fashion.

[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:50.520]
Ah!

[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.460]
Kennedy must also be able to work very fast and work under strict deadlines.

[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.400]
Sports knowledge and production skills also require it.

[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.920]
And so what's the ideal?

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:02.960]
Who's who's leaving?

[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:04.640]
Don't know.

[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.500]
You know, there's a, like, rotating door in this place.

[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:09.940]
Who's leaving?

[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.040]
Not in.

[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.820]
How's Hendoin?

[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:15.540]
Fine.

[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.020]
Good?

[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.060]
Thank God.

[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.260]
Give him a big kiss for me.

[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:18.880]
I will.

[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.760]
He's one of the good people, Ken Moldin.

[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.220]
Yep.

[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.000]
And then we have some other people who are, you know, okay people,

[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.280]
but don't belong on-air.

[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:25.840]
A lot of those.

[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.360]
WQAM, hello.

[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:28.460]
Georgia.

[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:28.980]
Five.

[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.440]
WQAM, hello.

[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:31.880]
Neil.

[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:32.560]
Yes.

[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.180]
Hey, I'm liking the, I'm liking the Supreme Court this morning.

[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:36.960]
I'm hugging my gun.

[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.300]
Yeah, squeeze it.

[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.020]
Yeah.

[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.720]
In fact, put it to your temple and give it a shot.

[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.580]
He's loving us a pain card.

[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:45.400]
He's loving his gun.

[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.880]
Ah, ah, ah, good.

[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.620]
Only crazy people are in love with guns.

[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.420]
Only men with really teeny tiny penises are in love with guns.

[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.780]
Guns exist for one purpose and one purpose only.

[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.620]
To kill something.

[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:02.700]
Yeah?

[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.540]
Some people got it coming.

[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:05.940]
Yeah, well, that's true.

[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.800]
I never thought about that.

[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.560]
And handguns exist for only the purpose of killing other people.

[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.120]
Right?

[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:18.460]
But like Ray Perry said, if we had a lot more handguns out there,

[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.860]
it would bring a lot more people to a death.

[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:20.460]
That's right.

[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.360]
Isn't that what he says?

[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.220]
Something like that.

[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.560]
Like if we had like 400 more sports radio talk stations,

[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.700]
it would, you know, they could all have a chair like, uh,

[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.840]
like Steve Lap over there in James Crystal.

[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:30.420]
That's true.

[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.340]
We had last week about James Crystal broadcasting.

[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.300]
Oh, that told me everything I needed to know about Norma Kent.

[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.020]
He's obsessed with those people.

[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.400]
Those people are his idea of what this industry is all about.

[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.620]
And that's why you and I are still here.

[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.500]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:46.700]
Hello.

[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:47.920]

[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.360]
Daniel, Sid Rosenberg says you're a predator

[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.920]
and a bet the small children.

[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.220]
I tend to agree with them.

[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.280]
Yeah, okay, good.

[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.600]
Well, I have a great life with Sid.

[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.240]
I hope you two have a good time together.

[00:37:59.160 --> 00:37:59.880]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:00.780]
Yeah.

[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:01.600]

[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.760]
I'll give you credit for a woman, Least you're not here to...

[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.880]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.040]
Hey, Neil.

[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.040]
I heard you talking earlier about your sick and everything.

[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.980]
When I'm an ex-assiaral and I put some victim...

[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.460]
Right, good.

[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:14.820]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.880]
Now, George, it's time to Chris again.

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:18.920]
QAM, hello.

[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:20.440]
Hello.

[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.220]
Yes.

[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.220]
Bill.

[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.700]
Let me say it again.

[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:24.000]
Yes.

[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.220]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.060]
I don't know.

[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.140]
I've got a couple of things for you.

[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.420]
First of all, I need you to settle a bet for me and my wife.

[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.200]
Years ago in the radio, you gave a definition of what Hmong was.

[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.320]
Do you remember what that was?

[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:36.540]
Yeah.

[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.080]
No.

[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.360]
About the goat hanging from the tree?

[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.220]
The goat hanging from the tree?

[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:49.000]
Yeah, you came up with a definition of Hmong was the equivalent of hanging a goat from a tree upside down, hitting it.

[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.920]
And what comes out of its nose is Hmong.

[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.020]
Okay, I never said that, but I'm, you know, whatever.

[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.720]
Okay, well then I lost the bet.

[00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:04.880]
By the way, on your gun control, have George sent you the article in the herald today about the guy in Kentucky with a hangout that yesterday, uh, blew away like five of his coworkers.

[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.660]
Hmong.

[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.860]
That's what we needed.

[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.700]
If everybody had a gun, we had a lot more dead people.

[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.760]
And last but not least, I've been listening to you for 20 years.

[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.120]
I think it's the second time I call.

[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.500]
I still can't get over the fact that people call you with absolutely nothing.

[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.940]
Not that I contributed a whole lot.

[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.400]
Hey, listen, yours was, uh, you know, a stellar compared to anything else we've had so far.

[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.400]
Have a great life and you too.

[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.460]
That was an award winner.

[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:31.080]
Wouldn't you say it was like a coach in Jordan with the Jargers game.

[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.840]
You're a predator and I send Rosencranse Persons.

[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.100]
Oh, it says I use sock.

[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.960]
Yeah, this is the kid is filming a thymotha get up there with I'mus again.

[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.200]
Who?

[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.780]
A lot of think said Rosencranse dean.

[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.420]
Oh, maybe that's why they were talking about I'mus the other day.

[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.580]
See, one, like I said before the show today, there's only one additional thing I'll say about that.

[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.640]
I mean, we know he's old and seen.

[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:57.580]
I'mus, but how stupid can you be no matter what the point was he was trying to make when you get burned so badly

[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.160]
in the first time you don't go anywhere near the fire again.

[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.360]
Right?

[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.440]
That's what normal people do.

[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:03.720]
Right.

[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.340]
But in case you just got to look at death wish.

[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:06.720]
Right.

[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:12.960]
And so he just can't stay away from all the erasional comments and leaves himself wide open and they're sharped in on there,

[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.680]
opening up a big stupid mouth.

[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.100]
Like somebody died and left him the keys to the kingdom.

[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.120]
He's going to decide who's going to be on the air and who needs to be fired and all this other crap.

[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.700]
WCOM, hello.

[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:32.700]
And in the meantime, people like Michael Savage can get on here and say the most grotesque, hateful, bigoted garbage.

[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:33.880]
And that's okay.

[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.680]
5 6 7 0 5 6 6 8.

[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.960]
Gotta move up and down.

[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:38.740]
Gotta be.

[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.900]
Well, I sure we oughta start the draft show now.

[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.340]
Let's get that rally on the phone.

[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.020]
Great idea.

[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.240]
Yeah, and then we can just eat while the draft show is going on.

[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.920]
I think we got that.

[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:50.620]
I could be wrong.

[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:58.080]
I think we got one drop in that goes like, I'll find it.

[00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.380]
Here it is.

[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.340]
Draft this.

[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.160]
Oh!

[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.340]
Like that.

[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.840]
WCOM, hello.

[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.620]
We've all been bo-

[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.680]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:14.380]
QAM.

[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.200]
Holy cow.

[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.780]
How about them cubbies?

[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.220]
It meant pathetic.

[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:23.880]
Sad.

[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:24.880]
Didn't they get beat?

[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.440]
I think they've been losing lately.

[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.040]
I'm not sure.

[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.060]
Marlins, by the way, lost 15 to three last dodges in case you missed that.

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:36.220]
To those devilish dev arrays.

[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.940]
Oh, we can't have a name like that for our team.

[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.460]
The Lord is going to be so upset with tapah good.

[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.940]
If the Lord were smart, he'd low-temperate off the map.

[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.000]
What a horrendous place, man.

[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.360]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.340]
Yeah, it's, uh, I keep singing that thing too.

[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.660]
I can't get out of my head.

[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.040]
Yeah.

[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:55.720]
I catch it.

[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.820]
It's funny, but I'm not so funny.

[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.300]
It's pathetic.

[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:41:59.300 --> 00:41:59.520]
Yeah.

[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.320]
It's writhily, but, uh, I don't even move up and I'll sound.

[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.860]
Gotta move up and I'll down.

[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:06.060]
Yeah.

[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:13.340]
But anyway, the thing is about, and who cares about the damn coach of the heat, Andy Rothman,

[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:13.760]
anyway.

[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.160]
Yeah, exactly, huh?

[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.480]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.300]
Yeah, aren't you dead yet?

[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.780]
Uh, I'm working on it.

[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:22.980]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:26.040]
Justin Jackson is a moron.

[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.100]
Ow!

[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.220]
That's all.

[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.320]
Now, by Tuesday, I'll be just like brand new.

[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.000]
That is if I leave right now, go back to bed.

[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:40.620]
No, no.

[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.060]
Just a joke.

[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:42.480]
All right.

[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.940]
Oh, and don't forget to join George this Saturday.

[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:45.740]
It's right.

[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.540]
It's right.

[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:51.280]
At the AT&T store at 5644, northwest 167th Street in Hylia.

[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.080]
But you should have a tremendous turnout in a location like that.

[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.140]
I'll play my card, right?

[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:55.820]
Yeah.

[00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:00.540]
Come by for great deals on the hottest phones like the Sony Ericsson Walkman 580L plus

[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.100]
ask about AT&T Navigator.

[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.180]
Get turned by turn directions right from your phone and use it to find lowest gas prices

[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:07.660]
in the area.

[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.020]
What does that mean?

[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.220]
Get turned by turn directions.

[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.140]
In other words, it's got a GPS right there on your phone.

[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:12.680]
Oh!

[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.180]
That'll tell you where all that will work out.

[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.700]
All that will get some great Q&A prizes too.

[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.120]
The usual low budget crab deck we give away.

[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:23.860]
George will be there noon to two of this Saturday AT&T store at 5644, northwest 167th

[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.880]
Street in Hylia.

[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.840]
Not really.

[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.320]
It's 2 a.m.

[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:27.640]

[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:29.860]
Good morning.

[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:30.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:31.540]
When is the hour?

[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:31.860]
Hello, I'm OK.

[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.220]
I just can't stand this guy's showing Hannity on Fox News.

[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.620]
I mean, they're a big or not be in the world in hell.

[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.500]
Then why do you watch it?

[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.740]
Well, I was flipping through actually that I was reading out on Fox News.

[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.960]
Why would you watch Fox News?

[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.040]
Well, I'm going to tell you.

[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.860]
You should let me talk.

[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:47.920]
Yeah.

[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.520]
Could you read out Flank and Spock?

[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:50.420]
No.

[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.240]
You don't.

[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.180]
Do you like outflank?

[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:52.640]
No.

[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.380]
No.

[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:53.480]
No.

[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.340]
But I like him.

[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:54.880]

[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.560]
Well, I think he's funny.

[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:01.060]
Anyway, he talks about Hannity and Combs and Hannity's in very very big letters and Combs

[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.940]
is in tiny little print because it's a notsystation.

[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:04.340]
Right.

[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.320]
I wanted to see what Spio came out of his mouth.

[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.700]
It was revolting.

[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.200]
I mean, he's saying that Democrats want $4.50 since the gap.

[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.280]
We don't want to drill.

[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.160]
Is that the dumbest thing you ever heard?

[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:17.880]
Yeah.

[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:18.440]
Well, I want to.

[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:20.020]
OK.

[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.060]
Let me say it again.

[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:21.860]
Let me say it again.

[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.200]
Don't watch Fox News.

[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.280]
See, he's already gone.

[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.020]
He's giving me a song to dance about if I would let him say something and I'm trying to

[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:29.660]
have a conversation.

[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.760]
But he's not interested.

[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.140]
He wants to hear the sound of his own voice because he had something so profound to say.

[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.240]
But Fox News is a bunch of notes.

[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.640]
He's in Sean Hannity's elunatic.

[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.040]
Like that.

[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:39.900]
That's a bulletin.

[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.140]
Write it down on your wrist, George.

[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.020]
Don't forget it.

[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.220]
OK.

[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.520]
Get the best hours.

[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:44.920]
Get it.

[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.700]
This is your last.

[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.280]
Forty-two-five-sixty-two-a-m.

[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:48.680]
Me.

[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:49.360]
Fourth.

[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:49.480]
Six.

[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:49.900]
Later.

[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.440]
The biggest news, the best talent.

[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:59.260]
You're listening to Sports Radio 560-wQ-a-m.

[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.520]
Miami Fort Lutter Dance.

[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.020]
This is a new Roger Shale.

[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.720]
You're—you're—you're—you're—you're—you're—you're—you're—you're—your brain.

[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.480]
No, no—no, no, don't worry.

[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.640]
Any question?

[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.360]
I love words.

[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.540]
I thank you for hearing my words.

[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.340]
I wanna say something about words that I…

[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.680]
I think it's important.

[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.580]
I love what I say to my work and my play, to my fashion words.

[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.520]
or all we have really. There are some people that aren't into all the words. There are some people that have you not used certain words.

[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.960]
Yeah, there are 400,000 words in English language and there are seven of them. You can't say on television.

[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.720]
What a ratio that is.

[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.040]
3993 to seven.

[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.860]
They must really be there.

[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.080]
They'd have to be out ranges.

[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.020]
They'd be separated from a food that large.

[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.320]
All of you over here, you seven.

[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.040]
Bad word.

[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.440]
That's what they told us, they were remembered. That's a bad word.

[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.420]
You know the seven, don't you, that you can't say on television?

[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.580]
Those are the heavy seven.

[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.900]
Those are the ones that'll infect your soul.

[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.040]
Curve your spine.

[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.620]
Keep the country from winning the war.

[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.180]
And it doesn't even belong on the list, you know?

[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.940]
Sounds like a snack, doesn't it, huh?

[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.240]
Yes. I know, it is, right.

[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.220]
I mean, noone abyscoed.

[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.480]
The new cheese.

[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:38.940]
Pizza.

[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.900]
Sesame.

[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:40.840]
Onion.

[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:42.780]
Cater.

[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.860]
That's the candy, just whoa.

[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.000]
Oh, that stuff started to work down.

[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.920]
Good. Got some nasty green crap coming up.

[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.420]
And some flim too.

[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:04.600]
Love it 0-2 at 560 WQM, 560-705-60.

[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.220]
Look at that phone, man. It's pretty lame, pretty lame.

[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.140]
Pound 560 and they've arrived in singular wireless line.

[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.760]
You notice the one thing we got now is that we're acquiring new collars

[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.020]
who each one of them has the same thing to say every time they call.

[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:19.940]
And they do it every day.

[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.120]
Every single thing.

[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.480]
Now they call you on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.060]
You know it. Really?

[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.480]
What you think you're special?

[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.680]
No, that's true. I never thought about that.

[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.120]
I don't know. I didn't know.

[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.560]
I don't want you to feel left out.

[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.340]
I'm not.

[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:36.980]
Oh, wait, I'm looking at the phone right now.

[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.160]
I do feel left out myself.

[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.900]
579 on the pull. Our goal is 600.

[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.420]
Once we get to that, we're just going to play.

[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.640]
Got to move up. We get to not down.

[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.860]
Whatever that is.

[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.220]
Don't forget we hit the NBA draft five hours tonight,

[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.900]
seven of midnight, because our management

[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.240]
are sicker than hell, man.

[00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:54.700]
They're sick, crazy people.

[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:57.620]
WQM, hello.

[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:01.440]
QAM.

[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.160]
Yeah, I want to get on with Neil.

[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:03.960]
You're on.

[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:05.480]
Neil.

[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.160]
Yeah.

[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.740]
Yesterday on the late night.

[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.280]
I don't know if you happen to catch the trade between

[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.880]
German and Neil and DJ's board.

[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.460]
No, because I don't care.

[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.860]
Covering out just the NBA draft.

[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.380]
Turn it up a little louder.

[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.680]
Yeah, turn up real loud.

[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.580]
Okay, in fact, sit on it and the radio too.

[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.720]
I don't know if you happen to catch the trade

[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.940]
between a good life.

[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:28.980]
I have no luck.

[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.820]
Schmuck, five six seven, oh five sixty pound.

[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.960]
And for you know something, I think that pull we had the other day

[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.880]
about all sports radio.

[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.000]
That is the most evil thing that ever came down to pike.

[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.900]
That was the end of life and the world as we know it.

[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.880]
They certainly did this industry as we know it.

[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:48.200]
Much of lifeless, overgrown children who like to

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.280]
little with balls.

[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.100]
WQA and hello.

[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.340]
Yeah, yesterday when I called these shows.

[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.980]
Yeah, when you called it was it was a same-phone-e-accent.

[00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:58.900]
I was in the same phone-e-accent.

[00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.980]
Where's the heat kept?

[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.240]
WQA and hello.

[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.440]
I called you to show yes of the news.

[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.300]
And I know.

[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.360]
Yeah, they're passing it back and forth now.

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.680]
That's a new attack.

[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.420]
I guess they're writing out the material now.

[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.760]
It takes them a long time.

[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.520]
They stay up all night.

[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.400]
Now they're working on it.

[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:16.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.000]
And material too.

[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.620]
Five six seven, oh five sixty pound, five sixty.

[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.420]
Now you know you could take a poll on the gun control thing on the Supreme Court.

[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.100]
But it is really pointless as you know.

[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:27.400]
Yes.

[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.260]
Because the gun nuts, they love their guns.

[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:35.280]
It's the American way of life and nobody don't in fact the most popular response last time we did one.

[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.520]
Don't effort my guns.

[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.900]
Don't effort my guns.

[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.300]
It's America baby.

[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:41.220]
I'm John Wayne.

[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.020]
I got my piece.

[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.000]
I got a whole bunch of packed away somewhere.

[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:45.700]
Don't mess with my effing guns.

[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.100]
That's America for you.

[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.820]
So that'll be the response you get if you're I mean you know do whatever you want.

[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:58.440]
But I'm just suggesting because then of course newsmax.com all the other right wing the right wing nut job

[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:02.460]
websites start creeping you know all of them as with my guns.

[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.780]
WQA M hello.

[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.020]
Hey how you doing?

[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:06.720]
Okay.

[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.220]
I will go over and got my birth tend to see you on vacation with my family.

[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:11.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:17.140]
And I hear these people talking and your day was kind of white and probably had a lot of sheets in the closet meal.

[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.240]
And they're saying that if Obama gets elected they're going to have to do something to rectify it.

[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.580]
And I kind of said, but what's that mean he goes?

[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.100]
You know what I mean?

[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:31.160]
I said we got all this kind of ammunition and surface air missiles and bazookas.

[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.580]
It's going to have to do a joke.

[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.520]
I mean is that like very naive or are these people?

[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.000]
Oh my god.

[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.960]
I was talking about very naive.

[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.580]
Why would anybody go on vacation to Gatlingburg Tennessee?

[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.800]
Well my family wanted to go up there to Tennessee now.

[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.360]
Oh my god.

[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.580]
I gagged your rhythm.

[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.940]
I dump them all.

[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.320]
When you get rid of your family if they made you go to Gatlingburg Tennessee?

[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.640]
I don't think I've ever been there.

[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.380]
Well don't.

[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.400]
WQA M hello.

[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.900]
No thing like you thought about.

[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.220]
QA M hello.

[00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.980]
Any other morning or while you?

[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:00.560]
Okay.

[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.700]
I went on your website and I put some pictures of George.

[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.580]
He's so ugly.

[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:05.340]

[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:07.840]
Oh my god.

[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.380]
Yeah I guess he won't be asking me out then.

[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.100]
It's alright I got a lot of them.

[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.160]
Oh my god.

[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:19.580]
Oh we've got some shocking news here just so that you just facts to me from the scum sentinel.

[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.560]
Let me find the appropriate drop in.

[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:27.260]
Here it is.

[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.820]
I wanted to give you the real thing right now.

[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.340]
Ryan Norcross.

[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.220]
You fairy.

[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.100]
Well became a household main coaxing South Florida through Hurricane Andrew 92 says this

[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:37.760]
unsentinel.

[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.720]
It's calling it quits as a TV weather forecaster.

[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.640]
We're going to have to come up with a new weather furry.

[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.820]
Now that Miss Kamal's in the slamer and Brian Norcross is leaving Channel 4.

[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.000]
Norcross 57 is notified officials of Channel 4 that he will not renew his contract which

[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.420]
expires Monday.

[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.600]
So we can focus on this private emergency communications business.

[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.120]
Last time I'd be on the air was Tuesday night.

[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:01.740]
He's done.

[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.280]
Won't see him no more.

[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.880]
It's going to be a funny feeling personally sent in a review but I just know it's the right

[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:08.200]
thing.

[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:13.020]
After watching reports about flooding in the Midwest, Norcross said he realized he could

[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.840]
no longer provide quality hurricane coverage and also tend to America's emergency network.

[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:21.460]
The firm allows residents and TV stations to receive emergency alerts and other critical

[00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.880]
information during a hurricane or any other disaster.

[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.240]
Norcross created the private venture along with Max Mayfield, former director of the National

[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:28.980]
Hurricane Center.

[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.000]
Sean McDonald present in GM of Channel 4 said the station had hoped that Norcross would

[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.360]
continue his role as a hurricane specialist, a disaster specialist.

[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.860]
If you see him on your screen, you know it's a disaster.

[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.100]
We respect this decision we regret that for now, a no longer play rule with our weather

[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:51.380]
team McDonald's on a statement, Brian's wildly respected as one of the country's leading

[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.420]
hurricane experts and will always have the gratitude and admiration of this community

[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.260]
for his efforts during Hurricane Andrew.

[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:56.840]
You ferry.

[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:03.780]
No crosshair national recognition as well as any award for his 23-hour marathon broadcast

[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.960]
advising staff for millions have a survive the category 5 hurricane August 24, 92.

[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.200]
McDonald said the door is still open for Brian to return it something.

[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.380]
How come those of us who were working our asses off around the clock at Iodina have

[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.080]
never got any awards?

[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.240]
Not that I'm big on awards, but how come we never got any recognition?

[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.100]
Radio.

[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.460]
I'll screw them.

[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.420]
Screw you TV people, okay?

[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.020]
I don't know too many people with battery operated TV sets.

[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.080]
I know they have them, but not how many people have got them.

[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:31.800]
I have the word.

[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.100]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:34.440]
Yeah.

[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.040]
A lot of people have battery operated radios.

[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.300]
In fact, when they tell you how to prepare for a hurricane, one of the things they

[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.500]
tend to have is a battery operated radio.

[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.740]
Not TV set.

[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.560]
McDonald said the door is still open for Brian to return it sometime in the future.

[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.780]
A possibility that our cross is not ruled out.

[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.500]
That we've been a bit about.

[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.440]
Brian or cross is done.

[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.240]
592 votes on Chris's poll.

[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.700]
He's pretty pleased about that.

[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:08.220]
And by the way, before anybody else calls about how Chris looks or I look or George looks,

[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:09.180]
we're all ugly, okay?

[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.360]
Everybody knows that the pictures are right there.

[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.180]
How we do with those pictures, by the way?

[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.860]
What do you mean by the black man?

[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:18.620]
Who said, yeah?

[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:19.680]
WDQYM, hello?

[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:20.580]
Radio.

[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:21.460]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.560]
Hey, do you believe that this guy in North Cross, they're going to throw a parade for him?

[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:26.960]
Who said, yeah.

[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.100]
That's what they said, they're saying.

[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:30.380]
They're going to throw it down Andrew.

[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.460]
No, you're getting confused.

[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.600]
It's a Pride Week.

[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:34.800]
Oh, okay.

[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.220]
It is.

[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.400]
At least it is here.

[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.160]
I don't know about there.

[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:40.840]
It's Pride Week.

[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.460]
That is in Pride.

[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.820]
Six hundred votes even on the poll now.

[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.560]
I can go back to bed.

[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.440]
Is that really true?

[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.620]
They're going to throw up parade or is he just making that up?

[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:52.940]
I don't know.

[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.180]
Got him.

[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:55.240]
Move up and down.

[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.280]
You're psychic, man.

[00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:58.120]
What do you mean?

[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.060]
The Zack opens the door and you start singing that.

[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:00.760]
Oh, no.

[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.020]
Why do you open the door?

[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:02.600]
I don't know.

[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.560]
I guess he wants to do it live.

[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:04.600]
And the son or two?

[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:05.880]
Give him a microphone there, Chris.

[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:08.480]
I don't lie him doing that live or recorded.

[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.840]
That's the most embarrassing thing.

[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.480]
I've got to go up and not down.

[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:18.100]
One, two, three, four.

[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.400]
What else do you want Neil?

[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:21.980]
I got it.

[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.360]
What do you want?

[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:29.760]
Beasley or Rose?

[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.940]
Bruce Beasley or Joe Rose?

[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:34.600]
Yeah, sir.

[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:41.160]
I think it would be a real hoot if a kid named Beasley got back to body beat.

[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.000]
Life on the New Roger's stove.

[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:52.360]
Three, four, get down.

[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.680]
Beasley or Rose?

[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.360]
Got to go up and not down.

[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.400]
Got to go up and not down.

[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.880]
What else do you want?

[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.680]
Like I said, we have 600 to 200 votes on the poll.

[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.440]
I'm going back to bed.

[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:04.000]
Here's George.

[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:05.720]
Sorry.

[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:06.380]
Let me get him out of there.

[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:06.720]
I'm sorry.

[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.080]
Get him out of there.

[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.060]
Oh.

[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.920]
Oh, this is the all we do are at the end of the hour.

[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.040]
We're going to be doing our thing.

[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:15.480]
Right.

[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:21.280]
Our Neil Deal for rivals, which that would go pretty good that always does.

[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:21.860]
Yep.

[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.380]
There's certain places that go on like in a heartbeat.

[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:26.300]
And there are other places that they're not all that's from me.

[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:27.880]
Which may be very, very good.

[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.480]
For example, what was the place in Hollywood?

[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.380]
I love.

[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:34.300]
Saratoga.

[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:34.860]
Saratoga.

[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.460]
That we still got some leftover for there.

[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:38.520]
And why George is phenomenal about it.

[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:39.160]
Right.

[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:40.400]
There are things about it.

[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.900]
Well, you know what Brian Norcross would say.

[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:47.300]
What?

[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:47.980]
It's big.

[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:48.620]
Hi.

[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.960]
This is Brian Norcross for your WQAM official information set up for Hurricane George.

[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.320]
Don't panic.

[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.160]
Get your water.

[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:55.940]
And run.

[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:56.800]
Run.

[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.620]
We're going to die.

[00:56:59.320 --> 00:56:59.620]
Oh.

[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.980]
The biggest names of the stars.

[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.680]
This is your largest sport with your 560 QAM.

[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.480]
The fourth leader.

[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.560]
The third leader.

[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:17.860]
The third leader.

[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:17.960]
The third leader.

[00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:18.040]
The third leader.

[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:18.360]
The third leader.

[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.240]
The third leader.

[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.960]
The third leader.

[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.220]
The third leader.

[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.200]
The third leader.

[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:30.200]

[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:30.900]
The third leader.

[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:31.280]
The third leader.

[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:31.720]
The third leader.

[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:31.820]

[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.040]

[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.140]
The third leader.

[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:32.140]

[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:32.140]

[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:32.140]

[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:32.300]
The third leader.

[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:32.440]

[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:33.600]
The third leader.

[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.160]
The third leader.

[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:38.440]
The third leader.

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:38.440]

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:38.440]

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:38.440]

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:38.440]

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:38.460]
The third leader.

[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:38.720]
The third leader.

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:38.720]

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:38.720]

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:38.720]

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:38.720]

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:38.720]

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:38.720]

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.060]
It got to work a little hotter on the nest you want.

[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.420]
I rose, you judiciary.

[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.300]
There's a lot of hot drizzles.

[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.260]
That's right, watch your back and come back.

[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.560]
Well, you won't wait for no, no bow.

[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.900]
But you'll bat back and you won't wait for no bleeding.

[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:24.860]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:54.840]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, above, above the clouds Oh, above theulating stars oh, above the illumination of untold flowers it's twelve என by, above the望 sky turns you to a monster and broader defines him, that all is my true obsessed friend no longer appears, real unconscious contain

[00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:00.360]
The rising thing that's happened so far this year, Neil accepted a pay cut and re-up for WQA

[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.400]
and one of Puts, 199 votes.

[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.740]
A black guy won the Democratic nomination 127.

[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.140]
Gas hit four bucks a gallon, 80.

[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:08.820]
Oh my God.

[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.020]
Neil actually served us for a rare public appearance, 64.

[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:13.860]
Hillary didn't win at 49.

[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.320]
Tim Roscied died, 37.

[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.820]
George Carlin died, 34.

[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.600]
I love words.

[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.600]
The primary is lasted that long, 18.

[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.680]
And Joel Feinberg gets the ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket,

[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.720]
ticket, ticket, ticket, ticket, one.

[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:27.920]
One.

[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:37.560]
Wow, he's busy with his auto racing career and girlfriend beating career and whatever

[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:37.900]
else.

[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:43.140]
I think he got out there just in time if he asked me before he had lost any more money.

[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.840]
One thing about Joel, he knows when to pull out.

[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.380]
615 votes on the pool, man, our goal is 750.

[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:52.900]
I just made that up.

[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.540]
What do you think Chris?

[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:54.020]
750?

[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:55.020]
Yeah, then we can do that.

[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.300]
I mean, this is a, well, when did I put this on here?

[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.100]
Oh, last night, late last night.

[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.040]
So it didn't have like much of a head start.

[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.580]
Let's get some new cars on here today who want to call and have some really brilliant

[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.160]
discussions and solve the problems of the world.

[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:10.660]
What do you say?

[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.280]
You think?

[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:11.580]
No.

[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.300]
And pound 5, 60 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.780]
Keep in mind that it's not tourist season, but nevertheless there might be a few people

[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:23.860]
in South Florida from other parts of the world who are listening to the show right now and

[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.900]
want to get, you know, they want to soak into flavor what South Florida is really all

[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.160]
about.

[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.960]
You follow what I'm saying?

[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:30.860]
What's it all about?

[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.140]
And they can do it from these calls on his show.

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.800]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.780]
Q-A-M, Ola.

[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.600]
Oh, no, there's a good one.

[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:41.460]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.560]
Yeah, if you sign the news, need to.

[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.920]
Oh, God.

[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:46.720]
Ah!

[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:47.740]
Ah!

[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:48.500]
Ah!

[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:51.420]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.120]
Q-A-M.

[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.840]
I'm punching this thing and nothing is happening.

[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.580]
Wouldn't that be bad if all of a sudden got all from one jet?

[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:02.500]
Trashajik.

[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.700]
There it would be sad.

[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.620]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.240]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.860]
You like it?

[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:10.620]
Ah!

[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.180]
Oh, there it is.

[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.060]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.820]
Hey, ah, Neil.

[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:19.680]
Yeah.

[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:21.620]
Ah!

[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.400]
Man, he's off days of killing me.

[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.080]
Anyhow.

[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.120]
Ah!

[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:27.600]
Yeah.

[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.860]
I really got nothing to talk about now.

[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.460]
Why did you, let me ask you a question.

[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.660]
Why did you dial the number?

[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.380]
I don't know because I like this show.

[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:44.180]
And I thought I could come up with something funny from the time I called to the time he picked

[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.620]
up.

[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.360]
Sometimes I'll say a couple of things now, man, in the last item.

[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.340]
But I don't know.

[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.900]
I really pooped out this time.

[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.500]
Yeah, well don't poop out again.

[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.360]
We'll get some great poop on.

[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:57.640]
And poop on it.

[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.000]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.540]
Remember what I just said only moments ago about the intellectual of those?

[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.200]
People with some brilliant observations about life in general and south road is specifically.

[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.140]
What about Futsi?

[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.860]
What are we going to do about him with the Red Nose reindeer?

[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:10.540]
What do you mean?

[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:11.600]
I don't know.

[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.880]
I don't pay any attention to him anymore.

[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:13.600]
Is he still on the ear?

[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:14.440]
I don't know.

[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.480]
You're the only one who pays any attention to your QAM.

[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:16.700]
Hello.

[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:17.700]
Hello.

[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:19.980]
WQAM.

[01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:20.180]
Hello.

[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:22.300]
You are a predator.

[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:24.500]
WQAM.

[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:24.700]
Hello.

[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:25.740]
Hey, good morning, Neil.

[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:26.480]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.440]
Two things.

[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.480]
A possible shameless request.

[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:30.400]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.680]
Rubbin on Jesus.

[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.480]
May I come on Jesus?

[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.900]
You're not going to need it?

[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:36.760]
No, it's too long.

[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:37.460]
It's too long.

[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:37.700]

[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.880]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:44.120]
And how about an idea for Bokobry and the BB King song when Love came to town?

[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.160]
Just put when Joe Bell came to town in there.

[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.040]
I like that.

[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:47.580]
That's good.

[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:47.980]
Okay.

[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:48.820]
Thank you so much.

[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.380]
Is it a good call?

[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.880]
When Joe Bell came to town.

[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.200]
When it went fat ass, Jolly, Joe Bell came to town.

[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.700]
Oh, oh, oh, Neil.

[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.620]
Did you see this article?

[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.020]
Neil.

[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.300]
Leave me alone.

[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.400]
Joe.

[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.180]
We have five and a half years to go.

[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.500]
I'll be here every day when I'm physically capable of doing it.

[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.360]
Other than that, leave me alone.

[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:11.680]
Take care of George.

[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.560]
Oh, by the way, speaking to take care of George, you ever called Bob Green?

[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.280]
I'm sure you didn't.

[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:15.940]
No, I keep forgetting.

[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:16.780]
Well, why not?

[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.540]
I keep forgetting.

[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.120]
Maybe he's got something for us.

[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:19.380]
Maybe.

[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.340]
But I keep forgetting.

[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.640]
You're pathetic, you know.

[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:24.260]
You're gonna.

[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:24.840]
I'm gonna.

[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.540]
I'm gonna do this.

[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.160]
I'm gonna go do this.

[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.440]
Yeah, and then I get high and forget.

[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:28.380]
Yeah, right.

[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.060]
Everybody QAM, hello.

[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.140]
Hey, Neil.

[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.880]
You know, first of all, there was a study somewhere.

[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.660]
I think it's like over 75% of people were done in their home.

[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.760]
Usually the criminal users against them first.

[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.860]
Anyway, for them to get to it.

[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.220]
No one.

[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.960]
Number two is going to be a little painful, but I'll stay anyway.

[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.440]
You know, first they got over a long ago.

[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.060]
And then only Joe can, I know you hate hockey park, but no one's even called and said anything.

[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.500]
I can't freaking believe it.

[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:54.340]
And the excuse they used is because one of the new guys, first of all, it's going to be their goalies for the...

[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:54.920]
Nobody cares.

[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.860]
Yeah, I know.

[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:57.180]
I know.

[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.080]
Take care of George.

[01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.520]
You got Jacques Marton.

[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.400]
You got a frog.

[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.960]
A loser, a born loser for the GM.

[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.280]
And a coach that nobody ever heard of, obviously, works cheap.

[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.500]
Nice going, Alan Cohen, destroying the organization.

[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.240]
Here's a man who came in and knows, has no idea what he's doing.

[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.060]
But he's the owner now because Wayne dumped out.

[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:16.920]
Wayne bailed out.

[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.500]
Went and doubt Wayne bailed out.

[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:19.500]
All the time he does that.

[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.360]
Did you notice that pattern?

[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:22.240]
Nope.

[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.640]
0.5, 60, and a Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.240]
Boy, you're right.

[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.400]
They're pretty slim and grim today.

[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:32.780]
Slim pickens.

[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.180]
WDQA M Hello.

[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.860]
Hi, they're mailers.

[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.520]
What are you talking about?

[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:38.720]
WDQA M Hello.

[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.140]
Hello, Neil.

[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:40.880]
Yes?

[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.700]
I was trying to find a good machine this weekend over at a...

[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.140]
Nick Asuki.

[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.060]
Out of the whole place.

[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.760]
I only found two video game poker machines out of the entire casino.

[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.800]
I thought that was pretty crazy.

[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.360]
But I got a question.

[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:00.660]
When you see that the 7-0s now get blackjack, you would assume that probably in the next 10 years games like Crabson,

[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.880]
who might make their way down to Florida.

[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.260]
What do you think are the odds that there would ever be a sportsbook?

[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.740]
Would you say maybe about 20 to 25 years before they would allow something like that to be?

[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.480]
I hope it had any idea and I couldn't care less.

[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:12.640]
All right.

[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:14.760]
Yeah.

[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:15.940]
Couldn't care less.

[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.020]
Sportsbook.

[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.320]
Bending on G.A.M. is man.

[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.120]
Perfect for this radio station.

[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.040]
I'll never forget when we first came to QAM.

[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.000]
It's one of the most depressing things I've ever seen.

[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:29.340]
All these punks, all these producers, these punks running around.

[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.520]
And they all had compulsive gambling here.

[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:32.660]
They all had their own bookies.

[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.040]
And it was like hanging in the hay.

[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:35.920]
We're like their mentors.

[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.340]
And they were like all a punch in their guts out.

[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.060]
I never worked in a place like that.

[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:41.420]
Did you?

[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:42.780]
No.

[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.400]
It was a culture shock then and I'm still suffering from it.

[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.480]
What do you think about that Yankee game?

[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:52.280]
How many points you give in the South-Excavator?

[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.220]
How many, I mean, what are we talking about here?

[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.320]
What are we talking about?

[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.820]
Crazy people is what we're talking about.

[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.060]
Yeah, the idea that we could have a full casino in South Florida is so revolutionary.

[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.240]
I mean, how many, and then of course, Casino Stan will be calling in again about that.

[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.040]
Can you believe that, Callie, other day?

[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.420]
I told him, oh, this and I told him that.

[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.660]
He is the gambling maven.

[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.660]
That's something you can bet on.

[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:26.740]
If anybody's talking about Casino's or any kind of casino gambling, Casino Stan will be there with his rickled up pants and a rickled up head.

[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.380]
Let me go pass this one.

[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.000]
Let me go pass this one.

[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:29.760]
He's the rickled up head.

[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.020]
And I go by FDQAM.

[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.840]
The fourth leader.

[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.760]
Howard David's a bitch.

[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.120]
Dad was having trouble remembering my son's name.

[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:39.620]
How are you?

[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.560]
What now, Grandpa?

[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.600]
For a young man with very little experience, he's done very well.

[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.440]
And doing everyday things.

[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.420]
What are you doing with that bow and arrow?

[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.840]
I know how to boil.

[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.720]
These problems may not be normal aging.

[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.360]
They could be early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.780]
I have the oldness.

[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.000]
The oldness it takes to...

[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.500]
I give it as mild to moderate Alzheimer's, aerocept can help.

[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.900]
I admire respect.

[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.280]
My great, great, great grandchildren.

[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.860]
Parasept is helping him do better because we want to increase people's taxes.

[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.380]
If it's Alzheimer's, aerocept can help.

[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.400]
I am very happy to be a fireman.

[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.760]
Oh yeah, he's a real panic.

[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.300]
1131 at 560 WDQAM, a 25-year-old press operator,

[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:30.340]
shot and killed five co-workers and himself.

[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.940]
And a plastics plan, rural western Kentucky just hours after arguing with a supervisor,

[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.140]
about not wearing safety goggles and using his cell phone while on the assembly line police said yesterday.

[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.720]
He got pissed off and fired up, baby.

[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.460]
And in America, when you get pissed off and fired up, you know what you do?

[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.320]
You go get a gun.

[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.480]
You got one there?

[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.360]
No, I got some ribs and I'm eating them.

[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.960]
Oh, all the food is there already?

[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.220]
Well, I'll be damned.

[01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:58.920]
And booze.

[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.680]
From rivals, food and booze.

[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:01.980]
Oh, God.

[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:04.480]
They were good drinks over there and they liked to share them.

[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.920]
Authorities said Wesley Higden, if Henderson, Kentucky, was so riled by the argument with a supervisor,

[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.160]
they called his girlfriend and told her that he wanted to kill his boss.

[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.600]
Oh, that sounds like a plan.

[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.500]
The girlfriend didn't warn anyone police and just two hours later Higden argued with another co-worker,

[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.940]
then shot and killed the supervisors they walked outside.

[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:25.520]
Then he returned and shot at co-workers in a break room and on the plant floor.

[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:29.200]
A man who called 911, frankly described the violence, seemed to have dispatched her,

[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.140]
tallying up the number of dead around him.

[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.340]
There's more than two people there.

[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.480]
There's like one, two, three, four, five people dead a man said the supervisors dead too.

[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:43.460]
Authorities said Higden was known to keep a 45 caliber pistol in his car, which is not illegal and Kentucky.

[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.780]
You can be damn sure of that.

[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.000]
And then good old boys, they're packing it.

[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.100]
They're packing heat.

[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:51.100]
And not in their pants either.

[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:55.240]
The first shooting took place as the supervisor was escorting him from the building.

[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.960]

One worker was injured and being treated in the critical care unit at St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center in Evansville, Indiana.

[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.400]

[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.680]
Henderson Police Sergeant John Neville said a news conference.

[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.400]
The plant operated by Atlanta based Atlantis Plastics, employs about 160 people

[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.040]
and makes parts for refrigerators and plastics signing for homes.

[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.280]
He was pissed off, baby.

[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.080]
Went to his car, he got his peace.

[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.940]
Now he's not pissed off like he told himself to.

[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:42.740]
Four of the five victims, remember, is the same Michael's Catholic church in Seabree, Kentucky, said the Reverend Jason Reclure,

[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.760]
who had spent most of the morning with the victims' families.

[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.280]

custom films for industrial and packaging uses,

[01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:00.280]
and molded plastic pieces used in products such as appliances and recreational vehicles.

[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.340]
But a big fatibu, but about this, this goes on every day.

[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.460]
Sign America, man. They love their guns.

[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.480]
You get pissed off? Kill a box of people.

[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:16.260]

and a four-man ballot that included Ralph Nader and Bob Barr,

[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.020]
voters chose Obama over McCain,

[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.840]
48-33%.

[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.760]
How do you like that?

[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.300]
You like it?

[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.620]
Oh, that's right, you're eating. I'm sorry.

[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:45.080]
Yeah, whatever. Yeah, I like it.

[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.120]
Eating ribs.

[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.300]
And what are you eating near Tubby?

[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.780]
We got them sliders over here, the Kobe beef sliders.

[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.680]

Ribs.

Ribs, sliders, and chicken wings,

[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:55.880]
and wings,

[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:57.680]
and things.

[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.840]
I'm drinking poor too, I'm sure.

[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:01.260]
Uh-huh.

[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.060]
658 votes on the pool, but we are really on fire.

[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.260]
We're flaming on the, uh...

...on the website.

[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.160]
And on the phone, it's a different story.

[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.160]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.120]
QA and hello.

[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:18.740]
Meal.

[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.400]
Meal.

[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:22.080]
Yeah.

[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.100]
Is it true that the sub-cendant was rehiring Jim Sani?

[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:29.680]
Who knows and who cares?

[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:32.600]
But you care?

[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.160]
No. Do you care?

[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:35.000]
Yes.

[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:35.640]
Why?

[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.920]
Because I want to know about broadcast sports.

[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.140]
Oh, yeah. He, he, he don't even own a radio.

[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:41.920]
Are you kidding me?

[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840]
Get out of here.

[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.900]
Are they rehiring Jim Sani?

[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.460]
This is the kind of stuff that South Florida worries about.

[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:52.300]
Is the Sun Sentinel gonna rehire facturred Jim Sani?

[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.100]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.060]
Hey, Taco, your game.

[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.780]
Yeah, no kidding.

[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.180]
638 votes on our award winning pool.

[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.020]
And no calls on the board.

[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.260]
Which, in this case, maybe just as well.

[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:10.720]
Let's have to do it.

[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.420]
Mmm, food though.

[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.800]
I'm not eating any food, okay?

[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:14.460]
Pig.

[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.160]
You should cow.

[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.160]
Cow.

[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.240]
Just shovel it down.

[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:17.960]
Get a shoe horn.

[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.260]
Just get a, uh, good Kobe Sliders.

[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.860]
Get a crowbar and just shovel it down your fat.

[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:23.740]
Purs, kill yourself.

[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.500]
You don't need no crowbar.

[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:24.820]
That's okay.

[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.460]
His jaw actually unhinges, you know, kind of like a snake.

[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.020]
Shhh.

[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.200]
Tragic.

[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.860]
There's nothing wrong with a good meal.

[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.900]
But you're just, you're just out of control.

[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.800]
You're bigger than life itself.

[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.780]
You're going to be dead before you're 40.

[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.800]
You'll never make it to 40.

[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:41.980]
I love you too.

[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:42.680]
Am I right, George?

[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:43.860]
There's no question.

[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.820]
We'll be, we'll be mourning another big fat dead person who wouldn't listen.

[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.740]
Stop being a cow, okay?

[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:55.540]
Okay.

[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.560]
Okay, is he, is he shoveling it in there?

[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.540]
Yeah, yeah, I can hear it here.

[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.320]
I'm eating a Kobe Slider.

[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:02.840]
What do I want me to do?

[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:03.680]
How is it?

[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:04.520]
Awesome.

[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.220]
That's a got cheese, you know.

[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:07.740]
It's got a little bit of cheese on it.

[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.520]
It's got some, um...

[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:11.620]
Yeah.

[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.700]
Try to find out what the, uh, the garnish that's on top of it.

[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.040]
It's kind of like...

[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:18.180]
It's kind of cheese.

[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.240]
What is it?

[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.900]
A grilled tomato.

[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.540]
A grilled tomato.

[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.180]
Mmm.

[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:24.340]
Clovers.

[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.640]
Onion jam.

[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:29.080]
Onion jam.

[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.160]
Oh, I jam on it.

[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:31.360]
I'm right.

[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.260]
Like a red onion jam.

[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:32.260]

[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:34.440]
I'm, I'm pretty PO that you're there and I'm here.

[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.620]
Because I could use it, see, would like, nurse me back to health.

[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:38.400]
You don't need it.

[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.380]
W-Q-A-M-H-O.

[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.620]
Q-A-M-Pig-Fest, hello.

[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.160]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.960]
I want to ask you a couple questions about things that you said.

[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.440]
Uh, what is plunging your guts out actually mean?

[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.860]
Well, what, what do you mean, what does it mean?

[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.780]
Well, what do you think it, what do you think it is?

[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.320]
So, what did it come from on, I'm, you know, I made it up.

[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:04.020]
Okay, and what's the, what do you think it means?

[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.540]
I think it means playing with a lot of machines.

[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.580]
No, I mean, any kind of gambling.

[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.640]
Okay, and what's the, what's the, what's the key?

[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.920]
Let me, let me tell you right now, you know what the biggest problem in the world is?

[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.000]
Can I tell you?

[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.400]
I'm listening to many dumb goyem.

[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:29.220]
567-0560, pound 560, I mean, Verizon singular wireless line, make no mistake about it.

[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.420]
There's no, no, no, nothing is even a close second.

[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:34.400]
WDQA M, hello.

[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.720]
Neil, the garage is a lazy, it's fire drugs.

[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:41.860]
Yeah, I, I was so lazy, I'd have, what's his name, screen of calls there.

[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.380]
Chris, if he weren't so lazy, and we keep your stupid ass off the air.

[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.380]
You know, I was thinking about that during the last break, which I don't think about a very often banked skyd.

[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:55.680]
But here are these two morons, and this is their life.

[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:00.380]
This show every day, this is their life.

[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:00.700]
Right?

[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:03.420]
That's it, there's nothing else.

[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.040]
I'm calling over it, over it, over it, over again with the same stale garbage.

[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.980]
And you notice the fascination of the obsession they have with you by the way.

[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:11.920]
Oh, I know, it's a deep...

[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.520]
Jarge is gay, Jarge is ass, Jarge is hard.

[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.880]
They're life, fire, Jarge.

[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.220]
It's a deep heart kind of a love.

[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:18.340]
Mm-hmm.

[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.080]
And this is their life.

[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.160]
As fast as redol can read all the phone, that's all.

[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.120]
And they make tapes of it, and they make a CDs of it, of the calling out the show, and other show.

[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.000]
And this is their life calling the talk shows.

[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:29.820]
They're proud of it.

[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.980]
And of course, what they're shouting from the ragtors is...

[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:34.500]
I have no life.

[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:34.740]
Right.

[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.300]
Deputy QAAM, hello.

[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:44.960]
You know, I definitely agree about the too many dumb goyam, but there's also a lot of scheming, conniving Jews, man.

[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.060]
You got to agree.

[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:46.840]
Mm-hmm.

[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.040]
And let me tell you something else.

[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:54.460]
So, let me ask you, if you're not a mooching little Mexican, you're not in 15, huh?

[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.080]
You, you got to be a mooching little Mexican?

[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.720]
Is George right in your material for you or what?

[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.800]
Yeah, he's sent it to him by email.

[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:04.300]
Yes, right now.

[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.640]
I'm sure he's given it to you.

[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.140]
And the material too.

[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.820]
Six hundred forty-four votes on the full.

[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.560]
Nothing about George.

[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.280]
Anybody I like is Scott.

[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:13.880]
Well, whatever, whatever.

[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.040]
Any boy I don't do with that?

[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:15.220]

[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.740]
I have nothing to do with that.

[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.080]
What do you blame in me for?

[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.280]
What do you mean by that?

[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.740]
You're the one that went on the air, but the fact belly again, I went down the air by one.

[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.920]
The fact, I didn't say anything about what's going on up there.

[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:26.560]
You're the ones.

[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.240]
About the facts.

[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.360]
Facts of life?

[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:30.900]
Yeah.

[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:31.780]
What facts?

[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.640]
About your life up there.

[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.180]
I didn't go on the air and spill any of that.

[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.240]
These people depends based on what's obvious.

[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.860]
Based on you talking about somebody no to no.

[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:42.480]
Shameless.

[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:43.540]
Shameless.

[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.180]
The sacks remain.

[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.040]
I had nothing to do with that.

[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.160]
Shameless and outrageous.

[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:46.640]
It is.

[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:47.340]
What are you doing?

[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:48.180]
You don't know enough of you.

[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.600]
You don't even know about the birthday party.

[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.440]
No, that's not what you mean.

[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.460]
Yeah, the birthday party.

[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:52.600]
What the fuck!

[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:53.000]
What the fuck?

[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.020]
You're the one who didn't know that.

[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.060]
I am the fourth leader.

[01:16:58.440 --> 01:16:59.080]
You're a band.

[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.800]
Hello, this is it, Miss Heather.

[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:08.060]
And I don't know I'm Sean, just in all these stuff we've had these to make me feel like a little big-time.

[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.380]
He dropped crowds.

[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:12.100]
He said, wow, that's like a baby sum.

[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.600]
I don't know who his little girl is.

[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.140]
I'm the one who's the big guy.

[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:16.140]

[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:16.140]

[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:16.140]

[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:24.540]
If we need a teeny, buddy, little 40 shots, a tube shot in his shot, maybe I love really hot.

[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:31.240]
He didn't fake that anyone would notice. He'd look like a Hershey's kid.

[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:39.460]
Hershey's kid, he didn't be. He has a really good rock, but wasn't blessed with a ball.

[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:45.220]
That's no truth. He has no, I bet posh proud that so, damn.

[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:56.580]
He has nothing to love. That's why his voice. So just like a chick, my baby skinny soccer home.

[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:26.560]
He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy. He's got a baby, buddy

[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:46.100]
It's amazing, isn't it? It is shocking. Four T-tail noon at 5'60. WDQ AM. George and Rei昕 are eating at

[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:55.700]
Wee whee, whoop whee, whoop whee, whoop? Whoop whee, whoop. Whoop whee, whoop. Whoop whee, whoop whew, whoop whee. Whoop whew, whoop. Whoop. Whoop whee, whoop whee, whoop whee. Whoop whee. Whoop whoop whew, whoop. Everybody else are together right now.

[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:00.680]
Beef, cheese, lettuce, good lettuce, and then put some taco sauce on them.

[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:04.320]
Little ones like red and green onions, and I got some Kobe beef sliders that I'm saving for last.

[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.620]
Because they're the best.

[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, it is not a colon and boar, man.

[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.300]
I've said these are the dog days, is the understanding of the century, which makes it even much worse.

[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:20.700]
Because one thing about the acronics, it didn't make any difference.

[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.840]
What time of the year it is, where most other normal people are, who might have some kind of a life.

[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.860]
These people are always here, depend on it, make no mistake about it.

[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.980]
Am I right? Yes. Yes.

[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.960]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.640]
Pound 5, 60, and the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.220]
I'll wait. Just like Santino, I'll wait.

[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.920]
Deputy QYM, hello.

[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:47.540]
Hello.

[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:48.360]
Yes.

[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.320]
Am I online? I'm in your room.

[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.140]
Yes. You are? You're on right now, yes.

[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:53.680]
Yes.

[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.800]
Yes, you are.

[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:55.740]
Can you put some music?

[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.100]
I beg your pardon?

[01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.240]
Can you put some music?

[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.280]
What does that mean?

[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.740]
Like, you know, music. Like, I want 100 music.

[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.820]
What are you listening to?

[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.600]
To your show.

[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.400]
Yeah, then why do you want to hear music?

[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.800]
For a little bit. Just like, a little break.

[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:13.740]
No.

[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.020]
Why?

[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.720]
Because it's not a music show.

[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.800]
I know, but don't you want to just like take a break sometimes?

[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:21.460]
No.

[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.140]
You want to get a call like this? I do. I want to break my neck.

[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.060]
No, I don't do that.

[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.040]
What do you want to hear?

[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:30.360]
For a little bit.

[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:30.840]

[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.120]
Yeah.

[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:33.920]
And...

[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.900]
I'll figure out if you'll call.

[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:37.480]
Yeah, I'll go to the bathroom.

[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480]
And then the place you can do.

[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.440]
Okay, well, don't do it again.

[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.140]
All right.

[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:40.720]
Okay.

[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:44.200]
I don't know. See, in her case, I think she'll take my advice.

[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.560]
Could you play some music?

[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.220]
Could you play some music?

[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.280]
Oh, I got better than that.

[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:53.700]
Do you?

[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.880]
She was a community.

[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.240]
No, that's not it.

[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:59.920]
I am CDA Cruz and I am dead now.

[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:00.540]
That's it.

[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.900]
Yeah, let's play some CDA Cruz.

[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.680]
Or let's just play music.

[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.060]
Or we could always play a...

[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.660]
Gotta go and move up and I'd go.

[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.000]
Or we could always play a...

[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:09.000]

[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:09.400]
Don't burn over again.

[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.900]
Don't you share. Guaranteed.

[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.360]
No, forget we got that big NBA draft show.

[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.200]
You got to be daft to listen to the draft.

[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.340]
For five stinking, long, excruciating hours,

[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.680]
seven of midnight tonight.

[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.740]
Only crazy people would do that.

[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.440]
Only people insane, like a management of this radio station.

[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:30.480]
Crazy people.

[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:39.500]
People who sit at home and sniff dirty, old, smelly, sweaty, jock straps in their spare time.

[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.140]
And everdaily they have a lot of it.

[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.080]
WQAM, hello.

[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.060]
QAM!

[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.920]
QAM, hello.

[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:45.980]
Hello?

[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:47.800]
Yes.

[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.620]
Yeah, hey Neil, I wanted to ask you, are my ambient?

[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.280]
Yeah, sounds like you, yeah.

[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:54.320]
Oh, okay.

[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.600]
I want to ask you, what is the... is it a rumor?

[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.100]
Or is it the thing that's possible that South Florida is going to come to its own state?

[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:02.640]
And...

[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.680]
What do you think the cap will be?

[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:05.720]
Or do you think it should be?

[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.140]
Let me say it again.

[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.260]
No, it's not going to happen.

[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:10.580]
Okay.

[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020]
And do you want it to happen?

[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.060]
You know what I want?

[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.360]
You just want it to happen.

[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:17.400]
That's what I want.

[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.060]
Just call the end.

[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.140]
Oh wait.

[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:27.380]
Gotta move up and out down.

[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.480]
Gotta gotta move up and out down.

[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.100]
You know, there's one thing that's always just...

[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:38.320]
Remember, at IOD, we had a kid from Cincinnati who came in and recorded that rap.

[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:39.640]
Remember that?

[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:40.780]
Sure.

[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.840]
I remember what his name was.

[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.240]
I remember he looked pretty good.

[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:44.540]
Cory?

[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.020]
Yeah.

[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.600]
God, what a memory you got.

[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.320]
How can you remember that?

[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.620]
I saved the tape because Rick and Suds introduced it.

[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.280]
Oh my God.

[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.120]
His mom had money.

[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:53.760]
That was all.

[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.280]
And I sat there and I watched an amazement.

[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:56.840]
It was...

[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.320]
The settlement.

[01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:58.800]
Sure.

[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:02.560]
Why was this white kid trying so desperately to be a black rapper?

[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:02.940]
You know?

[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.600]
I don't understand that whole thing.

[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:10.580]
I guess because blacks supposedly are cooler than white people.

[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:11.400]
They invent cool.

[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.080]
I see everything that they do because they're black.

[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.400]
The young white guys want to be as black as they can without changing their skin color, of course.

[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:22.420]
But they want to be as black and culturally as they possibly can.

[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.160]
I think it's something that you ought to send a note up to IMS.

[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.380]
Maybe he can talk about it tomorrow.

[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.380]
Good plan.

[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.040]
Napi-editors.

[01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:31.900]
In fact, maybe you can get a hold of...

[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:34.880]
Well, Sud Rosencran shortsteen and the predator and he can...

[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.560]
You know, maybe place for the national predators.

[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.880]
And he can pass it along to his good buddy.

[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.780]
The I-man.

[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.180]
Well, I-man.

[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:44.120]
I sure hope you're not going to get fired again, I-man.

[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.680]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:48.880]
I-N-E-L wonderful program.

[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:50.960]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:52.980]
A-N-E-L, Ted Bell here.

[01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:54.640]
Venter of the big potato.

[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.120]
Luminum full trick.

[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:56.780]
How you doing?

[01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:57.960]
The what?

[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.000]
I'm the one invented putting the aluminum floor around the big potato.

[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.260]
Around your ass, yeah.

[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:03.580]
Huh?

[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:04.900]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:06.980]
Q-A-M, hola.

[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:09.740]
Hello, Leo.

[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:11.160]
Hello, yes.

[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.180]
Leo, are you still like Luis Miguel?

[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.920]
He's alright, he's got a fat ass, he's okay.

[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.620]
What's your favorite song?

[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:18.880]
What's your favorite song of it?

[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.240]
I don't know.

[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.080]
Oh, one more thing.

[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:23.820]
Georgia's crevendomaricone.

[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.140]
You wish.

[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:30.900]
Same old boring, tired monotonous crap.

[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.000]
Madicone, Madicone, Madicone.

[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:37.180]
All kinds of stories out of heaven by the way.

[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.020]
They try to have a gay-were pride parade there.

[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.980]
And all of them in a Catholic church is all pissed off

[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:45.480]
because they're doing things to decrease homophobia

[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.560]
and make people more sensitive.

[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:49.760]
Like not killing quite as many fags.

[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:53.860]
And probably that's because Raoul is in charge now.

[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:54.460]
You know Raoul?

[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.380]
Yes, I don't know.

[01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:56.860]
Deputy Q-A-M, hello.

[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:00.360]
Deny it, don't believe it, don't believe it.

[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.200]
Come on out here.

[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.780]
To a clock, that's all we got.

[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:05.940]
Don't ask me why.

[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.900]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.280]
Hello, Catholic.

[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.380]
Q-A-M.

[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.420]
Hello, I speak the deal.

[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.460]
Speaking, yes.

[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.260]
Hey, Neil, how the hell are you?

[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:16.860]
Okay.

[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.500]
Uh, you know, I just heard a, uh,

[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.780]
you earlier you were saying that, uh, you were full of venom.

[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:22.700]
I don't think you're full of venom.

[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.660]
I think you're full of crap.

[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:24.900]
But I think you're full of venom.

[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:25.420]
Yeah.

[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:28.540]
And...

[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.680]
Oh, and that was it.

[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:30.760]
That was a Medlea's material.

[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:31.160]
Great.

[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:31.700]
Excellent.

[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.440]
Talk about crap.

[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.520]
That was the crap, Maister.

[01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.500]
6.62 and a pool of divas still eating or what?

[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:43.160]
Do they bring food here?

[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:43.700]
I'm still eating.

[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:44.860]
I hope not.

[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.580]
Especially for Chris.

[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.300]
And we would like to at least have Chris come back and finish the week with you tomorrow.

[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.700]
Yeah, our drinks are a dessert.

[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:53.260]
Yes.

[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.440]
And one of the drinks.

[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.680]
I have a cake.

[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.460]
You can bring it up here.

[01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:58.640]
Mm-hmm.

[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:02.060]
Don't forget we got that coming up in just a couple minutes.

[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.160]
And George is a second lady.

[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.420]
I'm going to get all the thick tongues here in a minute.

[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.680]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.820]
Well, that guy, that guy really...

[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:12.800]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.020]
Hi, Neil.

[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:14.600]
Good morning.

[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:15.460]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.360]
I just wanted to ask you a question.

[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:22.480]
Is there any intelligence left in South Florida anymore that lives to the radio?

[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:23.120]
No.

[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.580]
What the hell is happening to this town?

[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:27.420]
You tell me.

[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:28.660]
I don't know.

[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:32.200]
I've listened to talk radio for 25 years.

[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.380]
I was like out of high school.

[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.600]
And it used to be interesting.

[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:39.800]
And it used to hear opinions and have discussions and like intelligent conversations.

[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.020]
And now people are just calling to hear their silly voices on the radio.

[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:43.240]
Right.

[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:43.580]
You got it.

[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.160]
It's stupid things.

[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.560]
It's so sad.

[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:48.200]
And it's embarrassing.

[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:53.100]
It's embarrassing for this entire community that these people can't call and have a...

[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:57.640]
a serious or a, you know, intelligent something to say.

[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.620]
Well, let me know when that's going to start again.

[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.360]
Well, no, you let me know because then, you know, I want to go back to listening to it again

[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.060]
and maybe learning something about...

[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:07.340]
Uh-huh.

[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:08.440]
Thank you very much.

[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.640]
We were all learning something.

[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.720]
But we're learning there's idiots left that listen to talk radio.

[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:14.200]
That's it.

[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.860]
No, there's idiots left in South Florida.

[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:16.620]
That's what we're learning.

[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:17.580]
Lots of them.

[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.640]
That's so sad.

[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:21.140]
But I think you're great.

[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:22.340]
I think George is great.

[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.120]
I appreciate what you do every day.

[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.600]
I'm glad you're going to stay on the radio.

[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.840]
And I hope they put George on more because it's all good with you guys.

[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:30.320]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.760]
I think Noona too today sounds good.

[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:32.720]
No.

[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:33.880]
Have a great day.

[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:34.760]
Stay on till two.

[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:35.660]
Okay, bye.

[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.020]
Bye.

[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:39.460]
Come on more, George.

[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.180]
I think Noona too sounds magnifical.

[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:41.780]
Case slacker.

[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.640]
Finish up the day.

[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:43.400]
I've got to eat over here.

[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:43.900]
Up yours.

[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.540]
I'm drinking.

[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.300]
I drink this.

[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.220]
That is you.

[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.220]
Four minutes till Noona, QAIM.

[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.700]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.220]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.260]
This is I with this news.

[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.160]
President Bush is getting ready to head home following his week-long trip to Europe.

[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.800]
Bellfast Northern Ireland is not among the biggest European capitals, but President Bush

[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.180]
made it his last stop.

[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:15.040]
So let me say directly to the Canadian people, and to all of you here today who welcome the Americans.

[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.760]
Are you the Spanish or Spanish?

[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.200]
Mr. President, you're in Ireland, not Canada.

[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.220]
I know.

[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.120]
The Irish speak English, not Spanish.

[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.020]
I know that.

[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.460]
I'm asking for the vote.

[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.320]
Who is this?

[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.380]
And the people of Ukraine.

[01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:33.140]
What?

[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:34.480]
Did I say those words?

[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.340]
What a news.

[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.040]
Sometimes the words get mischaracterized.

[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.360]
Sometimes, you know, what I say.

[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.200]
Why not be a jack?

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.580]
What they say is they're not exactly what I say.

[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:45.880]
You failed.

[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.820]
Okay, 12 noon at 5.60 W.Q.M.

[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:48.560]
We got the jerk show.

[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:49.800]
Come up at 2.M.A.D.O.G.D.4.

[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:51.580]
And then we got, oh boy.

[01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:53.660]
The NBA draft.

[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:55.200]
You're a daft if you listen to the draft.

[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.420]
Seven to 11.

[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:57.080]
Midnight.

[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:57.660]
Five hours.

[01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.760]
We don't have 31 left.

[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:01.300]
We had 50 certificates.

[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.100]
Don't move fast.

[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.380]
The rivals ought to move really fast.

[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:04.940]
Always does.

[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:06.680]
And if it doesn't, it means that we got nobody listening.

[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:07.600]
I'm going to buy them.

[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:09.840]
You don't need to buy them.

[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:10.540]
29.

[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:11.880]
They're going like hotcakes.

[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:13.440]
And deservedly so.

[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.120]
But I sure wish I was there to enjoy that food.

[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:16.820]
That's, uh, alright that you're not.

[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:17.640]
That way we get more.

[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:19.200]
Oh, okay.

[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.000]
But somebody there doesn't need more.

[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.080]
Okay, I don't want to mention any names.

[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.360]
But we did that appearance there at Gulfstream.

[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.560]
And I saw this child.

[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.660]
I mean, seriously, something's got to be done.

[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.800]
You know what, Don, it's yourself, they're old, man.

[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.500]
I got news for you.

[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:36.740]
Okay, I'm a 65-year-old, faddle, queen.

[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:37.200]
Okay.

[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.720]
And I don't come close to your girth.

[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:44.500]
My God, you're trying to like cast talk about it.

[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.140]
And that would be like a Ron Jeremy calling somebody else Harry.

[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:50.540]
God.

[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.160]
That's right.

[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.720]
You fat turd burger you put in joy at anyway.

[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.440]
You only live once.

[01:29:56.900 --> 01:29:57.360]
That's right.

[01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.200]
And in your case, it won't be long.

[01:29:59.200 --> 01:29:59.840]
Not long yet.

[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:03.340]
That's for show.

[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.500]
26 left, but we got almost half of the sold in a couple of minutes.

[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.640]
We got a machine event coming up in Cincinnati live on CNN.

[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:12.840]
He's going to take a breath.

[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.940]
Not a deep breath, just like a quick, you know, shallow breath.

[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:18.840]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:20.840]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:21.580]
Yeah.

[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:26.880]
Hey, I think all you sports folks talking about Shaq and Kobe and Shaq and Kobe.

[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.280]
You know, all I have to say to Shaq is,

[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280]
right here.

[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.200]
Well, he sure worked on that pretty heavy duty didn't he?

[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.440]
How about you worked on it for hours?

[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600]
I know, the committee made it.

[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.480]
I was asleep so we wouldn't forget any of the lines.

[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:39.980]
Right.

[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.360]
We're dire.

[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.160]
We're dire.

[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:43.340]

[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.880]
We're spoiled coffee the whole night long.

[01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:47.680]
WDQ-A-M, hello.

[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:48.840]
Hey, Neil.

[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:49.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.660]
I just want to thank you for not being one of those greedy talk co-hosts

[01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:56.660]
that's charged to listen to you on the internet.

[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:57.420]
Uh-huh.

[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.240]
Are you out of your compliment, or that I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:03.420]
I lived here, out of state, you could listen to you on the floor.

[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.300]
What do you, what do you mean you want to compliment me for that?

[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:08.380]
I mean, if I thought that I'd get people to pay for it, I would charge them.

[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.760]
I don't think that I think you, I think you would enjoy letting the public hear what you want to say.

[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:14.600]
No, I do not.

[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:16.300]
I don't want to, I want the money, man.

[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.960]
Don't give me the son to dance about it.

[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.420]
Having the public enjoy what I hear to have to say.

[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.160]
I want the money.

[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.520]
All right, my friend.

[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.480]
You have to say.

[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.480]
Thank you, sir.

[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.460]
Better change your altitude.

[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.260]
Okay, quick, the kiss of my ass.

[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:30.100]
You're not my type.

[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:30.980]
Trust me.

[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.660]
How are we doing on here?

[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:35.780]
23, man.

[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:40.160]
They're going, they're going in chunks for rivals in Hollywood.

[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.040]
They should be gone by 1230, I would think.

[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:43.600]
I know, yeah.

[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.660]
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:47.180]
Leave it to Chris.

[01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:48.060]
He'll chime in there.

[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:48.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.240]
450 more votes.

[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:50.920]
We'll have 1200.

[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:52.100]
All right.

[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.280]
Now, what happened yesterday?

[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:57.420]
Did we get to the 900 that you were screaming about or not?

[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:58.080]
Yeah, right.

[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:00.020]
Just as we were going to next show.

[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:02.220]
Oh, that was two days ago, two days.

[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:03.160]
We did?

[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:03.720]
Yep.

[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:04.720]
I think you're lying.

[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:05.960]
I think Disney made it up.

[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:06.680]
Why would I lie?

[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.000]
Because you're about to.

[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.400]
Because you're you, because you're fat.

[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.040]
I'm not going to get any money for lying.

[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:11.660]
So why would I lie?

[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:13.480]
You're fat and devious and dangerous.

[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.240]
Full of crap.

[01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:16.840]
Nobody can hear you.

[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:16.940]
Nobody can hear you.

[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:17.140]
Hello.

[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:18.160]
Neil.

[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:19.100]

[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.160]
It's Shaq.

[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:21.420]
I'm here on my ass.

[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:21.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.000]
I'm here on my ass.

[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:24.000]

[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:24.560]
How many QAAM?

[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:24.780]
Hello.

[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.220]
Is there a limit to how many of those off-price fields I can get?

[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:34.600]
Five.

[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:35.840]
Five.

[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:36.640]
Five.

[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:36.800]
Five.

[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:37.760]
Okay, cool.

[01:32:37.860 --> 01:32:38.480]
I'm going to buy all five.

[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.080]
Cutter punch each.

[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:39.780]
Thank you, Neil.

[01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:40.320]
Okay.

[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:41.780]
Good.

[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:43.520]
Excellent.

[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.240]
We only got 22 left.

[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:46.980]
So we better hurry.

[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:47.240]
I'm going to eat better.

[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.060]
I'm going to move quickly.

[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:48.940]
Because once again.

[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:49.780]
They got.

[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:53.920]
Yeah, start.

[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:54.660]
What?

[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:55.500]
It just relax.

[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.180]
Just keep eating.

[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:56.500]
Okay.

[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:57.680]
We'll survive.

[01:32:58.020 --> 01:32:58.640]
A lot of pressure.

[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.000]
Why are you ignoring us?

[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.940]
And just shoveling all that free food down your puss.

[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.400]
There's something strange on the phone.

[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.420]
I'm not talking about the calls.

[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.240]
I couldn't say.

[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.040]
But, no, no, seriously.

[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.640]
About the way that the lines are lighting.

[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:13.700]
Have you noticed that?

[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:14.120]
Nope.

[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.340]
Three five six, three five six, three five six.

[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:17.860]
You see that?

[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:18.260]
Oh, yeah.

[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:19.700]
Well, they don't come in in order.

[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.880]
In other words, the first line is line three and...

[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:23.540]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.080]
Hello, Mashi.

[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:25.460]
Uncle Neil.

[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:26.140]
Yes.

[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.240]
I missed you.

[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:28.040]
Yeah.

[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:28.600]
Where were you?

[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.440]
W-A-M.

[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.360]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:34.540]
Hello.

[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:35.660]
Hey, Neil.

[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:36.140]
How are you?

[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:36.740]
Okay.

[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:38.480]
Good question.

[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:44.100]
These crazy mental myths that...

[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:47.180]
There's a lot of these group of people that just keep calling you.

[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:47.540]
Mm-hmm.

[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:48.480]
Why?

[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:50.540]
What is...

[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:51.180]
I have no lines.

[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.060]
I have no lines.

[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:52.900]
I have no lines.

[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:53.860]
I have no lines.

[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:54.300]
That's why.

[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:55.060]
This is their life.

[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.900]
And, apparently, there's nothing you can do.

[01:33:58.060 --> 01:33:59.260]
I know you've talked about it.

[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:00.180]
But...

[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:01.540]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:05.120]
There's nothing that this station or this company is willing to do.

[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:05.840]
Nothing.

[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.360]
I mean, can't you pay a private detective to get their numbers?

[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:10.320]
Oh, yeah.

[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.100]
Joe Bell's got a private detective.

[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.520]
He's going to call up Shrylock Holmes and he's going to get a...

[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.500]
Columbo on the case.

[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:17.240]
Get out of here.

[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:19.920]
Private detective, my ass.

[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:21.560]
Remember those days?

[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:25.060]
Oh, Joe Bell's got a private detective friend and he's going to get involved in...

[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:25.060]

[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.980]
Joe Bell couldn't give a crap lesson if Erwin calls was...

[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:29.280]
How's that?

[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:30.160]
I'm your friend.

[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:30.980]
He couldn't care less.

[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.260]
Because those people are...

[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:36.340]
When it comes to humor, they're on the same level that he is.

[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.600]
Oh, Neil, did you get the bad news up there in Toronto?

[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.740]
I don't know if the news got up there.

[01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:41.740]
You had Tim Russell died.

[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:42.740]
Oh, oh, oh.

[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.780]
That was the beginning of the call on Thursday, like a Friday last week.

[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.320]
18 left is all we got.

[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:55.540]
What weren't you amazed and amused?

[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.480]
Well, not amused.

[01:34:57.940 --> 01:34:58.500]
I'm amazed.

[01:34:58.660 --> 01:34:59.780]
He just keeps trying to be a comedian.

[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:00.720]
What have I always told you?

[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.900]
There is nothing worse.

[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:07.680]
There is nothing less funny than people who aren't funny trying to be funny.

[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:11.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:13.040]
Nobody's saying.

[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:16.640]
I'm saying Joe Bell ain't funny.

[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.100]
He's as funny as most of these colors.

[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:19.880]
17 left.

[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:25.440]
560-560-0.560, I'll leave Erwin and sink in a wireless line.

[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.100]
WQA M, hello.

[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:29.120]
Hello?

[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.020]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:33.920]
Let me try it again.

[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:34.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:37.500]
Goodbye.

[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:38.740]
WQA M, hello.

[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.140]
Hello, Neil.

[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:40.860]
Yes.

[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:42.540]
Let's talk it out.

[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:45.000]
Yeah, let's get rid of your ass.

[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.000]
No.

[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:49.900]
I just want to talk and be a bit...

[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.260]
About what?

[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.320]
Talk about what?

[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.080]
I hope that all these people wake up and shut those in the real Bama.

[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.040]
This is the quarter-slot guy.

[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:00.400]
This is the quarter-slot hole.

[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:00.700]
Yeah.

[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.820]
Now, what did I tell you last week?

[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.520]
What did you tell me?

[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.660]
I said don't ever call the show again.

[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.100]
Well, I want to talk it out.

[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:09.580]
Wait a minute.

[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.740]
What part of that sentence didn't you understand?

[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.600]
OK, Neil.

[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.200]
Let me ask it again.

[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.220]
What part of that sentence didn't you understand?

[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:25.020]
I have to find something to tell you today.

[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.580]
Can all these people want to be ready?

[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.840]
Answer the question.

[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:28.880]
What?

[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:33.380]
The DD calls, Neil.

[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.140]
It makes your show.

[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:37.020]
Like hemorrhoids, I need your call.

[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.240]
I can need a hold on the head.

[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:38.980]
But, no.

[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:40.120]
Let me say it again.

[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.760]
What part of don't ever call the show again?

[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:43.940]
Don't you understand?

[01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:45.580]
I'll be more happy to explain it to you.

[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:47.260]
OK, well, no.

[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:48.760]
Well, yes.

[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:49.940]
Well, yes.

[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:50.620]
You said about it.

[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.040]
Not calling it a word.

[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:51.940]
Let me say it again.

[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.480]
What part of that sentence don't you understand?

[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.120]
Oh, I understand it, Neil.

[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:56.640]
Well, good.

[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:57.300]
I can go to it.

[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.000]
Get lost.

[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.060]
14 certificates left for rival.

[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.920]
They're going, like I said, by the bottom of the air, they'll be gone.

[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.260]
And once they're gone, I.

[01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:10.500]
They're gone.

[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:12.980]
And we know how great the food is.

[01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.420]
And you guys are shoveling it down.

[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:16.400]
Just to push me off, basically.

[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:20.820]
I'm sitting with my raw throat on a ass end of luckily, though,

[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.300]
that Bentley is a taste trouble, but it really works.

[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.100]
You know, so I'm not coughing and hacking and puke anymore.

[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:25.920]
Mm-hmm.

[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:26.520]
I do.

[01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:28.200]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.720]
We cannot put the solution.

[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:33.140]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.560]
Yes, suicide, I think is the answer.

[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.260]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:36.420]
We got it.

[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:39.740]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:42.820]
Any way we can get me Joe Bell's email address?

[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.500]
Yeah, joe at wqm.com.

[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.860]
How about a poopoo joist there?

[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.560]
Poopoo joist?

[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.200]
Yes.

[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.840]
Send her a poopoo platter in a mail.

[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:58.120]
56670560 and pound 560 in the Verizon Singular wireless line.

[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:00.180]
That last guy, he's going to take care of things.

[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:03.300]
He's going to send some hostile emails off to Joe and joe's

[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.520]
and get this show back to where he used to be again.

[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.140]
Anybody buying it?

[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:07.400]
No.

[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:07.940]
Believe in it?

[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:08.320]
No!

[01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:10.280]
What about you, George, you believe it?

[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.740]
You had to hear Tubby laughing in the background there, too.

[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.640]
No, it's you laughing.

[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:19.340]
No, it's you laughing.

[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:19.820]
That was George laughing.

[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:20.700]
No, it's you laughing.

[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.260]
Tubby, Tubby boots.

[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.940]
Because I believe this chick I got in here with me.

[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:28.860]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:30.500]
Bill.

[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:31.300]
Yeah.

[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.840]
You're a bell-canadian?

[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:34.680]
No.

[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:36.380]
Oh, you sure?

[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:36.880]
It's time's it.

[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:39.460]
Let me say it again.

[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.800]
No, he's not Canadian.

[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.640]
And why would that mean if he were?

[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.640]
You make up the Canadian.

[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:46.580]
What?

[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.920]
What did he just say?

[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:50.860]
I don't know.

[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.280]
I wasn't listening.

[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:52.760]
Oh, nobody else was either.

[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.820]
56670560, pound 560 on the...

[01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:00.900]
Verizon and Singular Wireless Line.

[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:03.820]
13 left.

[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:06.220]
Look at how the dial is down to 136.5.

[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:09.260]
The S&P is down.

[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.340]
Yeah, it's down bad.

[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.460]
Here comes the money and there goes your money.

[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:16.560]
Why I sure hope that guy, the S&P guy, didn't lose too much.

[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:20.440]
I sure hope he didn't lose more than 99% of whatever he's pressed.

[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:21.900]
The biggest name.

[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.040]
The best talent.

[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.380]
Here comes the new project.

[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:26.800]
4.652AM.

[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.600]
The sports leader.

[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.300]
Hi, Luis Miguel.

[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.540]
Play it, baby.

[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:34.320]
Oh, well, has anybody heard of Father Merge?

[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.580]
Father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.980]
The well-a-father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.480]
The well-a-father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.560]
The father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.880]
I heard was burgling her.

[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.300]
Father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:48.780]
Father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.140]
Father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.540]
Father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:55.980]
Father Merge was burgling her.

[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.620]
Well don't you know it was Father Merge?

[01:39:58.720 --> 01:39:59.460]
Well, he was all the explicitly.

[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.840]
And, forgently burgling her.

[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.220]
Well, a-father Merge was burgling her.

[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.040]
That's what I heard.

[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.160]
Missed my dress for the alleys.

[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:11.340]
Sinner mixero melody.

[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:19.620]
Sinner mixero melody.

[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.460]

But Merge Merge

[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.900]
Well, he was also being boy

[01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:39.780]
And Merge Merge

[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:40.340]
Merge Merge

[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.580]
Well, a Merge Merge

So, 16 to 5.60 WQ

[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.340]
Get some of these certificates we have

[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:58.440]
Oh

[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:58.580]
Yeah

[01:40:58.580 --> 01:40:59.080]
Oh

[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:01.320]
So, that means

[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.120]
We're still 41. We only have

[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:03.540]
Yeah

[01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:03.940]
Left

[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.260]
For um

[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:05.980]
Rivals

[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:06.980]
Great food

[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:08.140]
Good location

[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:09.300]
Everybody knows it

[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:10.220]
Everybody loves it

[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.700]
How come we still got those neon left

[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.120]
I don't know if people are sloth

[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.660]
Now you think maybe because it's the 26th of June

[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:21.120]
El Vante de Seis de Hunio

[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.540]
I think that could be it

[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:24.800]
Could be

[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.240]
Long days man, dog days

[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:26.660]
There's there

[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:27.380]
There's positive

[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:28.980]
There's nobody there who uh

[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:30.380]
Who doesn't have to be

[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.220]
Or we can't afford to get out

[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:34.840]
But of course that's always the case

[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:38.560]
Still got neon

[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:39.460]
Yep

[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:40.780]
Oh boy

[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:42.460]
That guy who said he was going to buy five

[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:43.220]
You're full of it

[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:44.340]
Full of crap

[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.400]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:47.960]
Pound 5 60 and they've arrived in

[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:48.340]
Singular

[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:49.280]
Wireless line

[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:49.780]
The phone

[01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:50.940]
That is a door nail

[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:52.080]
And you know the one

[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.280]
The one thing in it

[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.620]
In its own perverse way

[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:55.360]
And this is a truth

[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.720]
If we didn't have the four or five nut jobs on there

[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.260]
Can you imagine how many calls we'd have

[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:01.040]
All summer long

[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:01.960]
Two three

[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.580]
All summer long

[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:04.840]
Two three

[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.000]
That's the only reason that

[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.280]
There are on four or five hundred times

[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:09.200]
A day on when you're doing the show when i'm doing it

[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:10.180]
It doesn't make any difference

[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:11.140]
Well in your case

[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:12.860]
They're not there because you got

[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:13.760]
Fatso screen

[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.500]
How do you do yesterday's screen

[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.340]
He was perfect

[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:18.960]
Get out of here

[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.000]
Okay, see you

[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:21.320]
So in other words

[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.760]
What's happening here

[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.220]
Is they're making up for their inability

[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.740]
To get on Monday, Wednesday and Friday

[01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:26.860]
And they're really

[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:28.900]
Going heavy duty

[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.640]
It's incredibly frustrating for them

[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:31.500]
You can imagine

[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.920]
Yeah, well you better quit frustrating our audience

[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:34.160]
No

[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.320]
Yes, no

[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:41.740]
See that line one never rings

[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:42.540]
QAM hello

[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:45.040]
I can see the money man. I'm looking for a job

[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:47.600]
QAM hello

[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:50.960]
QAM yes

[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:54.320]
I was at hard rock they have the new Blackjack tables

[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.640]
Yeah, you might have like 75 tables of people flying

[01:42:57.640 --> 01:42:59.340]
And they're like pre-informed five deep

[01:42:59.340 --> 01:42:59.840]
Screen

[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.020]
Think I've ever seen

[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:01.680]
Mm-hmm

[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.760]
Is there then any of you that they get to see them

[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:05.920]
Everyone has been plunged

[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.740]
And doesn't become to be so bad in my

[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:08.640]
I mean everyone's betting

[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:09.320]
Crazy

[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:10.940]
Have you been there yet?

[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.820]
Not not since they got the Blackjack now

[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:16.560]
You got Falker on there, 5000 a hand

[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:19.600]
They've got Blackjack 50-60 tables

[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:20.740]
Crazy funny

[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:23.000]

[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:23.680]
Everyone's waiting

Well, what were you doing there?

[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:26.840]
What do you mean?

[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.680]
Well, they're just calling for young boys

[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:29.100]
They'll get

[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:31.060]
Oh, no doubt I believe that

[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.880]
At the hard rock

[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:37.820]
5670-560-pound-560-undiverized and singular wireless line

[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.620]
It must have been a Sid's boyfriend

[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:41.760]
WDQ-AM, hello

[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.120]
You know, why do you think George smokes so much pot?

[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:46.620]
Because he wants to

[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:49.420]
WDQ-AM, hello

[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:52.560]
Q-AM

[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:56.320]
Hi there, just got back from Jay's salon

[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:56.960]
That's great

[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:00.000]
That was it

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.900]
Now how are we doing over here on our thing?

[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:05.540]
No, still sitting there on your own

[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:06.280]
Boy, that's not good

[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.120]
I think Robert Grieffer's got something to do with that

[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.280]
Either that or Eric Scott is foot on the break again

[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.400]
But I'm gonna go back to the pool, okay?

[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:15.540]
You keep your eye on that

[01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:17.380]
And let us know when they're gone

[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:17.980]
We'll do

[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.120]
699 votes on the pool

[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:22.800]
I bet if I refresher we might have 700

[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:23.680]
No, we don't

[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:25.780]
2008 is already half over

[01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:29.100]
What's the most surprising thing that's happened so far this year

[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:31.040]
He looks at it a big pay cut

[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:33.220]

[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:37.580]

[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:45.460]

[01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:57.720]
You're just a pig

[01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.140]
If I should die at 41

[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:00.720]
George Carlin died at 38

[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.000]
The primers lasted that long 19

[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.180]
And Joel Feinberg ditched the ticket for

[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:07.640]
We finally got a little action there for Joel Feinberg

[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:09.040]
701 vote

[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:12.740]

[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:22.700]
Oh

[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.840]
Stick it in the ticket ticket ticket ticket

[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.840]
Before I die, that's my goal in life to find out what that is

[01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:31.860]
I know you don't care because you're just a hard to ask but

[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.680]
Me being a great inquisitor

[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.920]
I'm just I just wonder what that's all about

[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:36.960]
What is it supposed to mean?

[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:37.880]
What is supposed to occur?

[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:38.200]
I don't know

[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.940]
What is it supposed to say?

[01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:41.400]
Why is it in there?

[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:42.560]
Ticket ticket ticket

[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:46.500]
I mean if it's not in the same category

[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.640]
Would gotta move up and don't go down

[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.180]
Gotta go up and don't go to it's on the same category as that

[01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:52.880]
Gotta gotta go up and don't go down

[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.700]
Now let me ask you a stupid question Chris

[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.980]
Don't they heat since they had that grotesque

[01:50:57.980 --> 01:50:59.380]
What they went about four games all season

[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:00.700]
They had that horrendous record

[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.000]
Don't they have the number one pick?

[01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:02.980]
No, they have the number two pick

[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:04.400]
Who's got number one?

[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:04.900]
Chicago

[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.720]
They had a worst record than the heat

[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.840]
No, the way the NBA does it

[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.520]
All the teams that didn't make the playoffs

[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:14.460]
They then get put into like a

[01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:15.660]
They don't have the hopper, yeah

[01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:15.940]
Yeah

[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:18.740]
And so the first three picks are chosen that way

[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:20.320]
And then the worst song

[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.060]
Whatever is you know by record

[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:22.880]
Yeah

[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:25.680]
So the heat were chosen second instead of first

[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:27.660]
And so how they're gonna move up?

[01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:30.340]
Well that was that was their lottery song

[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:31.840]
Before the lottery came out

[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:33.640]
So they're just playing it again

[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:41.380]

Well, I mean I mean I like Zach but

[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.880]

[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.840]
Oh, he's got his hand in it all right

[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.900]
Backed him and his foot

[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.120]
Back in the day when we were doing all the sports writers all the time, you know

[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:08.860]
Right

[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:12.400]
That was I'm pretty sure that was our illustrious program director

[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:18.200]
That was his sticking apart was really going to be hot now when Hank was on who had what's the guy's name the

[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:20.220]

[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:22.640]
Top of guys name now

[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:25.240]

[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:27.900]
I forgot it

[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:28.220]
Be the

[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:29.660]
The old man

[01:57:30.180 --> 01:57:31.300]
The Bino curve

[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:33.460]
Yeah, he would have a model or that would be

[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.420]
And if the PD would have no that would be Hank

[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:38.140]
Okay, well he loved you

[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.020]
Jesus Christ Hank, I love you but

[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.180]
By the way, have you heard from Hank or do you know you don't

[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:47.100]
For you know I haven't heard Nereo word no

[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:53.440]
No, all right. Well, they have a good one. You and I take care, buddy. Okay. You heard from Hank. Who?

[01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:54.940]
The Humper

[01:57:57.620 --> 01:57:58.020]
Hey

[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.320]
That as much as I used to

[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:08.560]
You notice that since since the changeover anybody's wondering about how come these numbers have all of a sudden vanished

[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:11.980]
I'm gonna Joe Bell's big change there in the end of December

[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:16.400]
When they blew out Eddie Kay and they blew out Hank in a you know

[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.880]
Blue up the whole station and of course they gave jerks his own show too with the same time

[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:26.540]
You notice how the numbers and the audience have basically vanished simultaneously must be just a co-worketing

[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.840]
So you think? Yeah, it is

[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:35.420]
I can't wait for it to happen. There's nothing to do with anything else. Right. Ice going jolly Joe

[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:40.820]
He is a destroyer. He is a butcher. He is a murderer. He's killing us

[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:42.940]
But they like him

[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:46.720]
Because he's saving him a lot of money

[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:52.340]
And as far as you George if you think we're gonna give you any we we you know that's a tough one

[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:54.640]
You know we just can't do that. Yeah, I know

[01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.900]
Only saving 80 billion dollars on Hank's salary and next year on what we cut kneel salary and everybody else

[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:04.540]
But we can't give you any money, but maybe we can send you out and hurry a little bit more

[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.340]
That's right

[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.420]
Somebody told me that I would spit right in their face

[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:16.720]
I would get up and drop my pants and take a big smelly nasty dump right on their desk

[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:21.220]
That's what you should have done if you had any balls, but you don't and of course now I have dependence

[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:25.740]
I can't afford balls. You have depends. I have dependence, you know not optional ones either

[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.180]

Another shot a little zorge. Okay, just keep it up

[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:34.520]

Well, she's got one of those and maybe you know

[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:23.400]

Okay, all right and every time he calls he says the same thing

[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:53.080]
Every time he says the same exact thing I hate OJ and go Obama. Do you have any idea what that significant is supposed to be?

[02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:55.460]
Nope. Oh

[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:03.580]
Well, the fact that he's a black guy and he you know, he likes Obama, which is fine. He hates OJ. Which is great, but that's that

[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:06.320]

An email from a disgraced mega church pastor tag Haggard

[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:16.020]
What I call him Ted Haggard

[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:16.520]
Yeah

[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:21.860]
To a long time family friend admits sexual contact with the male escort but breaks from the original story

[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:27.140]
Haggard founder of new life church and former president of the National Association of Evangelicals

[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:31.880]
Phil from grace in November 2006 after Denver, Massur and male escort Mike Jones

[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:35.520]
went public with allegations that he and Haggard using the pseudonym art

[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:38.340]
had sex about once a month

[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:41.740]
Jones out at Haggard due to his support of Colorado's amendment 43

[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:46.780]
lead proposed amendment to band game marriage but everybody is a back doing what he preached against

[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.560]
Let me say it again but behind everybody's back doing what he preached against

[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:52.220]
Uh-huh

[02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:53.060]
You follow that?

[02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:53.560]
That how you do it?

[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:54.680]
I get it behind the back

[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:55.500]
It's one way

[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:56.860]
Rack them

[02:14:56.860 --> 02:15:00.780]
According to Haggard the only contact he had with Jones was a full release massage

[02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:02.540]
A full release

[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:08.060]
On allegations, Jones secured meth and meth and fedamines for him Haggard told family friend Kurt Serpie

[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:10.780]
Then he repeatedly bought drugs but didn't use them out of shame

[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:15.460]
This is something he said he's been struggling with all of his life Serpie said he

[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:17.260]
Craved sex he was a sexoholic

[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:21.240]
According to Serpie the encounters weren't about sexual orientation but

[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:22.220]
gratification

[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:26.560]
He also added that rather than three years Haggard said the encounters lasted three months

[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:31.180]
The text of the email obtained by krdo appears below

[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:37.100]
Said Haggard writes I was referred to my Jones from the concierge in Emeryott Hotel when I asked for a

[02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:37.480]
Massure

[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:42.500]
It was during the massage that it started to become essential and that led him to masturbating me

[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:48.500]
That wasn't as our only sexual contact but it was immoral and it was this experience that caused me to confess immorality

[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:50.600]
in my letter of resignation from a new life church

[02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:54.360]
During the conversation with Mike during an act of the time he masturbated me

[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:58.440]
He told me about some drugs he could get for me that would enhance my masturbation and experience

[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:02.820]
I returned on five occasions and bought those drugs. I actually used them three times

[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:05.360]
Strolling them away in shame before use two times

[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:09.220]
It is for these offenses that I confess being immoral and deceitful

[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:14.040]
These are the answers you requested but I don't know why you would say you deserve them. That seems odd to me. God bless

[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:14.900]
Ted Haggard

[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:17.500]
God bless my ass

[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:19.680]

[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:21.420]

[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:25.100]
Mm-hmm and speaking of the good book

[02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:31.500]
Guess what country is gonna be pretty more Bibles than any other country in the world. Guess what communist country China? Yeah

[02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:37.820]

[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:38.960]
Yeah

[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:41.940]
With the help of a new hanger size facility

[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:47.380]
There's a company in China on its way to becoming the biggest Bible factory in the world cranking out 12 million copies a year

[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:52.120]
See I think that's good. I think that you don't have to you have to pedal the bull crap

[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:57.380]
You don't have to believe in it, but if you can capitalize on it make some make some nice cash from it. What's wrong with that?

[02:16:58.340 --> 02:16:58.440]

Ah, well you're doing doing pretty well. I think

[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:39.180]
Let me ask you a question. How come that

[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:45.420]
Al Sharpton is always looking for people to apologize but for those of us that grew up in New York

[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:49.080]
He still has not apologized for what he did with the whole to want to grow

[02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:57.380]
Even though that's the right right through his teeth right. I mean our heart. He should I say because he's a worse kind of person up there

[02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:02.100]
And he continues to profit off of other idiots mistakes. I don't that that's his business. He's an explorer

[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:07.020]
Yeah, well anyway, at least I don't have to deal with it up there anymore

[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:12.380]
But I'll listen to the man hope these fools decide to keep you around. Okay, I see you

[02:20:17.180 --> 02:20:19.480]
Sounded a little bit disgruntled there at the end

[02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:23.380]
Little bit gruntled, huh? A little bit

[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:49.020]
What do you got what do you got smuck?

[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:50.820]

[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:53.880]
Because that's what you got nothing you got plenty of nothing

[02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:58.200]
Very very sad that that was worse than the kid with the insurance

[02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:00.580]
A thousand times worse

[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:06.900]

You people in the media you're all sick sick

[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:08.680]
WQ I am hello

[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:15.740]
You're doing today. Okay, could you imagine the money you would have made if you would have went back to phone calls three years ago instead of reading the news

[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:17.400]

I'm not going back to a reading tone. I mean I wanted to hear it in air like I used to you know that's that's enough

[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.240]
Why should I deprive these great callers of their chance? That's right because that they're what the show is all about

[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:41.880]
You know then they're convinced of that

[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:50.380]
That's why in the fall and the fall book we were number one when I wasn't taking our leany calls and then the winner book when we started taking calls and we went to number on

[02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:54.260]
Well, it's kind of a transition. You know they'll get used to it

[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:26.600]
No, no, and let me say it again. I don't think that Charlie Christ is gay. He is

[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:30.240]
It's just like Mark Foley. There's no doubt about it. There's no question

[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:35.240]
Why does he go and play this charade with the girlfriend? Why why does time cruise keep getting married? Okay?

[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:39.800]

Thanks to shed light on that one more thing Neil and swear this is true

[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:50.180]
I'm watching this TV station car this morning. They have these Buddhists

[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:56.560]
Not months, but Buddhist people you're not gonna believe this they call this guy on the telephone that sells the bait

[02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:59.500]
I swear this is true. He sells live bait

[02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:05.800]
They call him to the dock and they give the guy hundreds of dollars and they release the bait right there on the dock

[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:07.620]
Say and they want to save lives

[02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:10.920]
I'm gonna hang out what's your take on that. I swear to God it's true

[02:35:12.740 --> 02:35:13.100]
I

[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:16.860]
What's your take George?

[02:35:18.980 --> 02:35:19.820]
What's your take

[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:25.480]
You have a take on that. I don't have a take

[02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:34.060]

[02:35:34.740 --> 02:35:36.840]
This is the highlight of Chris's day besides eating

[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:42.060]
Everybody Q a.m. Hello. Yeah, I believe you about

[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:50.060]
Charlie Chris, you know being gay so I don't care whether you believe me or not or whether anybody believes me

[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:53.700]
It's like my saying the sun is shining here now. It's a fact. It's not it's not movie

[02:35:54.280 --> 02:36:01.620]
I agree and and I the reason I know why is because people hello. I'm here. Oh, yeah people who have you know

[02:36:01.620 --> 02:36:06.760]
supported him in the past and in is like I don't know what they called the cabinet as the governor of the senator

[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:15.580]
But even is head of you know security those are the guys. They'll always know what's going on and and the head of the security for a while is Andy Rossman

[02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:17.940]
Oh, yeah, I bet that did it

[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:19.740]
Nobody Q a.m. Hello

[02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:25.540]
Q a.m. Well, what is with that guy anyway with the guy I don't know

[02:36:26.540 --> 02:36:27.980]
Q a.m. Hello

[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:33.060]
Oh my queen said the mighty sorcerer to hide himself. He's almost as good as the Yovenguy

[02:36:33.060 --> 02:36:37.600]
Not quite but almost never heard from him today either the way just wait but how about you

[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:42.680]
I mean from the dime slot guy either we heard the quarter slot guy who I am personally going to hire a hitman for him

[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:44.200]
We'll find out who he is too

[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:50.340]
You know the interesting part of it is and I have no way of knowing whether that guy was right or not about Charlie and the name of that company

[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:57.220]
Um, but everybody who calls a each one of these misfits people out there know who they are

[02:36:57.220 --> 02:36:58.460]
You know what I mean? No

[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.960]
What's into him being a bastard of court all as usual right right

[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:12.040]
And it would be really I think it would be great to find out who all these people are and although some people don't care

[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:15.880]
Because this has become so much their life that they don't really give a crap like your friend their own

[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:18.320]
Although they've been they've been notoriously quiet today

[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:23.480]
You know, so maybe they found each other or something maybe they found the Lord maybe they found

[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:25.800]
Maybe they found the right fold

[02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:26.740]
I'm

[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:57.620]
At 05 60 pound 560 on the Verizon singular Bible slide Ricky Martin

[02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:02.920]
Well, we sure don't hear about him anymore. So you see those of you already pressed like put your chin up in the area, you know

[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:04.920]
Your little chin ball

[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:09.880]
Not hearing about wiki Martin any day. We don't hear about him is a good day. That's why I look at it

[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:13.000]
Because I'm the eternal optimist. I'm thinking that maybe

[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.520]
Charlie to Bell the the finger of the Lord will come down and smoke him or something

[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:20.800]
Maybe Lord will stick his finger in Joe's back don't ask

[02:38:21.240 --> 02:38:25.320]
And cause that oozing bloody wild diarrhea that we were all hoping you would get remember that

[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:30.700]
Now you're not gonna say anything because you really think now do you have another meeting setup for them or what?

[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:33.460]
No, no, no, was that was it

[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:38.520]
Yeah, I mean there's gonna be a contract at some point. I think oh there is I think

795 on the pool 795. Oh, it's exciting

[02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:48.280]

[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:51.660]
But how is that possible the 367

They headed on the air like two hours ago and I keep looking on their website either their website is

Is common dear by the most incompetent idiots or they just don't want to put it on there for some reason

[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:33.720]
Well, what's the reason for that? I don't know the fact that I mean I don't know

[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:37.740]
Besides the fact that including your friend your fat face friend Lou Dobbs there by now

Spinning his wheels. You know that that's either they're giving us a little clues

[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:11.540]
I think the great one wants to come out of the closet. Don't you?

[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:13.440]
I do in fact

[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:18.080]
I challenge him to drive his rig right up to the front of the station here and you and Chris can go out there and like

[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:19.600]
Have a little interplay

[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:25.740]

[02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:20.940]
See I don't understand after somebody died. I mean at least to have a hunter which nobody even knows who that is anymore

[02:46:20.940 --> 02:46:24.100]
But at least before he croaked and I guess because he was desperate to you know make a few bucks

[02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:26.020]
So he wrote a book and he came out of the closet

[02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:31.120]
But I mean what what's the point after somebody dies? Do we have to protect the uh?

[02:46:31.500 --> 02:46:36.820]

I mean used to be that I was addicted to any of the godfathers and now when they're honest it

[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:26.160]
I can't take it it just because I know every word every you're lying to dialogue every every breath they're gonna take

[02:50:28.700 --> 02:50:31.260]
And the scene that I keep I don't know why it's bad luck

[02:50:31.260 --> 02:50:34.020]
I guess the scene that I keep coming across is when they're setting up our

2008 is already half over the most surprising thing that's happened so far this year was it Tim Russell's death?

[02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:41.420]
No, was it George Collins death? No gas hitting four bucks a gallon. No the most amazing thing that happened with his crowd

[02:51:41.420 --> 02:51:46.420]

Keep away from the suit

[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:38.900]
