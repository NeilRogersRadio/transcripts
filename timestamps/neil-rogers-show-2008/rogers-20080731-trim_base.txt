The biggest name is the best coward.

[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.340]
You're listening to Sports Radio 560WQAM, my Miami for the Latter Day.

[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.680]
Schmuck, Schmembert, Schmuggerian, Schmammazel.

[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.980]
560WQAM presents the Neil Rogers Show to talk to Neil, dial 560560 in day and broad.

[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.200]
In other counties, called full free, 87775 Neil or pound 560 on your AT&T and Verizon Wireless phones.

[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.320]
The opinion expressed by Neil is, gets more of his colleagues, do not represent the WQAM explain to them.

[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.640]
Now the Neil Rogers Show on 560WQAM.

[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.700]
Now install this? No bill.

[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.840]
Did you see our ratings for the last book?

[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.980]
Yeah, I know it's going to start in.

[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.080]
Sure, good talking with you.

[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.980]
What you're about to act when you won't wait for more.

[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:30.280]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.260]
No no, no, wait for υp

[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.320]
That's right, watch your back.

[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.980]
That's right, watch your back.

[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600]
Right below, below, below, below.

[00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.640]
Don't bend them, bend them.

[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.740]
Watch your back.

[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.340]
Watch your back.

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.060]
Watch your back.

[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.840]
Watch your back.

[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.880]
Watch your back.

[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.540]
Watch your back.

[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.280]
Watch your back.

[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.960]
Move away.

[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.020]
Yeah, let's get that stuffy.

[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.900]
I know one more time in your life.

[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.140]
I'm going to be a little bit more nervous.

[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.260]
Yeah, that's the weakest link right there is Zach among the producers.

[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.360]
He votes you the emotion and always doing the same thing to Joe.

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.120]
Let's play to him.

[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]
That's what I just said.

[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.320]
That's why I played that.

[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.820]
What?

[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.540]
I think the turning point on the morning show is for Zach Kimmelman.

[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.940]
Was that, uh, got to, got to move up and out down.

[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.960]
I think that, that's the kind of change that was on.

[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.200]
That was the reading spike.

[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.180]
That's the highlight right?

[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.120]
That wasn't a spike.

[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.260]
That was a disaster.

[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.560]
That brought new shame and embarrassment to a station that's already for the last two and a half years.

[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.160]
Been disgraced, humiliated, and what are embarrassed.

[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.640]
Anyways, so the book came out yesterday.

[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.740]
We did not so bad.

[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.660]
Whatever five and Claret's came in to congratulate me this morning.

[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.300]
How do you like that?

[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.120]
Who was to show you how far this place is going in the toilet when somebody comes in and congratulate you for being on the first page in the target demographic?

[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.780]
Hey, we'll take it these days.

[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.720]
Oh, hey, listen, I was, I was pleased because when the hourly's shared between 10 and 2, you know, we did over a five share or five.

[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.320]
I'm saying five six. That's my psychic prediction.

[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.820]
Yeah, that's just what you make up.

[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.160]
Right. Exactly. You're saying five six.

[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.060]
That's it. That's it.

[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.260]
Based on five six, that means that the two to three hour with jerks would have to be a disaster.

[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.660]
And what's with this Aradio Hitmo when it's salsa crap?

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.620]
Another one.

[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.600]
I don't know. What the coast?

[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.100]
Explain that to me.

[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.640]
They took me to a dump.

[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.100]
They're going to fade back where they belong.

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.600]
Good.

[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.920]
But Aradio Hitmo, I mean, it's like one of those also ran stations and all of a sudden,

[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.260]
Oh, and in some day parts, what is it?

[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.460]
Where's that one plea?

[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.180]
Here it is.

[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.320]
Overall, for the whole week, they're number two and men.

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.740]
They went from a typhoon ninth to number two and in the morning, they're number one.

[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.600]
They slaughtered Ron and Old Paul.

[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]
Now, do you believe that?

[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.860]
They went from sixth and men, the first from a four to a nine-nine from the winter of the spring.

[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.800]
Aradio Hitmo and that salsa crap?

[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.240]
No. I don't believe it.

[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.120]
Does anybody believe it? It said maybe a whole bunch of wire diaries.

[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.420]
Does anybody with a brain?

[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.960]
No. Anybody who wants a radio believe that crap, huh?

[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.300]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.040]
All right. Here's George's poll from yesterday.

[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.720]
And this is my last show for a long time.

[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.440]
Yep. For a week and a half.

[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.200]
Thank God.

[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.780]
And the good news is it's only going to cost me 1,500 bucks to repair my vet.

[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.900]
You know, you think that I came on here and said, oh, I totaled it.

[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.880]
I just demolished my, you know, I smacked, I kissed the wall. That's all.

[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.260]
I kissed it. Like bubble would say, it kissed it. That's all good.

[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.720]
And so it's only going to be 1,500 because after we place defender,

[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.420]
you know, when you're dealing with a fiberglass,

[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.720]
and you got a big crack,

[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.440]
like Oprah, a big crack.

[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.480]
If I could overcome my fear, I would blank. That was George's poll.

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.420]
Yesterday, 608.

[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.420]
And the reason he had that many votes is because Eric,

[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.520]
I think you got a deal going with Eric now.

[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.340]
So I can't change the poll like early in the afternoon.

[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.880]
That's right. Is that the deal?

[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.480]
It has only begun. Well, no, why don't you do that?

[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.840]
I kept faxing him the poll and he wouldn't put the new one up there.

[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.680]
I could have called him and said, right, you know,

[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.960]
I try to explain the fax situation to you before about that.

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.140]
If you don't want to tell him that you're going to fax something

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.440]
and he doesn't turn on his five subplates,

[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.820]
he's not going to receive it or no day to pull every day that I'm on.

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.400]
Yeah. Yeah.

[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.600]
Like this is something new.

[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.220]
If I could overcome my fear, I would call any arranger show 120.

[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.860]
Well, hopefully a lot of people overcome their fear today and call in.

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.520]
Right. Don't be afraid.

[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.500]
Be afraid.

[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.080]
Skydive 93. I think only people with a death wish do that.

[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.520]
Move to New York to move to a new city 48.

[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.760]
Quit my job 40. Try gay sex.

[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.600]
Gay 34. Get into horse 29.

[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.300]

[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.680]
Approach my love interest 26.

[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.040]
Oh, I'm going to tell you I would mind two nights ago.

[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.160]
Yeah. Love interest.

[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.400]
Oh my god. I would just I try not to be one of those people who stirs it.

[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.020]
People, you know, too too obviously.

[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.740]
A lucky Lou.

[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.000]
Oh my god.

[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.340]
There were these two young guys in the early 20s.

[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.900]
One was his ugliest dirt.

[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.680]
And the other one.

[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.220]
I would say they were like Middle Eastern.

[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.800]
Whatever that means.

[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.840]
You know, like maybe Egyptian or so.

[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.760]
I don't know like that.

[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.780]
I have seldom in my life seen anybody who looked that good.

[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.720]
And I just kept staring and staring and he seemed to be oblivious.

[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.240]
Approach my love interest 26.

[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.160]
I should have gone up and given them big kiss on the lips.

[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.680]
A sweetie.

[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320]
Maybe he was a terrorist.

[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.780]
Have sex 20.

[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.900]

Learn to swim 12.

[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.080]
What is it? What does that mean?

[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.920]
There are people afraid of the water.

[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.060]
Oh yeah.

[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.300]
Get married 12.

[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.460]

Visit a friend in the hospital to go to a whitewater rafting 2.

[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.540]
Out of 608.

[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.580]
Are you sending me stuff?

[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.140]
Yes.

[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.800]
Oh.

[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.840]
He.

[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:45.820]
Here.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.960]
Okay, here's a bunch of stuff.

[00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.200]
Oh, the hourly is.

[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.300]
Is this the hour means yeah?

[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.500]
Well no, it's not the hour by hour means.

[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.020]
It's something yeah.

[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.880]
Yeah, it's better than what we had.

[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.820]
Clare said he's having some trouble with tap scan.

[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.760]
He's going to give you what you know what we want, what you want as he's cabinet.

[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.580]
Is that what he said?

[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.060]
As long as it's...

[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.340]
First before you tap it you got to find it.

[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.160]
Oh.

[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.140]
God, looking all these pages.

[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.020]
Anyway, this is interesting.

[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:11.980]
This will kill the whole show.

[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.360]
Let's look at my poll here which I got a good poll on there if Eric would ever put the damn thing up yesterday.

[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.420]
Finally, we must have put it on there like two in the morning or something.

[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.020]
The weakest link on WQM is Jirks 68.

[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.300]
Jirks.

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.700]
And you're telling me that Geldy's going to replace him.

[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.140]
Now did you really say goodbye to him yesterday?

[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:32.760]
Jirks.

[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.000]
I said hi to him yesterday.

[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.320]
You said you're going to miss him.

[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.420]
Right.

[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.740]
I said it all the time on the air.

[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.640]
I've been saying that for months.

[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.420]
You told him that?

[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.000]
Yeah.

[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.940]
Why are you going to miss him?

[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.860]
Oh, he's a nice guy.

[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.780]
I'll stop talking crap.

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.380]
What you're saying?

[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:49.900]
He is.

[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.240]
You were telling me that in the beginning and then all of a sudden you changed.

[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.000]
No, no, no.

[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.160]
He's only ever been nice to me.

[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.040]
A lot of other people have some crap to say about him.

[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:57.420]
No.

[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.760]
The weakest link on QM is Jirks 68.

[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.480]
Kimba Bo camper, who you were leading there for a short while but he passed you like you were laying flat.

[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.720]
Kimba's 47.

[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.140]
That's why we keep bringing him back.

[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.180]
And that's why we're promoting him being on the Kill Mad Dog show.

[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.840]
Kimba Bo camper, a speaking statue.

[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.000]
47.

[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.860]
George has got 37.

[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.220]
You're a respectable third.

[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.260]
DA 21, who's got a 0.5 there at night.

[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.120]
Joe Rose 19, the big O13.

[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.980]
I got five and Mad Dog's got four.

[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.520]
I'm the weakest link.

[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.860]
Oh, and now Mad Dog just tied me with five.

[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.180]
Good.

[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.060]
I don't want to be a, you know.

[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.800]
Okay, so here's what we got.

[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.300]
Should I do the break first?

[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.420]
Or should I go down all these?

[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.700]
Because the numbers are just pouring out of my machine mine.

[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.340]
They're pouring out.

[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.280]
He got some time.

[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.100]
5 to 7 a.m., Radio Hitmo is number one with a 10 share.

[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.400]
This is men 25 to 54.

[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.640]
Anybody, and this is 5 to 7 a.m.

[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.220]
Hot, big.

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.440]
Big is 30.

[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.760]
They got a 6 to, yeah.

[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.900]
Not so hot.

[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.260]
Radio on more.

[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.420]
No speaking in English.

[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.000]
That's what this book is all about.

[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.600]
The spring book.

[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.800]
No speaking English.

[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.460]
The coast is number seven.

[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.100]
Let's see.

[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.720]
Men in black.

[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.900]
WMIB is fifth.

[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.820]
Magic is sixth.

[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.700]
Magic is got a 4-1 in the morning.

[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.060]
Coast is got a 3-7.

[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.240]
IOD down to number eight.

[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.380]
Life.

[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.480]
QA is number 10 with the 3-2 between 5 and 7 in the morning.

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.920]
And what's the waxy god?

[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.260]
God.

[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.760]
You got a 1-5.

[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.320]
A 1.5?

[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.760]
INZ is got a 1.2.

[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.280]
I'm excited.

[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.460]
Nice going there, Ken Charles.

[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.600]
Charles over at Scaram, America.

[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.720]
Over at Cheap Channel.

[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.740]
A bunch of losers.

[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:44.980]
How about FTL?

[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.040]
They got a .2 in the 5 to 7 and 1.

[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.620]
Oh my god.

[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.580]
Look at all these pages.

[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:51.560]
Holy crap.

[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.280]
Pages falling on the floor.

[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.100]
I got a miss here.

[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.380]
You know me, Mr. Organization.

[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.400]
And I wonder about the Beasley organization.

[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.840]
I wonder how long they're going to sit still for this swill.

[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.700]
Let's see, 7 to 10 a.m.

[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.660]
Here's the important stuff.

[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.780]
Audio did more again.

[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.680]
It had tons of wired diaries, obviously.

[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.640]
Number one with a 9.8-shear.

[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.940]
Does anybody believe that?

[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:17.460]
No.

[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.360]
W big.

[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.460]
Paul and ancient Ron.

[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]
Number two with a 7-2.

[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:23.600]
Hot 105.

[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.780]
W M I B.

[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.280]
Man in black.

[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:26.820]
The coast.

[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.560]
7 to 10 a.m. Where are we?

[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]
Where the hell are we?

[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.240]
Magic is number 10 by the morning with a 2-9.

[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.500]
That's because Ricky Tiki is gone.

[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.940]
And the other guy, what was the guy's name?

[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.380]
That lasted about 5 minutes.

[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.240]
Oh, I don't know.

[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.100]
Number 13, oh look at that.

[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.060]
Number 12.

[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]
Waxi with a 2-8 and number 13 Q-A with a 2-7.

[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:48.660]
Bruce Kelly.

[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.100]
I tell him, Zach.

[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:49.520]
What?

[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.580]
Bruce Kelly.

[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.360]
Bruce Kelly, yeah, that's the guy.

[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.020]
Bruce.

[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:53.780]
Thank you, Zach.

[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.260]
I was Zach, totally that nice job on a Joe Rochow.

[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.360]
There was Zach, you killed it.

[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.060]
Butchered, destroyed it.

[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.680]
Got it, got it, move up and I'm down.

[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.760]
I guess what, in the next book you better move up and out

[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.260]
down earth.

[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.100]
You're out of a job, all you.

[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.920]
Q-A-M-2-7 and Waxi, said the kid 2-8.

[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.460]
About a flat footed tie.

[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.580]
I-O-D, that will 1.8 share 7 to 10 in the morning.

[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.980]
Holy cow, can that be right?

[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.780]
I-O-D, 1.8, 1.7?

[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.480]
1.8.

[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.820]
What about WFTL-A-50?

[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.820]
A 0.4, nice draw on Steve Lappell.

[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.300]
0.4, I love those numbers that start with a-

[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.120]
Oh, oh yeah.

[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.480]
What about Mr. Ego?

[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.320]
What's that station he's on, WWN, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, like that?

[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.660]
Don't, don't, don't, doesn't show.

[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.940]
You don't know, and it doesn't show.

[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.020]
Doesn't have any number.

[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.840]
So in other words, he always points.

[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.540]
Oh, zero.

[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.300]
I think we'll do the break, then we'll get to the important stuff.

[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.820]
Look at that, we're number three.

[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.260]
Yeah.

[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.460]
Five two.

[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.720]
So we get a bonus.

[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.380]
Am I right?

[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.120]
Mm-hmm.

[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.380]
Not more, a little bit.

[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.020]
Little, we get the minor, and the minor spoils.

[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.700]
CMQ-FA-M is number one, 7, 4, radio, 8, Mohs, 6, 0, and Q-A-M is stirred.

[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.620]
Wirt third with the brothers from 10 to 2, with a 5.2.

[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.440]
Let's get that bonus money going, boys.

[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.260]
Now, I'll get named the best talent.

[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.080]
This is your largest sport in the 5.6 Q-A-M.

[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.780]
The sports leader.

[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.680]
We're number three.

[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:30.260]
Gaming.

[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.940]
Oh, black.

[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.420]
Kind of a fat.

[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.000]
It's something they can't seem to hide.

[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.440]
Kind of a fat.

[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.940]
They can't admit that they like guys.

[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.200]
Yeah.

[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.080]
Yeah.

[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:05.780]
Yeah.

[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:08.560]
Yeah.

[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.140]

[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:10.140]

[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:11.900]
Yeah.

[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:12.620]
Yeah.

[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.600]
Oh, kind of a fat.

[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.680]
What Michael Jackson likes to do.

[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.560]
Kind of a fat.

[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.620]
Who's he kidding?

[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.980]
Is it you?

[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.800]
Oh, girl.

[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.620]
You're the proper talent.

[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.600]
We're the interviewee.

[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.120]
We're the always willing goal.

[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.300]
We're the least together.

[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.880]
That's really cool.

[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.740]
They're okay.

[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.040]
Yeah.

[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.240]
Yeah.

[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.680]
10.18 at 5.60 W.D. Kim.

[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.480]
Let's take a look at the award-winning schedule today.

[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.080]
It's Jerks from 2 to 4 in the studio.

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.120]
You can save it by to him again.

[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.120]
We're going to miss you Jerks.

[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.520]
You can say even though you're blind.

[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.540]
Mad Dog at the Shula's.

[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.340]
Stake 2 from 4 to 6.50.

[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.820]
First pitch with Jesse Agler at 6.50.

[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.420]
Did the Marlins win last night or what?

[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.560]
Yes, they did.

[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.500]
They did?

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.640]
Yep, 75.

[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:15.760]
They beat the match?

[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:16.380]
See.

[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.440]
So what's the story?

[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.080]
They like the filming amount?

[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.340]
I don't know.

[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.300]
I didn't see that score.

[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.340]
I know the Cubs won.

[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.840]
That guy is going to be all whipped up.

[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.580]
You know, he's himself deluded.

[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.200]
And then the D.A. show for me to 11 after Daphense tonight.

[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.560]
We'll get to those nighttime numbers momentarily.

[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:34.960]
Let's see.

[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.360]
Midday CMQFM is number one.

[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.600]
No speak in English.

[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.580]
7.4.

[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.640]
An audio hit mono.

[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.460]
Speak in English.

[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.800]
6.0 and we got a 5.2.

[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.840]
We're number three.

[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.160]
Big is the fourth with a 5.0.

[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.840]
So you said we had a 5.6?

[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.360]
I said that was my psychic prediction.

[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:51.640]
No.

[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.580]
That's what you were talking about.

[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.480]
I told you we had more than a 5.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:55.180]
Yeah.

[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.700]
And that's because two to four is a disaster.

[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.340]
But anyway.

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.000]
Coach is fifth with a 4.7 tied with hot.

[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.700]
And the other, let's see.

[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.140]
I.O.D.

[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.020]
Look at that.

[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.240]
We kicked their ass.

[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.220]
3.6.

[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.400]
They're tied for 10th with the W.H.D.R.

[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:09.980]
Whatever that is.

[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:10.580]
Some crap.

[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:11.960]
3.6.

[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.520]
We got like 50% more.

[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.900]
And that includes that's 10 to 2.

[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.220]
That includes 2 hours of rush.

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.120]
Well, I can't wait to see the hourlies.

[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.360]
Are we going to get those or what?

[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.260]
I assume.

[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.020]
Then you are.

[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.240]
No, don't assume.

[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.660]
Go in there to Clarence's office and say they old fag wants the hourlies now.

[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.160]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.320]
Not this segment.

[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.140]
Oh no.

[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.780]
Go in there.

[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.540]
Coach Chris, whatever your name is.

[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.700]
I said bring a bit as soon as you got the tap scan.

[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.100]
Taps scan.

[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:35.240]
Taps scan.

[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.460]
We got two tap and it will actually take a long time.

[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.020]
Two to four PM.

[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.760]
Here we go.

[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.820]
Better than I thought.

[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.340]
Aren't you shocked?

[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.260]
We got a two share.

[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.620]
A two point.

[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:44.880]
Oh.

[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.260]
I don't know.

[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:46.700]
Sure.

[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:46.900]
What?

[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.180]
We're number 21 and 2 to 4.

[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.900]
Number one is the coast with the 6.2.

[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.340]
Now, what kind of numbers are these?

[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.020]
The coast and men put about 54.

[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.200]
Right.

[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.020]
Followed by how 105 big life.

[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.640]
I.O.D. for 6.

[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.440]
That's a rush.

[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.740]
Rush just kicking.

[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.320]

[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.460]

[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:25.920]
No.

[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.840]

John McCain has several supporters trying not to not off great here in Ohio.

[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:07.480]
Hello my friends. I just ate a soft meal here at Floucess Wiener and Snitchel's my friends.

[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.420]
With my friend, Lindsey Graham there love.

[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.820]
Yes, he's my smithers.

[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:23.060]
I enjoyed the meal my friends, especially my dessert of chocolate covered felty.

[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:30.460]
After I ate my friends I like to sing with my diapers full.

[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:40.820]
This old man John McCain, he's got water on his brain.

[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:51.980]
Here I'm a wack cow maniac who is much too old to campaign for anything I wish I could just go home.

[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.640]
I need an nap. I'm tired my friends.

[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.440]
I can't beat that guy.

[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.040]

[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.100]

[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.760]
The A's got 26 with that 0.4.

[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.880]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.960]

[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.480]
Here's the facts that really is aggravating.

[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.020]
Hello, Georgia.

[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.480]
And the O.K.

[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.740]
Congratulations on the latest book.

[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.180]
I recommend a book for both of you to read it will make for good segments when you discuss it.

[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.820]
Title how the world really works author Alan B. Jones.

[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.280]
Press A, B, J, press. A B, J.

[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.620]
You'll have a tough time getting it. No bookstores, no Amazon, etc.

[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.620]
We sent away B, J, press for it.

[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.960]
Best personal regards.

[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.580]
Caroline Ian and Hamilton, Ontario. How's it going?

[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.140]
Hey, what's a nice day, man? It's sunny.

[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.800]
Going to be like 79, 81, something like that.

[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.920]
Listen to your most days whether in Australia, Canada or Scotland.

[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.280]
And then it says, if you don't like it, we'll give you double your money for it for a pet rescue or any other charity.

[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.640]
What else talking about charity?

[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.340]
That's what Georgia's thinking. He's got his own charity.

[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:23.820]
That's right.

[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.140]
Charity begins at home. You know what they always say?

[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.120]
Yeah, it ends there too.

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.660]
And the fact that we actually got a little dribble of a bonus out of this book and I'll say it's a major miracle.

[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.920]
You know what? You were laughing at me when I said we had a possibility when I was extrapolating in my head the 2554s.

[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.940]
You didn't believe me, did you?

[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.360]
I wasn't laughing, but I didn't. I just smircled a little.

[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.020]
I curled one end of my mouth.

[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.960]
I went snorting.

[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.500]
You were snorting?

[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:50.900]
Yeah.

[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.340]
Under Tim Horton was ever snorting.

[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.080]
I know he was drinking the night that he crashed his car and got a snort.

[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.000]
Well, they called out a snort.

[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.660]
You starting with Danny Boy now again?

[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:03.880]
With poor Danny Boy?

[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.480]
Danny Boy got canned because the Neocons, they were going to show them, they were going to show the network something or two or three.

[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.800]
And they did.

[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.740]
And CBS caved in.

[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.800]
And of course that was after they got that $550,000 fine which the court sister out.

[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.300]
And they said, oh, we're flying.

[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.940]
Exxon post a new profit record.

[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:36.100]
Exxon mobile once again reported the largest quarterly profit in US history today, posting net income of 11.68 billion dollars on revenue of 138 billion in the second quarter.

[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.360]
The profit works out too.

[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.640]
I want you all to grab onto something and hold on real tight.

[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.340]
The profit works out to $1485.55 a second.

[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.860]
$1480,000, even I don't make that much.

[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.300]
$1485.55 a second.

[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.860]
Although they were short of Wall Street estimates.

[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.560]
Able is predicted they would make $12.1 billion in profit.

[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.560]
But they didn't, they only made $11.68 billion.

[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.780]
That's in the second quarter.

[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.080]
That's in three months.

[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.620]
The rape of the world continues.

[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.060]
I don't need to read any book about it.

[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.680]
I can see it.

[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.960]
You can feel it, you can smell it.

[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.620]
You can pump it.

[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.160]
WQAM, hello.

[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:24.740]
What a shame.

[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.920]
I was just going to start taking a tremendous run of calls here.

[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.700]
It's my last show for many, many days for week and a half.

[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.460]
And I would have thought today we'd have a tremendous outpouring of call.

[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.340]
When you were thought so?

[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.320]
I imagine.

[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.120]
How was it yesterday?

[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.820]
I don't remember.

[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.340]
Chris?

[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.400]
There was a whole day ago.

[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.020]
Um, not that great for calls.

[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.560]
Yeah, that's what it was.

[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320]
What does that mean?

[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.040]
I just wasn't very good calls.

[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.080]
I mean we had a couple good ones, but nothing major, nothing constant.

[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.240]
You have a lot of calls yesterday?

[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:54.740]
No.

[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.320]
I had a lot of chronics.

[00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.200]
Yeah.

[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.840]
A lot of stalkers.

[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.360]
Stalkers?

[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.180]
We always will.

[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.900]
Those homosexual stalkers, you know, your people.

[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound five.

[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.920]
We were number three and we're pretty stupid.

[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.220]
We'll take a coast to show you how this place is degenerated on the tutelage of Jolly Jobelle.

[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.920]
He's butchered and he's just strided.

[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.760]
He's decimated it.

[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.440]
And of course our sports child who still hasn't given me the hourlies.

[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.160]
He's a, he's a co-conspirator.

[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.560]
He's a meeting right now.

[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.260]
He's a meeting right now.

[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:30.260]

[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.320]
He's in a meeting right now.

[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.100]
He's in a meeting of what?

[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.300]
The emotions.

[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.040]
Sports children.

[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.000]
That's what he's in a meeting of sports nerds.

[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.260]
He promised us the hourlies and this is like the last time, remember?

[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.540]
He kept being in a meeting and he wouldn't send us stuff, remember that?

[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:45.880]
Mm-hmm.

[00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.820]
And I had a scream and carry on like a petulant child.

[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.240]
WQA and hello.

[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.820]
Hey Neal, it's people that call and thank my dear.

[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.340]
It's just killing our show.

[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.260]
Body clean!

[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.180]
It's like that.

[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.520]
WQA and hello.

[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:02.640]
Neal.

[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:03.320]
Yes.

[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.400]
Happy birthday, sir.

[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.080]
Back to you.

[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.800]
Couple of talking points here for you.

[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.020]
So I just heard the profit of course.

[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.780]
I had heard that earlier this morning.

[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.700]
But what's your position on drilling here at home?

[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.360]
What's my position?

[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.700]
It's all a big scan.

[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.420]
It's all a big scan.

[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.380]
I believe so too.

[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.020]
Of course, we have to be resourceful and use our resources with the highest infection.

[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.280]
They don't want to be resourceful.

[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.280]
What they want to do is keep shoving all the money in their Saudi buddies pockets.

[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.400]
That's what it's all about.

[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.300]
It's a game.

[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.740]
Don't you get it?

[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:33.920]
Right.

[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.300]
I need to tell the other talk, talk about drilling in homes.

[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.140]
It's just window dressing.

[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.040]
That's what it's all about.

[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.580]
I don't believe with picking up a low sea, read and baroque.

[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.100]
They're talking.

[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.960]
I think they're fear-mongering.

[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.240]
They're trying to spend the issue.

[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:46.440]
It takes 20, 10, 20 years to extract the oil and be sure.

[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.740]
I don't think that's completely accurate now.

[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.720]
I just think they're trying to spend the issue with that.

[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.300]
It's the rape of the world and they're 11 every second of it.

[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.300]
You notice as soon as there's some resistance, it's like testing how far they can go.

[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.380]
Testing the marketplace.

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.360]
How far can they go?

[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.140]
How high can we go before the public starts revolting a little bit?

[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:16.420]
They put the screen on the congress, on the consumer, and then, of course, they put the screen on the congress.

[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.600]
They're all a bunch of crooks.

[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.140]
You don't believe me?

[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.840]
Ask Ted Stevens.

[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.920]
They're all a bunch of crooks.

[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.040]
Of course, oh, 12 a.m.

[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.120]
To answer your question, six ten Allen Combs, 12 a.m.

[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.980]
From the Combs and Hannity Show.

[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.380]
12 a.m.

[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.220]
Scary America.

[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.140]
12 a.m.

[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:33.980]
You got a good number there.

[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:34.980]
Allen Combs.

[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.100]
What do you mean 12 a.m.?

[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.500]
12 midnight?

[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.360]
Yeah.

[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.900]
We don't have got no midnight numbers on here.

[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.780]
Are you kidding me overnight?

[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.480]
No, no, you were asking who it was.

[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.940]
No, no, I wasn't asking about 12 a.m.

[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.540]
I was asking about 8 to 9.

[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.480]
Something down for both of them.

[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.600]
Okay, good choice.

[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.280]
Thank you.

[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:52.660]
All right.

[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.420]
Excellent choice.

[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.940]
The Wooden Soldier, Kibble Bowl camper.

[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.020]
Standing straight and tall and erect if I can say that.

[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.620]
And his boring is, and they keep bringing it back.

[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.320]
They love it.

[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.920]
And George knows why.

[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:07.660]
Yep.

[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.380]
Sports!

[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.140]
Sports!

[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.460]
Oh yeah, do you see what they had at JFK yesterday with a luggage?

[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.420]
Nope.

[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.340]
The system broke down.

[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.660]
They computerized the software glitch, crippled the SSI.

[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.900]
So they had like 80 billion bags all over.

[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.500]
And of course, big, big, big folks that they are, American Airlines said,

[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.000]
Oh, well, you can either travel with your bags or just leave them here.

[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:30.840]
Nice.

[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:31.600]
Yeah.

[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.060]
283 votes on the pool.

[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.140]
Let's take a puke at it.

[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.200]
I may have to read this one several times today, because this is the kind of stuff they

[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:41.940]
sink their teeth into.

[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.060]
We already have 50,000 votes if Eric would have put this pool on there, you know, by 5, 6

[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.320]
yesterday afternoon instead of being out the parliament house.

[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.160]
He's getting more and more like Josh Cordis every day.

[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.300]
The weakest link on WQM is Jerks 94.

[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.040]
Kibble Bowl camper 61 is moving on up.

[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.480]
If we were smart, he'd be moving on out.

[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.700]
Jorge's got 50.

[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:11.380]
The 828, Joe Rose 22, the big 015, who's got an ego bigger than the German, it's 8 and

[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.440]
I got 6 last place.

[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:19.980]
The best tower, your 151st, your 151st, your 151st, your 162st, your 162st, your M.

[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:28.500]
The fourth leader, the three down south, where the mudwems go to hang from trees and play banjo.

[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.200]
You got some who own a station on, newfangled raiding old.

[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:43.180]
Now as North Carolina goes, rallies a big city, you know, and that's where the beesleaves

[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:47.220]
had to go for Goli, Riley, Joe, you ferry.

[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.900]
A new GM, he'll do what he can.

[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.860]
Shake your hand like a friend, then quickly walk away.

[00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.520]
Absolutely.

[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:06.920]
They had Joe, go to 56, oh, with raiding and the toilet mold to get those,

[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.340]
blaming sportful mose in order and control.

[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:19.360]
And then so, Goli, Riley, Joe, above you'll learn in the know, he lets mose.

[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.960]
Go, here's what blows, his Goli is on show.

[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:30.260]
He'll make a big change and rearray.

[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.360]
It's worse or the same, he hasn't done a thing.

[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.340]
Or what goes all the air had to, Joe don't have a stinkin' clue about a poor,

[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.440]
not that essentially blows sportful radio.

[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.100]
Oh my god.

[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.960]
Oh, 56, oh, Goli, Riley, Joe.

[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.280]
He's doin' it baby, he's done a few things, I mean that's an old bit so when he says he hasn't done a thing,

[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.800]
since that was recorded, he has a few things, all of them in the toilet bowl.

[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.480]
Get the plunger out, man, because that bowl is going to start overflown any day,

[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.820]
it's getting really full with the crap that he's put on here.

[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:42.800]
I love that nighttime point, whatever it is.

[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.580]
There's a thing where it's got the ratings in this last book from all around the country,

[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:55.160]
different markets for sports talk stations, and they're all like 17th and 24th and 199th, not good.

[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.960]
I mean, there are some markets, I didn't see like New York and Chicago and St. Louis and like that,

[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.280]
were probably doing pretty good, but around the rest of the country,

[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.060]
sports talk is in the crapper man.

[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.260]
It's down the old cube.

[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.060]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.720]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.620]
Yes, sir.

[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.040]
Hey, what do you think about the Marlin's, boy?

[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.060]
The Marlin's.

[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.120]
I don't think about them at all.

[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.740]
I love the story, we're going to be good, people are going to go start going on the games now,

[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.200]
we're back boys, we're back.

[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.560]
Yeah, likely story.

[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.060]
We're back, cowboy.

[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.840]
You can go bowling in the aisles there, man, you can bring your own bowling ball.

[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.200]
No chance, go back, get on the rubber wrap, and go back where you came from, loser.

[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:39.500]
Cowboy.

[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:44.040]
298 votes on your full, what's our goal today, 400?

[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:50.160]
Well, that's Eric's fault, he offered you an explanation of why he did it around and didn't,

[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.540]
he just wouldn't put the new full thing up there for me to change it.

[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.360]
I kept trying to change it and there was nothing on there, nothing to change.

[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.720]
Except your underwear, why did he do that?

[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.700]
I don't know.

[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.100]
I think you put them up to it.

[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.100]
Yes.

[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.200]
56670560.560 and they've rising in singular wireless line.

[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.640]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.960]
Go on the rally, it's called Bob Pusenland.

[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.300]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.440]
Come on up, shot, come on up, shot.

[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:19.960]
QAM, hello.

[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.040]
I didn't match you 202.7, do.

[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.260]
Really?

[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:24.760]
Wow.

[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.380]
They need to bring back what we're doing at night.

[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.480]
Maybe that would do something for QAM.

[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.460]
The air thing was never on Magic 102.7 and you noticed one was on it, a quick whirling

[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.280]
and a disc jockey.

[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.100]
Right.

[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.300]
Is he on the air somewhere?

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.540]
No, not yet.

[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.640]
No, Craig is not doing anything.

[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.300]
Nobody's doing something.

[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.300]
Kind of retired.

[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.760]
Okay, thanks.

[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.160]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.460]
My, my, my.

[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.360]
I bet she's doing something.

[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.420]
56670560.560 and they've rising in singular wireless line.

[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.900]
I wonder how Stan Major is doing.

[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.600]
I keep thinking of that guy so I would buy a couple of nights ago.

[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.040]
Yeah, just like he's on his double inch shades on inside.

[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.460]
What kind of a lunatic where some rest is indoors?

[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.300]
You see that sometimes.

[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.700]
Shady people.

[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:14.760]
Is that it?

[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.940]
That maybe that's why I thought I'd stand major.

[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.760]
Not so slim with shady.

[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.520]
WQAM, hello.

[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.580]
They'll tell your sportholders no Marlin Stadium.

[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:27.820]
Yeah.

[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.180]
Like I haven't been saying that for a hundred years.

[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.880]
Have I been saying that for a hundred years?

[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:34.340]
Uh-huh.

[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.140]
Schmuck.

[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.340]
56670560.560.

[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.720]
See what you understand sir is that the powers that be since everybody the whole world is nothing but corruption.

[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.400]
They're going to go ahead and they made their back door deal and they're going to shove it through.

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:46.800]

[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.320]
And no matter what Norman Brahmins says or anybody else, they're going to push it.

[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.560]
Just like the Metro fail.

[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.060]
Everything else if it doesn't make any sense, let's do it.

[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.140]
Like near a thingy, thingy per canyotherr with the Mickey Erison behind closed doors.

[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.660]
I just wonder if any palms got greased on that whole deal with the Mickey Arena.

[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:06.320]
Huh?

[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:06.820]
What do you think?

[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.800]
There's a lot of grease in going on.

[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.820]
Let me tell you right now.

[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.260]
56670560.

[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.960]
It's pretty slow on that phone today.

[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:16.940]
You were right.

[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.680]
Must be your fault.

[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:20.720]
You know what it is.

[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.060]
No, it's the fault of the fact there's nobody in town right now.

[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:24.820]
It's the 30th.

[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.440]
It's today the 31st of Julio.

[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.600]
This is the last day of our sale.

[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.680]
Uno de Agosto.

[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:29.600]
See.

[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:30.560]
Wow.

[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.320]
We better get with the right language now because if you look at these numbers, see.

[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.900]
The market has turned, I mean, it was pretty lopsided before.

[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.720]
But now it is just no speaking English.

[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.340]
I mean, it's just amazing.

[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.640]
Just shocking.

[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.180]
Right.

[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:47.880]
Right.

[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.880]
Maybe we ought to give Paco his own show.

[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:51.880]
There you go.

[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.080]
Get him to do something.

[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.580]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.020]
QAM, hello.

[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.320]
QAM.

[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.560]
Morning, Neil.

[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.400]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.920]
I see where you're starting to follow them, gubby.

[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.080]
No, I'm not.

[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:12.240]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:12.980]
You mentioned them in the fall.

[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.600]
Let me say it again.

[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.220]
No, I'm not.

[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.900]
You can call every day and say the same stupid thing about them, cubbies.

[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.980]
And then when they go into a big skin, they're like 17 games behind with 15 left to go.

[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:22.980]
What are you going to say then?

[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.200]
You must be delusional, man.

[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.780]
You must be on heavy-duty drugs.

[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320]
I'll meet you at Murphy's.

[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:31.980]
We're not interested about Murphy's bleachers, or the cubs, or Steve Stone, or any other modicone.

[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:32.740]
Not interested.

[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.600]
Take your cubs and stuff them.

[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.160]
God are you boring.

[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:36.820]
Jesus.

[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.140]
How about them, cubbies?

[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:38.920]
How about them coming?

[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.820]
Not interested in the cubbies or in baseball or anything that boring.

[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.540]
I'm an old, daughtering queen.

[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.920]
Okay, and I don't have that many years left, so I'm certainly not going to waste my time with stuff that's boring.

[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.180]
Good God.

[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:53.540]
Three hundred of hosts on the pool.

[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.380]
That's not a bad number.

[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.200]
Not a good number.

[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.120]
Nice going, you're about...

[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.140]
No, Eric screwed up my whole, all my plans.

[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.260]
I thought we'd have a rip-roar in the response and his pool and leave it to him.

[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.380]
He said, I'm sorry.

[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.740]
I had to leave early and didn't get home until very late.

[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.400]
I wish time.

[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.600]
Well, don't do it again.

[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.400]
No, in fact, do it anytime you want.

[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.360]
Now for an ex-cubber, we said George isn't worried about.

[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.440]
George hates the pools anyway.

[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:16.780]
Right.

[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.480]
Don't you usually put him on right before the show?

[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:18.820]
Right.

[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.840]
Well, that's a no way to get him in votes.

[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.220]
It's the same amount of people voting.

[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.040]
What do you mean by that?

[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.080]
By the time you change it.

[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.000]
In other words, let's say a thousand people vote on the pool typically.

[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.100]
They're always going to vote no matter when you change it.

[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.300]
We only wish a thousand people voted on the pool typically.

[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.120]
We only wish.

[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:40.000]
We only wish this radio station and a thousand people still listening to it since Jolly Jo and his demolition crew

[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.080]
came down from Raleigh in that big van.

[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.020]
I think we can do better.

[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.560]
In that moving van and what it is, they move the audience off of QA and MN at the right place.

[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.140]
That's right.

[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.120]
Well, you know, who was it?

[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.240]
It's the program director that wanted to be number two.

[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.260]
No, not the program director of the General Manjury.

[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.040]
Tim Williams.

[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.900]
Oh, I'll be a safe number two.

[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.700]
I'll probably be a safe number two on the risky number one.

[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.560]
I'll never forget that.

[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.220]
It's like the either one that's a big unwieldy audience.

[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:03.800]
That's right.

[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.780]
And the company's difficult.

[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.580]
It's dangerous, right?

[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:06.000]
Number one.

[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.420]
That was when I was in Zeta.

[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:07.760]
Right.

[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.460]
And Tim Williams, who got the job as GM only because he was the son-in-law of the Olivia,

[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.200]
their own the station.

[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:12.480]
Right.

[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.560]
The total is like, I can't.

[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.480]
A real moron, Tim Williams.

[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.720]
Oh, it would rather be a safe number two.

[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.940]
Don't be saying all those things, you know.

[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:21.680]
WQA and hello.

[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.100]
Neil.

[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:23.940]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.000]
How about a poll or how about doing a poll who would be better from two to four?

[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.300]
You mean, Galby?

[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.600]
We've all done that.

[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.260]
Oh, my.

[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.320]
Been there.

[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:34.880]
Done that.

[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:37.520]
Click.

[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.260]
See, hit him on here at response.

[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.960]
He just wanted to make his statement.

[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.100]
Make sound of words, mouth.

[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:46.800]
Right.

[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:57.620]
See, I've seen an envelope where we were up against that first couple of months down on the second floor.

[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.840]
Although, it couldn't have been because it was over.

[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.820]
It was the end of December.

[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.320]
Football season was ending, not beginning.

[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.580]
Neil, you ready for some smash mouth for ball?

[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.200]
I remember that call like it was only yesterday.

[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.420]
Just like they got it, they told me I lost touch with the audience with that Eric Clapton.

[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.300]
WQA and hello.

Good to see you.

[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.280]
Another cab driver went down in the line of beauty last night.

[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.300]
Meaning what?

[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.140]
Not my army.

[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.140]
They killed the cab driver last night.

[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.460]
Well, that's not good.

[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.280]
That's very good.

[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.520]
There's banana republic.

[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.760]
Oh, it's very good?

[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.120]

[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.380]
And what?

[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.540]
That was my question and what?

[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.620]
It was a response today.

[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:53.220]
Yeah.

[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:54.880]
Wow.

[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:56.860]
I've told you something.

[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.200]
Banana republic is the word I'll write in your part of it, man.

[00:42:59.300 --> 00:42:59.880]
You're part of the fruiner.

[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.580]
You're the people that Lou Dobbs is always screaming about.

[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:04.920]
WQA and hello.

[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:06.460]

Yes, sir.

[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.340]
What were you and Taco doing when you hit the wall?

[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.040]
Ah, ah, ah!

[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.980]
Taco wasn't in the car, ballet.

[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:16.820]
I was in the car.

[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.520]
It was 8 o'clock on the Sunday morning.

[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.300]
You think Taco or anybody else is getting up at 8 o'clock on the Sunday morning?

[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.700]
I don't think so.

[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.620]
But you keep hallucinating, man.

[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.900]
In fact, I got a perfect story for this guy.

What was that?

[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.060]
No idea.

[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.940]
Is that a Canadian story?

[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:33.820]
Evidently.

[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.100]
What is this from?

[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.320]

[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.060]
I've only heard the name.

[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.540]

[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:55.640]
Nearodgers.

[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.260]
Yes.

[00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:58.420]
Hello.

[00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.560]
Yes, sir.

[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.200]
I would have said one in the ass is better than two in the mouth.

[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.780]
That's what I got to say about these mounds.

[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.080]
One in the ass is what?

[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.240]
Is better than two in the mouth.

[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:10.840]
Okay.

[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.280]
One in the ass is worse two in the mouth.

[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.960]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.460]
It calls their singularly sensation.

[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.120]
You were right.

[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.740]
They're special today.

[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.420]
And of course, ask me if I'm really all that concerned about you really all that because

[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.400]
once you get to be two o'clock, I'm not going to do everything off and here for like

[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.080]
ten days.

[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:30.240]
Right.

[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:30.860]
What's your gun?

[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:31.900]
I'm gone.

[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.140]
I don't know if I'm going to go anywhere though.

[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.000]
You're going to have a staycation as they say.

[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:38.400]
I don't know.

[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.500]
And as far as the audience is concerned, Nanya has been right.

[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.300]
Oh, where are you going to go this time?

[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.320]
You're going back to Europe.

[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.040]
You're going to Amsterdam.

[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.200]
You know, people ask me where did deal go and I say, I don't know.

[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.020]
They don't know.

[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:51.800]
I didn't ask.

[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.600]
I will all hear about it when he gets back from wherever he went if he went anywhere.

[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:56.200]
Mm hmm.

[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.320]
You might like the last vacation.

[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:57.820]
Sure.

[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.660]
Which is the last minute deal.

[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:00.700]
Right.

[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.400]
And Amsterdam.

[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.380]
People think I'm obsessed with private life as they are.

[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.340]
Oh, exactly.

[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.700]
And believe me, if my life were all that exciting, which these people think just like they

[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.640]

[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:17.880]
WQAM, hello.

[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:19.380]
Hello, Neil.

[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.760]
Yes, how about bringing back Ed Berliner or Mercury Morris?

[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:24.800]
Mm hmm.

[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.060]
I mean, I'm coming.

[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:30.220]
They were like the, part of the Golden Age of QAM back in the mid-90s.

[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.100]
They were like the, part of the Golden Age of QAM back in the mid-90s.

[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.520]
They were like the, part of the Golden Age of QAM back in the mid-90s.

[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.360]
They were like the, part of the Golden Age of QAM back in the mid-90s.

[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.560]
They had a nose for sports.

[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.300]
I'll tell you that.

[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:46.320]
Fender 28 votes on the poll, let's see who's getting hammered, as they say.

[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:56.200]
The weakest link on WQM is Jerks 107, Volcamp or 68, George 57, DA 31, Joos 25, the big

[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.220]
O-22, Mad Dog and I are tied with Nina piece.

[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.580]
I've got you Robert Bieber voted several times.

[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:02.860]
Probably for me.

[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.100]
Yeah.

[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.460]
Yeah, yeah

[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.260]
If you're in 20 vote, I don't think you're gonna make no 500 like I said the goal is 400 today

[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:15.940]
What do you think are we safe on that? Yeah, I think so we can get the 400 WDQ YM. Hello

[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:27.800]
WDQ YM hello, no, yes, you remember San Dino Hernandez. No, no, you're right at Arlington Park never heard of him

[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.040]
You don't remember my saw the other night

[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.960]
I never heard of him never heard of my surprise

[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:40.000]
You're the guy that you're the guy that would have heard of my time. I don't don't worry about how do you feel about Obama?

[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.120]
Getting aggressive about Afghanistan

[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.900]
I think he ought to go over there and kill the Taliban. That's what he ought to do kill them all those were the guys that we paid

[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.740]
You know you remember that when they were fighting the Russians we

[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:57.800]
That's correct, but you think our good friends the packies invented them too when you forgot that

[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:02.740]
So what you want to do is you want to whack them now? What I want to do is them get on with my life

[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:07.880]
56705 60 pound 560 and even rising sing it a right us line

[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.280]
Great intellectual caller there. Well, what do you want to do about the Taliban?

[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.840]
Sent them a salami sandwich. They would be good make sure it's halal

[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:19.640]
Make sure that some schmata head and

[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.980]
Kerr kiss it and get cursed it before you were worsted

[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.020]
Germans like their worst

[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.820]
The Austrians though are the worst just ask John Jaros. He'll tell you

[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:36.920]
He knows all about it. That's right. He'll tell you if you want to see a real Nazi forget about Germany go to Austria go to Vienna

[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.300]
Get some of that V&E sausage

[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:46.380]
That's one country I would never never go to if you paid my airfare in the hotel and the whole deal

[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:48.440]
Austria

[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:57.040]
You know, we Austrians no, I can't say that I do this John Jaros Austrian is that his deal?

[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:02.440]
No, I mean he's you know a little little a little above or something a little above one

[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.740]
His his ancestry

[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.080]
Nazi is that what you're saying? Yes a little bit Nazi very very bad like a down in Marie a little very easy

[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.560]
A little bit of man. They're shiny

[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.340]
Later

[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:24.400]
The director of Batman and the producer of Mama Mia

[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:35.580]
It's one mother of a movie the dark night star Christian veils following up his record smashing Batman movie with a stint in jail as British

[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:39.400]
Media reporting was arrested today for allegedly assaulting his mother and sister

[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.240]
Batman versus his mama

[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.020]
I don't want to talk

[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:51.220]
Because it makes me feel bad where do we begin

[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:59.020]
Christian Bayer is no mama's boy. I wasn't exactly what I had in mind when

[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:04.460]
So I wanted to inspire people Batman versus his mama

[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.440]
It used to be so good

[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.440]
It's simple to kill the Batman

[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:16.020]
Serenzo Beating is not advised

[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:32.800]
Maybe you can explain to me what that's all about that mama Mia crap. Oh, I've been asking that question and I have this

[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.680]
I'm in back

[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.480]
Why did they make it in the first place?

[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.640]
Target audience to that kind of thing old fat women. I don't know. Okay

[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.120]
Yeah, all right

[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.260]
But mama, but I always think of that. Yes, the Rick Springfield one of your favorites

Looking old and and very gay with little girlly glasses on the head out of here Rick Springfield is not gay. I want to go is

[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:02.180]
More than ask your friend Linda Blair. She'll tell you what the morning shows. She's seen it. She sniffed it

[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.480]
Matt Lauer one of those

[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:08.960]
He wrote son of Paul Matt Lauer man you talk about another one of these guys much into about nothing

[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.280]
That's mad lower. He's kind of like the Anderson Pupu of NBC

[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.380]
without the nepotism

[00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:15.440]

Mm-hmm. Let's take this idea of the way. In fact, in fact, isn't that Greg Reid said you sandbag the station now

[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:56.120]
I was thinking about that this morning see when you say somebody sandbags that that implies doing something intentionally

[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.920]
Torpedoed was what he said. Oh, I don't know either. That's even worse than sand

[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:06.700]
Sandbag can we stay sandbag because anywhere that ends in bag Joyce don't like to say like no starts with like do sure

Of my apologies. I would have thought for sure. I'd go do a producer first. No, you wouldn't what do you got?

[01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:39.710]
I just wanted to ask you in your opinion. I'm sort of a

[01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:43.890]
Radio junkie. That's and it just a lot of good sign

[01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.230]
I said and what's the question?

[01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:49.530]
The this question is

[01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:57.670]
What happened in your opinion in the last I don't know six seven eight years that just seems like the call get dumber

[01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:00.390]
It's like the dumbing of America or something

[01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:07.810]
and and I just I just don't get it. I mean, I'm such a junkie boy and I at first didn't care for George

[01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:14.330]
But I really warmed up to this guy and uh and then when I listen to your callers calling in it's just like

[01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:19.830]
Man, give me back that last 30 minutes of my life. No, it's not you love it

[01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:22.170]
I do have it

[01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:29.050]
I love when you get the occasional good guy. I do not want one second happen

[01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:36.010]
Uh, that's that's a very good question. I've listened to you for I don't know how many years

[01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:44.110]
I'm in my late 50s. I lived in Polargaela. I moved to the keys and kind of lost QA. I'm a little bit down there

[01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:46.130]
We can get it on a good day

[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:47.790]
but uh

[01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:52.610]
Something changed in that show that show you know it seems like it used to be driven by

[01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:56.030]
Funnier calls. So something changed in what show?

[01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:03.510]
In the Neil Rogers show. What's the one you're saying in that show like you're talking in the eighth person or something? What does that mean?

[01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:08.250]
Is this like an out of body experience for you or something? I mean, what are you talking about?

[01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:15.010]
No, this is but you know, it's not like there's a lot of choices to do it to another channel

[01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.950]
Good radio. Oxymoron man

[01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:22.770]
Well, I'm sorry. You know, I used to do a little radio down here in the key. Oh boy

[01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:26.470]
And I thought I'm not going to go there like I know something about what you do

[01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:31.470]
But I was lucky enough to work at a station where it was a single individual owner

[01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:35.570]
That gave me life and to pretty much do what I wanted to do

[01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:38.530]
Well, those days you're going to say you can't you can't do what you want to do

[01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:42.290]
You can't do what to show you want to do and have a great life. Oh my god

[01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.130]
What's this?

[01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:29.050]
What's your name?

[01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:31.710]
I'm a volunteer.

[01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:34.250]
WQ a.m. Hello

[01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:36.570]
Neil. Yes, sir

[01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:39.710]
Take the pull your ass you asshole.

[01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:42.330]
Oh, that's good.

[01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:45.730]
That was the asparagus guy.

[01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:47.030]
Mm-hmm

[01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:53.150]
378 votes. I don't think you're going to make 400

[01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:58.330]
No, we'll get it. I think we ought to sign off for the summertime save a lot of juice.

[01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.650]
I know that many of you are doing the day. That's all for the day. That's all for the day.

[01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:03.530]
We always do that. We ought to sign off like especially after seven o'clock at night

[01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:05.950]
I'm a million. I don't

[01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:07.490]
Just to think down the

[01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:10.330]
I'm a reed. Saving jubilee. 60 Q.A.M.

[01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:12.030]
The fourth leader

[01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:14.210]
Spread them and say cheese

[01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:25.590]
We'll do anything

[01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:28.490]
I think one of you

[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:30.010]
We're the puppets

[01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:33.050]
Absolutely

[01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:35.630]
We buy everything

[01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:38.030]
We sell all the news

[01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:40.030]
We're the puppets

[01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.690]
You got it

[01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:45.710]
We buy everything

[01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:45.710]

[01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:45.710]

[01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:46.150]
We buy everything

[01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.070]
We buy everything

[01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:53.410]
We buy everything

[01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:53.710]
We buy everything

[01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:54.750]
We're the puppets

[01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.650]
So easy to

[01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.090]
I'm if you like

[01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.630]
We're the puppets

[01:18:09.710 --> 01:18:10.490]
I'm in the teeth

[01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:12.890]
I've got a way

[01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:14.930]
If we're the puppets

[01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:20.650]
Let them water

[01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:22.970]
All that's not that great

[01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:27.390]
For what does that matter to you

[01:18:28.890 --> 01:18:30.130]
Who needs rights

[01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:34.330]
That's what's for the

[01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:34.670]
Soot

[01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:36.890]
It leads for you

[01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:38.890]
With the puppets

[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.600]
I

[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.300]
No

[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:44.900]
Procession

[01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:45.760]
I

[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.120]
Got

[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:47.540]
Got

[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:47.820]
Got

[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:47.960]
Got

[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:48.080]
Got

[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.400]
Got

[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:48.900]

[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:49.340]
Got

[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:52.020]
Got

[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:52.020]

[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.020]
Got

[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.040]

[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:01.360]

[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.260]
Nu

[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:08.340]
Maybe it just starts to obey your command.

[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:14.160]
Nobody has the balls, you pay just pay with the profits.

[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:22.480]
It's ruined you, it's ruined me, don't be afraid.

[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:27.260]
You know, I just sometimes just cross my mind.

[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.420]
I've never thought I'd be poor.

[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.760]
Yeah, with it?

[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040]
I wonder if puppets fart.

[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.620]
It depends.

[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:36.720]
They fart and they're depends?

[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:37.720]
Suck puppets do.

[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:43.500]
1145 at 560 WQM, the cause of Inspectora today, including that really

[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:47.400]
terminal guy that was giving me a song of dance about talk radio and about how he worked

[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.000]
a key West and was fortunate enough to work for some boring guy who let him.

[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:51.700]
Who cares?

[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:57.060]
It's a radio show, that's all, it's a means to an end, it's a mockster leban as they say in

[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:57.940]
China, a mockster.

[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.460]
Oh, it's big in China, how'd you like to be breathing in that pollute?

[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.760]
Oh, no thanks, what's talking about that?

[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.900]
My god, I got everything you wanted.

[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.640]
You make L.A. look pristine and clean.

[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:07.480]
Dog with lead sauce and poison sauce.

[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:08.700]
I love this spot.

[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:09.940]
Get in my place.

[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.320]
Also impressed, I swished a guyco and saved over $600.

[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.300]
I was very happy.

[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:16.140]
Guyco.

[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.200]
Real service, real savings.

[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.160]
Am I smiling?

[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.020]
I can't do this.

[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:27.300]
I mean ordinarily, I'm not all that fun to her anymore, you know, for like the last hundred

[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:27.600]
years.

[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.440]
Yeah, but once in a while she can be pretty funny when she's making fun of herself.

[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.180]
Right, working that ad.

[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.860]
And that's, I mean, guyco doesn't have too many clinkers.

[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.420]
Too many stinkers, clarkers.

[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.280]
382 vote on the poll.

[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:47.160]
And you're, oh, you're catching Kimba, you got a good hospital for a second place.

[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.880]
Speaking of a good hospital, let's see what day is the third Sunday.

[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:52.940]
That's the hospital.

[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:56.200]
Yes, the Monmouth and Big Brown is making his comeback in the Haskell on Sunday.

[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:58.240]
You're going to plunge your guts out, Big Brown.

[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:58.660]
Yeah.

[01:20:59.340 --> 01:20:59.620]
Downtown.

[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.580]
Oh, yeah, don't tell me you lost your enthusiasm for horse racing already.

[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:03.200]
No, of course not.

[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.900]
You're on fire about it during those gallstream shows and that's because you were getting paid for it.

[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.520]
Just in behind them, kiddestine.

[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.540]
I'm excited when I'm here.

[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:09.960]
It arrives.

[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.200]
The rails comes on third, kiddestine is fourth.

[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.520]
Then we have Bella Creek in the fifth.

[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.620]
Chocolate for lunches, six bucks, seven lengths off the lead.

[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:24.960]
Then silver, fox trail, and Cayman Peacchew has two beaten, those being splicey dish, and Natalie's archer.

[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.460]
I guess where that race is from when you're from Danloys L.

[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:28.260]
I don't know.

[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.140]
Yeah, you do.

[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:31.060]
Woodbine, that's correct.

[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:32.820]
The untrust-lake secret.

[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:37.540]
Bella Creek is on the outside and within striking range, Cateriana is still at the...

[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:38.200]
Who do you like better?

[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.500]
Ten-teachers or Brian Sears?

[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:40.500]
Who?

[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.040]
Nobody at QAM, hello.

[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:42.380]
Who are you?

[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:43.120]
We're on it.

[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:43.820]
Anything goes.

[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.720]
If you've heard this message, please.

[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:46.720]
WQAM, hello.

[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.680]
Danielle, what's it...

[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:52.180]
What's it that George's going to do with a toy show with Lucy Lopez I'm waiting?

[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:53.100]
Is what?

[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.420]
Again, what's that?

[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.480]
The toy show.

[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:57.840]
And what is that?

[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:58.720]
I know.

[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.020]
It's one of those bits where he goes over killing good time.

[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.040]
I don't know if he's talking about him personally or with their audience.

[01:22:07.180 --> 01:22:08.580]
What are you talking about, sir?

[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.740]
Are you talking double talk?

[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:14.540]
I don't know, he always talks about killing good time, but I'm not sure if he's talking about...

[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.120]
Yours, yours, believe me, you've got plenty of it.

[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:19.420]
WQAM, hello.

[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:21.560]
Danielle.

[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:22.440]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:23.900]
Hey, what's up, man?

[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:24.820]
How you doing, Bella?

[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:29.740]
The guy calling about the show, I think what's happened, I've been a long time listening.

[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:34.480]
And I think it's plain to see that Joyce's the show, you know?

[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.040]
Mm-hmm.

[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:35.480]
That's not.

[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:42.780]
We made little bonus money in this last book and actually was on the first page in a ratings number three.

[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.500]
It's a miracle.

[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:51.760]
Yeah, but I'm asking you, because I know you always said that the silence here would never go through,

[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.240]
which are a pinion about that.

[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.120]
It's going through.

[01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:55.980]
No, it already went through it.

[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.540]
That's what I'm saying, it's going through.

[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.700]
It's a done deal.

[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.500]
And you know what?

[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.640]
And I still don't want to have it.

[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.560]
And you said again, and I still won't subscribe to it.

[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.420]
I still don't want it.

[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.660]
And there's some keeps calling me, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, because the accident wasn't that damn pondiac, you know, when we bought it.

[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:18.260]
And so they keep bugging me and I don't want to take me off your list.

[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.100]
Don't call here anymore.

[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.100]
I don't want to.

[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:22.620]
You want it?

[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:23.940]
You want sound like radio?

[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.100]
I have sound like radio.

[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:25.800]
You do?

[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.340]
I have a free subscription to series, yeah.

[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.120]
And?

[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.740]
I listened to a couple of music stations on Sunday.

[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.740]
It's a pinion of the ass by the way.

[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:31.960]
You got to be in the door.

[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.960]
You don't listen to how I read the door.

[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:33.760]
Who?

[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.120]
388 out of poll.

[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:38.360]
Boy, you're really struck me to get to four.

[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:39.280]
We're going to do it.

[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.280]
We're going to do 500 a day if it's the last damn thing we do.

[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:42.960]
All right.

[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.400]
We're going to push it and push it and I mean, Jesus got all mighty.

[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:48.700]
These are already, it's one of those polls our audience usually.

[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.740]
They eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.080]
They lap it up.

[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:54.320]
I guess where I'm going at two o'clock.

[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.160]
What?

[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:56.400]
You got it.

[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:56.860]
Good guess.

[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.100]
I'm on a street there like you wouldn't believe.

[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.500]
He has to damn plan quick hit, the two cent quick hit.

[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.280]
Not that it's interesting, but it kills some time.

[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.760]
And then of course I play to max 300 which is six bucks a play.

[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.760]
Most of these sluppers are playing 20, 30 coins, you know.

[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.960]
I mean 20 credits that's 40 cents.

[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.680]
How much, how much you going to make on any game playing 40 cents a shot?

[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.120]
So anyway, I'm playing it and the machine seemed dead as a door nail.

[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.180]
I was getting ready to leave except they're all jam packed because it's real popular now.

[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:30.580]
And so I'm stuck at this machine and I hit it and all of a sudden here's seven quick hits.

[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:31.980]
1100 bucks.

[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:34.660]
How do you like that?

[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:35.560]
Okay.

[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.120]
I liked it.

[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.660]
And they came and paid me and said, I said, where's the door?

[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:40.660]
I think I know what's over here.

[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.160]
Bye bye.

[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.640]
Bye bye.

[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.320]
I'm on a wild streak there.

[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:45.740]
I have no idea why it's called.

[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.320]
You know what's called?

[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:47.160]
Look.

[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.160]
Blind look.

[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.120]
WDQA in.

[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:50.340]
Hello.

[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:51.680]
Hey, Neil.

[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:52.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.800]
You know, someone should kick in that door with a brain trust.

[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.600]
This is a consulting and tell them that from two to four, man, we want George.

[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.120]
Yeah.

[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.440]
What do you think?

[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.020]
Can somebody out the ball to do that over there?

[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:07.500]
No.

[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.820]
Maybe George ought to do it.

[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.460]
Maybe George ought to go there, kick the door down and say, I want that two to four shot.

[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.680]
Now, don't bring back that squeak, myster, for Christ's sake.

[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:17.820]
You want it?

[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.100]
Now, of course, they wouldn't pay any more money for it.

[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:21.480]
What do you talking to me?

[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.080]
Yeah.

[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:22.680]
No, no.

[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.780]
For no more money, no.

[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:25.660]
Thank you.

[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.200]
How about if they give you a lot of money?

[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:27.740]
Okay.

[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.400]
How much do you think George is pulling down?

[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.660]
I don't know.

[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.320]
Couple of hundred grand?

[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:37.180]
No.

[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:37.800]
One city.

[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:38.940]
One hundred.

[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:39.800]
One city?

[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:41.780]
One twenty.

[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:42.240]
Maybe.

[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.720]
People are starving and they're paying him for that...

[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.420]
Carpet Hatcher.

[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:49.640]
Oops, and he's heating.

[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.000]
I like that color.

[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:51.580]
I call this one.

[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:51.920]
Come on back.

[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:53.980]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.520]
He does the heat and hoops I like him.

[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.700]
Maybe we could put him on from two to four.

[01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.380]
He'd pay us.

[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:00.960]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:01.840]
No.

[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:02.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.900]
It's not bad to be at number three in the Philippines because the only ocean was number three at one time on K-S-E-K and the stopoverty.

[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.640]
Then he wants a number two to follow.

[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.240]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.660]
Death cost him, give me a round of gas.

[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.360]
Come on.

[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.880]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:20.860]
Yeah, you know, after Robert's...

[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:25.220]
You know, sometimes I really like listening to your shit and then in their old times I think I'm out there.

[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:26.040]
I don't know.

[01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:31.780]
I don't know.

[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:32.220]
I know.

[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:34.860]
I don't have to ask myself if I'm about that call.

[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:35.320]
I know.

[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.140]
Who did that song, Barbara George?

[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:39.700]
I know.

[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:41.540]
That's a good song.

[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.060]
I think it is.

[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:43.060]
You got it?

[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:43.820]
You got Barbara George?

[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.320]
I know if it was a big hit.

[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.380]
About a hundred years ago.

[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.140]
Back when they hit like real music.

[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.560]
There it is.

[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.300]
When I was a South Man, I don't know.

[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:53.240]
It's man, I love it.

[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.460]
What year?

[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.140]
Sixty or two.

[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:57.980]
I know.

[01:26:58.500 --> 01:26:58.900]
I know.

[01:26:59.400 --> 01:26:59.760]
You know?

[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:01.040]
Nailed it.

[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:01.780]
Wow.

[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:02.980]
All the time.

[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:03.920]
No, no, no.

[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:04.560]
No more.

[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.640]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.440]
The cast is busy, Yovon.

[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:10.240]
Yovon.

[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:11.480]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.740]
Come here, Nail.

[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:13.380]
Yeah.

[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.240]
I think that George is going out with my traces.

[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:17.940]
Hello.

[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:18.220]
Yeah.

[01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:18.920]
I'm here.

[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.120]
I think he goes out with my traces.

[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:20.940]
I'll be masking.

[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.580]
Mm-hmm.

[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:23.420]
I think that.

[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.600]
W-Q-Y-M, hello.

[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.240]
W-Q-Y-M, yes.

[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.320]
Speak to God, please.

[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:33.740]
Speaking.

[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:35.140]
How are you?

[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.620]
No, we're a Wingo Star.

[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.200]
My name is Colleague.

[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.100]
Larry King's and Wingo Star on the show the other night.

[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.540]
How very unfortunate, yeah.

[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.640]
Well, Wingo put him in this place.

[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:54.100]
It was Wingo that just celebrated the sixth day birthday and Larry King was going on and on and on about his age and everything.

[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.440]
And finally, Wingo looked at Larry and says, well, look at you.

[01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.600]
You've been here forever and then he says, how old were you?

[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.960]
110, 120?

[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.060]
And I thought to myself, boy, he did meal proud, so.

[01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:05.820]
Yeah.

[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.020]
I always like that Wingo.

[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:08.580]
Nice going.

[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.620]
No talent for a good sense of humor.

[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.380]
393, I think, by the top of the hour, we're going to be like,

[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:16.680]
breaking 400 on there.

[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:20.400]
Whatever happened to Glenn Rinker, by the way, the crope, I think he might have.

[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.980]
Is he the one that blew his brains out or not?

[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:22.220]
No.

[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.040]
I don't know.

[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.780]
He was like a munchkin.

[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.640]
He was like a little guy.

[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.180]
I had no idea.

[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.420]
I think he, we're like Bob Mayer.

[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.240]
He used to sit on six phone books when he did the news.

[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:35.040]
Who is the guy that blew his brains out, the newsman, from Channel 10, I believe.

[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:35.660]
I don't know.

[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:36.380]
Orlando.

[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.600]
He woke up one day and he realized he was in Orlando.

[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:39.900]
It was brains out.

[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:40.540]
I don't blame him.

[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:43.200]
Poor Eric, man.

[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.380]
It's really sad.

[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.460]
He's got to be in that place.

[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.560]
Maybe that's why he wouldn't put my poll on yesterday.

[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.580]
Maybe he was really depressed.

[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.800]
He was out late, he said.

[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.220]
Out late doing what?

[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:53.460]
He's a married man with a family.

[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.900]
He can't afford to be out late on a weeknight on a freaking Wednesday.

[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:56.960]
Not what's wrong with that, man.

[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.080]
You married me with a family you need to be out late on a weeknight.

[01:28:59.240 --> 01:28:59.840]
It's not possible.

[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.020]
Good thinking, Eric.

[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.360]
More power to you.

[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:03.860]
A few a.m.

[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.680]
No more calls.

[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:06.500]
Yeah, right.

[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:08.320]
This is the guy that told me five days ago.

[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:09.540]
Three more days, no more calls.

[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.360]
And here's his stupid call on again.

[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.760]
And there'll be 12 more days, no calls for me, because I won't be on here.

[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:18.340]
And when I come back on Tuesday, whatever that date is, there'll be plenty of calls.

[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:19.600]
Schmuck.

[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:21.920]
W.Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:23.280]
Hey, Neil.

[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.220]
Have a good vacation.

[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:25.320]
Thanks.

[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:28.300]
And a Rocco bomb as wife is gone.

[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:29.520]
Okay, yeah.

[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.140]
One note earlier again.

[01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:31.340]
Why?

[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.220]
Is she, what was the first freshness he was using?

[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.700]
Does she have what it takes?

[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:36.540]
Is she have what it takes?

[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:37.020]
She has what it takes.

[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.480]
I think she does have what it takes.

[01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:39.540]
She's got what it takes.

[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.160]
It's only one thing that she needs to have.

[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:41.760]
That's right.

[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:42.620]
She's got it.

[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:44.640]
She evidently has one.

[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:47.920]
We have a 95 vote on our world famous pool.

[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:50.320]
The weakest link on W.Q.A.M. is Jerk 127.

[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:51.280]
Week.

[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.080]
Week.

[01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.820]
With a two share, although I'll be honest with you, that's about twice a while I thought he would get.

[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:58.900]
It's twice what Geldig got last time he was on the air.

[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.140]
And twice what Mo got between two and four.

[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.920]
When they had a one point.

[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.600]
Oh, God.

[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.860]
The kind of note, like I said, Florence Walk Radio.

[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:06.580]
I want that too.

[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:07.220]
We'll honor it.

[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.580]
And that's what Joe Bellen is specializing in.

[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.160]
Those are the kind of numbers that he rebels in.

[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.420]
Kim Bokap were second with 80 Georgia 72 right on Kim's ass.

[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.020]
DA 39 to big O 29.

[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.580]
Joe Rose 29.

[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:20.920]
Mad Dog is slipped out of me.

[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.480]
He's got 10.

[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:22.980]
And I'm still sitting with nine.

[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:30.260]
The best talent for the new largest sport radio 560 QAM.

[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.020]
The sports leader.

[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:32.980]
It's Dick Cheney.

[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.480]
I'd like to relax by having Mary Magdalen massage my balls while listening to the Neil

[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480]
Rogers 12th of an hour.

[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:38.520]
You can behave.

[01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:40.600]
Two nine on discovery.

[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:41.800]
Sharks.

[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.840]
Two Maronite on discovery.

[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.160]
Sharks.

[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.220]
Followed by several more nights of Sharks.

[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.120]
Yes, it's bits I'm programming once again here at Discovery.

[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:53.400]
Sharks.

[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.460]
Sharks and more Sharks.

[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.680]
Not fascinated by Sharks.

[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:58.520]
Okay.

[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:01.960]
Let's check out the Discovery Channel Video Library, shall we?

[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.780]
It's in here.

[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:06.980]
Let's see what else they have to put on the outside of the Sharks.

[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.320]
See there.

[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:08.920]
Sharks.

[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:10.820]
Sharks.

[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.900]
See this one here?

[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.020]
Oh, Sharks.

[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:15.280]
How about this one here?

[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:16.480]
Sharks.

[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.180]
Well, here's one.

[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:20.580]
Bonsi jumps the Sharks.

[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.920]
There's some more here.

[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.080]
Sharks.

[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.540]
Lots of Sharks.

[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.980]
Oh, I guess, uh, don't miss it.

[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:30.900]
You know.

[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.020]
Two nine on discovery.

[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.480]
Followed by one at 560 WQAM.

[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:38.540]
Happy, uh, 3rd day to sound like a little marshmallow, because I'm eating right?

[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:39.700]
I'm eating it.

[01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:40.160]
I'm eating it.

[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:41.000]
Schneider's weenie, yeah.

[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:41.680]
I nuke it.

[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.200]
During the break.

[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:44.800]
Ah, if I didn't nuke it long enough.

[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:45.900]
Uh-oh.

[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:46.620]
Half cold.

[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:47.620]
Mm-hmm.

[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:48.820]
Hey, try it.

[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:50.100]
Not on the outside, cold on the inside.

[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.720]
I'm gonna do another eight seconds.

[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:52.160]
I'll be back.

[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:52.620]
All right.

[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:54.220]
Yeah.

[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.800]
Should we just make us smithly noise as well as go under something?

[01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:58.740]
Sure, then.

[01:31:58.820 --> 01:31:59.520]
People won't notice that there.

[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:06.120]
I'm just, um, I want to keep on with my bookkeeping over here before I automatically log out.

[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.580]
I'm doing some banking, paying some bills over here.

[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:12.300]
I've got to keep busy during the show, you know.

[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.540]
I guess I don't know how we got along without online banking.

[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.880]
Indeed, you know how a writer's cramp.

[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:23.640]
Like every, every, like twice a week, you'd spend an hour writing and writing and writing.

[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:24.040]
Yeah.

[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.020]
Who?

[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.740]
Writing checks, writing the return address.

[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:29.940]
Payings don't build fashion way.

[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:31.300]
Who?

[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:32.860]
You?

[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.340]
Us, all of us before the internet, before online banking.

[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.320]
I still write checks.

[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:37.860]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:39.220]
No, I'm not.

[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.340]
I mean, there's something that pay online, a couple.

[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.320]
That's it.

[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.180]
Oh, much better now, am I waiting nine seconds?

[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:47.580]
Yeah.

[01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:49.020]
Mm-hmm.

[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:55.860]
Bad radio is eating on here.

[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:58.480]
I were, they're not having that meeting now, it's lunchtime.

[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.900]
There might be out, I don't know.

[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.820]
I think we ought to send a fat Chris to, you know, burn off a couple of calories.

[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.140]
Go do a little scouting for us. See what's going on.

[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:08.800]
We're back.

[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.400]
And tell that clurries we want the hourly.

[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:13.020]
Tell that nitwit we want it now.

[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:13.860]
Okay.

[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:15.180]
Unless, maybe he don't got it.

[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:19.960]
I guarantee if somebody would have had him.

[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.100]
Hard of had you.

[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:21.720]
He'll be able to buy now.

[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:22.460]
I'm sure.

[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.200]
He's sent out already blocked you for a fat boy.

[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:27.960]
32 a.m.

[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:28.260]

[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:28.980]
I feel.

[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:29.820]
Yes.

[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:31.860]
How did I go eating some food there?

[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.320]
Mm-hmm.

[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.200]
Yeah, that's so pretty likely, huh?

[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.840]
403 votes on the pool.

[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:45.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and 5, 60 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.100]
He's having major computer problems.

[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.360]
And what does that mean?

[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:52.000]
Out of thousands of years when I said Neil would like the hourly.

[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:54.580]
He looked me and said I'm having major computer problems.

[01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.600]
Is there anybody in the building that has a computer that works?

[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:00.480]
Me?

[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:02.500]
Chris?

[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:03.780]
Josh?

[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:04.880]
Lee?

[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:06.020]
Yeah.

[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.660]
See where there's a world there's a way.

[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.460]
If he wanted to get us that, then we could get it.

[01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:15.800]
Is there some kind of a disk you have to have to get the tab scan crap?

[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.360]
Is there like, you know, some...

[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.040]
I'm sure there's software access all of these things.

[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.180]
I don't know how that works.

[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:21.980]
I'd love to.

[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:25.220]
I'd love to be able to do it here, but you know they don't want us to have information about ourselves.

[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.600]
We might do something with it.

[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.540]
Like, no, like, no, like, no, read it.

[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.400]
Like an aspergerist, the spear?

[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:31.840]
Yeah.

[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.900]
Well, he's not being very helpful.

[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:37.560]
I'll tell you that.

[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.580]
I guarantee you, if someone had building those computer that works,

[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.800]
and he could be getting the numbers for us, very important,

[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.740]
and we important thing.

[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.040]
Because this is my last show for 12 days.

[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:52.440]
And if you think I'm going to be like, hang in around here doing cameo appearances to find a...

[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:53.520]
Well, you'll fax it to me, right?

[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:54.140]
Yes.

[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000]
If he gives it to you.

[01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:57.720]
Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.840]
So I could say in Billy Ocean, or it's the number two that we can end up...

[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:02.720]
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:05.220]
Why is that being very helpful?

[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:05.920]
Q.A.M.

[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.180]
Uncle Neil.

[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:09.740]
Tony Shark here.

[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:10.660]
Uh-huh.

[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:11.620]
I'm an artist.

[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.100]
And I got some good music on the web.

[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:17.160]
Ah, you could listen to it for free if you want to website.

[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.000]
No.

[01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:21.340]
It's controversial.

[01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:22.900]
No.

[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:28.060]
Hey, listen, I'm a long time first time, and I called you earlier and asked you, you know, a simple question,

[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:29.540]
and you will root to me and hang up, obviously.

[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:29.780]
Yeah, man.

[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:30.540]
What was the question?

[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:32.320]
And never mind.

[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.640]
You remember the question, dude.

[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:36.500]
Yeah, sure.

[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:37.520]
But, hey.

[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.260]
You saw it.

[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.780]
I'll give it a short.

[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:43.200]
You called the first time, as you call it, this time or what?

[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:48.980]
I'm calling this time because I want to tell you that I'm listening to you show for a long time.

[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.100]
And you make me laugh, man.

[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:51.860]
I'm a truck driver.

[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:52.600]
I'm good.

[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:55.960]
Well, I'm a good woman.

[01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.080]
Okay, you too.

[01:35:58.540 --> 01:35:59.160]
Bye, Tony.

[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:02.880]
He's a truck driver.

[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:05.660]
I've got an artist.

[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:06.680]
I'm an artist.

[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:06.920]
I'm a jeez.

[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:10.340]
406, you've got over the 400 hum, Chris.

[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.080]
You'll make 500.

[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:12.400]
All right.

[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:13.100]
Not.

[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:14.060]
Hey.

[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.140]
Let me say it again.

[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:16.760]
Not.

[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:17.760]
Look at five.

[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240]
WDQ-AM, hello.

[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:20.400]
You're paid.

[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:22.200]
Q-AM, hello.

[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:24.940]
Hello.

[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:25.720]
Hello.

[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:32.500]
Well, I hope he's carved and just trucked like just explode in a fiery, fireball that guy.

[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:33.220]
Okay.

[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:34.020]
Wow.

[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.540]
How you doing?

[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:36.500]
Great.

[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:37.560]
Hey, listen.

[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:38.180]
Seriously.

[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:40.800]
Are you really anti-satellite radio?

[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:43.080]
What does that mean?

[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:47.380]
Well, I mean, you know, for a while, wouldn't you like cocking to get on it?

[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:48.660]
Of course.

[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.760]
If they would have paid any money, they don't want to pay anybody any real money.

[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:57.260]
They want to give Howard all the money and Mel Carmison and everybody else so that can't get a real job.

[01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:58.200]
There's a lot of people off the cliff.

[01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.260]
Oh, my God.

[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:00.360]
That guy is up.

[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:02.880]
WDQ-AM, hello.

[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:04.200]
Hey, Neil.

[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:04.960]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:05.220]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:05.500]
Hi, brother.

[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:06.120]
Uh-huh.

[01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:10.400]
It looks like the pretty master got the hourly because they're claiming he kicked your butt over there.

[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.500]
Yeah, likely story.

[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.420]
They got a three something.

[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.260]
What are you talking about?

[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.080]
I don't know.

[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:16.100]
He looked like he's got the hourly.

[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:16.940]
He got it broken down.

[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.420]
Let me see it again.

[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:20.540]
The program director come in and say, let me say it again.

[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.520]
No chance.

[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:22.460]
No chance.

[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:24.320]
I'll let you.

[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:24.560]
I'll let you.

[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:24.800]
I'll let you.

[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:24.920]

[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:24.920]

[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.260]
I'll let you.

[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:25.280]
I'll let you.

[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.800]
What he did it.

[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:28.740]
Likely story.

[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.280]
True.

[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:30.360]
Uh-huh.

[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:30.640]
Okay.

[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:32.760]
Give me a big kiss from me on the red nose.

[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:33.860]
Okay, sorry.

[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.980]
I got news for him, man.

[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.060]
And the idea that he's on the year in the first place is so humorous.

[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:45.700]
So you don't know what it'll affect or cry.

[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:47.560]
Let's see.

[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.860]
All right, but we had Dave LaMonde the morning and then we fired him and we lied about it.

[01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:55.620]
Yeah, you really got a culinary control.

[01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.960]
So you're really doing it.

[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.100]
Chicken ass, you're on.

[01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.920]
He's the asparagus master.

[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:04.700]
Well, I'm telling my weenie it was, uh, it was okay.

[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:05.960]
Was it great?

[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.120]
Was it full filling?

[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:07.900]
No.

[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:09.860]
WQA M Hello.

[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.520]
The cane met with the Dalai Lama.

[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.940]
Now it's bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, picking.

[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:20.620]
WQA M Hello.

[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.020]
I'm at the doctor.

[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.340]
Thank God.

[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.420]
Oh, how a little y'all happy day.

[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:28.520]
Oh, man, maybe the lobotomy is underway.

[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:30.520]
Yeah, I'm sure not the right kind of doctor.

[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:33.240]
WQA M Hello.

[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:34.180]
I'm Neil.

[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:39.580]
Yeah, my calls you last week about the slipknot concert.

[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.260]
Remember that?

[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:41.420]
About the what concert?

[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:43.060]
Flipknot concert.

[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:43.740]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.380]
Uh-huh, sure.

[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:49.040]
Well, the concert was awesome and I actually got to go backstage and hang out with him.

[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.160]
I got picked out of like 2000 people.

[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:54.160]
Yeah, did you get to have a sex with him?

[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.020]
Uh, no, unfortunately not.

[01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:56.420]
Yeah.

[01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:56.720]
No.

[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.760]
Well, better luck next time, okay?

[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:03.860]
Good idea would be to like bend over and put your hands on your cheeks or more sucking around.

[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:04.400]
Got to do it.

[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:05.700]
That would help.

[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:10.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, 5, 6, 10, 60, and a Verizon's thing to get a wireless on.

[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.020]
What about those marlins, man?

[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:13.340]
What about the marlins?

[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:13.900]
Any interest?

[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:14.240]
No.

[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:16.780]
I think that's what's killing Jo and the morning besides that.

[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:17.980]
Hey, they're getting manny.

[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.660]
Too much marlin talks.

[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.480]
Like I said, somebody get a haircut.

[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.340]
They get him out of here.

[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:24.620]
It's got a crappy attitude.

[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:26.740]
They're getting manny.

[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:27.400]
They're getting manny.

[01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.720]
Like when, uh, it's all the same crap.

[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:35.100]
If people ain't interested in something, you could, it's like when the panthers got

[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:35.680]
Pavelle Bre.

[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.540]
You would have thought in a town where anybody cared about hockey that they would have been

[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:42.240]
screaming from the rooftops.

[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.340]
They would have been going nuts.

[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.920]
They would have been having parties in their pants and in the streets.

[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.740]
But no, not in South Florida.

[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:50.920]
We don't know nothing about that.

[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:51.960]
We don't want to.

[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.600]
Name the topic and that's the response to the...

[01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:57.180]
Somebody QAN.

[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:57.420]
Hello.

[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:03.480]
Hey, did you see the story on Certainly Not News about the woman who followed the

[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.560]
geezers of the space in her pussycaps hair?

[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.880]
Are you going to ponder that one for a while?

[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.380]
Nope, I'm going to ignore it.

[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:18.580]
Oh.

[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.700]
Not talking to me that was the rest of them.

[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:21.780]
You might think about it.

[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.040]
No, that's one to think about.

[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:25.780]
Is it a fact you sent me or why?

[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:26.440]
Yes.

[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.020]
Oh, I thought it was going to be the hourly, some clearance from that idiot.

[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:34.900]
Neil and George, good afternoon.

[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.700]
You have the new controversial Obama rap song by Ludicrous.

[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:40.140]
I heard a small piece of it on Power This Morning.

[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.300]
I'd like to hear it all if you have it.

[01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:45.000]
What I heard was phony thanks if you can't from Ray over at Morini Dodge.

[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:45.900]
No, don't got it, Ray.

[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.040]
We don't got it.

[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:48.760]
Power's got it.

[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:50.060]
Power's also got the...

[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:52.140]
They're doing the text messaging thing too.

[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:52.920]
Right.

[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:55.060]
They're selling you advertising budget.

[01:40:55.060 --> 01:41:00.160]
They're all over the buses, the rigbles, and the banner planes and the dot.

[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:00.540]
What do we got?

[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:01.240]

[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.680]
And by the way, it's Thursday, but you know, this noon came and went and we didn't give

[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:08.340]
you the restaurant thing because there isn't one this week again.

[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:08.780]
Correct.

[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.520]
But we are eating tomorrow.

[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:11.800]
Thank you, Steve Slur.

[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.820]
Can Tucky Fry, can I say it?

[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:14.960]
Yeah.

[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:15.460]
Yeah.

[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:17.680]
And they are going to bring you a graveyard bag.

[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:18.240]
A tub.

[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:19.440]
And I'm going to soak in it.

[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:20.560]
I agree with you though, man.

[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.360]
I'll climb into it.

[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.000]
First of all, any mashed potatoes, I have never had mashed potatoes in my life without

[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.740]
some kind of graveyard on it that were worth eating.

[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.760]
It's just a vehicle for something else.

[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.400]
And that is correct.

[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:30.500]
It's like a no ice cream.

[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:37.160]
I mean, even as much disdain as I have for a no ice cream, if it's got like gobs of hot

[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.860]
fudge and marshmallow and stuff like that, then they're pretty good.

[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.000]
But they're gravy is so good.

[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.080]
I just want to dip my fingers in it.

[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:43.680]
Really?

[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:44.020]
Yeah.

[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.100]
How about wavy gravy?

[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:46.800]
They don't make that anymore either.

[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:51.120]
Remember the good flavor is to make venegeries wavy gravy?

[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.960]
They sold out another corporate and other thing about all these horrible flavors now.

[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:00.700]
I could already be dead if they would have kept the good flavors coming fish food and wavy

[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:01.720]
gravy and stuff like that.

[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:02.580]
But no.

[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:04.300]
No.

[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:08.620]
We got strawberry, shortcake and bananas split.

[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.120]
And then a lot of things that sound really good and then you taste them like, ah fat.

[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:15.720]
Fat?

[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:16.280]
Yep.

[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.780]
As they say in the Middle East, fat.

[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:24.020]
I wonder what country those are guys were from at Woodvine two nights ago.

[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:25.660]
Maybe they'll be back.

[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.140]
Maybe they'll be the saftonone.

[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:32.580]
Maybe the guy will leave his buddy at home in an alley somewhere in a dark alley.

[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:37.620]
What do you think?

[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:37.960]
Yeah.

[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.360]
Hey, it's worth dreaming about, right?

[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:40.160]
Oh my goodness.

[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:40.780]
Dreaming is free.

[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.540]
I wanted to, I was sticking this guy out of a movie star or something because that's

[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:46.120]
how good he looked.

[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.020]
I want to go over and say, hey, are you in movies or something?

[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.440]
Let's go make something or something like that.

[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.280]
Tell me your producer works for lots of other people.

[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.380]
Ah, yeah.

[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:53.840]
Produced.

[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:54.720]
I'm going to make you a star.

[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.540]
414 votes on the poll.

[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.380]
The weakest link on WQM is jerk, 139.

[01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:03.260]
Kimba Bullcamp were 82, George 74, you're moving in on his territory.

[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.860]
Hey, the mall is Mediterranean.

[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:06.960]
It's official now.

[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:07.460]
They got it?

[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.620]
No, they got Arthur Rhodes at the moment.

[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:11.180]
They got what?

[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.220]
Dusty Rhodes?

[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:12.580]
Yes.

[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.380]
Almost as old as him, yeah.

[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.760]
DA40, the big O31, Joe Rose 29, Mad Dog 10, and Neil Nein.

[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.120]
The Marlins.

[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:24.480]
Who the hell is the battle politics?

[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.040]
Sporting of my season.

[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:26.860]
You am.

[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:28.760]
Big sports leader.

[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:30.220]
The Marlins win.

[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:31.840]
Marlins win.

[01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:34.980]
Marlins is on his behalf of their beer.

[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.400]
He's worry, so where we are now?

[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.920]
Looks like the fight the Rhodes dies.

[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.900]
Smells from the body, robots.

[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:58.540]
Barbara Bush has Marty Bell's an ice bulls-other ice, my bow.

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.720]
It happens when she's alive.

[01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:07.260]
She raised more criminal clouds.

[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:12.600]
Barbara Bush has Marty Bell's an ice.

[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:18.300]
And she's testing, holes in crab meat.

[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:22.300]
And she raised more crazy Saturdays.

[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.520]
She's a troll steak.

[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:28.360]
And takes our bricks to an A1.

[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:31.080]
Those dead say, what's no boys?

[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.380]
What's like she's carrying an apple and bull

[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.720]
between her thighs and eyes.

[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.900]
Marty Bell's an ice.

[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.480]
She's at the teacher's board.

[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000]
And when she's always surprised.

[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.060]
She's whimmel when she's caught.

[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:56.760]
Barbara Bush has Marty Bell's an ice.

[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:03.400]
She gave us George Bush and Jim Bush

[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:08.020]
not a match in the wild and white.

[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.800]
He'll be mentioned back.

[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.780]
And smells just like the magic sauce.

[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.140]
I'm a big hat.

[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:19.780]
Barbara Bush remembers on his four-night

[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:25.100]
on a fair day with Marty Bell's an ice.

[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.640]
But sure, he's had it at the right time.

[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:28.960]
Much too long as one of my favorites in the occasion.

[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:32.320]
Notice, co-19 at 5.60 WQA, I'm happy Thursday.

[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.540]
How's that meaning coming?

[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.360]
Almost be over with.

[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:36.140]
Must be.

[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.600]
And he's still got nothing for us, right?

[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:39.460]

[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.700]
Because he's a quizzling.

[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:42.460]
He's a simple thing.

[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:43.120]
He's an idiot.

[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.380]
He could make the effort to go to somebody's computer

[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:47.140]
that works in it.

[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.060]
But oh no, not Clarence.

[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:51.280]
Here's a story for George.

[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:52.680]
I know I had this in my pile here.

[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:53.500]
Somewhere in here it is.

[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.760]
I found it.

[01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:56.920]
Swingers and Hollywood haven't exactly been loving

[01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.000]
bedfellows yet starting yesterday.

[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.180]
The city that once declared war on a downtown

[01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:04.220]
swingers club and tried to ban two-life crews.

[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:07.600]
Smuddy rapping is playing host to swing fest 2008.

[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.720]
I know, they're sponsoring.

[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:09.460]
I'm doing well.

[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:10.900]
I know there's a world's largest swingers party

[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:11.780]
and adult trade show.

[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.340]
Well, of course they are with you because you're a prover.

[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:13.640]
Yep.

[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:14.700]
Like all of us.

[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.080]
The four day three in Wild Night events.

[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.220]
What does it say?

[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.720]
The four day in three Wild Night events takes over the entire western

[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.100]
diplomat resort in Spam, right foot theme parties, hundreds of exhibitors,

[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.540]
a shuttle service to a nude beach and a four-play golf tournament, F-O-R-E.

[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:30.200]
Ah.

[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:34.220]
Point stars including former California Gubernatorial candidate

[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:35.680]
Mary Carey will be in town,

[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:38.340]
mingling with the expected 10,000-so convention delegates.

[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.780]
Everyone's been talking about Hollywood looking to meet their

[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:43.280]
said convention spokesman Greg Freeman.

[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:44.260]
Why would that be?

[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:47.620]
Because you live there?

[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:48.220]
Yep.

[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:49.400]
That's it.

[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.480]
Jerry over you.

[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:55.820]
Can you believe he's on the air?

[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.320]
I'm on the International TV.

[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:58.220]
Ricky Tiki sent.

[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:00.020]
And watch the Spanley-Cladwoman dance.

[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.700]
While there have been other large-scale swinger conventions over the year,

[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:05.280]
swingfest is considered to be the first of its kind on the east coast.

[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:09.560]
Freeman said organizers chose Hollywood because it's tucked between Miami and

[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:10.600]
four-loader-dilets tucked.

[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:11.100]
Yes.

[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:13.400]
Miami-Dade's nudist playland,

[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.180]
had a hollow of a beach as only a short, simple shuttle bus ride away.

[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:22.040]
When not parting, convention goals will attend similar, such as pole dancing.

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.560]
Swingers and nudists can coexist,

[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:27.420]
and the all important legal issues affecting swingers clubs.

[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.920]
Hollywood is the perfect back-draft for that last tutorial.

[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.040]
Freeman City was nowhere of Hollywood's rocky relationship with swingers,

[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.500]
and the legal son, now what is this?

[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.420]
Oh, it's an email from my good friend Ken from Atobico.

[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:43.580]
It's a link to something.

[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:46.140]
CityNews.ca.

[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.780]
Well, I'll get it off by a thing in a second.

[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:48.980]
Must be mighty important.

[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:49.420]
Can you think?

[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:50.280]
Sure.

[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.000]
For just a second or so there,

[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.440]
I thought I might be an email from some listener out there that Joe Belgate

[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.440]
gave my email address to when surprised me.

[01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:02.300]
I speak out of emails.

[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:03.980]
Clarence came in and, oh, here's the hourly.

[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:04.640]
He's all right.

[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:05.880]
Where'd we get these?

[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:06.520]
Clarence.

[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:07.920]
Twenty is an idiot.

[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:11.140]
Oh, now that he put IOD on here too, I hope.

[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:11.440]
Yes.

[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:11.980]
I hope I hope.

[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:12.300]
Yes.

[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:16.660]
Because he usually just gives us an waxy because he thinks that's the only other station on the dial,

[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:17.460]
because he's an imbecile.

[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.000]
There it is.

[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:19.720]
Okay.

[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:24.480]
Okay, let's first go to, um,

[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:25.880]
oh yeah.

[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.800]
Foody, he really kicked our ass.

[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:28.540]
Take a look at this.

[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:31.720]
Take a look at those pathetic numbers, footsie.

[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.340]
If it weren't for Rush from Noon to Three, they're pathetic.

[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:38.780]
And Disney is the answer to 9 a noon.

[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:41.240]
9 o'clock, Joe Rose has got a 2-5.

[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:42.560]
He's got a 1.6 here.

[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:43.780]
This is a men 25 54.

[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:45.800]
And 10 o'clock, I got a 5-5.

[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:46.500]
He's got a 2.

[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:48.380]
And 11 o'clock, I got a 5-5.

[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:49.100]
He's got a 2.

[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.320]
You got squat, footsie.

[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:53.940]
How do you like that?

[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:54.640]
Yeah.

[01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:55.920]
Noon to one, we got a 4-8.

[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.280]
Rush has got a 5-4.

[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.260]
He beat us in that hour.

[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.020]
But, one to two, we got a 5-4.

[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:00.980]
Rush has got a 4-7.

[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:04.180]
Strange.

[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:06.620]
Two to three, we got a 2.3.

[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:08.380]
That's Jerks and Rush has got a 5-5.

[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:09.640]
Three to four.

[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:12.440]
Jerks has got a 1-7 and Rush has got a 3-7.

[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:14.400]
Rush didn't do all this great.

[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:17.560]
Maybe some of the right wingers in July didn't, or June didn't get all the adiaries.

[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:19.480]
All the way doubted.

[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:23.820]
And take a look at those, and at the afternoon, let's see that.

[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.340]
Four o'clock, we got a 3-7.

[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.720]
Five o'clock, we got a 4-1.

[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:34.060]
And six o'clock, we got a 2-8.

[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:34.860]
They got a 2-7.

[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:40.300]
So, except for that weak first hour following dead air, a man dog beat him the other two hours.

[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.540]
Then, at night time, take a look at that 8-9 pm.

[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:45.940]
I want you to take a look at this.

[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.300]
Between the two stations combined, W-I-O-D, oh, that's I-O-D.

[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:53.680]
I'm on the wrong side.

[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:54.600]
I'm on the wrong side.

[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.680]
Sorry, ours are exciting.

[01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:57.360]
Even more exciting.

[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:01.000]
No, let's see, I'm giving the wrong number.

[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:01.700]
But they're very similar.

[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.940]
Yeah, back to the I-O-D in the afternoon.

[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.080]
Still, we went.

[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:06.700]
We got the only 0.0.

[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.580]
All right, night time.

[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.280]
They got the Marlins, man.

[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.760]
They got a 4-5 at 7 o'clock, a 4.5 at 8.

[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.080]
A 3-4 and a 2-6.

[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:15.760]
And a 1-2.

[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.160]
And at 11 o'clock, they got a 4.3.

[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:20.900]
Which I don't know what they got on after the Marlins.

[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:24.920]
We, though, on the other hand, at 7 o'clock,

[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:26.640]
that's the dolphin infomercial.

[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.720]
We got a 1.0.

[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:29.940]
At 8 o'clock, we got a 0.1.

[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.220]
A 0.1.

[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.580]
Nine o'clock, we got a 0.5.

[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.980]
At 10 o'clock, we got a 0.0.

[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:38.120]
And another o'clock, at 1.0.

[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.320]
At 10 o'clock, we have a 0.0.

[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:42.700]
Yeah.

[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:49.900]
I think at that meeting, they're trying to figure out how to go lower than that.

[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:53.920]
And if anybody can do it, baby, they're the ones.

[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.960]
Yeah, you kicked your own ass, man, with two shares.

[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.840]
A 1-6, a 2 and a 2.

[01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:03.040]
A 2.0.

[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:04.300]
To be exact.

[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:08.360]
These footsie liquors out there, man.

[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.340]
I've heard of the foot locker, but the foot liquor.

[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.520]
The people in there, I guess.

[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.320]
People in there, everything.

[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:15.040]
Right.

[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:19.760]
There's even some people out there like the late Peter Clayton, who are into...

[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:20.940]
But that's another story.

[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.660]
So there we go, we finally got the hourlies.

[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:24.640]
And you're welcome, clearance.

[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.980]
And these say, thanks for the great job there midday between 10 and 2.

[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:30.760]
It is mine, he said that.

[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.440]
Far and away, the, in fact, at 4 o'clock, we got a 4 and a 5.

[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:37.420]
We got a 3 and a 4.

[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.800]
And the rest of the day, how about from 5 to 7 in the morning?

[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.980]
The big O's got a 3-1 and 3-1, consistency.

[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:51.420]
And Waxy is got a 1-8 and a 1-3.

[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:53.240]
Now, what time has it to kid on?

[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.600]
Is the Analyche 5-9 or something?

[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.700]
5-30 to 10, I believe.

[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.260]
Oh my God.

[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.020]
The big O kicked his ass.

[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:04.680]
And what about those hourlies there?

[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.120]
6 o'clock, what do we got?

[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.600]
3-1 and they got a 1-3.

[01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:16.400]
They got a 1-3 at 6 o'clock across the street.

[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:19.480]
7 o'clock, we got a 3.0 and they got a 2-5.

[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.680]
And then the last hour is about even Stephen, maybe this is a fraction.

[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:28.420]
And that was when Zach was doing, got a guy to move up and out down, got a guy, I'm telling you.

[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:32.980]
That's responsible for Joe Rose taking it up the old butt.

[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:34.640]
But, I'm going to break them in this book.

[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:36.020]
Zach.

[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.980]
People like that raspy voice, I think that's what it is.

[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.260]
It reminds them a little bit, you know who reminds them of just a little tiny bit?

[01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:47.420]
That's it.

[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:49.860]
I'm going to kick his ass and then I'll steal his two pay.

[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:56.080]
Come 26 and 560 WQM.

[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:57.880]
Greatest American dog.

[01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.340]
Here's the hottest show of the summer.

[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.660]
Critics are raiding.

[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.380]
Audiences are rolling over and playing dead.

[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:10.040]
Now, it's time to shake hands with the next step in pentatainment.

[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:11.820]
Greatest American.

[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:13.160]
Gerbil.

[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:13.660]
Gerbil.

[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.680]
How are the contestants performing the giant plastic sphere?

[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:22.920]
Can little Skippy take the wheel of death?

[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:33.100]
Or win an immunity carrot and avoid being voted off the seat or chips to take the long walk down the plastic tube of shame.

[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:35.140]
With celebrity judges.

[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:36.120]
Randy Jackson.

[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:39.000]
Paul Avgoul.

[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:41.220]
And Richard Geer.

[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.200]
Greatest American.

[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:43.960]
Gerbil.

[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:44.420]

[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:45.340]
Gerbil.

[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.500]
This fall only on CBS.

[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:50.700]
It's 12.32.560 WQM.

[01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.240]
So how do you like to go to those houries?

[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:55.720]
Not too shabby considering what we're up against.

[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:56.600]
It's a major miracle.

[01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:57.520]
Let's hear it for us.

[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:58.340]
I'll ride.

[01:53:58.600 --> 01:53:59.240]
We'll take it.

[01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:00.660]
Exactly.

[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:01.440]
We'll take it.

[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:03.000]
I won't tell you where we'll take it.

[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:04.980]
But what's that?

[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.180]
That's the wrong one.

[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.680]
I've done that before.

[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:08.560]
I was going to say.

[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:10.100]
We're number three.

[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:10.900]
Damien.

[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:12.940]
I didn't do a good job that time.

[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:15.880]
We're number three.

[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:16.620]
Damien.

[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.480]
That's better.

[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:18.840]
Not good?

[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:19.520]
It's better.

[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:20.700]
And you have a little bonus money coming.

[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:22.160]
So you don't have to cry so much all the time.

[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:22.780]
Damn it, little money.

[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:26.520]
It says pretty, uh, pretty mean.

[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:27.640]
Because I know what I'm going to get.

[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:28.680]
It's not not all that big.

[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:31.400]
So if I'm getting a poultry sum,

[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.060]
although I'll get mine a lot, you're sooner than you will.

[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:35.180]
They're going to hold out a dollar bill and let me smell it.

[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:36.760]
They're going to let you sniff it.

[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:37.400]
What about the dollar?

[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:37.980]
That's it.

[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.820]
Johnny Joe's got to come along and bend over like George Sniffett.

[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:43.580]
That's what we're keeping this cash.

[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:46.060]
Imagine when he farts, oh my god.

[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:48.980]
I'm not sure which would make the world.

[01:54:49.220 --> 01:54:50.300]
It doesn't mean a good pull.

[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:52.860]
Chris or Hank or Johnny Joe Bell.

[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:54.940]
Who's far from shit like that?

[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:56.600]
Maybe that was that earthquake the other day in LA.

[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:58.920]
Chris was here the whole time.

[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:01.620]
I've got the best story ever in the history of the show.

[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:02.440]
In the history of mankind.

[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:05.400]
Okay.

[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:08.040]
And it's for my close personal friend, Ken and Tobico,

[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:09.160]
which is right off the road here.

[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:11.800]
Who a message of me every now and then.

[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:16.880]
And this I must be psychic because I was thinking about this yesterday.

[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:20.600]
There was this Chinese woman, Chinese man, who was sitting next to me.

[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:25.560]
And she, old lady, she smelled so bad, she couldn't have seen a bar of soap in a hundred years.

[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.800]
And I wanted to scream.

[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:30.900]
Oh, and I had a good machine going to other one leave.

[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.620]
I had a good machine, but oh my god.

[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:37.040]
She was unclean at her machine.

[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.240]
And here's the story from City News,

[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:42.520]
Managecited from Casino because of BO.

[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:43.800]
I heard that story.

[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:44.720]
Did you?

[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.920]
Well, not just really briefly.

[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:47.660]
I want the details.

[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:49.640]
All the other details.

[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.080]
Michael Wax wants an apology, but don't bet on his getting one.

[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:59.940]
The 54-year limousine manager was an Atlantic City casino on Tuesday,

[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:01.340]
gambling his hard earned money.

[01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.460]
Waxed have been at a table for 17 hours straight,

[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:10.080]
and the 440-pound man complained he didn't have time to attend to his personal hygiene before setting out.

[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:15.280]
As he went to use the restroom at the Borgata Hotel Casino in Spa,

[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.720]
the establishment regular was followed to the squeal in the men's room by a manager.

[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.900]
What he was told, floored him.

[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:26.040]
His fellow gamblers were permanently upset by his rather distinctive and unpleasant body odor,

[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:28.400]
and the casino was asking him to leave the premises.

[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.980]
Waxed doesn't deny he wasn't exactly as fresh as a daisy that night.

[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:35.400]
There is no question I stink, he states bluntly.

[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.340]
I'm not denying it.

[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.200]
I do have an odor I've been playing for 17 hours.

[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.060]
I mean, when you can smell it yourself, then you know you really, really stink.

[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:46.980]
He tried to retake a seat at the table where he'd been playing,

[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.720]
but management refused to allow him to return.

[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.520]
He was ordered to leave in front of his fellow gamblers.

[01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:53.500]
He then asked if they'd given use of a hotel room to freshen up.

[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:55.060]
The answer was an adamant, no.

[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.940]
First rated the Brooklyn man left the complex steamy mad,

[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.920]
and smelling it more than just a fury.

[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.040]
Right, I'm sure he was steaming.

[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:06.220]
He's now filed an official complaint with the Casino Control Commission,

[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:08.880]
which is promised to examine whether any laws of regulation were broken.

[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:12.960]
The entire issue of this is that it raises the questions of when people's hygiene

[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.280]
become grounds for refusing to serve them,

[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.420]
and in this case shows there are no easy answers.

[01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:21.940]
Still, waxed things he deserves one and wants to go back to the hotel with his dignity restored,

[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.920]
why doesn't he discuss somewhere else to blow his dough on games of chance,

[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.840]
and better and better claims he likes the burgauda,

[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.540]
and there's no reason he shouldn't be allowed to go there.

[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:31.560]
And he insists he's not mad that they told him he smells,

[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:34.060]
he just believes they shouldn't have embarrassed him in front of other patrons.

[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.740]
I'd like an apology, he says.

[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.660]
So far, there's been no resolution to the impasse,

[01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:42.880]
and waxed vows to raise a stink if he doesn't get some kind of satisfaction,

[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.240]
which unfortunately is how the whole thing started in the first place.

[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:47.760]
He raised a stink.

[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:51.020]
Now that I know that they can kick people off further,

[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.680]
I think maybe I'm going to start to open up a mouth.

[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:56.540]
I'm going to start swooning, oh my god, you stink so bad!

[01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:00.000]
And then fall off the chair, and then have them kicked out and then sue the place.

[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:01.820]
How's that sound?

[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:05.300]
I mean, I'm serious, I've told you these stories for a long time,

[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:08.480]
I've been going four years, and I just can't believe how many people

[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.560]
there are who smell like they've never...

[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.500]
I mean, how water and soap are very cheap?

[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:16.700]
How water is free and soap is a muya cheap?

[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:18.540]
Well, does it say how fat that guy is?

[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:19.640]
440.

[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:22.100]
Oh, okay, well, I've known people that big, haven't you?

[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:25.280]
There are places they just can't reach, like anywhere.

[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:27.300]
Rack them!

[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.320]
That too.

[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:29.080]
Yeah?

[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.060]
So what does that mean?

[01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:33.520]
Have you made an excuse for this?

[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.540]
No, no, no, no, excuse is a reason for this thing.

[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:39.680]
I don't want to sit in the end of my heart and earn money and it's just somebody that think he smells like that.

[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:42.140]
Like the end of the world, okay?

[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:44.680]
That's the only way I can put it, like the Chinese lady,

[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.560]
I smell like the end of the world.

[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.800]
My one, now dead fat friend, reeks to high heaven.

[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:50.480]
Oh!

[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:52.800]
Of various things.

[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:55.720]
Ha ha ha ha!

[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:56.100]
Really?

[01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:57.080]
Yeah.

[01:58:57.580 --> 01:58:58.400]
It was a wonderful thing.

[01:58:58.480 --> 01:58:58.760]
Who you've been?

[01:58:58.880 --> 01:58:59.440]
It was like paparine.

[01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:00.520]
Oh!

[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:02.040]
Like a poop tree.

[01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:02.500]
Like a food streetman.

[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:04.360]
Indeed, very similar, yes.

[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:05.240]
Phenomenon.

[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:07.500]
So what do clients have to say about the hourlies?

[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:08.940]
Here you go.

[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:10.700]
That's it?

[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:12.060]
What do you want them to say?

[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:13.840]
Great going, guys.

[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:15.000]
Yeah, right.

[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:15.520]
Nice going.

[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:16.580]
You're coming back, you know?

[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:21.020]
So it's in December when the fall book came out, remember we were number one.

[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:22.020]
We had a gigantic book.

[01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:26.240]
And then through the wintertime months, that's when we just, the whole place went in a toilet.

[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:29.820]
And that was, that was, of course, after Johnny Joe blew up the radio station, remember that?

[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:30.240]
Yep.

[01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:35.720]
Blow out any K and the Humper and put on some stuff that I wouldn't wish on Hitler, you know?

[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:38.820]
And now it looks like maybe we're making a little bit of a comeback.

[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.500]
Plus I got rid of those bedtime stories and taking these great calls again.

[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:48.720]
They don't want to hear anybody reading bedtime no matter how important they are or how well written they are.

[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:49.800]
They don't want to hear that.

[01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.900]
You really want to push in for it?

[01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:54.280]
That's me.

[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:55.440]
Sabotura.

[01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:56.240]
Mm-hmm.

[01:59:58.400 --> 01:59:59.200]
Gabriella Sabotura.

[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:00.000]
Who?

[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:02.180]
448 votes on Chris' bowl.

[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:02.560]
What do you think?

[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:03.020]
Can we do it?

[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:03.860]
Yes.

[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:05.560]
Somebody to QIAM, hello?

[02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.560]
No, show again, my kneel.

[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:08.400]
QIAM, hello.

[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:10.160]
Mail?

[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:10.820]
Yes.

[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:15.500]
Hey, I just want to tell you, you're right again on another issue.

[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:20.720]
I called a couple weeks ago and talked about how, when Deputy Miller was on vacation, I turned over to a real quick as 610.

[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:23.160]
And I couldn't decipher where if it was scary or sad.

[02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.180]
And I told him to do a shopping class up there in Port St. Louis looking for a hobby shop.

[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:31.620]
And right next door is the St. Louis County Republican headquarters.

[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:37.960]
So I said, different few minutes, trying to decipher, you know, which, which to go into, the hobby shop or the headquarters.

[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:39.600]
And asked him, you know what they're thinking about.

[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:44.640]
And I got to think, I'm kind of curious that there's any women, especially in their work in Benar.

[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:48.580]
And I said, I'm sitting there, a woman's lifestyle there with halfway out the door there.

[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.740]
Please answer your question.

[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:54.260]
What is the hobby shop have to do with the Stephanie Miller and whatever you were talking about?

[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:57.420]
No, I told them a shopping class, look for a hobby shop.

[02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:01.660]
And I tell you this story, if you tell you another story, but so I said that.

[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:02.660]
And this is story?

[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:06.300]
I thought it'd be here.

[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:07.860]
Idiot.

[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.820]
56670560.560 in the Verizon's.

[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:13.240]
And get yourself a hobby, okay?

[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.820]
He was at the right place. He just didn't find a hobby.

[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:17.800]
I got a good one for him.

[02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:19.220]
Russian will that would be good.

[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.060]
Don't have to play it too long.

[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:26.340]
56670560.560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.380]
We had a lady called today.

[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:27.520]
No.

[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:28.900]
A different one, a new and different one?

[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:29.080]
No.

[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:29.360]
No.

[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:32.320]
An old and size you want? No.

[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:39.820]
Well, I'm sure you get a lot of span stuff on my crack parade today, you know?

[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.840]
It bugs me.

[02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:41.800]
Does it?

[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:43.060]
WQA M, hello.

[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:45.720]
There's a maid at just some pal.

[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:47.300]
WQA M, hello.

[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:48.940]
Neil God.

[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:49.740]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:54.020]
Hey, why is everybody making a big deal about Le Mans getting fired?

[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.660]
If he was fired or not?

[02:01:56.260 --> 02:01:59.160]
From what I remember, he took Sonny Hurs' job.

[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:02.020]
I think Sonny Hurs died of a broken heart.

[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:02.740]
That's correct.

[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:04.440]
So basically, we're going to go ahead.

[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.660]
Sonny in the back, that is correct.

[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:10.340]
Yeah, and also, I was at the game.

[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:13.560]
The Philadelphia Eagles and the dolphins.

[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.980]
And I hope Rick knows it, by the way, that guy did die.

[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:18.940]
What guy?

[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:20.360]
You know, the guy he ran over.

[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:21.440]
You were talking about Rick's thing?

[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.460]
Oh, it's old news, yeah.

[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:23.900]
Okay, good.

[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:24.360]

[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:27.020]
I hope Rick knows this.

[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.300]
And know what the best part of a lot of these causes?

[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:33.300]
They think they're funny?

[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:34.060]
No, no.

[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:35.420]
Well, that goes without saying.

[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:37.420]
And a lot of them think that they're mysterious.

[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.420]
This guy was serious.

[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:41.720]
And you got serious?

[02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:43.240]
Yeah, I did.

[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:45.840]
At least you got it for free, because I'll tell you what, you're on not pay for it.

[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:46.960]
And the receiver and everything, you know.

[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:47.700]
Wow.

[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:50.440]
Anything else, Robin?

[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:51.720]
Anything else, Robin?

[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:55.760]
Hype.

[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:57.480]
Just remember that one thing that I told you.

[02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:00.400]
If you never believe anything I told you, Hype is what the world is all about.

[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:01.100]
And all about it.

[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:05.260]
Ask me if I even tuned on to the, you know, turned in the talk stations at all.

[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:07.660]
You didn't tune in and tune in, but not in.

[02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:08.580]
No, no, no.

[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.080]
This guy's your a hard ass.

[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:11.680]
That's it.

[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:14.040]
It's because I like music.

[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:16.540]
So when's Geldy starting?

[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:18.260]
I don't know.

[02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:20.220]
It might not be him in the afternoon.

[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:22.320]
You've got me in your name.

[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:23.580]

[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:14.280]
I was in the

[02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:21.460]
Zoo magnet program when I was in seventh and eighth grade or the Zoo magnet program. Yeah, yeah, and he's just kind of a kind of a phony

[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:26.920]
You're picking on Ron McGill. Oh

[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:33.860]
Phony in what way he's he was who that's very nice in front of the camera and then when the camera's not around

[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:35.280]
He's just he can be kind of a jerk

[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:42.540]

Readin the fake lady Q a.m. Hello

[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:56.800]
Neil yes, what did he say to say? I'm I have a hypothesis that I'm sensing that when I talk to my Republican

[02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:58.240]
buddies and my

[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.260]
Conservatives, whatever want to call them I'm sensing that they are

[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:03.860]
West likely

[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:06.300]
To seek alternative

[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:11.620]
Either news media outlets whereas I'm sensing that liberals

[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:17.740]
Progressives Democrats really want to call them are probably more likely to pursue alternative

[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:23.040]
You know in other words, see the other side. Yeah, I would do I get some new friends is what I would do

[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:26.280]
I don't hang around with right I was right wing rectum holes

[02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:30.800]

[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:45.420]
I get these holidays confused

[02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:50.120]
But Monday's a big holiday so it's a long holiday weekend here and of course now

[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:55.500]
It's the weekend coming and I picture a lot of people bailing out this weekend of going vacation the thing just a civic holiday

[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:57.660]
It's a civic holiday

[02:12:58.360 --> 02:12:59.100]

W.D. Q.A.M. Hello

[02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:51.260]
Hey Neil Rogers. How you doing sir? Okay. I got a solution for you when you go to the scene

[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:54.880]
And they're thinking people put a bottle of a big staple rub in your pocket

[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.700]
And whenever somebody's thinking next to you just put a little smear under your nose

[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:03.740]
And you won't smell anything after that. Yeah, let me say the hell away from me too. I'm sure that there you go

[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:05.540]
But that does take the stentuacer

[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:12.160]
Okay, thank yeah, I'm gonna put this staple rub in my pocket. That sounds like a really brilliant idea on it

[02:14:14.860 --> 02:14:16.900]
Now wonder what that's under is it under Rick?

[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:20.440]
Is it under Riley? It's under Pete

[02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:22.800]
No, it's not

[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:24.900]
Just rub it

[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:27.080]
That's what I was looking for

[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:36.740]
The vix you take it out you smear it just rub it under your nose or wherever else you want to maybe on your rectum like that

[02:14:38.260 --> 02:14:42.140]
How is it that the tiny one how are they they so many of them smell so bad?

[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:45.140]
I mean the Indian people I understand the ones from India with that Korean air blood

[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:48.580]
You know it gets in their bloodstream and it's in their skin and like oh

[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:50.060]
Wow

[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:54.940]
But the Chinese well the Chinese you know kinds of funky stuff, you know

[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:56.060]
Mm-hmm

[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:59.900]
Remember that time I was looking for that. What was the name of that stuff that takes spaghetti?

[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.960]
I don't know. Oh, yeah, what's on this?

[02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:10.780]
No, no, that that takes spaghetti field. No, not dream field. That's good. That's real. No, you just would know this was uh

[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.280]
I don't know. Yeah, you do trust me

[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:19.200]
And any rate so I had my cabbie take me to a china town over in Spadina

[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:23.220]
Oh my god the stuff that they're the stuff that they're selling and eating

[02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:31.040]
I mean like calves hoos and just oh just the stench in that market would not to just make you want to kill yourself

[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:38.060]
Bad smell and so I most of it is dietary and then of course when you know what you know bays for months at a time

[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:39.280]
That doesn't help either, yeah

[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:45.600]
People who smell bad both for us. What's one guy say it's supposed to be? Yeah, but the bad little little

Because why the hell else is right in the middle of daytime when people are awake when they put him on there

[02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:58.060]
Am I right? Yes, absolutely absolutely

He said that Myers must appear before Congress

[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:42.800]
And if she wants to refuse to testify

[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:51.220]
She must do so in person. She's not immune from compelled congressional process. He said why do they say that process and why do they say pasta?

[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:52.640]
Oh god

[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.880]

[02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:35.840]
That was it no there are no initials on it because usually we have like you know that's somebody's initials all the way out of room

[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.960]
I'm looking at it now that's why

[02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:43.700]
What do we ran out of room on salad gives me fifth? I guess I could have stuck some initials on there anyway

[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:45.660]

These are very scary times we live in and guys you need to be especially careful when you're out on the dating scene

[02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:08.060]
Besides all those little things like aides feed ease and blah blah blah

[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:14.160]
There are some really scary things out there that you need to look out for first of all the wonder bra chances are

[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:19.960]
Most women you meet aren't nearly as large as you might think then look closely at their hair

[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:25.060]
The more styled it looks the uglier it probably is in the morning without all the gel and dye

[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:30.840]
Don't forget about those awful platforms shoes either. She's not really five foot nine hundred and forty five pounds

[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:32.200]
She's five foot one

[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:38.260]
145 pounds guys never overlook a lot of makeup fake eyelashes baggy clothing

[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:43.560]
Unnaturally trimmed eyebrows and two perfect looking teeth these are the 90s

[02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:47.580]
Technology is outstanding and once you strip away all the additives

[02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:53.460]

104 at 560 wdq and we got a one hour to go here until the big two of the little hand is the big hand

[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:03.480]
And there's not a call in the void. I thought this would be a short tremendous hour

Ever made vacation. You'll enjoy your 12 days off. We're sure gonna miss you. Not like that, you know

[02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:13.440]
The warmth. Can you feel I mean for a place that's got like such

[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:21.140]
Heating humidity most of the year. There's no warmth. No. Just there's just hating hostility

[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:23.540]
Like that

[02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.180]
In fact it wouldn't surprise me if that guy wound up and what was his name?

[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:32.340]

Yeah, Daniel Daniel Planeville right

[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:42.680]

Diabetic and the listless and lacking in energy. I mean all those things didn't help him

[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:36.800]
But nevertheless he still has his loyal following he meant something

[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:08.660]

Well, have a happy vacation man. Thanks very much. Okay. Say hi to the Humper

We let the cut the wall out

[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:02.200]
Yeah, they had to cut the wall out and lift them out of the house with a crane and the whole fat family would sit around

[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:06.860]
The person who was stuck in bed and they'd all be four-speed in each other and themselves a hammin

[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:12.140]
I mean that's really sick and you see all the all the empty pizza boxes on the shelves there

[02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:12.640]
Sure

[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:16.520]
495 on a pool the weakest link at WQM is jerks

[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:19.800]
168 and he 168 he's pulling away

[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:23.160]
He's in a league of his own the jerk show come back to

[02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:29.320]
Kimberville camper 95 George 88 is George stays on Kimber's fat ass

[02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:37.860]
DA 52 the big O36 Joe Rose 33 Neil 12 and mad dog 11 we got our own little battle going there on the ass end

[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:41.040]
I finally pulled ahead by one

[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:44.100]
WQA him hello

[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:46.940]
Yeah, but after no news yes sir

[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:51.400]
Yeah, um, I've brought yes, I've never received a really portion of the DA show

[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:54.540]
Because I've heard when he's filled in for Joe

[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:57.040]
Oh, because I listen to him full night

[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:00.880]
No, on your comments I have about always those are sure you're just everything

[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:07.520]
True three times that he would say tomorrow in the evening close by three that's morning tree comes tree

[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:10.620]
Tomorrow in the cuz of like master by everything who says

[02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:14.360]
He says the tree time and that's the me that was a good time that way

[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:19.940]
Yeah, well, if he goes a three-hour show, he only was one hour. That's real. It's good taking DA

[02:36:19.940 --> 02:36:23.120]
That's my only comment about the year show that's it

[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:26.640]
Okay, okay, bye-bye, man

[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:29.360]
I don't know what is he trying to say is he like him or not

[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:34.560]
I'm telling and I don't understand why he does so badly. I mean he's got a good voice

[02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:37.060]
He I don't know if he has any idea what he's talking about

[02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:41.540]
I know a couple weeks ago when he was filming us for Joey got me really parked off that one morning him

[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:43.700]
And Zach was there kissing his ass

[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:48.320]
Talking about the marlins don't draw because the media keeps talking about how nobody goes to the game

[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:51.100]
I mean, that's got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever heard my life

[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:57.580]
So media's fault. It's the heralds fault that nobody goes to the marlin games because they keep reporting that nobody is going

[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.460]
What are they supposed to make up a number like the like the teams do oh there was 80,000 people areas today

[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:07.240]
It we're knocking the doors down

[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:10.960]
Mm-hmm, so I don't know well you know him

[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:15.400]
Yeah, you see he's a good guy very nice guy, but he's got a oh sure

[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:19.240]
He's got in the 10 o'clock hour. He's got a point. Oh, yeah, that's not just in a trend

[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:25.160]
That's in the book. That's in three months. He's got a point. Oh, how's that possible if you ever heard of such a thing?

[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:27.280]
Yeah, I have heard of it on other stations

[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:34.960]
On this station. No, I'm like a real station. I'm talking about the margis is not a real station. Well, I mean used to be right

[02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:42.120]
That's what we ought to do. I think the rest of the show today. I just ought to play the old QM jingles

[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:44.280]
I

[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:57.620]
For the action was we have 502. Oh

[02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:02.980]
Oh, I'm 30 yet. Excellent job by Chris my fat Chris

[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:07.020]
Now did you pay for this meal at the other night or not?

[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:10.420]
Jesus certificate. Oh good

[02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:11.740]
Good

[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:17.120]
Now you send him the certificates and not the our good close friend of professor correct

[02:38:17.700 --> 02:38:20.060]
Why are you doing that? I like Chris better than I was

[02:38:20.060 --> 02:38:25.480]
Chris has the opportunity to talk about the restaurants that he goes to and I

[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:28.140]
Depend on Chris. He has my back

[02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:33.440]
So in other words, you're not taking care of our close personal buddy

[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:35.740]
No

[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:39.200]
He needs the money man. He needs the help

[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.840]
Well, that is just saving anybody. He's the first department of girlfriend

[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:48.960]
You know, you always have to kick in some extra money. So he ain't saving any money going to these places and with the ass right to be with they are

[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.540]
You didn't appreciate it when people were mean. WQA and hello

[02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:58.020]
How about Danny and Jimmy for the show of golden and evil?

[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:01.480]

These guys nick the stunts and whatever they get it and the people that call in

[02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:35.920]
They're just like them like that they were on the year what caught the weed in their high and their

[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:38.080]
I mean it's terrible

[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:44.280]
The years that I've been look at listening to 610 and Anna's here

[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:47.460]
This here

[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:51.660]

[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:20.680]

[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:37.580]
Don't must so go found a thing

[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:44.020]
I can't believe that people are still here

[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:53.620]
My agent told me not to change the thing

[02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:58.060]
Don't get down, keep on yelling

[02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:04.960]
Don't know what's done to stay

[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:15.520]
The bell and the jacks are the best ones

[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:21.560]
I'm afraid so high and make the door to go now

[02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:27.240]
Don't let the bells on the stage

[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:30.880]
Absolutely

[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:43.620]
131 at 560 WTQM, she is a real mess and her hubby, he's a hell of a guy

[02:41:43.620 --> 02:41:45.640]
Exhaust, you make whatever it is

[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:46.700]
Yeah, we have a good match

[02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:48.900]
503 and the board goes back

[02:41:48.900 --> 02:41:50.580]
Let's get constipation back on here

[02:41:50.580 --> 02:41:56.160]
Let's protest, let's get some of those horrible shows off the air like those sitcoms

[02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:59.520]
They left the letter out of sitcom and what's on today

[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:02.480]
WTQM, hello

[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:04.460]
New riders?

[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:05.260]
Yes?

[02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:07.900]
Oh, what's up buddy?

[02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:11.260]
Hello, what are you got?

[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.880]
What's going on with you mom?

[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:21.040]
Hello, what's up?

[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:21.820]
With the marlins

[02:42:22.580 --> 02:42:23.300]
What's up?

[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:24.920]
The marlins

[02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:25.940]
Oh, the marlins?

[02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:28.540]
I don't know, call your rose tomorrow morning, he'll tell you

[02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:30.960]
Talks to way too much about the marlins, that's why he's got a two-way

[02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:33.260]
Plus the fact Zach is doing that

[02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:34.540]
Gotta gotta move up and out

[02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:37.160]
Oh my god, didn't I tell you with the time?

[02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:38.240]
Yep

[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:41.520]
I told you that was the end, we reached the bottom of the barrel

[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:43.480]
No, I don't think so

[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:44.200]
What?

[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:45.220]
I think we can go low

[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:47.780]
You keep talking about going low, what is wrong with you?

[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:49.400]
Are you some kind of a communist or what?

[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:50.200]
Yeah, a comedian

[02:42:51.180 --> 02:42:55.100]
5,6,7, we got 28 minutes to go, not that I'm counting, I don't want you to think that

[02:42:55.100 --> 02:42:59.640]
Although I do have my shirt, my pantaloupies and my shoes, I got my shoes on

[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:02.400]
You know what that means don't you?

[02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:02.800]
Yeah

[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:07.520]
And my cab, you'll be out there sitting out front right at two o'clock when the little hand hits the, whatever it's gonna hit

[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:11.880]
And I'll run across the street and I'll give me a couple of stickers almond bars

[02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:15.660]
To eat on the way, that'll be my second half of my lunch

[02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:17.880]
I can't stop eating those things

[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:19.820]
Do you have the new stickers with the almond?

[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:20.980]
Yeah, you'll stop eventually

[02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:22.340]
Oh yeah

[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:24.300]
I'm dying on the hands

[02:43:24.300 --> 02:43:26.340]
I'm doing pretty good, I feel just fine

[02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:28.340]
Good sound, okay, so just like me

[02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:30.940]
Yeah, we got a nice book that just came out here for us

[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:32.100]
You look alright in this way

[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:34.320]
And I don't have any message from Jolly Jo Bell

[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:38.360]
Even though I told him I don't want any more message from whatever which I don't

[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:40.200]
Well, wouldn't you think that clearance came in this morning?

[02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:43.140]
Oh good job, congratulations Jolly, I'm being number 5

No, I didn't

[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:48.180]
Oh, you said he did

[02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:50.380]

[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:54.420]
And I have no idea

[02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:57.320]
Oh gee, I've been searching him for one or so long

[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:59.260]
Yeah, well keep looking, get a search party sir

[02:44:59.260 --> 02:45:00.500]
Let us know when you find him, okay?

[02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:02.700]
Because we got something for him, we're charged

[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:05.620]
Boy, you talk about somebody living in the past

[02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:09.000]
That's like, oh well, whatever happened to Alfie and Mickey Dane

[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:10.580]
Like that

[02:45:10.580 --> 02:45:11.360]
Yeah

[02:45:12.020 --> 02:45:12.940]
Well like that

[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:17.000]
Stu Goldstein, oh my goodness

[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:18.720]
Somebody QYM, hello

[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:20.080]
Yeah, what's up?

[02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:21.280]
What do you got, pali?

[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:23.120]
First of all, I like to apologize

[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:25.460]
I'm one of them not going to suggest it

[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:26.400]
There will be blood

[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:27.500]
I thought you'd like it man, sorry

[02:45:28.300 --> 02:45:30.000]
You saw I'd like it because of what?

[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.300]
I don't know, I just thought you'd like it, I think you'd like it

[02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:34.540]
I just thought it was really good

[02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:37.040]
Because of what? What was good about it?

[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:39.500]
I don't know, I just liked the whole symbology and it and stuff

[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:42.780]
You know, with religion and politics and oil and money and stuff

[02:45:42.780 --> 02:45:45.200]
I don't know, I just thought it was getting the marks

[02:45:46.900 --> 02:45:48.200]
I don't know, what am I going to do?

[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:50.180]
I thought there was something profound in there that we don't know

[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:53.500]
That all these preachers are watching snake roll sales, man

[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.960]
I don't know what's all there, I just thought you'd like it

[02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:57.120]
Hey, you didn't

[02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:59.020]
When you got a bastard at Baskin?

[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:00.660]
That's a bastard at Baskin!

[02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:04.060]
When you got a book, I need one more to get to 100

[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:04.880]
Bees

[02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:07.600]
He needs one more, what?

[02:46:08.140 --> 02:46:08.640]
I don't know

[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:09.980]
But he's almost at 100

[02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:12.520]
What is he talking about?

[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:14.540]
He's the guy that liked that movie

[02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:17.700]
Starting to see the pieces fit together now

[02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:21.080]
507 on Chris's award-winning poll

[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:25.380]
Did we ever get our lead?

[02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:28.880]
Oh yeah, we did get the lead in it, but she was like, she, I don't know

[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:33.220]
She was like on disconnect, she wasn't really connected with the show

[02:46:33.220 --> 02:46:34.400]
What did she say?

[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:38.040]
Something in A and something in the odd, oh about the three-way

[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:39.220]
That was the lady with the three-way

[02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:40.900]
Right, she wants you

[02:46:41.220 --> 02:46:44.740]
Yeah, well send me pictures of your husband, okay, honey, then we'll ditch your ass

[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:47.020]
WQYM, hello

[02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:51.020]
QYM

[02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:55.000]
Hello

[02:47:03.140 --> 02:47:04.880]
Bastard from a Bastard

[02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:06.900]
Oh, I took your milkshake

[02:47:06.900 --> 02:47:09.400]
Bastard from a Bastard

[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:17.040]
One of the worst movies ever made

[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:23.840]
And you know what I asked him what he did like about him?

[02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:24.700]
The symbology

[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:28.140]
Didn't you like the symbology?

[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:30.740]
Ted Stevens was just a rain and Pete's not guilty

[02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:31.340]
Yeah, right

[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:34.160]
Krupp, liar, thief, Kermit, Nazi

[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:36.200]
Kermit, Nazi, is there any other kind?

[02:47:36.580 --> 02:47:36.720]
No

[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:38.780]
Now where did you get the music from?

[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:41.800]
I just googled, there will be blood sounds

[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:43.420]
And this is the first link

[02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:46.240]
Oh great, that's why we need to get your computer hooked up to the board

[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:47.400]
And let's get the light

[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:48.700]
The tragic violin music on

[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:50.320]
There we go

[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:51.200]
Or whatever

[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:52.400]
Talk up

[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:05.280]
Bastard from a Bastard

[02:48:07.180 --> 02:48:08.100]
Okay, it's enough

[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:11.620]
Let's see how Chris's bowl is

[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:14.020]
Shaping up, shaking out

[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:15.260]
Went a dog, shake it out

[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.720]
509 votes, the weakest link on WQM is Jax 174

[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:23.220]
Kimbobo Camp 98, George 90

[02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:24.900]
Oh my God

[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:27.920]
The A52, the big O38, Joe Rose 34

[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:29.560]
I got 12 and Mad Dog's got 11

[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:32.240]
We got a real big battle going on for last place

[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:35.200]
Biggest name, the Bastard

[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:38.260]
He's got the digital politics, sportly 05, 60 QAM

[02:48:38.980 --> 02:48:40.700]
The fourth leader

[02:48:40.700 --> 02:48:41.960]
Let's go with each other

[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:43.460]
Nicky in the street

[02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:57.420]
All right

[02:48:57.420 --> 02:49:00.500]
Where will you go next to you, Jail and O?

[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.060]
You'll be red head, call it, so your spots

[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:06.260]
You'll see it all

[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:08.860]
Now you got squad

[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:14.840]
When you get to the Kimball Fired at ABC

[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.860]
Maybe you should bring back the dancing needles

[02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:26.060]
Everyone fails you could always do QBC

[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:32.440]
You could sell them out from shuttions to speedouts

[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:35.560]
Where will you go next to Jail and O?

[02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:38.680]
NBC is giving you the chance

[02:49:39.640 --> 02:49:41.520]
And nobody grabs

[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:45.700]
Where will you go next to Jail and O?

[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:49.540]
Will you sell on all your e-cots, stuff?

[02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:51.640]
You'll pack up on

[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:54.060]
And work for fun

[02:49:54.680 --> 02:49:57.660]
Wow, 141, QAM, you think something important was going on there?

[02:49:57.740 --> 02:50:00.320]
Huh, that he's leaving next to whenever it is May or June or whenever

[02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:00.780]
Who?

[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:02.340]
J-Lino

[02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:04.940]
When you think it'd be something really important

[02:50:05.500 --> 02:50:07.120]
Look at that, it's sunny in 77

[02:50:08.460 --> 02:50:09.140]
Right here

[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:12.780]
Just some white puffy clouds in the sky

[02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:13.980]
No rain in the next four days

[02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:15.320]
Looks like a beautiful weekend

[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:17.460]
And some of us aren't going to be working for a long time

[02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:18.400]
For 12 days

[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:20.080]
Futsi

[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:23.880]
513 votes on your poll menu

[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:25.960]
Are really on fire with it, that poll crap

[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:27.380]
All right

[02:50:27.820 --> 02:50:29.180]
And we just got a few minutes left

[02:50:29.180 --> 02:50:30.400]
I bet you're going to get some great calls

[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:31.500]
There aren't any on there right now

[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:32.900]
And that's because the delays got to build up

[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:35.660]
Once it does, they're going to come out of the woodwork like crazy

[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:37.160]
These last few minutes

[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:39.120]
You think?

[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:45.720]
So, hey guys, congratulations on being number three and men on a station that is clueless

[02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:49.020]
You can't complain about the leadership there because you haven't got any

[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:52.240]
Oh, and I take that back, they're leading us right into the toilet

[02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:55.340]
Don't forget we got the jerk show coming up at 2

[02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:59.220]
You want to listen because you never know what day you'll tune in at 2 and he won't be there

[02:50:59.220 --> 02:51:00.160]
Come on, Andrew

[02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:01.400]
That's what Georgia's saying

[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:06.420]
I mean, I don't you think it's kind of a low blow to be saying to somebody I'm going to miss you?

[02:51:06.980 --> 02:51:07.260]
No

[02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:09.920]
I'm not going to miss you, that would be a low blow

[02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:12.680]
No, fill up the door, hit the ass on the way out, that would be a low blow

[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:14.440]
And I want you to try to say he knows he's on the way out

[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:15.300]
I'm pretty sure he does

[02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:17.860]
We've got a two-share

[02:51:18.580 --> 02:51:20.460]
Night time, we got a, uh, uh, four-share

[02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:22.080]
We got a 10 o'clock, we got nobody listening

[02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.460]
Oh, point, oh, nobody

[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:25.380]
No, sorry

[02:51:25.380 --> 02:51:27.960]
That's what I'm saying, I think that number is a little bit too high for them in the afternoon

[02:51:28.500 --> 02:51:30.140]
Oh, two, yeah, that's a two-point

[02:51:30.140 --> 02:51:31.540]
Oh, I never thought of that

[02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:33.280]
Actually, a whole number, you know

[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:35.620]
Yeah, how do you spell that?

[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:37.940]
H, WDQAM, hello

[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:39.460]
Hey, Neil, do you hear me?

[02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:39.880]
Yes, sir

[02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:42.140]
How come you don't like to feel hungry anymore?

[02:51:45.080 --> 02:51:45.760]
WDQAM, hello

[02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:48.840]
What the f***ing goes?

[02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:51.200]
WDQAM, hello

[02:51:51.820 --> 02:51:55.140]
Hey, Neil, hey, I know you guys are working on getting that instant messaging

[02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:59.520]
What I understand is, uh, oh, coming at your jack there has instant messaging on his show

[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:00.600]
And they won't give it to you yet

[02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:04.340]
He's got, he's got text messaging on his show?

[02:52:04.600 --> 02:52:07.060]
No, no, he's his aim

[02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:10.260]
Oh, okay, I know, I'm sorry, I mean, it's time, I was just curious

[02:52:10.260 --> 02:52:11.960]
Well, we could do that too, I don't want to do that

[02:52:11.960 --> 02:52:13.040]
Yeah, I know you could

[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:14.660]
It's a message of something like that, must be

[02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:14.840]
Yeah

[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:18.740]
Have a good vacation buddy, and, uh, congratulations on hitting number for you and your...

[02:52:18.740 --> 02:52:19.460]
Thanks, pal, you're welcome

[02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:20.100]
Thank you, thank you

[02:52:20.100 --> 02:52:22.400]
Yeah, number three, well, how the mighty have fallen, man

[02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:24.600]
We're in number three and excited about it

[02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:30.320]
But these last two and a half years, this wrecking crew has come in there and it's like, uh, just unbelievable

[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:39.080]
And you tell me all these tales about Power 96 with all this, uh, the, uh, promote, outside promotion and build boards and craft, bus signs

[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:41.060]
Yeah, well, you know all about that

[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:45.380]
Never, of course, and given away money to buy the audience, stuff like that

[02:52:45.380 --> 02:52:46.240]
Mm-hmm

[02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:49.380]
How did they do, by the way? I guess they went up a little bit

[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:52.760]
Sorry, did we off my fan? I had to reach back and grab my credit

[02:52:53.100 --> 02:52:56.040]
Well, all we got is men 2554, that's not their demo anyway

[02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:02.380]
So that's what they would say, oh, that's not our demo anyway, we don't care about that, we're into punks

[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:05.240]
We're into Quentin and Queenagers, not into, uh, yeah

[02:53:06.200 --> 02:53:08.140]
Old guys like 26, 28

[02:53:09.940 --> 02:53:10.800]
And neither of mine

[02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:11.860]
WDQAM, hello

[02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:17.900]
But, like, number three is the right thing to number two, and then, it was all they heard, because they're not gonna be going to number one

[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:19.460]
WDQAM, hello

[02:53:22.220 --> 02:53:23.180]
QAM, hello

[02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:23.640]
Neil

[02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:24.340]
Yes

[02:53:24.900 --> 02:53:25.380]
Good afternoon

[02:53:25.900 --> 02:53:26.920]
Good afternoon, sir

[02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:28.420]
Uh, we'll be back

[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:30.520]
You're gonna make it the right?

[02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:32.100]
A week from next Tuesday, yeah

[02:53:32.100 --> 02:53:38.480]
A week from next Tuesday, a couple other things real fast, uh, why do you do radio station play?

[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.580]
You may have two different radio stations playing the same, we're working at the same time, what's up with that?

[02:53:44.620 --> 02:53:47.340]
Conspiracy, it's a comic conspiracy, communist, a communist, uh,

[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:54.600]
Okay, last thing here is, uh, uh, the reason why, hot 105 is number one, they got this new guy on

[02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:59.900]
It's a syndicated show and it's pretty good, you know, they get from music, good conversation and stuff like that

[02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:00.440]
I doubt that

[02:54:01.140 --> 02:54:02.380]
Yeah, y'all get that, man

[02:54:02.380 --> 02:54:03.460]
No thanks

[02:54:03.460 --> 02:54:04.820]
All right, it's very vacation

[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:05.720]
Thanks

[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:11.780]
And we got this new guy on, I don't know what his name is, and he's, uh, talking all kinds of good crap, and uh, yeah

[02:54:12.920 --> 02:54:13.740]
You believe that?

[02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:14.220]
No

[02:54:14.220 --> 02:54:15.980]
How 105 my ass

[02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:22.300]
514 vote, man, not only we get to 500, but we ease down by

[02:54:24.740 --> 02:54:25.840]
Aren't you proud of us?

[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:26.280]
Very

[02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:34.600]
And of course the important number is the ones that are arbitrawn, we do it, you know, we're gonna be, uh, spending some big bucks off those ratings bonuses

[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:39.440]
Hey listen, you know, you give me a, and I know you're, I feel the same way, but

[02:54:40.340 --> 02:54:44.960]
The fact that the matter is the idea that we would ever collect another penny bonus, or under the present regime

[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:50.320]
This is a miracle, but I want one of those people that's big on bragging and miracles, but this is a friggin miracle

[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:52.040]
I had abandoned all hope

[02:54:52.040 --> 02:54:53.460]
Oh my god

[02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:59.820]
And this guy's just like, uh, Obrubius, he seems to be a detached from reality

[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:04.220]
Everything he's put on there, like you said, if he likes it, it's gonna be a disaster

[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:05.420]
And we'll fail

[02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:05.900]
Bad?

[02:55:07.580 --> 02:55:09.780]
Misrubly, like the Kenyan Woe Morning Show

[02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:12.300]
WDQ-Y-M, hello

[02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:13.760]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:14.540]
Okay, sir

[02:55:14.540 --> 02:55:16.360]
Did you want you to do the last night?

[02:55:16.580 --> 02:55:20.820]
They had a reporter ask McCain whether he like boxers or brief

[02:55:20.820 --> 02:55:23.000]
He says, the pen

[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:24.200]
Yeah

[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:26.320]
Thanks for calling

[02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:26.920]
Cute

[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:30.100]
WDQ-Y-M, hello

[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:31.320]
Hey Neil

[02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:32.000]
Yeah

[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:33.420]
Talk right here to the rules

[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:35.240]
Yeah

[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:38.260]
All right, so I can know that

[02:55:38.260 --> 02:55:39.760]
Okay, thanks, thanks for the info

[02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:41.180]
Bye

[02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:43.500]
Talk right here to rules

[02:55:43.500 --> 02:55:45.760]
What are we gonna have some? That's what George wants to know

[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:46.960]
Yeah

[02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:52.560]
And by the way, I'm not seeing anything new about the Marlins and that whole man he remeerous thing

[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:54.060]
No, it looks like it might be off

[02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:55.160]
Why?

[02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:56.540]
Looks like it might be off

[02:55:56.540 --> 02:55:57.800]
It might not happen?

[02:55:58.060 --> 02:55:58.200]
Yeah

[02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:01.020]
Or then how is anybody gonna jump on the bandwagon with the Marlins?

[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:02.280]
Well, they got Arthur Rhodes

[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:04.120]
You know, Dusty Rhodes

[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:05.460]
Dust it off, Dusty

[02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:07.000]
Like Ross P. Row would say

[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:11.020]
Gotta roll up your sleeves and dust off if they old studies and do do do do

[02:56:12.420 --> 02:56:16.160]
I thought they were talking like this was already done deal the Ramirez deal

[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:17.680]
If they just bought war, yeah

[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:19.860]
And they got till four o'clock deadline?

[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:21.000]
Yep

[02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:27.800]
I get the distinct impression that the Jeffrey Luria David Samson, that perfect of there

[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:31.640]
They're trying to like put on the act that I've seen since the team's a shocked out of everybody

[02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:34.880]
And they're in the position they are right now almost standing in first place

[02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:39.060]
Put on this act of like, oh, we're really gonna try to put together a winner

[02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:42.040]
We're gonna do this because they want that stadium, man

[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:47.840]
They are on the edge of their seats, they're peeing in their pants wanting that damn stadium

[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:51.400]
Wanting you people to show up money at a time when nobody can even afford to fill their gas tank

[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:54.060]
They want the public to build on the stadium

[02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:57.320]
For a product that nobody cares about

[02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:02.120]
Like I've said before, it's like selling lots of balls to these Saudi Arabians

[02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:05.600]
And that's the place you want to be really you want to be pissed off?

[02:57:05.740 --> 02:57:07.440]
Be pissed off at the Saudis, baby

[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:10.700]
You want to drop one a bombah?

[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:12.520]
That's the place to drop the big one

[02:57:12.520 --> 02:57:16.400]
Wipe those bastards off the mat, take all the oil first and then wipe them off the mat

[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.500]
Am I right?

[02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:19.100]
Yes

[02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:20.440]
Sure, absolutely

[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:22.500]
Don't stop there in Saudis, smut the heads

[02:57:23.960 --> 02:57:28.640]
And in my building here, I've got all these Muslims and a lot of the women have the whole burko

[02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:31.740]
But a whole thing over their face, and you want to know why they cover up their face?

[02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:32.580]
For the ugly?

[02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:35.240]
Because they're right, that's right, because their husbands insist on it

[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:39.900]
Otherwise they couldn't be reproducing like rabbits, like rabbits

[02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:44.520]
That would be a good pull question, who makes the most babies? What group of people?

[02:57:45.660 --> 02:57:49.520]
Orthodox Jews, Catholics, Muslims, who else?

[02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:50.140]
Mormons

[02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:51.540]
Oh yeah

[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:54.460]
You picking on Donnie and Marie again?

[02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:55.820]
No, just say it

[02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:58.440]
I can't wait to find out how her next nervous breakdown is coming

[02:57:59.420 --> 02:58:00.540]
Somebody QAM, hello

[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:01.800]
Hi, how are you?

[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:02.080]
How are you?

[02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:03.060]
QAM, hello

[02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:10.760]
Hey, this morning I heard on the radio broadcast the thing about exon mobile posting a record for like the 8th quarter in a row

[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:12.720]
Yeah, $15 a second thing made

[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:18.480]
Yeah, and what's great about it is on the radio broadcast and then in USA today on the frontset.net.com

[02:58:19.240 --> 02:58:24.740]
It's a record profit, but it's okay because it's not as much the experts thought they were going to make it

[02:58:24.740 --> 02:58:26.740]
Right, they fell short of the Wall Street email is dry

[02:58:26.740 --> 02:58:27.700]
Yeah, terrible

[02:58:27.700 --> 02:58:29.900]
Okay, I'm going to over and enjoy it

[02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:36.220]
And over and enjoy being rafedded by the big world companies and by the big crux like Bush and Cheney and all of them

[02:58:37.580 --> 02:58:41.280]
That's what the world is all about, all new people waiting for you know, I mean I like Obama a lot

[02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:44.460]
And I think he's got good intentions, but you don't think they say about good intentions?

[02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:45.600]
No

[02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:46.540]
What did they say?

[02:58:46.540 --> 02:58:48.020]
They go to hell on a hand basket

[02:58:48.900 --> 02:58:50.100]
BASS IN THE BASS GET

[02:58:52.800 --> 02:58:53.860]
What happened to that music?

[02:58:54.380 --> 02:58:56.100]
Oh, I shut the browser down

[02:58:56.100 --> 02:58:57.960]
Oh, you already schmucked it and we're packing it up

[02:58:59.080 --> 02:59:02.860]
Oh, I got another vote on the poll. I got 13 mad dogs out of 1-11. I got them by 2

[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:05.460]
You have the weakest link

[02:59:07.300 --> 02:59:08.400]
WQ-A-M, hello

[02:59:09.080 --> 02:59:12.820]
Neil would all short drilling get a become a reality

[02:59:14.420 --> 02:59:16.280]
Let me ask you this, our chicken is going to pee

[02:59:16.920 --> 02:59:17.940]
Oh, how sad

[02:59:19.160 --> 02:59:20.160]
WQ-A-M, hello

[02:59:20.600 --> 02:59:21.620]
Good afternoon, Neil

[02:59:21.620 --> 02:59:22.680]
Good afternoon, sir

[02:59:23.320 --> 02:59:27.300]
I agree with you about the stadium and as far as the gas prices, Neil

[02:59:27.300 --> 02:59:29.240]
What sort of feel like we're getting a break now?

[02:59:29.360 --> 02:59:30.820]
We can get a gallon of gas for 387

[02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:33.860]
Yeah, right where they want it

[02:59:33.860 --> 02:59:35.480]
That's right, it's a psychological game

[02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:37.500]
They lift it up to they just a grotesque number

[02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:39.000]
And then they knock it off a few cents

[02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:40.320]
They say, oh, what a bargain you're getting now

[02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:41.700]
And the public says, yeah, yeah, that's good

[02:59:41.700 --> 02:59:45.640]
And not to change the subject, you talk about lineups

[02:59:45.640 --> 02:59:49.440]
The best lineup in history on the radio is Rick and Suggs in the morning

[02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:50.700]
You were 50 days

[02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:53.040]
I know, okay, thanks

[02:59:53.880 --> 02:59:54.240]
boring

[02:59:56.380 --> 02:59:57.880]
How many times have we heard that?

[02:59:58.040 --> 02:59:59.580]
Right, you talk about me living in the past

[02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:01.840]
At least I'm not wanting to do that

[03:00:03.380 --> 03:00:04.200]
And you need to remind

[03:00:05.460 --> 03:00:06.300]
That's it, yeah, we're good

[03:00:10.660 --> 03:00:12.640]
When you know what little Bob, Neil said

[03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:14.560]
We tried everything to make money with you guys

[03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:16.860]
And we can't do it so our hope and passion can do better

[03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:20.660]
A meeting from a hell

[03:00:22.860 --> 03:00:25.080]
Now there's this something in the past that won't forget

[03:00:28.600 --> 03:00:30.400]
Little Bob Neil from Consular Broadcast

[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:32.020]
He's from Cuxillhoes Broadcasting

[03:00:32.880 --> 03:00:34.580]
Standing up there in the stage and belittling

[03:00:34.580 --> 03:00:36.200]
All the people that work their asses off

[03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:37.800]
To try to make money in that place

[03:00:39.880 --> 03:00:41.640]
And come to find out after they did so

[03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:43.280]
I remember how passion, when passion owned

[03:00:43.280 --> 03:00:44.420]
As the log was full all the time

[03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:46.620]
At least they had a really professional sales department

[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:50.040]
I mean they didn't have no PD linear

[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:52.120]
I think that could but or Andrew

[03:00:53.860 --> 03:00:54.660]
But nevertheless

[03:00:56.840 --> 03:00:58.180]
WDQ-YM, hello

[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:02.460]
Neil, how's the Sydney Rosenbergs, uh, uh, uh, uh, nervous

[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:03.360]
Bad

[03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:05.340]
Bad

[03:01:05.340 --> 03:01:06.960]
Is it coming over to Cuxillhoes?

[03:01:07.660 --> 03:01:08.060]
What?

[03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:10.180]
Is it coming over to Cuxillhoes?

[03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:12.880]
Not bad enough to be on Cuxillhoes, I'm not that bad

[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:15.080]
Maybe you can put them on a night

[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:16.520]
You can break that point

[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:18.300]
And get the minus in front of it

[03:01:18.860 --> 03:01:21.560]
You know, when you look at that, I mean you've got that sheet right there

[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:23.160]
Don't you with the tap-skam with the Arleys?

[03:01:23.640 --> 03:01:23.760]
No

[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:26.600]
And you're starting at 8 o'clock

[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:27.960]
I mean this kid

[03:01:29.040 --> 03:01:30.740]
I don't know what is he thinking

[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:31.640]
Who?

[03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:32.860]
VA

[03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:35.880]
He's got a prominent grant

[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:37.940]
He's following dead air but he's got a point one

[03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:39.260]
A point five

[03:01:39.260 --> 03:01:41.240]
A zero and a 1.0

[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:42.920]
And he's not even his hour

[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:44.620]
That's the SPN radio at 11

[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:47.780]
So the three hours he's on

[03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:50.800]
He's got a point one, a point five, and a 0.0

[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:54.560]
So he ended up as a point six divided by three as a point two average

[03:01:56.280 --> 03:01:57.360]
How can you

[03:01:58.740 --> 03:01:59.220]
What?

[03:01:59.220 --> 03:01:59.500]
That live

[03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:02.200]
You know what I'm saying? I'm sure he does

[03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:04.200]
Does he live?

[03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:05.780]
I think they take him

[03:02:05.780 --> 03:02:07.960]
Does he breathe? Does he move?

[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:09.940]
Does he fart? Does he smell?

[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:16.940]
A 0.0

[03:02:16.940 --> 03:02:20.040]
Well maybe he's just kind of like radio-ish

[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:22.560]
Maybe he doesn't take it too seriously

[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:23.320]
We can only hope

[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:27.180]
And we're sure he's going to miss Jerk

[03:02:27.180 --> 03:02:28.380]
He's coming up next to two o'clock

[03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:29.240]
We're going to miss him real bad

[03:02:29.240 --> 03:02:31.240]
When Gildi makes a comeback

[03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:32.080]
Or whoever

[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:33.780]
The biggest name

[03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:34.900]
The best talent

[03:02:34.900 --> 03:02:36.160]
The strongest

[03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:37.900]
The strongest leader

[03:02:41.860 --> 03:02:42.960]
It's Dave

[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:44.880]
And Miami Town

[03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:47.580]
At 5.6.0

[03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:49.420]
WQA

[03:02:53.580 --> 03:02:55.020]
All right

[03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:01.160]
Don't lie

[03:03:01.160 --> 03:03:05.360]
All the hard firm

[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:06.280]
Don't stop

[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:09.180]
Every time I see

[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:11.820]
Don't stop

[03:03:11.820 --> 03:03:14.600]
That's pretty hard

[03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:15.400]
It can't win

[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:17.740]
Don't stop

[03:03:17.740 --> 03:03:20.460]
My TV

[03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:23.480]
He's president of

[03:03:34.980 --> 03:03:39.620]
The best

[03:03:39.620 --> 03:03:40.600]
The best

[03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:43.400]
The best

[03:03:43.400 --> 03:03:44.960]
The best

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:44.960]

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:44.960]

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:44.960]

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:44.960]

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:44.960]

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:44.960]

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:44.960]

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:45.740]
The best

[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:47.160]
The best

[03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:51.520]
The best

[03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:55.480]
And get to we all voted for

[03:03:56.520 --> 03:03:57.500]
Why?

[03:03:58.300 --> 03:04:00.600]
If you want this

[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:02.500]
Don't stop

[03:04:02.500 --> 03:04:05.140]
This drum and stupid

[03:04:06.540 --> 03:04:07.520]
He's

[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:07.920]
Don't stop

[03:04:07.920 --> 03:04:11.740]
And this drum and rich kid

[03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:13.800]
Don't stop

[03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:14.920]
He's even

[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:16.860]
Some are the me

[03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:19.600]
He's president of

[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:21.600]
Oh

[03:04:25.040 --> 03:04:36.440]
We should make a comeback

[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:36.440]

[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:36.440]

[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:36.440]

[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:36.440]

[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:36.440]

[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:38.560]
He's

[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:39.200]
Don't stop

[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:49.020]
It's not

[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:05.480]
I'm not black, come on back!
