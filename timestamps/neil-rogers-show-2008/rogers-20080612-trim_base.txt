The biggest names of Nest Cowell.

[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.880]
You're listening to Sports Radio 560W, you're watching WAM by M.

[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.380]
Wafs.

[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.000]
You're watching Wafs.

[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.620]
You're watching WAM by M.

[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.820]
Wafs.

[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.280]
Oh yeah.

[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.520]
We're gonna be real dangerous today.

[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.040]
560W, July 5th, the Neil Wenger show.

[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.400]
Oh!

[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.300]
WQAM.

[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.620]
You can kick my rear end.

[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:12.040]
It's the old new Leverto Beaver starring Barbara Gillingsley, Hugh Beaumont, Tony Dough, and Clint Eastwood as the Beaver.

[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.500]
Well, Beaver, you broke your brother's trophy, didn't you?

[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.100]
Yeah.

[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.400]
So what?

[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.100]
Well, Beaver, you've been told time and time again not to touch Wallace things, haven't you?

[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.260]
Oh, yeah, Dad.

[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.120]
But I was just target practicing in my bedroom.

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.440]
Right out of your box, I need to use something.

[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.940]
Well, I think the first thing you should do is to tell your brother how sorry you are about this whole thing.

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.820]
Oh, really?

[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.140]
Why is that?

[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.120]
Because you're a little snake, that's why.

[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.940]
Well, I think I can handle this.

[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.440]
Beaver?

[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.340]
No, I don't know.

[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.020]
You don't know if you're sorry?

[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.060]
I don't know if Wally wants me to say I'm sorry.

[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.260]
Well, Wally?

[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.420]
Yeah, that's okay, but just a trophy.

[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.060]
Anyway, it's not real gold.

[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.920]
Yeah, you're telling Wally.

[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.660]
Let me ask you a stupid question.

[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.340]
Did Beaver ever have a real name?

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.760]
What was his name?

[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.340]
Oh, no, I can't remember.

[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.880]
Hang on.

[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.760]
Sure, Beador.

[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.820]
Oh, that's right, very good.

[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.800]
Theodore?

[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.140]
Well, no, what are they called in Beaver?

[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.960]
What's the name of Beador?

[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.260]
Right, Theodore.

[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.060]
Right, 10, Ted is okay.

[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.520]
Teddy.

[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.280]
Hey, Teddy.

[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.300]
The Theodore.

[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.260]
Mm-hmm.

[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.300]
Yeah, when Barbara Billingsley would get bent out of shape,

[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.260]
she'd start calling Theodore, and then she'd go into that

[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.540]
bubonising of hers.

[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.160]
That was...

[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.460]
Excuse me, I speak chive.

[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.740]
That was the best.

[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.460]
Oh, God, I was.

[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.600]
That is one of the best movies I've ever made.

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.600]
By the way, in case you don't know when you probably already do.

[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.660]
Anything like that, any little clip from a movie like that that you want to see,

[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.400]
it's all on YouTube.

[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.320]
Like, if you just want to see that scene, it's on YouTube.

[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.080]
Anything you want.

[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.260]
It's already on YouTube.

[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.640]
Really?

[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.900]
I could go find it right now.

[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.620]
Barbara Billingsley talking chive?

[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.160]
Yeah.

[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.960]
Here's the poll from yesterday.

[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.160]
It's going to take till midnight to read the damn thing.

[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.920]
Oh, God.

[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.860]
Well, we'll get rid of this when we get to a thousand votes.

[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.840]
So vote a lot on it.

[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.020]
We got eight something.

[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.200]
What do we got?

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.980]
Eight, 60.

[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.040]
We'll get to a thousand this hour, I think.

[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.980]
Or whenever.

[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.240]
Take the wish-mix.

[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.640]
You can't.

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.120]

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.500]
What?

[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.480]
Takes two minutes just to scroll through it.

[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.720]
I mean, it's going to take me till midnight just to read all the-

[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.480]
And of course, I got to do them all and do justice to all of them.

[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.060]
It's a tight game.

[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.500]
It's a shame.

[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.460]
I forgot we can't play that.

[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.060]
Anyway, there it is.

[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.300]
What a way to start a bit.

[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.120]
Yeah.

[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.900]
This is sheer-

[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.480]
Anyway, I'll email you the link.

[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.980]
He was trying to bring me-

[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.120]
He was trying to bring me-

[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.720]
I'll straighten down.

[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.300]
And by the way, John McCain is-

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.900]
What I tell you-

[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.740]
Crazy, then a bed bug.

[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.500]
Oh, it's not important when they come back of the troupe.

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.160]
He's-he's a lunatic.

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.980]
He's a staggy old nut job.

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.640]
Period.

[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.260]
Which is good.

[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.320]
That's exactly what we need.

[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.460]
What was the most depressing movie ever made?

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.080]
Brian's song, 71.

[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.600]
It's been on top from the get-go, as they say.

[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.800]
And whoever says get-go, they ought to be shot.

[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.200]
Let's see, now what about when we did this to the other time?

[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.460]
I'm sure it was-

[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.420]
No, it was not.

[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.160]
Requiem for a dream, one by 25 vote.

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.760]
Look at that.

[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.140]
What's this all about?

[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.580]
I don't think our audience now has seen Requiem for a dream.

[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.800]
You better do your homework, folks.

[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.320]
About 100 degrees in the shade.

[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.160]
It cost 80 bucks to fill up your gas tank.

[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.220]
So I would go out and get Requiem for a dream.

[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.660]
And then you'll realize, hey, you think you've got problems, right?

[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.340]
But you'll feel much better about your own life.

[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.520]
If you have one.

[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.520]
I have no lie now.

[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.820]
Brian's song, 71.

[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.820]
Old Yellow 57.

[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.080]
Requiem for a dream, only 55.

[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.660]
The deer 139.

[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.420]
Sophie's choice, 34.

[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.640]
Leave you Las Vegas, 30.

[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.120]
Elephant Man, 28th.

[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.780]
That was a late edition.

[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.480]
Up to.

[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.820]
Midnight Express, 25.

[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120]
Oh, let's go take a shower.

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.720]
That was a true story.

[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.300]
What was his name?

[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.160]
Who?

[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.500]
Den.

[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.280]
Oh.

[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.540]
Bread.

[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.380]
Pit.

[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.160]
No.

[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.280]
Midnight Cowboy 25.

[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.540]

[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.080]
Davis.

[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.820]
Bread Davis.

[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.680]
Oh, it's Jordan's.

[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.900]
I speak, John.

[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.540]
Oh, cool.

[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.920]
What's wrong with that?

[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.440]
Nothing.

[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.640]
Well, she's not going to say a Shiite.

[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.640]
All right.

[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.400]
What we got for you, son?

[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.600]
He said that she's in great pain and he wants to know if you could help me.

[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.180]
All right.

[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.860]
Well, you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as soon as I can with some medicine.

[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.420]
Just hang this blood.

[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.480]
She could have said she'll probably read that out of me.

[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.400]
I'm not going to read his notes.

[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.660]
I'll write him.

[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.320]
All right.

[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.820]
I was going to say, uh, I know.

[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.360]
Terms of Endearment 23, Cuckoo's Nest 22, Saving Rhymes Privates 21, Love Story 19.

[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.280]
Oh, that was depressing.

[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.780]
Ray Milan was in that.

[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.940]
I was the heartless father, you know.

[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.140]
I never saw that movie.

[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.020]
Really?

[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.540]
Really?

[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.080]
Well, you didn't miss the thing.

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.320]
I was like, don't you?

[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.960]
Thank God.

[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.980]
Ali McGraw.

[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.820]
That's Ray Milan.

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.240]
Yeah.

[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.300]
Love.

[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.940]
Why do they make those kinds of movies?

[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.680]
Because they can.

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.800]
I get people are too happy because there's a lot of people.

[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.120]
They're really people.

[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.100]
I want to go see that.

[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.540]
They're too many happy people in the world.

[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.320]
They need to be brought down.

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.860]
American History X 17, 1984, 16.

[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.500]
Pay it forward 16.

[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.280]
Ordinary people, 15.

[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.580]
Mystic River, 14.

[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.340]
Bambey, 13.

[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.260]
Easy Rider, 12.

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.700]
Ten for American Beauty and Boiling for Columbine and what dreams may come.

[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.780]
Nine for West Eden Gilbert Gravesisler running the Green Mile Titanic Philadelphia and looking for Mr. Goodbar.

[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.300]
Eight for City of God.

[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.200]
Seven, mask the Champ Glinger Eglund Ross cast away the last American version of Graves' Arat Deliverance.

[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.520]
What was depressing about Deliverance?

[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.880]
I guess they didn't like what happened.

[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.120]
Why not?

[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.540]
I don't know.

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.600]
Not a happy ending?

[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.140]
Yeah, it was fine.

[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.260]
I couldn't sure what was special.

[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.880]
You?

[00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.580]
Six for the Kilomockingbird Ghost Beaches JFK, the House of Sand and Faw, Kramer versus Kramer.

[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.560]
Five for Blade Runner, Bulley and Lenny.

[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.100]
Four for my life, Bridges of Madison County of Mice and Men.

[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.280]
I'll watch that someday.

[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.640]
You said O'Jacket born free on the beach.

[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.480]
Irreversible monsters, balls, El Norte.

[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.000]
Three, a whole bunch of mad trees.

[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.420]
Saddest music in the world, Charlie.

[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.860]
All mine to give, raging bull.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.960]
Dancer in the dark, the pianist.

[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.940]
Happiness, clockwork orange.

[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.400]
I don't think there was anything depressing about that.

[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.700]
No.

[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.300]
Thought it was one of the all-time greatest.

[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.240]
There's funny, funny ending.

[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.620]
Well, the people of these three people have voted maybe a little dim.

[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.960]
AT, the hour is death in Venice, breaker, marante, Romeo and Julietta.

[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.680]
Romeo and Julietta.

[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.000]
Ta-da-da-da.

[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.300]
Memento 3, casualties of war three.

[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.780]
Two for Chinatown Splinter in the grass.

[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.740]
Bar fly the sorrow on the pitty little match girl, bang the drum slowly.

[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.820]
City of Angels, family of the dolls, and the Grey Zone and Train Spotting.

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:54.260]
And one for Sunday, bloody Sunday, the heart is lonely, Hunter, Cruisin,

[00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.960]
Honky Talk Man, Sleeper.

[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.020]
Once upon a time in America, talk radio murdered in the first Captain Crowley's mandolin.

[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.900]
Happy on.

[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.320]
Kids, Jack the Bear, O'Reilly Joe.

[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.080]
Poor Robbie Benson, man.

[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.600]
He'd done it.

[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.240]
He jumped off the telehatchy bridge, Robbie.

[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:09.780]
Yes he did.

[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.540]
I did it with him.

[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.680]
Topped off the bridge?

[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:12.540]

[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.160]
No.

[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.820]
Citizen Kane won and Magnolia won.

[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.880]
Don't start with that fact stuff again.

[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.760]
You went over the top.

[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.640]
I think I had my fact quotient for the rest of the week yesterday.

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.120]
With that limited whiteing stuff that you started in.

[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.520]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.520]
No votes.

[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:26.920]
None.

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.080]
Out of 800 and almost 900 votes.

[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.420]
None.

[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.680]
For the sorrow and the pitty suddenly last summer, deep impact running on empty jungle fever.

[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.900]
Bloody Sunday under the volcano, the professional, a beautiful mind, the crossing guard,

[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.140]
the lovers and the cube.

[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.520]
Rhymes with...

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:40.740]
Tube!

[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:41.380]
Rhyme.

[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:42.900]
And cube.

[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.220]
So there's that a lot of depressing movies.

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.460]
But like I said, some of them, if you watch some of the real trials and tribulations of the people in the movies,

[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.460]
you think, oh, I'm doing so much better in my own life than I thought it, then I realized.

[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.100]
Life could be a lot worse.

[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.720]
So what do you think?

[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.420]
I think we switch it now.

[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.100]
Do you think that's a good idea?

[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:06.580]
No.

[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.360]
Why?

[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.400]
I just wanted to say no.

[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.220]
What a bastard.

[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.340]
God.

[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.340]
Why you want to be negative today?

[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.460]
We got all positive stuff going on today except for Jolly Jobelle, who feels that we need to...

[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.480]
we need to hear about every hostile or negative or critical email that he gets.

[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.360]
I'm going to start forwarding all the fan mail that we get.

[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.000]
You, me, both Chris, anybody.

[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.360]
Yeah, that's you take a long time.

[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:29.780]
Sure.

[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.980]
Here's the new poll.

[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.840]
Which talentless child of privilege capitalized best on his or her family's fame and fortune.

[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.680]
And what a good list we've got.

[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.300]
Joel Feinberg, Paris Hilton, John F. Kennedy, Jr.

[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.560]
Oh, yeah, JFK Jr. I'm putting that.

[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.540]
He was just...

[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.000]
I mean, I...

[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.560]
Okay, so he died in a plane crash, but in the meantime he had no talent.

[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.620]
His magazine was boring.

[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.220]
He was boring.

[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.880]
He had nothing.

[00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:01.380]
Anderson Cooper, Ashley Simpson, Casey Affleck, Greg Gumball, Donald Televersacee, Nicole Richie, Donald Trump Jr.

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.100]
See, again, then we just do this poll?

[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:05.680]
No.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.700]
We talked about it.

[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.400]
I read the poll.

[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.240]
I talked about it.

[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.240]
And I asked who the hell's Donald Trump Jr.

[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.920]
And we didn't know then and we don't know now.

[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.080]
Maybe is this from Sean from Hollywood by a chance?

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.340]
No.

[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.380]
Who's this from?

[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:18.980]
I don't know.

[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.540]
From Shamrock.

[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.480]
Right.

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.300]
It's definitely Shane.

[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.980]
What's wrong with Charlie Shane?

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.240]
I mean, I'm not a big fan of him.

[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.380]
Nothing good.

[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.420]
But, you know, his...

[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.040]
Yeah, I just...

[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.060]
Sophia Coppola, I'm on a team.

[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.900]
George W. Bush, Paris Hilton and Joel Feinberg.

[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.060]
A magnificent bunch of choices there for you.

[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.740]
And we've already got a smattering of votes on the new poll.

[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.800]
Yeah, that will be poll.

[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.700]
The depressing will be poll.

[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.340]
Depressing.

[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.680]
Enough with that crap.

[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.180]
Middle of the summertime, it's 100 degrees in the shade.

[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.080]
One thing you don't want to do is get everybody all depressed.

[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.520]
Now, today is Thursday.

[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.480]
What means it noon?

[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.380]
And it's also the second of last day of the full,

[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.560]
a neoscadial here until the summer schedule starts on Monday.

[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.080]
Nothing I'm looking forward to that.

[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.900]
I think like that.

[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.000]
Or even better news.

[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.160]
Now, we're going to have another winning night of Woodbine last night.

[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.460]
But the guy who was threatening to stalk you,

[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.260]
you know, he didn't come by.

[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.740]
He wasn't there.

[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.780]
Or I'll see you inside me.

[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.880]
Or maybe he just was standing in the off to the side, staring.

[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.120]
Luring.

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.560]
Lurking.

[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:18.500]
Luring.

[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.420]
Luring and lurking.

[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.040]
How would you like to be the new Jack of Rock?

[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.720]
You could be the new face for the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel

[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.740]
to help getting the word out of our blank Jack coming to the

[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.840]
Seminole Hard Rock Hotel in Casino to submit your video application

[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.060]
to three minutes or less, just log on to wqam.com.

[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.660]
You could be the newest rock star in town.

[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.600]
Got it.

[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.180]
You want to be the Jack of the Jerk Rock?

[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.000]
Yeah, winner.

[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.420]
I think you have all the qualifications.

[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.500]
Got some great news, by the way.

[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.640]
Except for that British switlery liquor, who called yesterday,

[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.220]
when I got, was just really fouled.

[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.540]
Got some great news about the new polls.

[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.640]
A post-primary bump for Obama.

[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.200]
Ow!

[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.060]
He's kicking McCain's ass.

[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.320]
That was even before McCain said,

[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.840]
oh, who cares about when the troops come home?

[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.140]
WQA and hello.

[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:01.800]
Damn.

[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.480]
Yes.

[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:03.900]
I'm a...

[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.240]
Paul.

[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.340]
What is it?

[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.060]
I got something for your Paul.

[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.260]
For the little one?

[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:08.980]
Jim Belushi.

[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.400]
Okay.

[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.400]
And also, you know...

[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.080]
And have a great day.

[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.560]
You want to put him on your Jim Belushi?

[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.040]
No.

[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.040]
Why not?

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.340]
Is that an answer to the question?

[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.220]
Which talentless child of privilege capitalized most?

[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:26.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.580]
On his or her family's name in fortune.

[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.060]
I'm not saying I agree with him, but I mean...

[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.920]
Oh, I thought the implication is that they had famous parents.

[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.760]
Family.

[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.280]
Alright.

[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.220]
It could be a sibling.

[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.460]
It could be like a John.

[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.900]
I mean, if he wants to, I don't think he qualifies, but...

[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.400]
Why not?

[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.640]
I mean, he's not, you know, great or gay busters, but...

[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.260]
Well, so what about Charlie Sheen?

[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.240]
Alright.

[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:53.820]
What about...

[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.400]
How does Sheenie Epps?

[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.140]
What's wrong with him?

[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.820]
He's a good actor.

[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.700]
Alright, we'll put him on there.

[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.060]
Listen, it's not a question whether you agree or I agree.

[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.160]
You're not going to understand that.

[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:01.440]
Okay.

[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:01.620]
No.

[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.140]
This guy, he wants him on there.

[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.620]
I know.

[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.280]
What about...

[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:06.820]
What's his name?

[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.860]
What's his name?

[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.440]
Frankie Limon on the team name.

[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.380]
Oh, that's a good guy.

[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.900]
I don't know.

[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.760]
Just a joke, Chris.

[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.720]
Don't go putting it on there.

[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.000]
Oh, I already did.

[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.540]
Yeah, probably already did.

[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.940]
Oh, from it, it's after 10-5-5-60-WQM.

[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.200]
We got the jerk show at two.

[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:21.900]
Wow.

[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.940]
Oh, my God.

[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.740]
That is scary.

[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.820]
Mad Dog, it's your last day, two at four.

[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.420]
Six-fifty, we got the first bitch with Jesse Agner to Marlon Pregame, ten minutes with

[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.920]
nine and a half minutes of spots.

[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.920]
Dolphins tonight with Kimmelboke, emperor at seven and then, DA from eight to eight-twenty.

[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.720]
He's going to double duty, we just twenty minutes tonight because then we got the NBA finals.

[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.540]
Game four to Celtics at the Lakers.

[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.280]
Ask me if I care about the Celtics or the Lakers or the Heat or the Pistons or the Fort Wayne Pistons

[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.260]
Zalmers is what the original team was.

[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.020]
Did you know that, Chris?

[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.660]
No, I didn't.

[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.500]
The Fort Wayne Pistons Zalmers.

[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.820]
Don't ask me what a Zalmer is.

[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.340]
I have no idea.

[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.760]
I continue with a Piston, is.

[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.500]
What's a Zalmer?

[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.620]
Want a lottery, Pop Little Boy?

[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.780]
Have you seen how much a gallon of gas costs today?

[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.020]
Right, but like gas prices.

[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.140]
Looks like it's going to be four dollars this summer.

[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:07.820]
Maybe I don't know.

[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.480]
This is ridiculous.

[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.280]
Thank you.

[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:10.600]
The Fort.

[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.680]
Ridiculous.

[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.540]
Gas prices.

[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.260]
Bring it to him.

[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.140]
I don't know.

[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.760]
That is my money.

[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.260]
Shut up and give me some money.

[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.440]
It's not there.

[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.480]
Shut up with high gas prices.

[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.420]
They can't afford to pay for it.

[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.740]
That's how you price on the thing.

[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:06.680]
What?

[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:06.800]

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.140]
Pistons?

[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:07.840]
Persecular.

[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.540]
Ten, eighteen, and five, sixty,

[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.520]
WQ Amid Show is its ridiculous.

[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.700]
Your close personal friend Brandon suggests for the poor Brooke Hogan.

[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:15.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.940]
Who I guess is getting her own reality show now, too.

[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.480]
They sure is.

[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.680]
She really else has got their own reality show.

[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.520]
Isn't that something?

[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.660]
Is she got any talent at all?

[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.180]
Oh, does her daddy have any talent?

[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:24.420]
No.

[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:24.720]
No.

[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.700]
It runs in a family.

[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.180]
Mm-hmm.

[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.400]
Speaking of a reality show,

[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.200]
is Gene Simmons' family jewels?

[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.520]
Why does anybody care about Gene Simmons anymore?

[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.420]
Or, or, or, or, or did?

[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.180]
Well, if you were a kiss fan, like I am.

[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.560]
Then the offense 100 years ago.

[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:41.940]
It's a funny show, though.

[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.220]
I've never watched it.

[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.860]
By the way, we got an email suggestion for George Bush for the poll.

[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.080]
The original?

[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:51.780]
This one.

[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.280]
No, W.

[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.940]
The one that's leading the poll right now.

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.380]
EW.

[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.380]
23 votes.

[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.160]
He's leading the poll.

[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.960]
But that always happens.

[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.440]
You know, in other words, don't look at it,

[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.880]
or don't wait till I read the result.

[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.660]
In fact, I just got through reading the results,

[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.860]
and I read his name, but ready.

[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.540]
Well, somebody, you're so negative today.

[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.120]
I don't understand.

[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.220]
I think you're probably sour,

[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.540]
because, you know, that's starting next week.

[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.360]
You're going to be working to do in the show three days a week.

[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.180]
That's sour at all.

[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.620]
And having to come up with a poll three days a week.

[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:16.980]
Wow.

[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.880]
That's going to be a really tough ass assignment.

[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.780]
It's a challenge.

[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.420]
Maybe your close friends out there, Charlie B, and Sean from our label.

[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:22.540]
That's right.

[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.360]
Send your whole batch of new polls.

[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.400]
New refreshing, great, and Liz.

[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.300]
Come on, all you people.

[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.240]
Liz?

[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:29.460]
Yes.

[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.820]
Who's Liz?

[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.680]
Who's Liz?

[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.460]
The poll that we're using right now is hers.

[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.400]
Shamrock?

[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.480]
Yeah, once you get her, you're going to be able to address out

[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.540]
on the air too, hypocrite.

[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.380]
What are you talking about?

[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.660]
Well, you are a real bastard this year, and I've said,

[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.320]
it's a good thing I'm not going to be here much next week.

[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.780]
After a little whole summertime.

[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.720]
You're a bastardo this week.

[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:55.720]
You are giving me a meal today.

[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.300]
I'm going to have a hit with it.

[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:56.840]
I'm dumb.

[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.480]
What else?

[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:57.560]
What else?

[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:57.840]
What else?

[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.260]
What else do people call me?

[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.440]
You're giving me your meal addresses out on the air.

[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.620]
I don't give people's email addresses out unless they want to get a

[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.520]
little with mine.

[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.140]
Okay.

[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.900]
Like Joe Bell.

[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:07.960]
Oh, and Kelly Osborne.

[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.600]
Hey, there you go.

[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.880]
Give his email address out on the air.

[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.040]
I don't want it.

[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.760]
They already know it.

[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:12.860]
Kelly Osborne.

[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.500]
Absolutely.

[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.420]
57 votes on the poll.

[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.540]
The new one, which talentless child of privilege, capitalized best

[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.460]
on his or her family's fame and fortune, etc.

[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.640]
W24, Parasel 18.

[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.420]
JFK Jr. 6.

[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.360]
Joel Feinberg 2.

[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.220]
One for Anderson Cooper, down to fellow Versace, Nicole Richie, Donald Trump Jr.

[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.480]
Westell, and who that is.

[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.820]
Charlie Sheen and Kate Hudson and Sophia Coppola.

[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:42.900]
She's only got one.

[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.740]
My God.

[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.340]
Dad.

[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:45.360]
Dad.

[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.300]
Dad.

[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:47.700]

[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.520]
We're hoping to have any yet in either the Zimilusiaxley Simpson, KC Aflacker, Greg Gumball.

[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.700]
What about Joaquin Phoenix?

[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.500]
What about him?

[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.440]
You want to put him on there?

[00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.720]
If you want to.

[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.300]
I mean, he's everybody's bad, his brother.

[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.620]
Oh, now what does that mean?

[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.360]
River Fee, Opinus, was a bad actor?

[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.540]
They're both mediocre.

[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.340]
Or are is.

[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.560]
I say this.

[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.600]
He's ugly anyway.

[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.300]
I'm looking for him.

[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:12.880]
He's got a hair lift.

[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.880]
Oh, and who's the other one?

[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:14.980]
Rob Lois' brother.

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.160]
Chadlo.

[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.080]
Chadlo.

[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.240]
Put him on there immediately if not sooner.

[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:19.880]
Give me a break.

[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.120]
Chadlo, my ass.

[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.820]
He is.

[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.480]
Oh, we already had this story.

[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.380]
Sorry, Brandon, about the stalker filming himself masturbating itself.

[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.200]
Oh, no, this is a different.

[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.220]
I'm sorry.

[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.200]
Remember that one?

[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.140]
Yeah.

[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.580]
Now where's this from?

[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.220]
Does it have like a location, anything like that?

[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:40.900]
No.

[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.440]
That's the daily telegraph, so it's Brit.

[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.960]
Then Brit's man, they're really busy.

[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.100]
A stalker filmed himself masturbating and sent it to his victim's mobile phone while she was a

[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.460]
police station making it complaint about him.

[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.600]
The video gave police the evidence they needed to charge him.

[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.660]
The G-LONG advertiser reports.

[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.540]
What is that?

[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.560]
The G-LONG advertiser.

[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.280]
Sounds fresh.

[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:04.620]
No.

[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.040]
Benjamin Baker, 27, of Princess Highway and Coriob Victoria pleaded guilty in G-LONG

[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:11.760]
magistrate's court.

[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.120]
Well, this must be Australian.

[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.580]
Doesn't it sound?

[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.400]
Does?

[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.720]
Does stalking and using a telecommunications device to harass?

[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.740]
Police prosecutor Sheeten Shotton, S-E-A-T-O-N.

[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.220]
How would you say it?

[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.520]
Seatten?

[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.520]
Well, Alyssa said Baker repeatedly harassed his victim by phone and sent her a video of him

[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.120]
masturbating.

[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.840]
Unfortunately for Baker, one of his video calls was made while the one was at her local

[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.260]
police station laying it complaint.

[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.580]
She was laying it.

[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.860]
The victim answered the call to find Baker again masturbating and she showed the officer

[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.400]
taking her statement, seeing her constable a little stole the court.

[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.740]
Magistrate Tim McDonnell called Baker's conduct, disturbing and finding three grand.

[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.740]
His conduct was disturbing.

[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.420]
Quit disturbing everybody.

[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.640]
Okay, put that thing away.

[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.020]
People are starting to talk.

[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:03.560]
You idiot.

[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.560]
Now, what's this?

[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.140]
Oh boy.

[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.260]
Somebody sent this into us.

[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.020]
Neil, I hope you had a great chavuice.

[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.140]
I didn't even know it was chavuice.

[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.180]
You're not doing a good job of keeping me up to it in the start.

[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.440]
I got my calendar right here.

[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.860]
And when was chavuice?

[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.880]
When is some historic?

[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.100]
That's what I'd like to know.

[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.720]
June 9th was chavuice.

[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.760]
The first day of next when you got to look forward to his tish above.

[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.160]
Or tish above, that's one of my very favorites.

[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.860]
Even the glam can enjoy tish above all day.

[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:40.740]
Sunday August 10th.

[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:41.460]
Really?

[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.680]
August 10th?

[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:42.820]
Yeah.

[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.560]
You know his birthday that is, don't you?

[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:44.940]
No.

[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.280]
Paco.

[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.500]
Oh, well, happy birthday.

[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.580]
It's a long ways off.

[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.600]
Not far enough though.

[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.600]
Problem gamblers hit Ontario casinos with a $3.5 billion lawsuit.

[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.300]
This is right up my alley, baby.

[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.860]
I'll illegally, I don't know what, I got a streak going.

[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.760]
It's just done cany.

[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.460]
I don't know where it is.

[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.000]
One another thousand bucks last night.

[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.260]
In fact, that'll cover that check that I might send to a courtist this week.

[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.340]
I'll get around to it.

[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.460]
Don't let me forget about it.

[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:11.780]
Okay.

[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.480]
I just don't like being like one of those people every time somebody snaps their fingers.

[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.320]
You just, oh, I'm going to go into the room right now and put it in the mail.

[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:20.820]
I'll get around to it.

[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.020]
You know, right now I don't want to.

[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.340]
I'll get around to it today or tomorrow.

[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:31.740]
A $3.5 billion proposed class action lawsuit has been launched on behalf of thousands of

[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.860]
addicted gamblers who led to the a** to be barred from Ontario's casinos, but we're still

[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.280]
allowed in.

[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.880]
I bet your Maurice was in this.

[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.720]
Crazy Maurice, the frog.

[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.180]
The suit was filed against the Ontario Lottery and Gaining Corporation on Tuesday in Toronto,

[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.880]
claiming that the corporation did not do enough for those who signed up for a self-exclusion.

[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.500]
A program that allows people to have themselves banned from casinos so they can curb their ruinous,

[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:55.480]
gambling habits.

[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.480]
None of the allegations has been proven in court in a statement of defense as not even

[00:21:59.480 --> 00:21:59.880]
filed.

[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.360]
Those who signed up for the program are photographed and registered and their information is

[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.300]
stored in binders at every provincial casino.

[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.600]
If they're caught trying to enter casinos, they can also be arrested for trespassing.

[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.520]
But gamblers who spoke with CBC News on Condition of Anonymity said the program doesn't work.

[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.920]
One woman said she registered for the program at her gambling addiction letter back to the

[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.780]
casinos soon after.

[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.400]
I walked through and nobody even looked at me.

[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.180]
She said I kept gambling for next couple of years.

[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.660]
And losing her a** no doubt.

[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.520]
Lawyers say the OLG should be using high tech system to catch self-banned gamblers, and

[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.440]
Netherlands gamblers present photo-idead casinos and their ideas checked against the computer

[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:32.880]
database.

[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.540]
Lawyers say.

[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.140]
Lawyers Jerome Morse said the suit has designed help addicted gamblers who've lost large sums

[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:38.960]
of money in their families.

[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.300]
He also hopes the suit will bring about changes at casinos across the continent.

[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.920]
We hope it sets a precedent that not only benefits all members, but that will benefit

[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.900]
anyone who's subject to the dangers of gaming in North America, he said.

[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.560]
One thing I can't stand is gambling.

[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.740]
Ontario has settled nine individual lawsuits pertaining to self-exclusion, but has never

[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.160]
been hit with large-class action suit.

[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.720]
The OLG has argued in the past that it's ultimately up to the gamblers themselves to stay

[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.460]
away from casinos, although the corporation's expressed interest in obtaining facial recognition

[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.240]
technology to improve its screening process.

[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.120]
Like process cheese.

[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.400]
I bet your Maurice is involved and I maybe can get some of his money back.

[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.280]
I don't.

[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.580]
I'm on the side of the street.

[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.080]
He's done proud with the money.

[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.480]
He looks at me.

[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.880]
He's the sports leader.

[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.280]
I'm all the time.

[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.680]
I don't give a crap what that ferry has to say.

[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.200]
If you want to score things to guys that laugh.

[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.860]
I'll have you know.

[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.360]
I know what I'm talking about.

[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.140]
Every morning at the condo I take the elevated down and on my way to the car when I put my

[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.080]
clothing basket out.

[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.780]
I give a three condo piece.

[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.580]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.840]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.560]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:06.400]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.580]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.160]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.160]

[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.520]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:08.680]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.240]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.640]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.080]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:14.200]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:14.720]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:15.420]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.160]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.060]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:17.720]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.260]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:19.340]

[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.920]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:25.920]

[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.620]
I said the toys are back and pow.

[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:28.340]
The toys are back and pow.

[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.400]
Why you lose it?

[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.020]
I'm like a Hori, the sport whole fool.

[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.840]
I know everything that's going on in the news.

[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.980]
I'm like a Hori, the major rule.

[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.320]
I'm up to the judges.

[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:41.440]
Daddy O'Rooz.

[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.760]
Do you guys enjoy soccer today?

[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.660]
It's a better show when I take you place.

[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.900]
I know I ain't no way I'm playing me, but when they drop my boys will Jay

[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.600]
1033 27 before 11 and 560 WDQ and I said we'd take a million calls today, but first we have to get some

[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.820]
Okay, I don't see anything happening now. I'll go call some rangers up and have them come

[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.560]
Go calls find some people in the building that's holding the cone in the show. Well first let me write out what I want them to say

[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.640]
fight a few jerks

[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.060]
And right out where you'd like them to say and have that's right

[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:35.100]
They also do that they write out what they want them to say they go over it. They go over. Yeah, it's all out of here

[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:41.240]
Get out of here man. They're they're told what to say. I don't think it's scripted literally, but you know

[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.940]
That is pathetic

[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.060]
What do we show that sign? I don't know

[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:57.780]
Facing assured of foreign exotic dances a group representing 53 of Ontario strip club owners is turning to immigration consultants to find a loophole in the rules governing foreign workers

[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.360]
The adult entertainment Association of Canada is looking for alternative legal ways to our foreign-born strippers and dancers

[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:10.140]
One way might be to use foreign student visas since foreign students can now work for 20 hours a week in any job

[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:17.660]
So the group's executive directed Tim Labrinos in 2004 then Minister of Citizenship and immigration Canada Judy's grow resigned

[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:23.680]
After extending the visa of Romanian exotic dancer who have worked for her election campaign in the wake of the public outcry

[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.140]
Immigration officials have been looking at each individual application and visa offices have brought around to orders to

[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:29.120]
Screen out women

[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.680]
I think might be victims of trafficking don't lead health criteria or don't have a way home after their visas expired

[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:40.520]
This is led to a reduction of work permits and extensions granted to foreign strippers from 4 to 23 in

[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:47.100]
2014 to just 17 in 2006 up to 98% of foreign exotic dancers who apply for visas get turned down

[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.780]
Sid Lambrinos. That's bad

[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.500]
Have a shortage of

[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.120]
Exotic foreign dances and a shortage of heterosexual men

[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:01.520]

[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.640]
Well, look at that phone today man. There isn't a peep on that thing. That's really bad once the delay catches up though

[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.400]
You'll see

[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.940]

[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:39.520]
You know in the car you can drive around for a long time sometime and then all of a sudden the car comes to a halt because it ran out of gas

[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.760]
That's what happened in South Florida

[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:47.820]
They ran out of material years ago. Not not something new. I mean a long time ago. I think maybe like 10 and a half years ago

[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.220]
When we first had down on a second floor there remember that

pass this along some good news for Obama people they's have to be coming as

[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.820]
parties presumptive nominee and receiving an endorsement from his swirly

[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.100]
Democrat Barack Obama's open-to-general election campaign with a six-point

[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.380]
edge over John McCain and the most interesting thing in the Keith Obermann was

[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:48.900]
hyperventilating about last night is the demographics where he's ahead in

[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.280]
other words where people thought he was going to be in big trouble and ahead

[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.060]
ahead match up Obama leads McCain among African Americans 83 to 7% that we

[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:05.180]
knew Hispanic 62 to 28% you following these women 52 to 33% Catholics 47 to

[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:10.400]
40 independence 41 to 36 and even blue collar workers 47 to 42% Obama's

[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:16.200]
also had among those to say voted for Clinton 61 to 19% yet among white men

[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.680]
who made up 36% of the electorate in the last presidential election Obama

[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.760]
trails McCain by 20 points 55 to 35 points that's the only reason why the

[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:29.420]
election is close white men red mix good old boys don't want to vote for no

[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:34.740]
darky that's what that's all about right you about your company with white

[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.320]
men and white suburban women and the poor McCain has what seemed to be even

[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.620]
bigger challenges they include president bush was appropriating stands at

[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.320]
25% as well as an electorate that wants change from the president's policies

[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.960]
they don't want four more years of big bush and they certainly don't want some

[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.880]
daughtering old fool who comes on TV and says dumber things every week that

[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:59.480]
thing with Matt Lauer about the soldiers not important when they come back tell

[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.460]
that to their families tell that to them I'd like I'd like to see make another one

[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:07.740]
of his 4,000 visits to his photo ops in Iraq and tell the troops outside

[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.980]
important when you get out of here what's important is that we're going to

[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.060]
win of course nobody knows what that means when it's like a Vietnam what

[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.720]
what what does it mean to win how do you win what we're not when all the

[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.060]
shears in the sue as soon as the shearings and the Kurds stop killing each other

[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:27.580]
that when you win sure when it gonna happen when we win and then then he's

[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:30.840]
then they showed a clip where he's talking about well by the end of 2013 the

[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.920]
troops will all be home and blah blah blah I mean the fact that he's even got

[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.200]
more than like 10 percent in the poll shows there's something really really

[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:39.900]
wrong

[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.520]
let's guess with the

[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.660]

[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:30.120]
Oh, yeah, are you ready?

[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:31.900]

[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.240]
Don't know about you guys, but I talk like this all the time

[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.000]
You guys just be yourselves

[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.060]
What a bunch of ass holes

[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.080]
What a great fleet that was what about to add holes that was good

[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.240]
I got one that's even better than that, but I better not play it though

[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:09.700]
It's a Joe Rose saying go something you're behind. It's 11.01 at 560 WQAM

[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.060]
And the like the guy said without Bokeh Brian is sure wouldn't be squad

[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:15.780]
Is he right?

[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.800]
So everybody sent him a bunch of money you can use it then who get off my track

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.260]
Now I'm wondering if he thinks that because I moved up his

[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.720]
Steipend a month this time I get the feeling that he feels it's gonna be perpetually moved up a month

[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.560]
And perpetuity, you know, I mean yeah, I don't know

[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.220]
What do you mean you don't know why do you always run away from these things?

[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:42.420]
I don't know what right away like what on the on Bokeh Brian's keeper. Yes. Oh, okay. You're a sage and you're a spokesman

[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.780]
I see all right. Well then let's let's talk about it

[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:52.520]
Suspected terrorists and foreign fighters held by the US military at Gitmo have the right to challenge the detention and federal court the Supreme Court rule today

[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.080]
the decision

[00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:00.280]
Marked another legal blow to the Bush administration's war on terrorism policies in a five to four ruling the justice to

[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.700]
Said the US military lacks the legal autonomy to prosecute as many as 300 prisoners an issue with the rights of the

[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:10.840]
Detainees to contest their imprisonment as well as the rules established to try them in military tribunals a

[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.720]
Congressional law passed in 2006 would limit court jurisdiction to hear such challenges

[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.740]
It is a legal question the justice is to tackle three times since 2004 included is ruling

[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:27.200]
Each time the high court ruled against the government's claim that it has the authority the whole people at labels enemy combatants

[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.240]
Which can be anybody could be you I don't think they like your attitude

[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:35.060]
Could be a lot of these cars too their enemy combatants make no mistake about that

[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.420]
They're probably sitting right over there and what's his name Joel Feinberg's old office?

[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:44.360]
Who's running that place now besides Howard Davis you read that story about who took it over so I don't know

[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:50.440]
I haven't heard anything since then what story was that a while back he said that they

[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.220]
What is it the change of management? I forget what it was but you read something about it. I did. Mm-hmm. Who cares?

[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:02.020]
You you know Hank was on for 17 minutes with Sid Rosen cradstein Schwarzberg

[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.420]
You know I said at time he that was the

[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.480]
Idiot the quarter-schlock guy he has become

[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.480]
More annoying than anybody to me. I mean I'm sure that there are a couple of others who are more annoying still to you

[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.540]
But to me he's the most annoying of them all they're all they're all the same

[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.780]
Is that how it goes? Yeah, I'm like you know like when you watch a penis cartoon try around

[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.380]
Yeah, and you hear the adult

[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.760]
Like that

[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.600]
Clitten bit that you have oh, yeah, I was getting some chapequal

[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.240]
That's all I hear anymore when those people call

[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:41.420]
No matter who it is quarter-schlock time well you're gonna get practice because you're gonna have a lot of calls this summer

[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:46.060]
I'm gonna have all ringers starting on Monday. I George is gonna start writing up scripts over the weekend

[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:51.500]
Handing him out around a building and setting up people to call it right with some dicks to talk about the building on a building

[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.160]
Or the streets of homeless people

[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:56.720]
Roar skating and crystal meth and stuff like that right

[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.700]
Nobody Q.A.M. Hello

[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.700]

Well, yeah, I think I think I'll have another special comment regarding Mr. McKay's gap. Yeah, yeah, Mr. Lauer

[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:29.100]

Yeah, I guess I should say hey, how's it going? How are you doing? Yeah, that would be good

[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.620]
Don't you wish I think about this after here in a star? Yes

[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:48.500]
Not just one time a politician will get up just one time and say that they don't believe and you know those those fairy tales and you know

[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.280]
Suggest that they are an atheist

[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:51.920]
That has even true

[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.220]
Just eventour said and it took him right off the air

[00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:02.060]
But what now I miss you. What was that? Let me say it again. Just even Tura did say that. Oh, that's right

[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.540]
Yeah, yeah, the no longer governor I got you

[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:04.840]

[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.840]
Now that's what one of them or maybe a couple more now. I guess that would grow some balls or whatever

[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:18.440]
You know, say how they really feel. I don't know. I love this and handball of them. Right. Well, that's I thought I got there

You know, you know, it's just it's pathetic if we just fell right there. No, listen. Yeah, exactly

[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:25.620]
How do we do that? We could open up a store the life store and we could sell artificial lives to people who don't have any

[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.480]
We could have different different kinds of life. It's it's just

[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.920]
There are no words to describe how pathetic it is right

[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:36.440]

[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.240]

It's 11 past 11 at 560 WQ a.m

[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:28.840]
Niel said if the tongue was notarized once again actress Tainemore Neil is in trouble with the law

[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:34.760]
We think perhaps maybe this is what happened

[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.700]
Did a male park

[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:41.240]
claim it was just a joke

[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.280]
She said she did it to research your role

[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:50.900]
But the pipe she had on her had a full phone

[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:57.800]
She found the officers to let her go but sadly police said no

[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.640]
No, no, no she looked like it all white

[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:09.800]
The date of only one crack

[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.200]
Best out of talking smacks

[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.760]
She asked the cops if they knew she was

[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.800]
No sense of humor from the New York bus

[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:31.880]
It wasn't a good way to kick off too well the actress from paper movie too

[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.360]
Crunkaries and cupcakes

[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:43.480]
The things from the well-ventaited me too she got kicked off dancing with the stars

[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.520]
But getting booted off the show

[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.040]
Big childhood scarred

[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.100]
Behind bars

[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.480]
Tainemore Neil's a mess

[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.480]
A troubled girl I guess

[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.480]
Looks like she fell down and flies as fast

[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:10.100]
She did bad news bad news there

[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.920]
We see blame John McIntyre

[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:13.960]
McIntyre

[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.740]
Oh her daddy Ryan

[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:23.100]
No I want the rich and they don't bail her dumb ass out of

[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.620]
It's the water botanical Neil for the pole to do to think she fits in just like the OJs glove sure

[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.920]
If it doesn't fit she's full of Schmidt

[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:36.580]

[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.380]
I'm not going to tell you what it is yet

[00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:43.100]
Okay, I'll give you a clue

[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.280]
Now back to the show

[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:49.760]
Exciting huh I told you it was going to be a great day

[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.860]
It's a great Thursday in spite of some of the naysayers out there in radio land some of the

[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:58.000]
Some of that crowd we don't care we just don't care

[00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:04.600]
We don't give a crap here's a very disturbing story by the way secret plan to kill internet by 2012 leaked

[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:12.760]
Some question if reports that pay-per-view system to be introduced as a hope but wider march to regulate the web is documented

[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:19.300]
By Paul Joseph Watson. Oh on prison plan. Oh well there a little little bit of a little paranoid little uh, you know what I mean?

[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:20.500]
Yeah

[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:29.280]
ISPs have resolved to restrict the internet to a tv-like subscription model where users will be forced to pay to visit selected corporate websites by

[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.740]
2012 while others will be blocked

[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.300]
According to a leaked report

[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:42.500]
Despite some people dismissing the stories of hoax the wider plan to kill the traditional internet and replace it with the regulated and controlled internet to is manifestly provable

[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:47.340]
Both bell Canada and tell us employees officially confirmed that by

[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:57.920]
2012 ISPs all over the global reduced internet access to a tv-like subscription model only offering access to a small standard amount of commercial sites and require extra fees for every other site you visit

[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:02.240]
These other sites within lose all the exposure and eventually shut down

[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:08.520]
Resolving in what could be seen is the end of the internet's ones a report that spread like wildfire across the web over the last few days

[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.800]
The article which is accompanied by a you

[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.580]
CHIEW! clip

[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:19.580]
Says the time magazine writer Dylan Patton has confirmed the information is about to release a story and that the movie will effectively shut down

[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:23.440]
The web could come as soon as 2010 and it's got the clip right here in the story right away

[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.180]
It'll be on our website tomorrow. I'm sure nobody will watch it

[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:35.400]
People have raised questions about the report's accuracy because the claims aren't backed by another source only the promise that a time magazine report is set to confirm the rumor

[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:41.340]
Until such a report emerges many have reserved judgment or outright dismissed the stories of hoax

[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:49.580]
What is documented as the story on the scores is the fact that tell us this wireless web package allows only restricted pay-for-view access to a selection of corporate and news websites

[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:52.800]
This is the model that the post 2012 internet will be based on

[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:58.360]
People have noted that the authors of the video seem to be more concerned about getting people to subscribe with their you

[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.760]
CHIEW! accounts than fighting for the net neutrality by

[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.960]
probably featuring an attractive woman who isn't shy about showing her cleavage. They're just hanging out here

[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.040]
just about

[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.520]
Best majority of the other you

[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:18.620]
CHIEW! videos hosted on the same account consist of bizarre avant-garde satire skits that they have with the same people featured in the internet freedom clip

[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:23.580]
This is prompted many to suspect that the internet stories merely a stunt to draw attention to the group

[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.560]
I wouldn't have to use one oh yeah

[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.920]
Well, let us know now. Let's see 2012

[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.820]
That's four years away and we got five and a half years ago. What are we gonna do then? Well, we'll come up with something else by then

[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:36.400]
I'm sure we will by then the good callers will be back

[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.160]
Oh

[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:45.660]
Yeah, what are you laughing about the catfish lady? I told myself a funny joke Paul Harvey Jr

And we had rich packer yesterday you what we had rich packer yesterday. We did oh sure

[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.460]
What he called about I forgot

[00:59:55.340 --> 01:00:00.240]
Something you know how you know was him. I could spot his voice in a crowd rich packer

[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:05.740]
The one only the packer factor except no substitutes. Wow void in Alaskan Hawaii

[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:11.340]
Which talentless child of privilege capitalized best under his of her family's fame and fortune George W

[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.460]
I had met him before but

[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.360]
Let's hear what George just told us before noon 12 30

[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:15.640]
It's all sorry. Did I say 12 30 11 30? Okay. That's what I meant to say you know Andrew came in and Andrew came in to talk about that

[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.400]
And we have a lot of chat. Yeah, he's just a little intimidated. You know, he's new

[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.120]
And scared of you like everybody is I told them well you go ahead and continue being scared of Neil

[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.560]
But don't be scared of me coming here and talk

When we have questions and things and issues. Yeah, he's so he's going to do better

[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:35.500]
But he's bringing the food in and everything's great. Well, what do you mean he's going to do better?

[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.880]
As far as communicating because you know how you had problems with that copy

[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.400]
The three yeah

[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:52.020]
And $399 lunch right and by the way, he said that they've already got people coming in and talking about hearing it on the show

[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.020]
It's all good. Thank God for that. Well, at least he gave it a little bit of feedback

[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.980]
That's more than we get from our other sales holes indeed. They give us nothing

[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:04.040]
Well, they give us ajada and so is Todd rec continues being a thrown in everybody's side including fat Chris. Yeah

[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.740]
Go sell something else to leave us alone. Okay, we're tied to your crap

[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.880]

5670560 and pound 560 and they've arrived in singular wireless line

[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:54.460]
Very very weak today. The screenless man these phones ought to be blown off and especially when we had all that

[01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:01.140]
Technical history are going on yeah, and now we finally got the phone back and there's now one light ringing right now

[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.420]
Look at that there's not one line ringing blinking the whole whole got a second out caller

Even lionates not ringing of course. It's so discontinued now

We think that that to me is just it's hysterical well looking all the money Joe Bell is gonna save the bees

[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.240]
He's now he's gonna be the hero. He's gonna show him how to make up the transmitter off to save him a lot of money

[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:27.400]
That's a good idea in fact their day part times of the day when it'd be probably a public service

[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.060]
Just shut down the transmitter look at all the juice you're gonna save

We're really gonna have to really gonna have a summer of uh

My drugs and uh

[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.480]
Obluscating what did I ever do to you?

[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:04.940]
Hmm

[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.820]
56705 60 and that's not the guy that's not the what did I ever do to you guy

[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.280]
Trust me what I'm saying is

[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.280]
Well, yeah, it's a clone. It's another wannabe

[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.800]
Because the one thing not only they lack any material but

[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.780]
The closest that they'll come to finding any is to is to do a weak imitation of somebody else's material

[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.900]
So it wasn't good enough material right right

[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.800]
If somebody else's crap

[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.980]
That would be like taking a dump and it turns out that really with somebody else's you know what I mean?

[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.900]
Oh, yeah, I know it's not easy to fathom that but I get in this in this crowd

[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.100]

[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.260]
What is she the show Neil?

[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:54.320]
We're gonna Q a m. Hello. Oh, Neil how you doing? Okay, sir

[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:59.800]
Just the question would you class this show under a political or a comedy show?

[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:05.140]
Just that a curiosity if you had the party it's not a categorized show. It's it's it's the show

[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.520]
Whatever it is. It's a WTF show

[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.740]
Right you had to put one of categories. I don't have to and I'm not gonna

[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:17.520]
But what I don't know why I don't want I don't want if you had to if you had to categorize your life and

[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.040]
Really that all besides pathetic and ponderous. I don't know what else I would say

[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.920]
I think that would cover it all if I see there goes again pick it on the cars you so rude of the cars

[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:33.060]
I would love to know what it is that anybody has ever said on this show that I cut off

[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.280]
There was worthwhile hearing that that when it was oh it was worthwhile right

[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:47.340]
In fact, I could have rebate that mm-hmm five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and leave a rise in singular wireless line still looking for our first lady caller of the day

[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.140]

What somebody Q a m hello

[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.480]
Wow damn that was quick

[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:13.100]
Hey, sorry, um, you know, I think a lot of things have to do with the colleges

[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:18.320]
You don't take them for so long and then all of sudden bams are taking a couple of them in all the year

[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.500]
Yeah, that other no question. It's my fault. Yeah, absolutely. No, no, I'm not saying it sure

[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:27.580]
I mean we love you and we you know, we love the cause. I mean, I think listen all these like you said the

[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.280]
Butthole um guys that call in it says give that

[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.900]
But if you were to take them longer

[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:41.600]
You know you'd read out all those idiots, but it wouldn't have to feel the need to like purge themselves every time you say

[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.700]
Hey, let's take a call. I got news for you. I could I could take them

[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:50.320]
24-7 and they would still always be there. That's their life. Don't you get it? Yeah, that's you

[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:55.140]

[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:56.200]
I'll keep soliciting

[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.620]
Well, I think it's all your big parts

[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.640]
Here's one is a good one too. How about Lisa Marie Pressley for the pool. That's a good one. Lisa Marie

[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.580]
I mean Lisa Marie

[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:08.800]
That's a really good one

[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.620]
You getting these down on there? Chris or what? Yep

[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:16.420]
Lion 9 is always excellent Q.A.M. Hello

[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.800]
WDQ.A.M. Hello

[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.220]
That's good stuff

[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.520]
WDQ.A.M. Ola

[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:27.760]
WDQ.A.M. Hello

[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.580]
Where? I got stuff

[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:32.900]
Where? The collar stuff

[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.480]
Where?

[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:35.060]
Joe stuff

[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.920]
Where? What? What? What?

[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.180]
Okay, you start on Monday

[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:46.340]
You don't want to have to do three days a week, do you? No, no

[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.520]
He's getting them down pretty good WDQ.A.M. Hello

[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.660]
See, all you mad at Joe Bell is making me take calls

[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.860]
Joe Bell isn't making me do anything

[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.220]
Because normally you don't take any calls so I think he was just telling you to try to take some more calls

[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:03.680]
Sir, let me say it again. Joe Bell has no input into anything that happens on his show, okay

[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.220]
Well, that's good

[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:11.160]
Other than what we can't do not what we do do or must do or should do what we can't do that's another story

[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.260]
You can't play far down but he's telling you to take calls

[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.080]
No, he's not

[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.400]
But let me ask you a question. Are you you have a hearing problem?

[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.860]
Me absolutely not

[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.600]
I'm great. I just got through telling it. He does nothing to do with whether I take calls or not

[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.720]
That's not what he wanted to hear

[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.360]
Well, okay, Joe Bell wants me to take calls. Okay, is that me happy?

[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.380]
Keep up the good work. Yeah, okay

[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:35.580]
See, all we have now are cranks and antagonists people with problems with you or me or crates

[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.460]
I don't know how they're like, I could go to the left. That's what we're left with

[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:42.060]
See, they think that it does. That's the part that I find on us slightly amusing

[01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.880]
They think oh, well, I wish you're a must at his balls

[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.000]
Yeah, first you got to find him, okay

[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.260]
You know

[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.340]
WQA M hello

[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:56.840]

[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:00.780]

[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:06.440]
That was going to be the good call too. I could smell it

[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.540]
Mmm WQA M hello

[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.400]

[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:12.900]
WQA M hello

[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.840]
Me! Yeah

[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.000]
What happened to Chuck Mayer? WI-O-G

[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.600]
I haven't got any idea

[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:20.740]
Have a good day

[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.420]
WQA M hello

[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.080]
Hey, I'm your first lady caller

[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.300]
This is Rose Marie

[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.760]
Yeah, this is Rose Marie. Neil, I used to wait on you with the race track

[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.660]
All redhead with the big nose

[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.580]
At what race track? At Pompo-no?

[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.700]
At Pompo-no, yeah

[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.360]
Oh, I'll be there. Yeah, how you doing?

[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:41.960]
I'm good. How are you?

[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:45.060]
I'm good. You got the helicopter on that list

[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.880]
Yeah, she uh second place

[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.020]
Oh, because I hadn't told he's spelling but somebody called him before me with that

[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.140]
That's my day off too

[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:56.420]
I hate to make you repeat something but what happened to that Richard?

[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.880]
I already hit a superfactor or something and

[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.360]
Drop the head of the table

[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.760]
He didn't hit the superfactor. He hit the table

[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.940]
He hit the table

[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.600]
Right at the race track

[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.100]
Then right in the dining room. I wasn't there. Thank goodness

[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.780]
Wow, I know. I didn't see you in a long time

[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.640]
Okay, I just want to bad parents out into the lift but she's already on there.

[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.120]
Hi sweetie. Have a good life. Hi honey.

[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.680]
Hi, yes. How do you like that?

[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.820]
A lady in the somebody I know in a nice person and the living and breathing

[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.580]
And whatever happened to fat wrench, he hit the super. I had the super prop and that was a poor Richie

[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.140]
Poor Richie, man

[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.460]
See this pool is really kind of a waste of time

[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.320]
We want to know why anytime we have a pool where you put George Bush on here

[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:42.480]
Although Paris Hilton is giving a run for his money. He's got 135. He's got 83 and everybody else is

[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:45.760]
Like almost invisible. They pale in one significance

[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:52.100]
Out of 277 vote. I bet your Chris is all whipped up. What do you have on the first one? Eight what? Oh, it was 877

[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.340]
So you're gonna you're gonna have maybe 13 hundred votes. They combined

[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.420]
All of us think you'd almost think that we had somebody listening to it. Although I have doubts about that

[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.260]
You know

[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:10.000]
I

[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.120]
Later

[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.820]
Now back to cow jeopardy and your host Alex Treby

[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:22.560]
We move on now to double jeopardy and let me remind our players. There's not one but two dairy doubles on the board

[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.180]

[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:27.800]
You had the lowscore at the end of the last round choose a category. Please

Big and stupid for 200 the answer is a dry cow or vice president coil. Yes, Elsey

[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:42.540]
Right what is an under failure? I'm under on a family. Very good. You now have control of the board

[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.660]
Famous cowgirls for six hundred. This is Delta Berks favorite dress

[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:48.740]
Bussy

[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.540]
Correct. What is a mumu very good? Please select

[01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.360]
Calpari for 800 the answer is to give birth or a kind of coffee. Yes, Bussy

[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.020]
No, Elsey

[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:09.500]
So again the answer is to give birth or a kind of coffee. Yes, Roseanne

[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.280]
What is decal power? That's right

[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.680]
Oh, that means we're out of time

[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:21.600]
We'll return in a moment with final cow jeopardy where our category will be real food for real people right after this

[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:29.080]
The answer is it's a lemon 45 and 560 W. Cuymsa. There's another one that you must love. Cali jeopardy. Yes, I do

[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.080]
I like the other jeopardy parties. By the way the foods here

[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.880]
Well, that's great the foods are in about 50 minutes or so. We'll be doing our Neil deal because it's Thursday

[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.640]
And we got 8 million open lines on the phone bad news man. I thought we'd have a tremendous outpouring today and tomorrow

[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:48.120]
These last two days before the summer schedule starts well as you get

[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.200]
I'm very important because it has to go in

[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.080]
Would you get I'm eating some hummus right now

[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:57.920]
hummus hummus

[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.460]
It's great

[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.740]
I'll fix Dan what you do isn't exactly fish

[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:13.880]
And they've brought a lot of food actually all bunch of things really what about Chris? What do you watch on having a bacon meatless patty?

[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.080]
Chris is not in the room right now

[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:19.780]
Why is that you got me maybe he's clearing out some way for lunch, you know

[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:24.740]
Maybe they brought a whole bunch of desserts too. Oh, that's what I told you really good said

[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.780]
I wouldn't be surprised if they'd bring a whole bunch of desserts

[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:32.800]
This kind of pisses me off non-fish sandwiches really good. Well, what is it?

[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.180]
It tastes like fish, but it's not oh

[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.920]

How could desserts I mean I just don't understand it?

There's no lard in these desserts, so he doesn't want any part of it

[01:31:45.710 --> 01:31:47.710]
He didn't get that way eating healthy, you know

[01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:56.450]
If it isn't an animal product fried in another animal product he doesn't even want to look at it

Chocolate ganache. That's just what I need you know

[01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:42.070]
Gus Pacho soup baked Arctic char

[01:32:43.230 --> 01:32:45.430]
Ooh, I'm not going to that party

[01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:54.070]
Alex Kaczynski is more accustomed to appearing on list to fill US-impean court vacancies that headlines involving pornographic scandals, but

[01:32:55.250 --> 01:33:01.270]
Yesterday the chief judge of the country's largest federal appeals court was forced to suspend an obscenity trial he was presiding over after

[01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:04.290]
Six L. Express images posted to his family's website became public

[01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:11.850]
The LA Times reported that Kaczynski had posted sexual material on his personal website and then blocked access after being interviewed about a Tuesday night

[01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:17.170]
Kaczynski 57 told the Times he thought the material on his site which included a video of a man

[01:33:17.170 --> 01:33:23.850]
Converting with a sexually aroused farm animal couldn't be seen by the public the judge said he didn't believe any of the images were obscene

[01:33:26.250 --> 01:33:29.870]
Including a video of a man converting with a sexually aroused farm animal

[01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:36.010]
Is it perient? I don't know what to tell you he told in his paper. I think it's odd and interesting. It's part of life

[01:33:37.190 --> 01:33:40.810]
It's not part of my life converting with sexually aroused farm animals, but nevertheless

[01:33:42.170 --> 01:33:50.050]
Yal Kaczynski the judges film editors son told the New York Times yesterday that the site is registered to him and he maintains it friends and family are able to post it

[01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:56.750]
There he said the fact that it was publicly accessible actually is my fault to Yal Kaczynski for the newspaper. I made a mistake configuring it

[01:33:56.750 --> 01:34:00.430]
Neither father nor son make clear Wednesday who posted the images in question

[01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:03.870]
Judge Kaczynski said earlier that he didn't believe any of them were obscene

[01:34:05.010 --> 01:34:10.170]
He's spend it until Monday the trial of Ira Isaacs who's charged with obscenity for selling movies depicting

[01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:15.510]
Bestiality and extreme fetishes involving feces in urination. I'll start to do that in a minute or lunch

[01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:20.030]
Sorry, a pellet judge is such as Kaczynski occasionally handled trial court cases

[01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:24.490]
Kaczynski told others in the case he wanted to give them time to consider whether or not to be disqualified

[01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:29.650]
Federal prosecutors are discussing their options department of justice lawyer Kenneth Wooded said

[01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:37.310]
At best the exposure of his website was embarrassing turn in vents for Kaczynski who reached the pinnacle of a long illustrious and colorful judicial career in November

[01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:42.690]
When he was appointed chief judge of the 90 West Circuit Court of Appeals which has jurisdiction over nine Western states

[01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:50.350]
The appointment kept a 26 year career on the bench that began in 1982 at age 32 when he was named chief of the newly created federal claims court

[01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:52.830]
Which handles lawsuits related to federal contracts?

[01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:58.010]
Three years later president Reagan appointed him to the 9th Circuit making him the youngest federal pellet judge in the country

[01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:03.370]
President George Herbert Walker Bush seriously considered nominating Kaczynski for I court openings in 1991

[01:35:03.970 --> 01:35:07.710]
Even though the jurist hasn't received the same considerations from Bush Jr

[01:35:08.410 --> 01:35:14.050]
Still Kaczynski enjoys a sterling reputation as an eloquent opinion writer and a titan on the bench even while his off-the-benture

[01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:15.310]
San Fristonies run the gamut

[01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:22.230]
Kaczynski 57 was born and romamed into Holocaust survivors and came to America when he was 12 six years later

[01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:29.590]
He won a date in 1968 while appearing on the TV show the dating game after greeting the contestant with good afternoon flower of my heart

[01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:37.750]
He purports to build his own computers and say was an authority on snowboarding while successfully vying to win gossip blogs contest for judicial hottie

[01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:45.490]
Seven years ago we engaged Washington DC federal court administration a battle over web

[01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:52.130]
Filters that they installed a block porn from government computers the computer savvy Kaczynski walked into a government computer room in San Francisco

[01:35:52.230 --> 01:35:59.210]
And personally disabled the film is from three appellate circuits including his own touching off a feud with administrators and ultimately one when they stop blocking porn

[01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:03.170]
I do like that. I think the judge is you know a little freaky is what he is

[01:36:04.410 --> 01:36:07.010]
But to each its own, you know, yep

[01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:09.270]
Maybe he likes animals

[01:36:10.450 --> 01:36:12.090]
So how are we doing with that thing?

[01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:17.270]

[01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:17.770]
Acting like a child. Oh, oh, he's superstitious

[01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:24.410]
Why what is it if he doesn't eat it? He's feeling like he decided that he doesn't like tofu and therefore

[01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:34.390]
As if as if tofu only tastes like one thing as if everything in here doesn't taste like you know something different and delicious

[01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:40.710]
I like tofu nothing in here tastes like it and I mean a mango

[01:37:41.970 --> 01:37:42.650]

[01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:15.170]
I told him we'd go find a stray cat in torture at while he ate if he needs to have an animal suffer while he eats

[01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:25.870]

Yo, what the搞 up and Antipenbe

Hi guys, it's tlach module here we is a newly washed Lincoln lien car

[01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:14.930]
7.0 clock and you on travel

[01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:21.390]
all the time.

[01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.750]
Oh yeah,

[01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:25.250]
15 at 5.60 WQ AM.

[01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:30.350]
At least 14 Republican members of Congress are refused to endorse or publicly support

[01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:34.190]
Senator John McCain for present, and more than a dozen others declined to answer whether

[01:41:34.190 --> 01:41:35.530]
they back the Arizona Senator.

[01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:40.350]
Many of the recalcitrant GOP members declined to detail their reasons for withholding support,

[01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:44.410]
but Representative John Peterson, Republican and Pennsylvania expressed major concerns

[01:41:44.410 --> 01:41:48.610]
about McCain's energy policies and representative Walter Jones and North Carolina's side of

[01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:49.250]
the war in Iraq.

[01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:53.890]
A handful of other Republicans on Capitol Hill made the distinction between endorsing

[01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:57.390]
and supporting adding that while they haven't yet endorsed they do support McCain.

[01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.730]
Right.

[01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:02.510]
In recent weeks, much of the discussion in debate about party unity has been on the Democrat

[01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:07.390]
side amid their protracted presidential primary, achieving harmonies and concern on both

[01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:08.470]
sides of the aisle this year.

[01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:14.030]
It's not unusual for certain factions of the Democratic and Republican parties not

[01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:15.990]
to embrace the respective candidates for president.

[01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:20.470]
McCain's campaign sees that Senator Crats' reticence about Barack Obama issuing a release

[01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:24.190]
on Tuesday that highlighted the representative Dan Boren is an endorsing the presumptive

[01:42:24.190 --> 01:42:24.530]
nominee.

[01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:28.510]
While some conservative Democrats have yet to endorse Obama and didn't back John Kerry

[01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:33.170]
in 2004, there are both centrist and conservative Republicans representing various parts of the

[01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:34.950]
country or not embracing McCain.

[01:42:36.170 --> 01:42:39.130]
Throughout his career in the House and Senate, McCain's been in odds with his party on

[01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:43.730]
a range of issues including campaign finance reform, earmarks, immigration, healthcare,

[01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:44.770]
taxes, and energy.

[01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:49.030]
Some Senate Republicans were especially hurt when McCain's role in the gang of 14 V-line

[01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.890]
judicial nominations.

[01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:55.570]
Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado has been sharply critical of McCain and immigration,

[01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:59.070]
told the Hill and February, I don't like McCain, I don't like him at all.

[01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:02.810]
And I second that emotion, I don't like him at all.

[01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:05.910]
Kind of like Swirlery, I feel the same way about him that I do about her.

[01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:07.590]
Don't like them at all.

[01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:11.050]
Maybe that British guy will call in.

[01:43:11.130 --> 01:43:12.590]
Oh, geez, why call me both?

[01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:15.350]
He was, he was just foaming at the moment.

[01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:16.450]
That's good though.

[01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:17.970]
Yeah, maybe he came up with that.

[01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:19.130]
And that was actually a real call.

[01:43:19.710 --> 01:43:21.470]
Yeah, maybe we'll clean off his teeth a little bit.

[01:43:22.610 --> 01:43:23.390]
I'll let foam.

[01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:25.930]
Look at that phone, baby.

[01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:26.350]
Look at that.

[01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:27.130]
The hole on the phone.

[01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:27.390]
Yeah.

[01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:28.830]
Not a call on the board.

[01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:35.070]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 6, see this is what cracks me up about those people who scream

[01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:36.250]
and holler for the phones.

[01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:39.130]
Oh, the show just isn't the same without the callers.

[01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:40.430]
Are you with the callers make the show?

[01:43:40.570 --> 01:43:40.630]
Yeah.

[01:43:40.890 --> 01:43:41.390]
Or where are they?

[01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:43.470]
Every time I do this, it's the same story.

[01:43:43.710 --> 01:43:43.810]
Right.

[01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:49.050]
They just can't keep up the mo.

[01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:52.870]
They can't maintain the mo.

[01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:55.510]
WDQA and hello.

[01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:59.250]
As we were saying, George, now.

[01:43:59.730 --> 01:44:06.050]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and pound 5, 60 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:08.490]
WDQA and hello.

[01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:09.330]
Neil.

[01:44:09.930 --> 01:44:10.230]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:12.150]
The Hillary just me off, man.

[01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:13.250]
Oh, I got shot at.

[01:44:13.370 --> 01:44:13.890]
Look at me.

[01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:16.830]
And then, oh, yeah, I voted for the crimson going to Iraq.

[01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:19.610]
But then, because of some popular, now we shouldn't be there.

[01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:20.570]
Oh, look at me.

[01:44:20.650 --> 01:44:21.010]
Look at me.

[01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:21.450]
Look at me.

[01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:22.090]
Oh, I'm in.

[01:44:28.130 --> 01:44:28.690]
I'm in.

[01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:30.690]
I'm in.

[01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:31.450]
WDQA and hello.

[01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.590]
Hello.

[01:44:34.570 --> 01:44:35.950]
How was it?

[01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:36.530]
Adam.

[01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.730]
Yeah.

[01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:39.150]
Okay.

[01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:44.750]
He's got a strangulated instrument is what he's got.

[01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:46.370]
WDQA and hello.

[01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:47.530]
Neil.

[01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:48.370]
Yes, sir.

[01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:51.230]
What about when he used to cruise in the 80s?

[01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:51.590]
If you look at this, you can see that.

[01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.590]

[01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:53.430]
Oh, what about when I got it?

[01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.630]
Yeah.

[01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:56.170]
WDQA and hello.

[01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.870]
Yeah.

[01:45:03.250 --> 01:45:04.670]
WDQA and hello.

[01:45:09.650 --> 01:45:10.410]
WDQA and hello.

[01:45:10.450 --> 01:45:10.450]

[01:45:10.890 --> 01:45:11.270]
Hey, Neil.

[01:45:11.530 --> 01:45:11.690]
Please.

[01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.770]
I have one please.

[01:45:13.190 --> 01:45:14.570]
Please bring back the tape.

[01:45:14.670 --> 01:45:15.450]
No, George, please.

[01:45:19.050 --> 01:45:19.830]
WDQA and hello.

[01:45:22.050 --> 01:45:22.550]
QIM.

[01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:27.250]
You can do it.

[01:45:27.490 --> 01:45:27.830]
Excuse me.

[01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:30.910]
Did you fart?

[01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.990]
Hello?

[01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:32.670]
Yes.

[01:45:33.670 --> 01:45:36.510]
I'd like to ask a simple question about the MBA final.

[01:45:37.570 --> 01:45:38.710]
You want to ask who a question?

[01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:40.130]
Giving.

[01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:42.310]
You want to ask who a question?

[01:45:43.450 --> 01:45:44.430]
A hard question?

[01:45:45.570 --> 01:45:46.970]
Yeah, a hard question.

[01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:48.110]
Like, are you a moron?

[01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:50.790]
No, that's an easy question.

[01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:52.370]
Deputy QIM, hello.

[01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.610]
Neil.

[01:45:54.110 --> 01:45:54.470]
Yes, sir.

[01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:57.830]
Listen, I'm white and I have a black wife.

[01:45:58.270 --> 01:46:00.530]
And I want to know with the rate to stop it with,

[01:46:01.410 --> 01:46:05.870]
why can they get on I'm just for saying certain things or you can't say the N word,

[01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:07.430]
which is perfectly understandable.

[01:46:07.770 --> 01:46:13.090]
Why can everyone get on the radio stations and TV and like Joe Rose and such?

[01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:15.870]
White trash, this, white trash, that.

[01:46:16.050 --> 01:46:18.090]
If we start saying black trash, it's on that very racist.

[01:46:18.490 --> 01:46:21.010]
I mean, I'm far from racist, but what is your take on that?

[01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:22.350]
Isn't that racist comment?

[01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.990]
That's my take.

[01:46:23.690 --> 01:46:26.410]
Isn't white trash, but racist comment to be saying on the airways?

[01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:27.030]
No.

[01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:31.150]
Okay, but if we say the other way, it would be taken as racist.

[01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:31.730]
That's correct.

[01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:32.390]
Now you got it.

[01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:33.070]
Now you catch it on.

[01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:33.370]
Okay.

[01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:34.270]
Take it a little while.

[01:46:34.450 --> 01:46:34.910]
It will slow.

[01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.930]
You're catching on.

[01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:40.270]
560, 705, 60, 560 and they Verizon,

[01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:41.750]
sing it a while on trailer trash.

[01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:42.350]
See is better.

[01:46:42.690 --> 01:46:44.450]
White trash, then you get into race.

[01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:47.570]
Trailer trash, then that's more general, right?

[01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:48.550]
Sure.

[01:46:48.890 --> 01:46:51.030]
How we do with a certificate, by the way, we got 39 still?

[01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:51.410]
Yep.

[01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.950]
You got to be kidding me.

[01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:54.890]
We started with only 50.

[01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:58.190]
WDQA and hello.

[01:47:00.690 --> 01:47:01.330]
QA and?

[01:47:02.130 --> 01:47:04.490]
Barack Obama is the second coming of it.

[01:47:05.110 --> 01:47:05.910]
WDQA and hello.

[01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:07.350]
It's Barack Obama.

[01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.890]
It's Barack Obama.

[01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:09.110]
QA and hello.

[01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:12.150]
What I've got to do, what I've got to do, what I've got to do,

[01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:13.530]
little, little, little, orange.

[01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:16.170]
WDQA and hello.

[01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:17.030]
No.

[01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.810]
Yes.

[01:47:18.330 --> 01:47:22.270]
I keep hearing mad now talking about how nasty it was in this studio over there,

[01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:24.530]
so they had like red stains on the carpet.

[01:47:25.150 --> 01:47:27.290]
There's one you think Randy was walking on that carpet.

[01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:29.430]
WAAA!

[01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:31.150]
WAAA!

[01:47:32.210 --> 01:47:32.690]
WAAA!

[01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:33.690]
WDQA and hello.

[01:47:33.690 --> 01:47:34.750]
Yes.

[01:47:34.750 --> 01:47:35.170]
I'm saying yes.

[01:47:35.290 --> 01:47:35.810]
WAAA!

[01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:38.050]
QA and hello.

[01:47:46.610 --> 01:47:47.590]
WDQA and hello.

[01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.590]

[01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.590]

[01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.590]

[01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.590]

[01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.590]

[01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.590]
Yes.

[01:47:48.610 --> 01:47:49.010]
WDQA and hello.

[01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.010]

[01:47:49.330 --> 01:47:53.310]
I'm saying I live in a trailer park at Magdala Hall.

[01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:55.010]
I want to ride before we go.

[01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.230]
Yeah.

[01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.850]
Sure you do.

[01:47:55.930 --> 01:47:56.630]
Bad Tony.

[01:47:56.710 --> 01:47:58.450]
Bad Tony-Ason Reverend Schwartz.

[01:47:58.890 --> 01:47:59.090]
Who?

[01:47:59.470 --> 01:48:00.570]
Bad Tony-Ason.

[01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:02.170]
WDQA and hello.

[01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:03.010]
Neil.

[01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.670]
Yes.

[01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:09.670]
I'm love at the bulk and I've got singular and I use pound five-sixty and it doesn't work

[01:48:09.670 --> 01:48:12.850]
because it can't be completed as dial.

[01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.490]
Yeah.

[01:48:13.730 --> 01:48:14.530]
It's because you have singular.

[01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:15.830]
Are you aware of that?

[01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:18.550]
It's a talk-off.

[01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:19.850]
It's because he is singular.

[01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:22.470]
It's Verizon and singular wireless is one of our FACNC.

[01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:23.170]
How can you have singular?

[01:48:24.110 --> 01:48:24.550]
Okay.

[01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:27.130]
I've got FACNC singular.

[01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:28.210]
I didn't know there was a difference.

[01:48:29.050 --> 01:48:29.870]
Are you supposed to be?

[01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.950]
Okay.

[01:48:31.810 --> 01:48:32.270]
Okay.

[01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:34.130]
Maybe it's a scam.

[01:48:35.290 --> 01:48:36.190]
WDQA and hello.

[01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:38.410]
QA and.

[01:48:39.810 --> 01:48:40.450]
They're Neil.

[01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:41.090]
Yeah.

[01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:42.530]
Andre, through the follow.

[01:48:43.810 --> 01:48:44.150]
Yeah.

[01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:45.670]
Okay, great.

[01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:46.230]
Hello, Andre.

[01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:47.730]
WDQA and hello.

[01:48:49.650 --> 01:48:50.610]
Two A.M.

[01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.870]
Hello.

[01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:53.690]
Yeah, these products have no material now.

[01:48:54.230 --> 01:48:55.150]
WDQA and hello.

[01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:56.970]
Hello.

[01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.770]
Yes.

[01:48:58.650 --> 01:48:59.150]
I'm Neil.

[01:48:59.550 --> 01:48:59.870]
Yes.

[01:48:59.870 --> 01:49:01.590]
Yeah, I was wondering.

[01:49:01.730 --> 01:49:04.510]
One of these FUShing OSHOIs, but that was today.

[01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:06.490]
Last week.

[01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.970]
Last week.

[01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.690]
Yeah.

[01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:11.210]
Oh, it's on your website.

[01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:13.110]
Let me say it again.

[01:49:13.330 --> 01:49:13.830]
Last week.

[01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:17.930]
It shouldn't be on our website because Eric should be taking all of that stuff off of there.

[01:49:18.850 --> 01:49:19.710]
It's outdated.

[01:49:20.050 --> 01:49:21.170]
It's on the top of the thing.

[01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:23.110]
It's on QA and.com.

[01:49:23.410 --> 01:49:23.430]
Okay.

[01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:25.110]
It's a commercial thing.

[01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:26.770]
It doesn't belong on NeilRogers.com.

[01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.790]
And how it got on there.

[01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:28.910]
I haven't got any idea.

[01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:31.550]
Eric was trying to be helpful and it was helping a little bit too much.

[01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:32.850]
Did that take it up before the show today?

[01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:36.010]
And didn't we say he was going to all of that stuff?

[01:49:36.110 --> 01:49:36.430]
He did it right away.

[01:49:36.710 --> 01:49:37.690]
It's not even on there.

[01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:39.190]
It's not even on there.

[01:49:39.210 --> 01:49:39.930]
It's not even on there.

[01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:41.390]
Once it's gone, it's gone.

[01:49:41.530 --> 01:49:42.070]
Okay, Schmuck.

[01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:44.210]
Oh, Sean Permanke tour.

[01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:46.550]
WDQA and hello.

[01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.870]
We are.

[01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.330]
That's not.

[01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:49.270]
QA and hello.

[01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.750]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:51.050]
Hello.

[01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:52.330]
Hello, hello to George too.

[01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:52.710]
Yep.

[01:49:53.250 --> 01:49:56.250]
Hey, I'm a, um, I'm a, um, rabbit atheist.

[01:49:56.250 --> 01:50:02.770]
And, uh, I was wondering if you guys could clarify a couple things about the Bible for me, because I, you know, I've read, I read, and the guide to the Bible.

[01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:10.470]
And, uh, I've heard enough about it that, you know, it doesn't make any sense to me, but I was having a heated discussion with some Christians the other day.

[01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:18.650]
And, um, I brought up some of the ridiculous stuff like, you know, being killed for working on Sunday and killing your kids as they misbehaved.

[01:50:18.690 --> 01:50:21.970]
And, uh, they insisted that I was nuts, that that stuff's not in the Bible.

[01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:23.590]
And, uh, or go to Bible.

[01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:26.670]
But a Bible.com, it has a search engine, find anything you want in the Bible.

[01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:27.650]
I'm sorry.

[01:50:27.650 --> 01:50:28.530]
And a version of the Bible.

[01:50:28.690 --> 01:50:29.750]
Bible.com.

[01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:33.790]
So the Bible for any phrase, any word, any version.

[01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:36.570]
When they said, uh, they go, uh, Leviticus.

[01:50:37.150 --> 01:50:37.630]
I'm sorry.

[01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:38.950]
Leviticus.

[01:50:39.450 --> 01:50:40.090]
Oh, okay.

[01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:41.310]
Levit, uh, get going.

[01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:44.950]
Uh, and they said, they said, oh, that's the old testament. That's, and that's not.

[01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:47.090]
Okay, but I ask you a question.

[01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:50.250]
Why would you dignify such garbage while I was wasting your time with it?

[01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:51.810]
Why would you, well, what's the point?

[01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:57.870]
Well, you know, it's just that we're at a party and somebody said something that was so ridiculous.

[01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:06.170]
I had to say, like, you know, you guys call yourself Christians, but you do all these things that are so contrary to, you know, what it says to do.

[01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:12.290]
This rulebook that you have of, uh, how you're supposed to, you know, behave and, uh, run your life.

[01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:14.850]
And none of you guys even seem to know what's in it.

[01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:19.130]
And, uh, there were several different people that just, you know, told me how close that by was.

[01:51:19.630 --> 01:51:22.170]
And I was going to confront them because they said, oh, that must be the old testament.

[01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:22.990]
And that's the testament.

[01:51:22.990 --> 01:51:23.710]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:26.510]
So, I mean, so they're not, and I'm not, right?

[01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.630]
Correct.

[01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:34.070]
Hey, how about, uh, post-adjusting, uh, what's the most ridiculous thing in the Bible?

[01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:39.550]
People living for 900 years or, um, they're long-hauled.

[01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:41.170]
Yeah, there wouldn't be enough room to lift up everything.

[01:51:41.170 --> 01:51:42.550]
All of it.

[01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:46.030]
Well, the most ridiculous thing about the Bible is that there are people who actually believe it.

[01:51:46.230 --> 01:51:48.490]
Yeah, and they said to me, will you ever ever read it?

[01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:54.850]
I said, no, I read books that told, uh, the ridiculous, you know, contradictions about it, and stuff like that.

[01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:57.090]
And I've heard enough about it.

[01:51:57.170 --> 01:51:58.330]
No, let me say it again to you, sir.

[01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:01.190]
Don't waste your energy with Kaka, okay?

[01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:03.090]
Don't waste your energy with Kaka.

[01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.510]

[01:52:04.170 --> 01:52:04.970]
That is correct.

[01:52:05.970 --> 01:52:06.730]
Kaka moan.

[01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:12.010]
Next time they start giving you a song and a dance about all this, the good book says this, just tell Kaka moan.

[01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.670]
Mm-hmm.

[01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:14.070]
And that next time, it'll go away.

[01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:15.050]
That's a catch-all.

[01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:17.070]
How you doing on your poll, there, Chris?

[01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:19.210]
367.

[01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:21.870]
You got to shout it 500 today.

[01:52:21.970 --> 01:52:23.830]
Wouldn't that be something on that new poll on a second poll?

[01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:24.410]
That'd be pretty good.

[01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:28.790]
That'd be pretty, uh, be a lot better if we sold those certificates for Chris, of course, is up here down there.

[01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:30.070]
The biggest name.

[01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:31.170]
The best talent.

[01:52:31.410 --> 01:52:31.690]
The best talent.

[01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:32.650]
This is a live dance.

[01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:34.890]
Fortly to 5.60 QAM.

[01:52:34.890 --> 01:52:35.390]
They.

[01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:36.030]
Fort.

[01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.670]
Later.

[01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:41.110]
Now back to Dawn Jeopardy and your host, Alex Trebar.

[01:52:41.850 --> 01:52:43.510]
We move on now to Double Jeopardy.

[01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:45.650]
Sparky, you had the lowscorpy end of the last round.

[01:52:45.850 --> 01:52:47.030]
Choose a category, please.

[01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:48.810]
What a culture for 200.

[01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:52.010]
The tough exterior covering of the common birch tree.

[01:52:53.110 --> 01:52:54.830]
No, I'm sorry we cannot give that to you.

[01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:56.330]
It must be in the form of a question.

[01:52:56.530 --> 01:52:57.510]
What is barks?

[01:52:57.590 --> 01:52:59.050]
Sparky, you still have control of the board.

[01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:00.950]
Taboo's for 600.

[01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:04.150]
And the answer is the new sofa and the poodle next door.

[01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:05.430]
Correct.

[01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:07.470]
What are two things you're not allowed on?

[01:53:08.250 --> 01:53:10.170]
First little hygiene for 200.

[01:53:10.570 --> 01:53:12.710]
The answer is because they can.

[01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:15.270]
Sparky, no, barn barn.

[01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:16.350]
Correct.

[01:53:16.650 --> 01:53:18.410]
The answer is because they can.

[01:53:18.670 --> 01:53:20.410]
The question, why do dogs look there?

[01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:22.850]
Oh, and that means we're out of time.

[01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:24.990]
We'll return with final dog Jeopardy.

[01:53:25.110 --> 01:53:26.130]
Where our category will be.

[01:53:26.610 --> 01:53:27.410]
Scratch and sniff.

[01:53:27.690 --> 01:53:28.210]
We have to do this.

[01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:29.550]
Yes, scratch and sniffers.

[01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:31.970]
1231 at 5.60 WDQAM.

[01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:32.590]
That's a great Thursday.

[01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:34.550]
We got 80 training callers lined up here.

[01:53:34.710 --> 01:53:35.410]
What's that?

[01:53:35.730 --> 01:53:36.090]
What?

[01:53:36.810 --> 01:53:38.530]
How do we do with the certificates, by the way?

[01:53:38.650 --> 01:53:38.930]
38.

[01:53:39.690 --> 01:53:40.050]
38.

[01:53:40.190 --> 01:53:40.950]
There goes another one.

[01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:45.350]
And I had some food and I had one of the meat patty things.

[01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:46.050]
Meat patty.

[01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:46.890]
Yes, meatless patties.

[01:53:46.890 --> 01:53:47.350]
It was pretty good.

[01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:48.330]
There.

[01:53:48.450 --> 01:53:49.470]
I had like three of them.

[01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:50.670]
Yep.

[01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:52.170]
So I do apologize.

[01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:53.210]
It's pretty good.

[01:53:53.210 --> 01:53:54.390]
It's got some nice spice to it and everything.

[01:53:54.690 --> 01:53:56.570]
So, the natural apology.

[01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:58.430]
I said just that you're such a hard ass.

[01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:00.030]
Well, I like that stuff.

[01:54:00.130 --> 01:54:01.790]
It's just a pile of plate up with them patties.

[01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.530]
I like that kind of thing.

[01:54:02.590 --> 01:54:03.230]
Like a baby.

[01:54:03.610 --> 01:54:04.310]
Like a baby.

[01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:05.690]
I've listened.

[01:54:05.850 --> 01:54:08.250]
A lot of people are superstitious about vegetarian food.

[01:54:08.370 --> 01:54:08.710]
I can relate.

[01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:09.330]
I used to be.

[01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:10.810]
Oh, I mean, superstitious about veg.

[01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:11.750]
I never heard of that.

[01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:14.410]
They just, they don't think they're going to like it

[01:54:14.410 --> 01:54:16.610]
because there's no meat or lard in it.

[01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:19.530]
Because nothing suffered in order to make it.

[01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:20.690]
So it's not going to taste good.

[01:54:30.190 --> 01:54:31.150]
I'm having a smoothie.

[01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:32.430]
Are you really?

[01:54:32.590 --> 01:54:33.090]
Yes, I am.

[01:54:33.410 --> 01:54:33.630]
Good.

[01:54:34.090 --> 01:54:35.170]
You usually do that, don't you?

[01:54:36.170 --> 01:54:36.350]
What?

[01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:37.270]
Have smoothies?

[01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:40.090]
What are you talking about?

[01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:40.750]
Yeah, oh yeah.

[01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:42.090]
It's like a little while.

[01:54:42.090 --> 01:54:44.210]
Well, yeah, you're talking in the past now, okay?

[01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:45.670]
No, no.

[01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:47.010]
There's still hope for the future.

[01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.470]
I hope so.

[01:54:47.690 --> 01:54:47.990]
Yeah, good.

[01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:48.750]
I doubt it though.

[01:54:50.170 --> 01:54:51.150]
I don't think so.

[01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:53.210]
John McCain's demonstrated non-chalance

[01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:54.970]
and whether or not you guys should bring its troop song

[01:54:54.970 --> 01:54:58.150]
from Iraq demonstrates that the Republican presidential candidate

[01:54:58.150 --> 01:55:00.610]
is out of touch and just doesn't get the consequences

[01:55:00.610 --> 01:55:01.830]
of a continued occupation.

[01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:04.290]
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said yesterday.

[01:55:05.370 --> 01:55:08.030]
Reid issued a skating review to the Arizona Senator

[01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:10.450]
after McCain's appearance on the NBC Today Show,

[01:55:10.810 --> 01:55:12.650]
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean

[01:55:12.650 --> 01:55:15.350]
and Syrigans of Presidential candidate Barack Obama

[01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:16.730]
also were quick to condemn McCain

[01:55:16.730 --> 01:55:18.270]
after Wednesday morning's appearance.

[01:55:19.230 --> 01:55:21.330]
Post Matt Lauer noted the perception that the surge

[01:55:21.330 --> 01:55:23.150]
is working in asked McCain if he had a better estimate

[01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:25.370]
of one American forces can come home from Iraq

[01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:26.150]
to which McCain replied,

[01:55:26.770 --> 01:55:28.350]
no, but that's not too important.

[01:55:29.730 --> 01:55:32.950]
As he has before, such as his off-criticized 100-year statement,

[01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:34.550]
McCain said the length of occupation

[01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:35.490]
wasn't what was important,

[01:55:35.690 --> 01:55:37.470]
but the number of casualties he has troop suffer.

[01:55:38.370 --> 01:55:40.950]
So let them stay there and rot forever as long as they stay alive.

[01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:41.930]
That's what really counts.

[01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:44.910]
Little, little, little, little, little crazy person.

[01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:47.710]
And this is the best of Republicans could come up with.

[01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:49.510]
It was a total crazy old coup.

[01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:52.030]
56670560,

[01:55:52.570 --> 01:55:54.850]
Pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:56.530]
WDQ-Y-N, hello.

[01:55:59.730 --> 01:56:00.730]
WDQ-Y-N, hello.

[01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:04.510]
Hi, this is Nancy.

[01:56:05.290 --> 01:56:06.570]
I enjoy your show mentally.

[01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:07.330]
I have a question.

[01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:08.410]
Yes, I do.

[01:56:09.090 --> 01:56:10.270]
My question is,

[01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:12.870]
last week your ratings came out.

[01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:14.930]
How did you do it?

[01:56:15.010 --> 01:56:16.550]
Because I was looking in the paper

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:18.410]
and nobody wrote anything on it.

[01:56:19.090 --> 01:56:19.970]
Good. That's good.

[01:56:21.710 --> 01:56:23.410]
That's good that nobody wrote anything about it.

[01:56:23.410 --> 01:56:24.130]
They're not good.

[01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:25.390]
They won't hurt.

[01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:28.030]
The station is vanishing from the earth.

[01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:29.910]
That's why nobody wrote anything.

[01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.730]
Yeah, he's just a trend.

[01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:31.950]
They don't write articles about trends.

[01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:33.090]
Oh, okay.

[01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:35.650]
That's what Barry Jackson was going to write something

[01:56:35.650 --> 01:56:38.410]
because he usually writes things about...

[01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:41.230]
Especially if the guys across the street

[01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:43.210]
or in the middle, he's in their pocket if they do well,

[01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:45.590]
which really happens, but especially if it happens.

[01:56:46.490 --> 01:56:47.610]
Okay, because I was out of town

[01:56:47.610 --> 01:56:49.950]
so we can read my nephews' graduations.

[01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:50.890]
I can't even write in, you know,

[01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:53.490]
be able to hear what happens.

[01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:54.630]
You don't want to know.

[01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:58.150]
Okay, but you're not going to have to have a great day.

[01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.630]
They sucked.

[01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:00.490]
The ratings sucked.

[01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:00.870]
They blew.

[01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:01.670]
We don't have any.

[01:57:01.770 --> 01:57:02.830]
Can't complain about a ring song.

[01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:03.890]
QM because we don't have any.

[01:57:05.230 --> 01:57:06.610]
But Jolly Joe is running around.

[01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:09.790]
We're going to do this and we're going to do that.

[01:57:10.130 --> 01:57:11.150]
You'll see, Neil.

[01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:13.810]
I'll see you all right.

[01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:14.810]
WQAM, hello.

[01:57:15.610 --> 01:57:16.270]
Hi, Neil.

[01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:22.450]
Did you see the recent time magazine article about the soldiers on Prozac

[01:57:22.450 --> 01:57:23.550]
and anti-depressants?

[01:57:24.010 --> 01:57:24.250]
No.

[01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:26.290]
It's very interesting.

[01:57:26.650 --> 01:57:29.270]
It has a stat that shows...

[01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:33.150]
When the soldiers have been on three or more tours,

[01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:37.710]
their incidence of mental-serious mental illness is close to 30%.

[01:57:37.710 --> 01:57:39.310]
Well, don't tell us, John McCain.

[01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:41.250]
Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.

[01:57:42.010 --> 01:57:42.910]
Okay, thanks.

[01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:43.290]
Thank you, sir.

[01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:46.830]
May be he wants more people to be mentally ill, like he is, John McCain.

[01:57:47.090 --> 01:57:47.710]
That's possible.

[01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:50.290]
And this is where he loves companies, not what they say.

[01:57:52.530 --> 01:57:53.710]
I think you're eating again.

[01:57:54.210 --> 01:57:54.470]
Chop, chop.

[01:57:55.650 --> 01:57:56.370]
WQAM, hello.

[01:57:58.630 --> 01:57:59.650]
WQAM, hello.

[01:57:59.650 --> 01:57:59.650]

[01:57:59.650 --> 01:58:00.530]
I have a number one news.

[01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:02.310]
WQAM, hello.

[01:58:03.450 --> 01:58:03.790]
Yes.

[01:58:04.130 --> 01:58:06.590]
Why do you have something again, Hitler recladen?

[01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:07.530]
What is Joe and Jack?

[01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:08.630]
Oh, here we go again.

[01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.890]
Yes.

[01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:11.470]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:58:11.590 --> 01:58:12.310]
Let me ask you something.

[01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:15.470]
Is this your one topic?

[01:58:15.710 --> 01:58:17.130]
Is this all your people will be talking about?

[01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:20.530]
What do you have against Hillary Clinton?

[01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:26.890]
Yes, I talk about men, part on your face, part on your whole.

[01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:29.370]
Every time you get some scores,

[01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:32.310]
what are you talking about with cruising in the 80s?

[01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:33.150]
Did they spank?

[01:58:36.410 --> 01:58:36.910]
No?

[01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:39.510]
Yes, I said.

[01:58:39.790 --> 01:58:40.410]
Yes, I said.

[01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:40.850]
Yes.

[01:58:42.630 --> 01:58:43.410]
Oh, yes.

[01:58:44.630 --> 01:58:45.830]
Was there any doubt?

[01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.130]
No.

[01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:49.350]
Was there any doubt that he had the other order?

[01:58:49.670 --> 01:58:49.670]

[01:58:52.930 --> 01:58:56.150]
56670560, 560 and they've arrived in Singular, wireless line.

[01:58:56.370 --> 01:58:57.910]
Well, I got such a big throw a lot of it yesterday.

[01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:59.710]
Let's come back and do the thing.

[01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:00.850]
You betcha.

[01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:02.750]
WQAM, hello.

[01:59:03.610 --> 01:59:04.730]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:59:05.170 --> 01:59:05.470]
OK.

[01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:09.690]
I'm Jeff Dauter from Life in a band called Doc Hooler.

[01:59:09.690 --> 01:59:11.710]
Yeah, you're in a band called the Voice in the band.

[01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:12.710]
You're in.

[01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:16.930]
56670560, £560 in the Verizon.

[01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:18.930]
You know, the interesting part of it is,

[01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:20.650]
as weak as the responses today,

[01:59:21.370 --> 01:59:23.190]
when you take away the four or five, you know,

[01:59:23.250 --> 01:59:24.690]
they're called 600 times a piece,

[01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:26.070]
there ain't much of anything.

[01:59:27.110 --> 01:59:27.370]
No.

[01:59:27.490 --> 01:59:27.810]
You know what I mean?

[01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:28.290]
Oh, yeah.

[01:59:29.170 --> 01:59:29.970]
Kills time, though.

[01:59:30.670 --> 01:59:32.590]
Oh, yeah, he kills some sensational time.

[01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:32.930]
Yes, after all.

[01:59:33.410 --> 01:59:34.710]
I think Kills the operative word.

[01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:37.590]
How we doing with the certificates, by the way, still 38?

[01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:39.650]
Refreshing right now.

[01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.650]
38.

[01:59:43.290 --> 01:59:43.910]
Not so good.

[01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:46.730]
WQAM, hello.

[01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:48.890]
Hey, Neil, whatever you do, man,

[01:59:49.070 --> 01:59:50.170]
just don't get the right TV.

[01:59:50.610 --> 01:59:52.270]
Please, don't get the right TV.

[01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.990]
Why is that?

[01:59:53.110 --> 01:59:53.870]
I have the right TV.

[01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:55.870]
Oh, I think just want to keep saying it.

[01:59:56.210 --> 01:59:56.530]
Got it.

[01:59:56.590 --> 01:59:57.070]
I like it.

[01:59:57.330 --> 01:59:58.170]
Got it down there.

[01:59:58.230 --> 01:59:59.890]
Don't have it here, because it doesn't exist here.

[02:00:03.050 --> 02:00:05.610]
56670560, £560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[02:00:06.590 --> 02:00:07.230]
WQAM, hello.

[02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.910]
QAM.

[02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:13.030]
WQAM, hello.

[02:00:13.650 --> 02:00:14.450]
I'm Gavore.

[02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:16.190]
QAM, hello.

[02:00:17.110 --> 02:00:17.850]
Hello, Neil.

[02:00:18.370 --> 02:00:18.510]
Yes?

[02:00:19.330 --> 02:00:24.350]
Hey, as the media given any kind of indication on who Obama is going to have his running mate at this point?

[02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:26.850]
Well, what do you mean he's the media given any indication?

[02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:27.930]
He hasn't decided yet.

[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:29.010]
How many of you have been in the chat?

[02:00:29.710 --> 02:00:32.830]
I know, like, with McCain, there's everybody talking about Chris now.

[02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:35.270]
That's going to be his running mate.

[02:00:35.690 --> 02:00:38.010]
Everybody's talking about Limp Risted, Charlie, Chris?

[02:00:38.370 --> 02:00:40.390]
That's all Flurb about it online earlier, so.

[02:00:40.530 --> 02:00:42.030]
Well, that doesn't mean everybody's talking about it.

[02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:44.690]
You saw Blurb about it, so therefore everybody's talking about it.

[02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:47.250]
Well, online and also on the talking head shows.

[02:00:47.650 --> 02:00:47.850]
Yeah.

[02:00:48.170 --> 02:00:52.410]
Well, once they're looking to his closet, this Chris ain't going to be the running mate.

[02:00:53.150 --> 02:00:54.790]
Yeah, I think it would go by on my...

[02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:59.810]
I don't understand why Richardson's not talked about to be with him, and then they will fear him.

[02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:01.030]
Okay.

[02:01:02.250 --> 02:01:06.970]
Well, I guess they can just forget the whole, you know, vetting process, and they just call this guy,

[02:01:07.010 --> 02:01:08.410]
and he'll tell him Bill Richardson's the man.

[02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:09.130]
Yeah, that's it.

[02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:12.330]
Has the media done a speculating yet?

[02:01:12.490 --> 02:01:12.590]
Yeah.

[02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:16.330]
How about we just wait till he decides and tells us who he chooses?

[02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:17.030]
Wouldn't that be an interesting...

[02:01:17.590 --> 02:01:18.270]
Yeah, that's no fun.

[02:01:18.370 --> 02:01:18.810]
Let's speculate.

[02:01:20.690 --> 02:01:21.030]
Speculate?

[02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:21.850]
I will.

[02:01:21.970 --> 02:01:23.170]
You're picking on Bill Richardson again.

[02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:24.550]
391 votes on the poll.

[02:01:24.670 --> 02:01:25.830]
We're getting close to 400, Chris.

[02:01:26.330 --> 02:01:26.610]
All right.

[02:01:26.610 --> 02:01:31.690]
Which talentless child of privilege capitalized best on his or her family's fame and fortune?

[02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:33.870]

Okay.

So what breakfast cereal will you tell Mom to buy?

[02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:38.530]

[02:04:11.230 --> 02:04:11.930]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:12.010 --> 02:04:12.530]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:13.790]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:14.990]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:16.950]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:17.250]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:18.470]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.470]

[02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.470]

[02:04:21.130 --> 02:04:24.350]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:26.150 --> 02:04:26.710]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:26.710 --> 02:04:26.710]

[02:04:26.710 --> 02:04:26.710]

[02:04:27.570 --> 02:04:30.910]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:31.930]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:31.930 --> 02:04:32.910]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:33.730]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:36.730]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:36.730 --> 02:04:37.650]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:40.490]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:42.110]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:42.110 --> 02:04:42.970]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:42.970 --> 02:04:43.410]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:43.450 --> 02:04:48.430]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.430]

[02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.450]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:51.690]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:51.690 --> 02:04:52.210]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:52.230 --> 02:04:52.750]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:53.770]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:55.130]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:58.470]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:59.430]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:04:59.430 --> 02:05:02.410]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:02.410 --> 02:05:03.930]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:06.750]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:08.390]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:10.670]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:14.390]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:15.870]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:18.170]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:18.170 --> 02:05:18.410]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:18.430]
I love you Flintstones, Jewelble Valley.

[02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:19.930]
You know, a piece by George?

[02:05:20.290 --> 02:05:20.290]

[02:05:20.290 --> 02:05:20.910]
I said, how's it going today?

[02:05:21.670 --> 02:05:22.810]
No, sir, it's not going to happen.

[02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:26.530]
I mean, where, you know, if it makes you happy, saying these things, fine.

[02:05:26.650 --> 02:05:27.430]
I don't disagree with it.

[02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:28.170]
What's not going to happen?

[02:05:28.690 --> 02:05:29.650]
But wouldn't it be ironic?

[02:05:29.890 --> 02:05:31.390]
And irony is the point I was trying to make it happen.

[02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:32.190]
Let me say it again.

[02:05:32.330 --> 02:05:34.370]
It isn't going to happen.

[02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:36.530]
Read my lips like Daddy said.

[02:05:37.210 --> 02:05:37.850]
Read my lips.

[02:05:37.950 --> 02:05:38.730]
It isn't going to happen.

[02:05:40.410 --> 02:05:43.210]
Yes, it would be poetic justice, but we don't have any justice.

[02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.610]
Okay.

[02:05:43.850 --> 02:05:47.670]
We're too busy, you know, busting people for having a pin droid or something.

[02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:48.650]
We're asking their ass train, their car.

[02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:52.850]
We don't worry about people that, you know, send folks to get killed on a war based on lies.

[02:05:54.850 --> 02:05:58.110]
Okay, I got a really good article here about blame Bush, where the hell is it?

[02:05:58.310 --> 02:06:00.790]
Oh, and Chuck Berry said no to John McCain.

[02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:06.130]
Aren't you impressed by that?

[02:06:07.110 --> 02:06:07.710]
Medium impressed.

[02:06:09.530 --> 02:06:10.730]
That doesn't blow you away.

[02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:12.730]
The fact that Chuck Berry turned down McCain.

[02:06:14.250 --> 02:06:15.850]
He said, hell, I don't know about blow it away.

[02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:19.530]
He joined a course of musician's starving John.

[02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:21.350]
I don't know why that's even a story.

[02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:22.930]
Would you expect Chuck Berry to be a Republican?

[02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.730]
I would not.

[02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.950]
Well, there you go.

[02:06:25.450 --> 02:06:28.450]
I can't find that damn story about blame Bush.

[02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:29.570]
Oh, here it is right here.

[02:06:29.610 --> 02:06:30.170]
It's in my hand.

[02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:31.250]
That's why I couldn't find it.

[02:06:32.130 --> 02:06:33.090]
Sometimes you're looking forward.

[02:06:33.130 --> 02:06:34.530]
You can't find it because it's in your hand.

[02:06:35.250 --> 02:06:38.410]
Robert Scheer says, blame rising oil prices on Bush.

[02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:41.890]
Wow, a lot of people must have bought Hummers last week.

[02:06:41.890 --> 02:06:43.590]
How else to explain the spike in oil prices?

[02:06:44.130 --> 02:06:44.550]
I've got a brief one.

[02:06:45.050 --> 02:06:46.330]
Can I read this?

[02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:49.430]
No, I'm not being silly.

[02:06:50.070 --> 02:06:53.810]
They are, and by they, they, I mean the gaggle of media pun,

[02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:56.930]
it's another administration apologist, embedded by some green zealots

[02:06:56.930 --> 02:07:00.250]
who want to explain our energy crisis by reference to propagate consumers.

[02:07:01.190 --> 02:07:03.850]
Sure, in the long run, we consumers, especially the most wasteful ones

[02:07:03.850 --> 02:07:06.410]
who have put a reside in the rural USA, and who become a customer

[02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:09.070]
to consuming many times our populations' worth of the world resources,

[02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:10.210]
do need to shape up.

[02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:14.010]
But that has little to do with the five-fold rise in the price of oil

[02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:15.850]
since George Bush became our president.

[02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.630]
The AP did it.

[02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:20.370]
Bush's deliberate roiling of rural politics is the key variable

[02:07:20.370 --> 02:07:21.930]
in the run-up of oil prices.

[02:07:22.330 --> 02:07:25.770]
No president's been more brilliant in destabilizing the politics of oil producing countries

[02:07:25.770 --> 02:07:29.170]
from Venezuela to Russia and onto the key oil lakes of Iraq and Iran.

[02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:33.230]
The last will go down, and the history of our nation

[02:07:33.230 --> 02:07:36.770]
is one of the dumbest excavators ever rivaling even the madness of the Vietnam War.

[02:07:36.770 --> 02:07:39.550]
But this time the neocons bet their smart money on oil

[02:07:39.550 --> 02:07:42.010]
as the decisive missing ingredient for success.

[02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:45.630]
Vietnam was always absurd on its faces the imperial adventure because

[02:07:45.630 --> 02:07:48.170]
as American consumers who check their labels must know,

[02:07:48.490 --> 02:07:51.490]
the Vietnamese dominate the market only in the provision of farmed shrimp.

[02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:54.490]
I won't bother here to dignify the canard that Vietnam,

[02:07:54.770 --> 02:07:57.550]
any more than Iraq, ever represented a serious threat to U.S. security

[02:07:57.550 --> 02:07:59.810]
to our McCain sacrifice in the former warnaz,

[02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:01.910]
apologetics for the current one outwithstanding.

[02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:05.030]
After the most ignominious defeat in American history,

[02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:07.930]
Communist Vietnam did not have to be fought on the shores of San Diego

[02:08:07.930 --> 02:08:09.510]
as the hawks at that time predicted,

[02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:11.450]
but rather went to war with Communist China,

[02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:14.190]
the country that had occupied Vietnam for thousands of years.

[02:08:14.730 --> 02:08:17.070]
The Vietnamese later made their peace and outcompete successfully

[02:08:17.070 --> 02:08:20.210]
in the capitalist market without controlling anybody else's resources.

[02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:24.590]
Something similarly unexpected is likely to occur if we get out of Iraq

[02:08:24.590 --> 02:08:26.750]
and permit the people of that region to make their own history.

[02:08:27.230 --> 02:08:30.290]
Events upon our departure will follow the vagaries of a historical script

[02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:32.650]
centering on religion, ethnicity, and nationalism,

[02:08:32.650 --> 02:08:36.170]
which is the talking heads in the median political circles United Ignoring.

[02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:39.750]
As Iraqi Prime Minister Al Malaki demonstrated the other day

[02:08:39.750 --> 02:08:41.830]
with his third visit to his former safe haven in Iran,

[02:08:42.290 --> 02:08:44.510]
the politics of the region have already been sorted out in ways

[02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:46.170]
unproductive by the Neocons.

[02:08:46.650 --> 02:08:50.890]
When he'd only note the words of advice extended to Malaki by a ran supreme leader,

[02:08:51.250 --> 02:08:54.550]
the Itollical meeny, that the Iraqis must think of a solution to free themselves

[02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:55.430]
from the U.S. military.

[02:08:56.010 --> 02:08:58.230]
Malaki nodded every grateful for an audience with a man

[02:08:58.230 --> 02:09:01.210]
who holds Iraq's destiny as hand thanks to the American overthrow

[02:09:01.210 --> 02:09:04.170]
to Ran's nemesis Sodom Usain, as I said Bush was brilliant.

[02:09:05.070 --> 02:09:08.090]
But to be fair, the administration did finally get something right last week

[02:09:08.090 --> 02:09:10.610]
when defense secretary Robert Gates fired both the civilian

[02:09:10.610 --> 02:09:11.950]
and military chiefs of the Air Force.

[02:09:12.730 --> 02:09:15.730]
It were being punished in part for being in charge of an Air Force defense system

[02:09:15.730 --> 02:09:18.790]
that lost track of a nuclear load, be it loaded B-52,

[02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:21.310]
that flew over the U.S. without anyone in the chain of command

[02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:22.450]
or where it was dangerous cargo.

[02:09:22.890 --> 02:09:25.050]
Then there was also the matter of ballistic missile fuses

[02:09:25.050 --> 02:09:26.890]
that were wrongously shipped to Taiwan.

[02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:30.650]
The Air Force has been especially egregious in exploiting the history

[02:09:30.650 --> 02:09:33.610]
of over 9-11 to commit to hundreds of billions in future spending

[02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:35.610]
for high-tech weapons that make no sense

[02:09:35.610 --> 02:09:37.090]
with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

[02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:41.530]
One issue in the firings was the Air Force's pushing for hundreds more F-22 fighter jets,

[02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:44.910]
a $65 billion program that Gates had concluded was not needed

[02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:48.610]
as there's been no rule for the existing forces in Afghanistan and Iraq wars.

[02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:51.750]
Gates rejected the argument that China or any other nation

[02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:54.390]
was on the way to providing the F-22 with a worthy opponent.

[02:09:54.710 --> 02:09:57.630]
Given a sudden commitment to logic, Gates may not survive long

[02:09:57.630 --> 02:09:58.970]
even in his lame duck administration.

[02:09:59.710 --> 02:10:03.830]
Better get someone in their fast who is content that we taxpayers pay the interest on loans from China

[02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:07.650]
to pay for building up an arsenal of counter-reppings that the Chinese show no sign of building.

[02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:09.410]
He had so many money, yours.

[02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:13.970]
Robert Scheer, he was good enough for the early times.

[02:10:14.050 --> 02:10:14.150]
Nope.

[02:10:18.130 --> 02:10:21.290]
But nevertheless, I love all these people.

[02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:23.010]
I mean, you know, that young guy that called before.

[02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:25.590]
I mean, he was articulate and intelligent and concerned.

[02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:27.010]
But what's the point?

[02:10:27.010 --> 02:10:29.830]
You know, what's the point of beating a dead horse?

[02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.750]
Am I right?

[02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:32.830]
Might feel good.

[02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.950]
Not for the horse.

[02:10:35.650 --> 02:10:36.370]
That's my death.

[02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:38.430]
Well, I'm looking at that death by a chocolate.

[02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:43.410]
Got to stop eating carbs, man.

[02:10:44.130 --> 02:10:44.590]
Got to stop.

[02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:46.070]
Don't you agree?

[02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.790]
I do agree.

[02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:48.550]
When it's out, store them out.

[02:10:48.730 --> 02:10:49.350]
I'm trying to cut them down.

[02:10:50.050 --> 02:10:50.490]
You're what?

[02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:51.830]
Cutting down the carbs.

[02:10:52.230 --> 02:10:53.510]
Whenever I'm on a diet, I'm on a diet.

[02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:55.010]
I'm on a diet.

[02:10:55.010 --> 02:10:57.710]
I gotta get back into the 180's and then the 170's and then 160.

[02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:02.450]
You can do it.

[02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:03.270]
By what?

[02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:04.290]
By will.

[02:11:06.450 --> 02:11:07.030]
George will.

[02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:07.630]
George will.

[02:11:07.750 --> 02:11:08.150]
George is diet.

[02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:09.730]
I got news for it.

[02:11:09.850 --> 02:11:10.370]
He likes that show.

[02:11:10.690 --> 02:11:12.670]
If you watch George step on top of his that show on Sunday,

[02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:13.450]
you will lose weight.

[02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:14.990]
You'll lose your appetite for life.

[02:11:16.150 --> 02:11:17.270]
God is at a bad show.

[02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:18.730]
Let's bring back David Brinkley.

[02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:19.150]
What do you say?

[02:11:23.530 --> 02:11:33.350]
Yeah, yeah, you know how some it's not me yet. Thank God, but some people when they get old their eyelids begin to droop and their eyeballs start like they look like they're gonna pop out

[02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:35.930]

[02:11:37.190 --> 02:11:40.090]
Where's Chad Huntley when we need a man? Where's Edward R. Morrow?

Where's Robert Trout and his buddy trouser trout?

[02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:53.590]
The Democratic Party as a whole is as spineless and cowardly as

[02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:59.070]
Anyone could ever begin to imagine which is why the Republicans every time they get in there every time they steal another election

[02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:02.010]
They get away with basically whatever they want

[02:12:02.010 --> 02:12:05.910]
Bubba he gets a hammer and he's being impeached okay

[02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:10.230]
For lying about his personal sex life which was nobody's damn business, but nevertheless

[02:12:10.770 --> 02:12:14.930]
Whole country had to be everything had to be held up in limbo because of that crap

[02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:18.410]
While Kenny Star was writing all this damn pornography and

[02:12:21.110 --> 02:12:26.330]

Maybe you'd be a lot less surly if you had ice cream every day

[02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:05.850]
Maybe feel a lot better about your life. Maybe you wouldn't waste 600 pounds

[02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:08.610]

It says we've also confirmed at least one of those children was in her kindergarten class

According to the incident report a girl told her mother she'd been molested multiple times by crap and crafts home on sickamore drive and chickamaga

[02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:48.530]
The incident report also states is at least one other victim and one other suspect that suspect is underage in place

[02:15:48.530 --> 02:15:53.730]

They've never had a deal with allegations of this nature and they're waiting on the official word from the sheriff's office before proceeding

[02:16:20.630 --> 02:16:21.950]
How do you like that?

How many Q a M hello? Hey, miss O'Neill. Yes, sir, mr. Collar

[02:22:48.350 --> 02:22:53.870]
I'm wondering if you've heard this rumor going around that the reason that Hillary Clinton only

[02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:58.770]
Suspended her campaign did not quit is because the fact that

[02:22:58.770 --> 02:23:04.450]
Senator Obama isn't legally allowed to be in the race to begin. Oh, are you?

[02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:07.030]
You know something you've been reading national review too much

[02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:13.210]
Well, the truer is not true. No, it's not true. Let me say it again. It is not true. Well, I think you're a damn liar

[02:23:13.210 --> 02:23:18.090]
Well, I don't care. What's your thing? How do you like that? Yeah, like you can think yeah?

[02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:20.490]

He ran out of material

[02:23:23.930 --> 02:23:29.630]
There's one thing I can't stand its name cards. Oh, Prince Charles. Yeah, but that isn't the show business. That's the thought of I

[02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:32.930]
Mean what is he?

[02:23:34.170 --> 02:23:35.210]
What is Charles?

[02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:42.510]
What funny looking no for the pool about the nepotism of capitalizing on his face

[02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:46.810]
I know because that that goes from generation that's all those puzzles

[02:23:46.810 --> 02:23:51.070]
And of course they would imply that somehow the rural family has got some kind of talent

[02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:56.290]
Exactly of a brilliant some kind of something besides just being a bunch of funny-dirty old hypocrites

[02:23:56.290 --> 02:23:58.370]
For busy screwing their brains out

[02:23:58.890 --> 02:24:03.810]
In addition to Prince Charles buggering the butler or whoever the hell he's doing or it's the other way around. I'm sorry

[02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:06.250]
That's why he likes wearing them kills

[02:24:13.330 --> 02:24:14.850]
The fourth leader

[02:24:36.650 --> 02:24:44.270]
I know what you mean every 28 days I get this insatiable craving to buy a banjo and a corn cob pipe

[02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:47.870]
Yeah, well then it looks like there's only one thing to do

[02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:50.550]
And was that down mr. Lacka

[02:24:50.550 --> 02:25:00.170]
Oh these two men are suffering from pre-ministral syndrome

[02:25:00.170 --> 02:25:08.230]
Beware the warning signs if your husband ever comes home with a tambourine or a banjo pick and insist on calling you

[02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:13.570]
Mr. Bones hide the shoe polish and call your family doctor immediately

[02:25:13.570 --> 02:25:17.650]
So tell me that mr. Bones yes, sir, mr. Lacka

[02:25:24.730 --> 02:25:28.210]
No, it's not very funny and there is no cure

[02:25:28.210 --> 02:25:34.530]
So when it happens to the man in your life try to understand pre-ministral syndrome

[02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:41.130]
Once they see that totally is we're good. I mean you know what this reminds me of what this is perfect for the

[02:25:41.610 --> 02:25:44.210]
Coaches your will comes around goes around or however that goes

[02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:46.950]
These are what 20 years old

[02:25:47.530 --> 02:25:52.690]
Right the ACNs from the early days at IOD thereabouts. Yes, and you know back in those days

[02:25:52.690 --> 02:25:57.250]
They were like you know like amusing, but not not hysterical fall down funny

[02:25:57.250 --> 02:26:02.530]
You know not what we thought and then we went through the whole cutting edge period where we could play a whole bunch of

[02:26:02.530 --> 02:26:07.030]
Of course we can't play and I was you look back at this and this is perfect for now

[02:26:08.430 --> 02:26:15.150]
These are amusing not hysterical right not dirty. Yeah, not cutting it what they're like oh

[02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:17.030]
Come on

[02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:22.730]
There's lukewarm at best. Yeah, the National one

[02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:27.590]
So what the National one sorry? I have belped right in the middle there

[02:26:30.450 --> 02:26:35.050]
You you don't understand what I'm saying what he said I don't know. Okay, I understand

[02:26:37.570 --> 02:26:41.210]
117 at 560 there is Barack Obama in Wisconsin each year

[02:26:42.490 --> 02:26:47.790]
Seniors in this conference should not vote. That's what the guy said before anybody 65 and older don't vote

[02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:53.090]
Even if you vote for the right candidate don't vote anyway. I mean he just made a whole lot of say it's our time

[02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:56.290]
No, yes, he turned about his unfair play as Peter Marshall would say

[02:26:56.730 --> 02:27:03.050]
Used to be the old parts in South Florida, but you know in his son. He's the early bird. It's our time now get out of here

[02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:03.970]
Oh

[02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:06.990]
I'll never forget that is that's a true story

[02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:09.670]
It's a true story some old bitch

[02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:14.530]
I go in a restaurant with a couple of friends. This is way back in the day

[02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:18.670]
70s mid 70s and

[02:27:18.670 --> 02:27:22.750]
Some old bang is sitting there. I think it was a Chinese restaurant was an early bird

[02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:28.490]
What are you doing here you're not old enough for the early bird this is our time now and

[02:27:29.650 --> 02:27:36.830]
And other dead W. Q. I. Am hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Okay? Are you gonna be traveling abroad this summer maybe

[02:27:37.430 --> 02:27:42.790]
Tell me I'm a few months back. You were putting this kind of putting a knock on Amsterdam. Yes, what's the deal?

[02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:45.350]
It's not the land of the free anymore. No, they're like

[02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:51.010]
They're getting rid of most of the red light district and they're banning a mushrooms and they're becoming more and more

[02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:52.830]
fascistic

[02:27:53.530 --> 02:27:59.270]
We would which it's gonna be their funeral because tourism is good and drop real bad there too many other neat places to go

[02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:02.690]
As opposed to going there and eating their crappy food. Oh, yeah

[02:28:02.690 --> 02:28:05.410]
Yeah, you don't want to eat a Mickey D's I can do that right here

[02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:09.570]
What about at that pancake place next to the river? Have you read that place is that still there?

[02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:14.590]
Pancake yeah, there's some big old building there the end Frank building where they serve these

[02:28:15.150 --> 02:28:19.970]
Panty pancakes well, I need no pancakes okay. Okay. All right. We'll have a good summer Neil

[02:28:19.970 --> 02:28:26.050]
You're okay twice a week then right? Yes, sir. Okay, because I we don't want to die a slow measurable death with George Kavorkian

[02:28:27.870 --> 02:28:31.430]
Okay, see you there's another one of your fans. I know they're lined it up

[02:28:31.930 --> 02:28:34.790]
That's all right. You better get used to it because George is gonna be on a lot

[02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:39.230]
I'll be here Tuesday and Thursday. I guess I should explain that we might have some new listeners out there. Oh not

[02:28:40.130 --> 02:28:45.410]
That during the summer months starting whenever I feel like it's starting about June 16. It doesn't matter what we do. It's a secret

[02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:49.250]
What do you mean by that nobody on the outside is gonna know? Oh nobody outside?

[02:28:49.430 --> 02:28:53.050]
Well, no anyway, that's right because we don't do any promotion outside. We just keep preaching the choir

[02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:58.510]
So like the costume appearance was great. It was a lot of fun, but you know, those are people who are already listeners

[02:28:59.590 --> 02:29:03.050]
We don't do anything anything to create one

[02:29:03.490 --> 02:29:05.950]
Soledante Uno not one listener new one

[02:29:07.810 --> 02:29:11.330]
So either they find us by accident or they just to don't find us and

[02:29:11.370 --> 02:29:18.150]
And the numbers keep dwindling and dwindling and the audience keeps dying and vanishing and moving away and a whole bunch of

[02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:19.350]
You know

[02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:24.990]
And these people but a beat better go and of course the excuse used to be

[02:29:24.990 --> 02:29:31.190]
We're losing a million dollars a year on the marlins. It was always the marlins was excuse why they didn't do any promotion

[02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:34.990]
Well, we don't have the marlins anymore and we're not losing any money on them

[02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:38.030]
In fact, we're we're siphoning off a few extra bucks not a whole lot

[02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:42.350]
But with that 10 minute phone. He showed we have it 650 every night before the marlin game with Jesse Agler

[02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:43.510]
Who's a good guy, by the way?

[02:29:43.530 --> 02:29:45.170]
I don't think we're doing but nevertheless

[02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:51.590]
It's just a commercial thing is all it is. Oh come on. It's a great show a lot of insight

[02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:57.970]
How much insight can you get into 90 seconds in between eight and a half minutes of spots a lot?

[02:29:58.510 --> 02:29:59.130]
Okay, good

[02:30:00.770 --> 02:30:03.410]
Boy, you're sure turn turn your ass today

[02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:06.670]
He turned his ass and cut a big fat one. I can smell it all the way up here

[02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:08.990]
That wasn't me must have been the damn cheesecake

[02:30:10.510 --> 02:30:11.550]
Wtq a m hello

[02:30:13.770 --> 02:30:14.730]
Wtq a m hello

[02:30:15.510 --> 02:30:18.510]
George the mushrooms please Q a m hello

[02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:25.850]
I'm sure you'd like him. Yes, I was wondering if George gonna be a you are wondering you were wondering

[02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:29.550]
If you're ever gonna croak. That's what we're wondering if you're ever gonna croak

[02:30:30.010 --> 02:30:31.730]
Everybody in town is wondering that

[02:30:33.850 --> 02:30:38.750]
You know, it's amazing how many years has he been like infesting our lives so put it too many

[02:30:39.450 --> 02:30:44.850]
And yet there's not one person who has who apparently has got any idea who that is other than his boyfriend

[02:30:45.610 --> 02:30:47.130]
You know, I mean? I

[02:30:49.010 --> 02:30:55.930]
Mean like when it was what's his name there the Eddie although that was from the phone number wasn't from some business that he's the manager at right

[02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:59.690]
What's his name against Steve Steve something?

[02:31:02.770 --> 02:31:05.550]
And then we put his name on here and the phone number he still didn't care

[02:31:05.970 --> 02:31:10.130]
This is what process is what this is what the deal is when you're when you're dealing with crazy people

[02:31:10.130 --> 02:31:15.030]
They don't care in fact they enjoy it right. It's like the serial killers. It's the same thing

[02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:19.150]
They're doing it because they know that they're gonna get their 15 seconds of fame before they get fried

[02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:22.230]
Everybody Q a m hello

[02:31:22.990 --> 02:31:29.090]
Okay, sir, first couple things I don't want to kill the ratings of hockey cock but congratulations on your new coach

[02:31:29.090 --> 02:31:29.990]
I wonder what you think of him

[02:31:30.610 --> 02:31:31.710]
Wouldn't make a congratulations

[02:31:32.690 --> 02:31:37.310]
But Wilson we got Doug Wilson who I can't stand and we got Cliff Fletcher there because there two

[02:31:37.310 --> 02:31:39.630]
There two stupid and cheap to hire a new GM

[02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:43.890]
So we're stuck with old white-haired Cliff Fletcher again, but anyway, I can't be any worse than I was

[02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:47.790]
I think Wilson might be a good fit for Toronto. I think I'm gonna say because they have no talent

[02:31:48.530 --> 02:31:53.130]
Well, yeah, I think he knows the ropes. I think you might introduce me some well that I know something

[02:31:53.130 --> 02:31:55.070]
He ought to be at the end of one, but anyway go ahead

[02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:55.830]
second thing

[02:31:55.830 --> 02:32:01.410]
I wanted to tell Chris too. They also got the cheeseburgers at the Donald's since the 19th on Sunday also

[02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:06.030]
Now you're talking okay. Thanks. Oh listen and and Chris

[02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:07.870]
emailed me yesterday

[02:32:08.570 --> 02:32:13.010]
Which I forgot to mention and I didn't understand it was about the the anus burgers

[02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:17.050]
Uh-huh, and what were you trying to tell me if they have them in the states? Yes, sir

[02:32:17.050 --> 02:32:19.630]
We have BK BK has an angus style burger

[02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:22.810]
Well, I don't think I don't have well, we're not talking about BK

[02:32:22.810 --> 02:32:26.590]
I understand that McDonald's does not have the angus burgers in the United States

[02:32:26.590 --> 02:32:32.130]
They've test trial them in a couple places only Canada has them in a wide they're great area

[02:32:32.130 --> 02:32:36.730]
So I must have the BK BF burger and that's what I thought I was burger eight yes

[02:32:38.350 --> 02:32:43.110]
Yeah, because we were talking and I said I'd lottery they tasted like ass. Yeah

[02:32:45.450 --> 02:32:46.570]
Who's oh

[02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:48.110]
Ian's

[02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:51.670]
Yeah exactly that's what Sandy Faten said

[02:32:55.690 --> 02:32:56.050]
You

[02:32:56.050 --> 02:32:59.470]
469 on a pool. I think you're gonna make the 500 that that would be a pretty revolutionary

[02:32:59.470 --> 02:33:03.230]
That would give me a little bit of confidence that maybe there's somebody how do we do with a certificate?

[02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:08.850]
It's not too good. That doesn't surprise me because lately. I mean we have two sushi places there

[02:33:08.850 --> 02:33:15.170]
You have a vegetarian what 38 not good see we're still stuck there on 38 we sold 10 right off the bat and then we sold since then too

[02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:17.290]
Not good

[02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:24.130]
Which isn't what's isn't a reflection on the restaurant? I mean you guys are eating and the food is great

[02:33:24.130 --> 02:33:26.050]
Which the other place was the same deal

[02:33:26.610 --> 02:33:31.190]
But it's just that people are afraid of places that they don't know about and the certain types of food

[02:33:32.510 --> 02:33:36.010]
Right, I think well, I think what we ought to do is based on the colors last few days

[02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:40.770]
Get some Mongolian beef, you know some on goalie restaurant honor for Mongolian idiots

[02:33:41.890 --> 02:33:43.230]
We'd have no shortage then

[02:33:43.950 --> 02:33:45.470]
We write up this crowd's alley

[02:33:46.050 --> 02:33:47.430]
Nobody Q a.m. Hello

[02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:51.970]
You low-peasant George again, please please

[02:33:55.770 --> 02:33:57.270]
I'd forgotten all about that

[02:33:58.050 --> 02:34:01.390]
Well George is trying to get into her pants or whatever the deal is I don't know yeah, that's it

[02:34:02.030 --> 02:34:09.530]
I don't know what it is Chris hates her like poison by the way. I do not you had you don't I don't you don't like her whatever

[02:34:10.450 --> 02:34:15.130]
You know see you know you're you're one of these guys you're getting just like you're just trying to start stuff

[02:34:15.130 --> 02:34:16.610]
It's not there no, I'm not

[02:34:16.610 --> 02:34:23.130]
You know, you're just old and from a unit. It's a matter of how old the day is not a case of the matter what changes you can't stand over on the air you said

[02:34:24.810 --> 02:34:31.130]
That's what you said no, we explained the whole thing what was that they were in the middle of a personal tip when that conversation was going on

[02:34:31.130 --> 02:34:38.690]
But it doesn't matter who is tomorrow you'll forget this conversation too. Who is an elusive had a personal problem that has since been resolved correct

[02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:40.190]
And what was that?

[02:34:41.290 --> 02:34:44.290]
It's in the past don't worry about you had something going on with her no

[02:34:45.130 --> 02:34:46.950]
ha ha ha ha ha

[02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:51.070]
Oh better no where to start loving it that I know

[02:34:52.050 --> 02:34:53.670]
Brandon says the angus VK

[02:34:53.670 --> 02:34:57.850]
or VK burgers great has fried onions bacon steak sauce cheese tomato and lettuce

[02:34:57.850 --> 02:35:02.130]
And well, let me tell you the Mickey D's one is really good too. We just you went gonna get it

[02:35:02.130 --> 02:35:05.190]
Maybe just out of spite I'll go get one today. They're really good

[02:35:05.690 --> 02:35:10.410]
And they have this pastry kind of bun. It's really funky. I don't know what they call it

[02:35:11.950 --> 02:35:15.690]
Well, but I don't they have it. I know why they don't have it. They're probably because it's too good

[02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:23.970]
The fourth leader

[02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:30.210]
You know taking care of your lawn these days

[02:35:30.210 --> 02:35:36.470]
Sheer seems complicated big trucks fancy service contracts dangerous chemicals

[02:35:36.470 --> 02:35:43.910]
And I'll seem so unnecessary especially now when you can call on something as easy and natural as

[02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:50.130]
Each week the Kim dog will personally inspect your lawn

[02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:54.890]
For weeds and crabgrass he'll spray liquid formula number one

[02:35:55.910 --> 02:36:04.230]
And for those patches where grass just don't seem to grow your Kim dog will apply a special layer of formula number two

[02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:05.430]
Oh

[02:36:05.430 --> 02:36:09.310]
Watch your step. That's all natural fertilizer

[02:36:09.930 --> 02:36:13.990]
So if your lawns looking kind of shaggy unleash the Kim dog

[02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:19.650]
We may not be the best, but we sure got a leg up on the competition. Oh

[02:36:19.650 --> 02:36:19.950]
I

[02:36:26.090 --> 02:36:26.650]
Don't

[02:36:26.650 --> 02:36:33.370]
131 and 560 happy to not love those those I do love this nuggets in the past what they were well produced on right

[02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:38.470]
People who cared and they didn't all have Scott petting you a lot of me there. No

[02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:45.430]
Let's see who's this from Sean Sean who's using a new format on his page

[02:36:45.430 --> 02:36:49.870]
Dear Uncle Neil. Thanks for the swell half price deals. I'm taking my girlfriend a blue moon for birth

[02:36:49.870 --> 02:36:53.290]
They despite the fact she sends naked pictures to other guys and do a few girls

[02:36:54.070 --> 02:36:59.070]
One of the fellows reciprocated. I wasn't interested, but a bit envious brings new meaning to the term upload

[02:37:00.350 --> 02:37:01.310]
Or like updog

[02:37:01.890 --> 02:37:02.510]
smells like

[02:37:03.390 --> 02:37:07.170]
I was lucky to get some hand price certificates last time first time I tried the blue moon

[02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:10.410]
Was poison ready to keep word but they sold out in 11 seconds

[02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:12.230]
Well good luck to you Sean

[02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:15.870]
He got some last time when that's because we don't have anybody listening anymore

[02:37:24.210 --> 02:37:28.510]
Mm-hmm. It's your fault. I know it's always my fault

[02:37:29.010 --> 02:37:35.470]
You had a you had a tip with the Lucy Lopez see first you lied about it first you said you never said that and I

[02:37:35.470 --> 02:37:38.890]
No, no, no, no, I didn't say what you said I said

[02:37:39.350 --> 02:37:41.750]
You said that you didn't like when she was on here with George

[02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:46.250]
He said it's not for him and I thought I said it wasn't not for me

[02:37:47.050 --> 02:37:52.330]
Yeah, so then you came on the air and just like me like you know world war three

[02:37:52.330 --> 02:37:53.710]
No, I did not

[02:37:53.710 --> 02:37:53.770]
I

[02:37:55.350 --> 02:37:58.330]
Didn't make a world war three. I said you don't like when she's on here

[02:37:58.330 --> 02:38:01.970]
What differences make what you like and don't like we're not programming do you anyhow?

[02:38:02.290 --> 02:38:07.130]
That's at the point what what is the point you lie and make stuff up no, I do not

[02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:08.150]
I

[02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:16.230]
You'll say the same guy that called me dumb the other day. Yeah, some screaming fag yesterday whatever

[02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:17.590]
What it was today?

[02:38:18.510 --> 02:38:20.970]
I hit who is the most boring

[02:38:21.570 --> 02:38:25.190]
Sean says he's got one pull then who what makes you the sleepiest

[02:38:25.650 --> 02:38:30.590]
Well, there's several people on left-hand com who you know could be in the right hand crossover. Okay. Thanks, Sean. Yeah

[02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:31.830]
cross-dress pull

[02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:37.630]
And the great news is I mean we had some phenomenal calls today. I got it. I got to admit that

[02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:44.950]
481 votes. We got 27 minutes for only 19 vote anybody could do that even

[02:38:45.370 --> 02:38:50.030]
Cordis could do that. Well don't let me forget you keep that reminding me about making out that check. Hey, don't forget

[02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:53.930]
I don't know. I don't forget to play that bit. Oh

[02:38:53.930 --> 02:38:55.830]
Yeah, I better do that now

[02:39:00.010 --> 02:39:03.610]
And they call John John's that's what it is. I'm not gonna find that

[02:39:04.310 --> 02:39:05.350]
Like your fingertips

[02:39:21.250 --> 02:39:25.170]
You think of a million there like J.F.K.

[02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:27.570]
Could afford a better

[02:39:27.570 --> 02:39:31.630]
J.F.K. at more time

[02:39:31.630 --> 02:39:36.090]
But I know a five per cup of cheap and crappy

[02:39:36.090 --> 02:39:37.710]
Plain that close

[02:39:37.710 --> 02:39:40.350]
I got it. That my head's about the

[02:39:43.030 --> 02:39:43.710]
Now

[02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:52.910]
From what they call the Kennedy curse

[02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:56.910]
If you don't think he'll galley for the life

[02:39:56.910 --> 02:40:01.090]
Here up its only gonna get worse

[02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:04.030]
Oh

[02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:10.190]
Hey

[02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:17.930]
Oh

[02:40:17.930 --> 02:40:22.990]
If you would have been like John Smith or something like that nobody would have paid any attention to him. Yeah, nothing going right

[02:40:25.210 --> 02:40:29.650]
But nevertheless he was a part of the Kennedy claim. He didn't look like a Kennedy and a lot of people said he was

[02:40:30.130 --> 02:40:36.170]
He was kind to own asses that he was the daddy. Oh, yeah, and of course that horror Jackie. She was anybody with a lot of money man

[02:40:36.170 --> 02:40:38.010]
She was screwing their brains out. Hmm

[02:40:38.730 --> 02:40:40.330]
Horror high paid horror yet

[02:40:41.850 --> 02:40:50.810]
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama charged yesterday that US credit card companies are tricking Americans with the accepted practices and the Republican John McCain has done nothing to stop it

[02:40:51.730 --> 02:40:57.410]
Obama on a two week tour focusing on problems in the US economy held a roundtable discussion with three people who have seen their credit card debt

[02:40:57.410 --> 02:41:01.350]
Skyrocket due to relentless cycle of interest rate increases and fees

[02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:07.510]
For too long credit card companies have been using unfair and deceptive practices to trick Americans in assigning agreements

[02:41:07.510 --> 02:41:09.030]
They can't afford a bomb a set

[02:41:09.730 --> 02:41:15.730]
Americans have enough session with credit cards often using plastic in place of cash. They're spastic over plastic

[02:41:16.350 --> 02:41:22.430]
And I'm encouraged by the credit card companies to use them to buy not just big ticket items, but on every day I was like gas and groceries

[02:41:23.690 --> 02:41:27.430]
See it says not just big ticket items now gas is a big ticket item. Yes. Yeah

[02:41:29.570 --> 02:41:34.350]
As a consequence many people owe thousands of dollars in credit card then are only able to make the minimum monthly payment

[02:41:34.350 --> 02:41:43.450]
The balance in place for a long time there are some fears that the credit card debt could mushroom into a crisis in much the same way that subprime orgises have afflicted the US economy

[02:41:44.410 --> 02:41:52.390]
Companies held up for scoring at the event included Bank of America Washington mutual and GE Pearl money a credit card issued through the eyeglass vendor pearl vision

[02:41:53.130 --> 02:42:01.850]
Obama said the laws and regulations governing credit card companies have been lax and that the companies have paid millions of dollars to create favor of members of Congress to get laws written to their liking

[02:42:01.850 --> 02:42:07.710]
I think everybody out there who we said Mickey D's you had to go to see the manager next time to go to your local

[02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:09.930]
Mickey D's your neighborhood joint wherever you go and

[02:42:10.490 --> 02:42:13.730]
Tell me when you want the a-ness burger now I

[02:42:14.450 --> 02:42:15.970]
I think that's criminal

[02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:18.190]
Who yet? Yeah

[02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:23.270]
Why are they holding it back from America is it's like anti-American or something? What's that all about?

[02:42:23.370 --> 02:42:28.790]
You've gotta talk before how sometimes they'll have a special T item one of those places and they discontinue it right when you're

[02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:34.130]
Yeah, it's like that Arby's used to do it all the time really cross my ass. I hate when they do that

[02:42:34.650 --> 02:42:36.250]
That's one thing about hardies

[02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:40.190]
We pulled up to the drive-through there and you know I hadn't been to hardies in the years

[02:42:40.190 --> 02:42:42.650]
And I looked at the the menu thing there

[02:42:43.730 --> 02:42:47.090]
And sure enough there was the mushroom swiss burger yep if they went ahead

[02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:49.510]
I would I would have just backed up and hauled ass

[02:42:49.970 --> 02:42:52.750]
Got back on a Hershey highway, but they had it

[02:42:53.890 --> 02:42:58.330]
And it was de freaking delicious and it was just out there. That's right. I was really good

[02:42:58.810 --> 02:43:00.290]
God it was good like hardies

[02:43:01.490 --> 02:43:07.310]
Who now doesn't I don't know people that haven't had it people with no taste like so many of the people in South

[02:43:07.310 --> 02:43:10.630]
Photo and wrote like people listen to footsie for Christ's sake on both of them

[02:43:11.730 --> 02:43:16.550]
Duff told me that he would like to take his radio out of his car and smash it into the sidewalk just out of his

[02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:21.190]
Scust for how bad that show is and you know how mild-mannered she he generally is

[02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:23.690]

Need I tell you that the difference between the two shows were night and day depending on who's at the home

[02:50:45.170 --> 02:50:48.290]
Between what two shows your show and his show

[02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:52.650]
Oh, he ran the show and his attitude and how he interacts with

[02:50:52.650 --> 02:50:58.190]
producers and things like that and his ability to tell time and his ability to behave like a talk show

[02:50:58.190 --> 02:51:00.150]
What do you think is there any component? Huh?

[02:51:00.630 --> 02:51:03.350]
