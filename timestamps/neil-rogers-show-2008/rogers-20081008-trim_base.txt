[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.900]
For the

[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.520]
No constant grab all they could get

[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.760]
They trickled it up

[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760]
To the one percent

[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.540]
Made us fall

[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.680]
And left us for dead

[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.580]
Absolutely absolutely

[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.520]
Could this be a recession

[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400]
But at night's boiling news

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.500]
Yes

[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.380]
There's people go and concrete you won't see that on the news

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.080]
It's like the 1930s

[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.460]
Another dreams of red

[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.360]
We're just the rich and dirty

[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.760]
And a point to buy gas

[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.820]
The court reduced papers

[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.100]

Eight billion people that then in the drawer

They've got us blind

[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.580]
Now we've got it just for

[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.700]
All

[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.580]
We're in the deep depression

[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.640]
But they don't want you to know

[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.900]
For the world's richest country

[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.160]
Mr. Pression

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.280]
It blows

[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.680]
Not as much as your your street but it blows

[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.000]
George is back with us. He had break problem the other day maybe you're because you're a liberal

[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.580]
That must be it

[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.980]
You didn't see the story about how a whole bunch of in one neighborhood here in Toronto

[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.300]
Whole bunch of people who had liberal signs because the elections next Tuesday had the breaklines cut

[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.140]
I said that break. Why? Yeah, they have the breaklines cut

[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.260]
So I think it was had his breaklines cut because he's a liberal commie pinco no question

[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.200]
So here's the polls from the a various networks. We got our poll going. We'll get to that

[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.360]

Yeah, have you ever watched that I saw yeah the little graph thingy right

[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.260]
McCain was flatlining most of the time or in the there were a few times when he was above a flatline

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.920]
And of course when you look at him flatline shouldn't come as any surprise but nevertheless

[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.660]
Yeah, it's pretty much over unless they come up with some real big October surprise now

[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.180]
Some real big surprise and of course the barracuda palin she's out there

[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.040]

[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.720]
Presidential debate debate number you know something. I think they ought to cancel the third one

[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.640]
They're boring

[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:01.620]
And the aimless two came on afterward on both MSNBC and CNN they pretty much unanimously agreed that the format sucks

[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.200]
It blows even though the candidates themselves in the parties they they set it up that way

[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.980]
But oh talk about boring. Did you think it was boring? Yes, it was and was there anything new other than my friends

[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.140]

[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.960]
I really wish McKinley just lost it and come running across the stage you know they had those handheld mics

26 points boy lost 120 points real fast of its gain

[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.560]

[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:06.520]
I tried to tell you George don't invest in stocks. It's like a it's a Ponzi game Ponzi a Ponzi

[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.400]
Ponzi game

[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.340]
A gay chef murdered his lover and cut out part of his leg seasoned it with herbs and fried it mm

[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.360]
Accord has heard in England

Anthony Morley 35 chewed one of the pieces before throwing it into his kitchen bin

[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.980]
He was having a little leg

[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:29.520]
Morley a former holder of the mr. gay UK title and walked to a nearby takeaway restaurant and told the horrified staff

[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.740]

It'd been stabbed 20 times in his throat cut

[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.920]
Morley later claim mr. Oldfield to try to rape him

[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.180]
Prosecutor Andrew Stubbs

[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.780]
Worn jurors that details of the case were unpleasant at disturbing mr. Stubbs said

[00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.220]
He added and carrying out your task in this trial. You must not allow the horror of what took place to cloud your comm assessment of the evidence

[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.780]
Come you don't like us with the economy and everything like that

[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:05.780]
Come

[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.340]
He said the two-minute known each other for some years

[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.480]
Not a number not like eight years or 20 years, but some years

[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:20.780]
mr. Oldfield was openly gay gay and would work selling advertising space for a homosexual lifestyle magazine

[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.020]
Probably a normal kent's magazine no doubt

[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.260]
He was described as flirtatious promiscuous naturally outgoing and bubbly

[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.840]
Morley was less sure about his sexuality and had relationships with both men and women

[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.660]
Oh, guess what speaking of that Jimmy Cifalus is the permanent morning show host on iodino

[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.680]
We'll get to that in a minute okay, and they've got their cyber pole going and oh who do you think is going to be the next present

[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:49.120]
McCain it's that fascist iod is all they should have a swastika on their billboards if they got any

[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:56.100]

[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.240]
Anyway, this guy had won the first mr gay uk contest 93 of the mad slasher the bubbly guy

[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.140]
On the day of the murder when april the two exchange text messages during the afternoon later met in a baron leads where they both lived

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:18.380]
And the text morally told mr. Oldfield they'd never been properly happy being gay mr. Oldfield replied try me. I'm not your average poof

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.380]
Remember that song by Peter fallen Sally poof the magic dragon come right up

[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.880]
He was dragging it. Oh, and yesterday fat Chris was able to get into your thing. What were we playing yesterday

[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.820]
Kingston trio Kingston true because one of the Kingston trio the guys died. Oh

[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.480]
Yeah, and so we played over the mta we played a word have all the flowers gone

[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.400]
Pete sigger wrote that which i thought it was bob Dylan, but

[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.080]
But it was not

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:51.180]
They exchange increasingly affectionate messages these two and arranged to meet morally stressing you wanted to take it slow

[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.920]
Later that night they ended up in morally's bedroom the court her they've been drinking beer both were around three times the legal limit for driving

[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.360]
Forensic experts later found evidence there had been sexual activity. Oh

[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.260]
Mr. Stubbs said morally used two knives taken from the kitchen downstairs to kill mr. Oldfield

[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.440]
He's slid is still cutting a vein and artery in the process

[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.500]
Stabbed him with great force in the chest and 19 times in the back

[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:21.120]
The evidence indicated or feel the belong under the dovet when he was attacked from behind what is a dovet do you vete a duvet?

[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.180]
Who is it duvet? I think so

[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.080]
Dovet it's British you wouldn't be a duvet

[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.780]
oye ve

[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.700]
Dovet what what is it dovet? I don't know i'm looking it up. Oh is it like oh it's in other words

[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.540]
You're you're correcting my pronunciation, but you don't know what the hell it is

[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.400]
Yes, the duvet

[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.880]
I don't know what it's pronounced. It's like what a comforter. How does it say it's pronounced

[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.880]
He can play it

[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:57.560]
One moment please be out go ahead. I'm waiting for the player. Oh, I'm so slow there you go duvet. I told you

[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.680]
Stuff said that after Mr. Oldfield died morely cut a section of flesh from his thigh took it down the kitchen

[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:10.840]
I cooked it the jury heard that morely was wearing only a bloodstained dressing gown and flip flops when he arrived at the takeaway his face in the hands were splattered with blood

[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.440]
Oive oive

[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.500]
He later told police. I know what I've done is wrong

[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.940]
He tried to rape me at least he won't be able to do it again morely denies murder the court was told

[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.600]
He was at the very least guilty of manslaughter

[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.680]
But the jury would have to consider issues of provocation and diminished responsibility the case

[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:27.960]
Continues

[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.060]
Let me say it again the case to continue

[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.180]
Oive

[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.120]
Duvet

[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.840]
Well, that's pretty unusual for the Brits to be using a French word like that duvet. I mean it's got to be French right with an et

[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.880]
And the Mologist friendship

[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:50.140]
No kidding very good fat Chris very very read from 1758 you and Greg read

[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.400]
Okay, now let's get to some of the emails. Oh here

[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.040]
Harry G who's a real a hole and a right wing idiot

[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.720]
rights is Jimmy syphilis now officially the permanent host and w i would do the morning. Yes. I just checked their website

[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.140]
Harry thanks for the uh heads up

[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.280]
It looks like he's already got his own web page on the i.o.d website

[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.040]
Yes, he does

[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:16.040]
Jimmy said this morning can sit as himself middle class and that Obama is a socialist because he wants to take money away from people making

[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.200]
200,000 and give it to poor people and I agree

[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.060]
I agree says Harry who's a real Nazi. That's why he listens to i.o.d

[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.620]
In it's a quarter of a million first of all is the right number and secondly

[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:32.680]
It's not a question of taking you and giving it away. It's a question of increasing the taxes so that rich people pay their fair share

[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:39.620]
That's what's all about Harry but you're too stupid to understand that that's why you listen to a Nazi radio station and to a pansy like Jimmy syphilis

[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.280]
Probably the worst play by playing out in the history of the national football league but nevertheless

[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.120]
Wow, Harry, but thanks for the like I said the heads up keep your head up Harry

[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.240]
Unlike a John McCain who was wandering around and on the verge of dropping the microphone. Yeah

[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.220]
No, my friends my friend. Hey, he looks like he's like one step away from Renfield

[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.900]
It gets a good point. Yeah

[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.680]
He starts reaching out and grabbing flies and eating the menu now

[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.660]
My friends lies are my friends. Lizette says oh my god of McCain says my friends one more time

[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.440]
By the way, CNN did a great montage this morning. They showed him

[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.800]
Same my friend over and over and they flipped it all together. It was great

[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.860]
Uh, if McCain says my friends one more time. We're gonna jump off a building

[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.120]
He is so decrepit it needs to go go Obama love the show says Lizette

[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.340]
Thanks, Lizette Tony says

[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.140]
The best thing last night was the way McCain would drop the wireless mic from his awkward stiff arm and catch it with his good hand

[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:42.180]
I wonder what that seems to go at a republicans. It was Bob Dull with the gimp hand from my WWW two remember that and he had a

[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.700]
Pen stuck in the United States. I don't know why he did that

[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.700]
He explained that once it was to show to people that his hand was occupied so not to reach out and grab it

[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.480]
Because it was his right hand so people would reach out to shake his hand and he would be out to grab it his hand and

[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.260]
Maybe that's why he didn't always limp but he would always have to uh, you know

[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.740]
Reach out and intercept with his left hand

[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:07.900]
So if he had a pen in his right hand people wouldn't expect to have their hands shaken with his right hand

[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.700]
And now you're gonna have to play Bob Dull's bum hand

[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.080]
Oh, maybe I'll finish Tony's email because it's very important for Robert

[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.260]
So

[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.280]
The

[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.220]
The biggest name

[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.700]
Yes, it's a big dog

[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.560]
That was down 27 points. Oh my god

[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.820]
It's down 32 points like I said

[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.840]
The sports leader

[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.780]
This is the most disgusting program

[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.300]
I urge everyone to complain to this station

[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:45.740]
Absolutely

[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:57.660]

So

no no he was he doesn't know him ever

[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.240]
those who know him well say he was not a tight end

[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.520]
but he was a receiver

[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.800]
you putting all this together no he was just he was like an average you know

[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.100]
receiver he was okay it was a decent player i think he caught a touchdown

[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.780]
pass on one of the uh maybe in that last super bowl 84 was it against the 49ers

[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:39.300]
who the hell did they play in that year i know they lost obviously

[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.200]
when the danny was there he i was off 49ers yeah i'm pretty sure we caught a

[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.680]
touchdown pass from danny boy oh danny boy danny and jimmy and jimmy and danny

[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:52.840]
we're smelling super bowl because we're there yeah oh my god it's just it's like a

[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.820]
disease like an illness and now we got the new jerk jerk street disease that is

[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.420]
the worst one so anyway George was out yesterday i'm sure that uh

[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.400]
Chris updated you and all the inside fall to all our shenanigans with

[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.720]
clearance our first-while program director he said there was uh nothing to do

[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.300]
there was no meeting right there was no meeting he went in there prepared to like

[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:17.280]
uh really take a giant dump on clearance his head and clearance said uh

[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.760]
beast was already in here and he apologized and get out of here he's my

[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.600]
buddy's my boyfriend the beast i wonder if beast's wife knows that uh

[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.200]
there's still a clearance and beast they're still doing it

[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.280]
you think i don't know maybe she doesn't care

[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.520]
if i were her i wouldn't care i'll guarantee that of course if i were she i

[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.200]
wouldn't oh my the thought of that

[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.260]
you know there's certain people that you try to envision

[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.280]
doing hanky spanky and what i mean yeah and that pair oh the douga down

[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.160]

[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:55.280]
the worst it went south baby oh no oh now it's down only 95

[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.740]

during the tech bubble for promoting his own craft

[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.680]
from making money going on here and giving advice and then making money uh

[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.560]

[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.000]
house like a trophy you know brought it in living room and stood there very

[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.180]

could never stand still for a second he was always storming around stalking

[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.580]
around the stage that's why i thought he was going to take that mic and slam

[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.100]
a bambam up the side of the head with it what a scary side it says he looks like

[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.580]
a troll with a weird retard joker melanoma stricken smile on his

[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.480]
push my friends think make a micken saying will be the worst thing to happen

[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.500]
you say my friends if some homic vein prevails his frail half dead as well make

[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.820]
it to the spring of oh nine then palen would turn the effing wet house into a

[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.860]
giant igloo and bring that turd tide a joiner reminds me of when the Beverly

hillbilly's moved in Tony says i hope that folks he bit Sarah palen falls off the

[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.860]
face of the earth after Obama wins if i never see her again there will be too

only eat those because they taste good okay not because they're from a cow yeah well i like

[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.540]
you eat ice cream because it's from a cow yeah that's exactly what you have a big big bowl of

[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.980]
Ben and Jerry's fish food you're sitting there thinking oh that's cow's really

[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:20.080]

mark your 560 quio and Huge 4th lead

[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.520]
friends

[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:05.740]
broon

[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.300]
oh

[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.400]
oh yeah

[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:22.160]
I'm old and grumpy, but try to understand

[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:30.780]
And I have a problem, because I can use my hand

[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.660]
I only have one hand, you fare I only have one hand

[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:44.400]
I like to take my pen and stick it inside

[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:59.760]
I can't hide, I can't hide, so please vote for me

[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:07.300]
I cranky bitter old man, and if you, you'll make one of me

[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:14.100]
I'll slap you like a man, but only with my good hand

[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:21.100]
I only have one hand, I only have one hand

[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.600]
Wow, how do you like that? I found a lot classic, very proud of you

[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.900]
Vest of Near Rogers 1996 from WIOD back when it was a great radio station

[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.040]
when people to the left of Attila Baha'u actually could listen to it

[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.680]
As opposed to grumpy idiots like Harry G.H. who comes back

[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.500]
Great comeback, Harry, you're ripping me for not wanting to get more of my money to the government

[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.340]
I went to blow on a racket on drug addicts

[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.240]
Harry evidently makes a few bucks, he released claims to

[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.540]
Even though he can't get his numbers right

[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.920]
He says you're just jealous of syphilis

[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.760]
He's on a real station with a real signal, real promotion, real listeners

[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.800]
Not the psychos who listen to your station, like you Harry, huh?

[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.200]
I love when they say, oh they're only psychos who listen to your station

[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.920]
And they're writing an emailing and like that

[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.500]
Psychos like you Harry, between his show on the radio, Dophon games and TV work

[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.640]
You can reach as many multiples of your audience who have every week

[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.700]
See, I don't really care that much about how many people we reach

[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.460]
I care on the 10th and 25th of numbers on that paycheck

[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.400]
And I can guarantee you, put all of Jimmy's enterprises together

[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.100]
He ain't even in the same league with fat old...

[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.760]
Deal, God!

[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.320]
That's right Harry, so you can give me a song to dance about

[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.900]
You know, you don't want to give your money to the government

[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.040]
I'm not happy either with the way the government piece away my tax dollars

[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.700]
Of which I spend a fortune

[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.780]
But nevertheless, that's the way it works

[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.320]
That's the way it goes

[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.820]
That rather have people make insidians a dollar, pay their fair share, including me

[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.920]
As opposed to Schlepper's getting erraped

[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.280]
By the right wing, who all they know is tax, tax the poor and middle class

[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.040]
Take from the poor and give to the rich, that's the Republican party

[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.120]
And it has been that way for years and years

[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.180]
Ever since I've been alive, Harry

[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.440]
Rhymes with...

[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:55.900]
You fairy

[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.280]
Jimmy Cifalis, he's sticking up for...

[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.760]
Stick with Jimmy Cifalis, and how come you're not over there with Glenn Drek

[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.720]
And Russian out your other fellow Nazis, come on Harry, get with it

[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.760]
Birds of a feather suck together

[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.480]
Debbie says, good news for your buddy Brandon, public says he's got milk on sale

[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.480]
$3.59 a gallon

[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.940]
Like we just heard moments ago, I'm with you, milk is food for baby cows

[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.660]
Love your show, feel better, says Troy

[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.880]
Oh, I see, it says Debbie on top, but maybe Troy dresses up

[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.120]
And there's like Debbie on the weekend, you know

[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.020]
Thanks, Troy

[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.060]
I'm sure that's not our Troy

[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.140]
I don't want to steal that from a seda kid

[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.760]
You know, I'm always stealing his material

[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.720]
Yep, all the time

[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.300]
Like...

[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:36.700]
Troy!

[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.480]
This, I've gotten several copies of this, it's from Boka, from Beth Shalom Synagogue

[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.160]
Have you seen this?

[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:43.840]
No

[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.100]
Oh, and you know how the churches and the shows they have out in front they have the signage?

[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.060]
Oh, the marquees, yes, I've gotten two or three of those already

[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.200]
Yeah, I've gotten a few of these, marquee, I love this

[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.080]
Happy New Year, please vote for the Schwarzen

[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.840]
Ha ha ha ha, good plan

[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.740]
That is the best!

[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.080]
Oh!

[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.960]
Alright, let's hear it for Beth Shalom Synagogue in Boka

[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.640]
What'd you think about that?

[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.360]
Cute!

[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.540]
I'm sure Harry will be emailing some more

[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.120]
I don't know why Harry, just go away

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.100]
You don't like me, you don't like my attitude

[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.720]
And you love Jimmy Cifilis

[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.880]
I'm jealous of Jimmy Cifilis, that'll be the day

[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.160]
Oh my god, can you even imagine that?

[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:18.920]
Mm-hmm

[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:19.920]
Wow

[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.820]
Great job on those games, by the way Jimmy

[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.040]
Even Fat Chris says you're the...

[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.100]
Just an abortion on those games, isn't that what you said?

[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.240]
Sure, I don't think I did, but um...

[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:32.520]
Sure

[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.660]
But that's what you're thinking though

[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.100]
Okay

[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.700]
I don't want to put words in your mouth, correct me if I'm wrong

[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.420]
I asked you your opinion a few days ago and you said just an abortion

[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.740]
I don't think I said abortion, I said a word to you

[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.240]
I said a word to you, like a subhuman race

[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.380]
I did like Bill

[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:49.760]
Better

[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.240]
Bill Zimfer

[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:51.600]
Yes

[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.480]
Well, I mean, we'd like to make Weber better too, but I mean is there any question about that?

[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.440]
Bill Zimfer, what a funny guy he was

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.540]
Here's one from Byron from Meridian, Idaho

[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:07.060]
Oh my god, can you imagine being in Meridian, Idaho?

[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:09.780]
Well, it depends on where it is

[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.260]
Oh Brandon's gonna go buy some milk right now, well better you than us

[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.280]
I'll stick with the ice cream and the cheese and you drink the milk

[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.940]
Baby cow milk, oh my god

[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.580]
I wonder if the Muslims drink milk

[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.700]
Certainly not with the falafels

[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.140]
Why not, sounds awful?

[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.600]
Doesn't falafel have meat in it? I don't know

[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.800]
It's traff, it's not halal, baby

[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.020]
You better get your kosher and halal straightened out

[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.960]
Hey, I got it all together

[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.020]
Damn it

[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.280]
You're gonna burn in hell with all those Muslims

[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.120]
Oh yeah

[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.200]
And there won't be those seven virgins waiting for you either

[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.320]
Now who were you telling me that was a member of Prokall Herum

[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.180]
Somebody was telling me that the other day about some guy

[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.540]
It wasn't me

[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.680]
It definitely wasn't you about somebody

[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.280]
I think one of the restaurant owners said

[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.740]
Oh that's right, good old muff

[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:54.940]
How's she doing?

[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:55.980]
Haven't seen him lately

[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.740]
He was in there the other day

[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.280]
What are you talking about having seen him lately?

[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.420]
He was there couple days ago

[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.100]
I was in a world and he were yesterday

[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.000]
You were there on Monday

[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.500]
Right

[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.140]
I saw him Monday

[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.220]
And today is Wednesday

[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.920]
Brian said see I know what day of the week it is, that's good

[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.620]
I got a nasty, I better drink some tea during the break

[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.880]
I better brew me some tea

[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.300]
I got no wienies, I got no bacon even

[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.700]
Oh it covered's really bare

[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.840]
Maybe this afternoon I'll go out shopping

[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.300]
Maybe I'll find some of that briars

[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.740]
We were talking about yesterday

[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.200]
I had several emails about it

[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:29.560]
Carb

[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.620]
What's it called?

[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.240]
Carb something ice cream

[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.100]
The four grams per serving allegedly

[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.520]
Carb counter

[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.100]
Carb sabers

[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:37.640]
Carb sabers

[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.100]
I don't know

[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.360]
And they have one of the flavors

[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.320]
They have the usual, see the low carb stuff

[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.900]
It's almost always in boring flavors

[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.900]
They've got chocolate vanilla

[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.780]
But they've also got rocky roads

[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:46.740]
Oh man

[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.280]
Carb smart

[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.760]
Carb smart, that's it

[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.580]
Are you looking it up?

[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.220]
Yep

[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.360]
You're pretty quick on that pewter, that's good

[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.220]
Well I think

[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.900]
Anyway Brian says thanks for the information on Canada yesterday

[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.540]
Obama did a good job last night

[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.740]
He looked in-sounded presidential

[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.060]
One of the highlights was when Obama talked about McCain saying

[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.440]
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran

[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.860]
And destroying North Korea

[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.440]
This man McCain is very dangerous

[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.660]
I think Obama and Biden make a great team together

[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:12.920]
McCain is no friend of mine

[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.200]
Oh come on my friend

[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.140]
My friend

[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.820]
He even reminds me a little bit of

[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.620]
I'm your friend

[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.020]
You notice the key, they see the same thing

[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:20.640]
Yeah, yeah

[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.000]
A little bit different from the real one

[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.620]
I had the real one, yeah

[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.240]
Oh yeah, I think he and Prozac Ron are one of the same

[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.740]
Uh huh

[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:26.700]
I'm your friend

[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:28.440]
Yeah

[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.740]
Now let's see

[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.480]
Oh here is Frank, my best friend

[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.520]
I've been so long

[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.980]
I'll get to it next hour Frank

[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.280]
Relax

[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.480]
I'll get to all your emails

[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.240]
Neil at Neorodgers.com

[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.120]
Keep them pouring in

[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.540]
And it's better the fact that now we got that stiff competition

[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.760]
Well what hours is he on Jimmy Cifilis?

[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.460]
I will look

[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.680]
And he's continuing to do those boring political interviews like

[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.440]
A foot he was doing

[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.480]
Even Tom Juckis said it was boring

[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.700]
Oh my God

[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.840]
Although I don't think little Tommy will rip Jimmy Cifilis

[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.980]
Because of the ex-dolphin factory, you know

[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.500]
I mean look at Kimba Volkamp

[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.400]
Or there's a real broadcaster for you

[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.280]
Oh God

[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.980]
Uh what are you looking up?

[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.100]
What he works

[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.180]
What hours?

[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.680]
Come on go to the IOD website

[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.320]
It's right there, he's placed it all over

[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.660]
Not aging well either Jimmy

[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.960]
Look like hell on wheels

[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.320]
He's not a bad guy though

[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.720]
He was on my show on IOD 100 years ago

[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.560]
And then he was on there promoting the morning show on Channel 10

[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.920]
That he had for about five minutes

[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.180]
And then they invited me on their show, you know

[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.380]
Tid for tat, so to speak

[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:32.240]
I guess he works five a.m. tonight a.m.

[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.060]
Oh so he's not on opposite us

[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.820]
Oh thank God I couldn't compete with that

[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.740]
And then we lose Harry

[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.520]
We lose Harry because he's got a Jimmy Cifilis blow up dial

[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.240]
And you know what you get from a Jimmy Cifilis

[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.920]
Blow up dial what you catch from it don't you?

[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.920]
Oh no, I'm not gonna say it

[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.160]
Crotch rot

[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:50.620]
Ah

[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.240]
Larry says you think why John McCain had to walk around so much last night

[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.600]
It was because he was experiencing diaper rash

[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:56.960]
Oh

[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.400]
Maybe his bag was overflowing

[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.420]
I could have been it

[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.980]
He just kept stomping around that stage and stomping around

[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.540]
Just a grumpy old man

[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.200]
Isn't it interesting that Bob Dool thing

[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.060]
You could transpose that other than the pen in the hand

[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:11.400]
You know

[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.140]
And it's the same guy

[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.180]
And I'm looking on this 96 disc

[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.280]
There was a lot of good stuff I mean

[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:17.540]
Oh yeah

[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:18.300]
Huh?

[00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.920]
Probably can't play any of it

[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.140]
Oh I know one

[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.900]
I can play a little bit of it

[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.240]
You're

[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:24.920]
You're

[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.940]
You look like a lady

[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.760]
And that's got that nifty sound in it too

[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.080]
That

[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:34.640]
Hmm

[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.280]
Oh I'm not sure that that one's got the bleeps in it

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.060]
So why bother

[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:38.600]
It does?

[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.740]
I don't know

[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.780]
Oh yeah you know it's a trouble maker

[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.260]
Here's more of him

[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.060]
Here's more of him taking a dump

[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:47.680]
What?

[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.360]
You know what I'm just remembering that's fine

[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:51.440]
That's funny

[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.720]
That's how we did not find

[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:53.880]
Okay

[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.360]
Okay

[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:55.800]
Okay

[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.600]
Okay

[00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:58.380]
Okay

[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:58.860]
Okay

[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:00.860]
Terrorist

[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.660]
Oh Jocelyn Elders

[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.680]
I know we can't play that

[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.020]
Hi

[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.700]
This is Jocelyn Elders and I'm mad

[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.840]
Yeah well I am too

[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.740]
I'm mad we can't play that

[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.380]
It's a funny bit

[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.880]
And we can't play this

[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.460]
How much for a kiss

[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.340]
Oh no we can play that

[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.340]
I got panicky there

[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.400]
Come on

[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.600]
How much for a kiss

[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.340]
How much for a kiss

[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.760]
Could I get it for a nickel?

[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.140]
Could I get it for a quarter?

[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.240]
It costs more money than I'll be

[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:27.960]
You ferry

[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.140]
Those were the days

[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.120]
Boy it's kind of sad

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.460]
Oh and guess what else we certainly cannot play

[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:35.860]
No

[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.040]
Ho ho ho

[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.460]
Let it go

[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.880]
You're a little bit of a go

[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.640]
Yeah

[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.720]
Root I'm not just foul and distasteful

[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.700]
The dolphins are cursing

[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.660]
And man it's distraightful

[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:48.940]
Yeah

[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:50.900]
Yeah

[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.280]
Can't play that one

[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.660]
Hey do you want to run faster?

[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.520]
Job higher and make the blind see again

[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.660]
Why do you want to move like the wind?

[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.540]
So are like an eagle and raise people from the dead

[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.120]
Huh?

[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:04.920]
Yeah

[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.320]
Then there's only one few little things

[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.980]
They all move air

[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:09.660]
Jesus

[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:10.900]
Oh

[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.460]
And air in Jesus

[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.220]
Just put up their arm

[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.840]
What they'll do for your game is a miracle

[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.760]
Oh no

[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.000]
Oh wow

[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]
You're supposed to get out of it

[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.440]
What are they?

[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:24.560]
They'll hear Jesus here

[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.380]
Yeah why?

[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:26.280]

[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.620]
And just push the button man

[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.640]
The whore

[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.500]
They'll find out

[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.280]
They'll find you

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.120]
Oh Jesus

[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:36.760]
Jesus

[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.020]
Jesus

[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.020]

[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.400]
The pet and the cushion chamber is filled with aviars

[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.820]
Carefully laid it at the scene

[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.940]
So every part of your foot is always walking underwater

[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.740]
Sorry

[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.800]
Not responsible for any water chamber that turns to white

[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.640]
And come and see

[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.460]
Look for the only air Jesus cross-traitor

[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.040]
Air Jesus

[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.660]
They'll make you feel like you're born again

[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.180]
What's the biggest name?

[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.580]
The best out of you

[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:11.160]
The biggest name is the best talent

[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:16.900]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM

[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:19.420]
Miami Ford Lauderdale

[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.080]
This is the Neo Roger show

[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.840]
This is your brain

[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.720]
What solid any questions

[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.720]
It's bleed

[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.680]
Like a lady

[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.060]
Not well but it's three walk

[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.540]
Like a lady

[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.300]
Like a lady

[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.100]
Talk like a lady

[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.900]
But I got wise

[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.760]
There's a difference between the thighs

[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.540]
Oh yes there is

[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.800]
A difference between the thighs

[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.700]
Oh

[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:58.100]
You showered me with kisses

[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.660]
I thought you were my queen

[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.500]
But I noticed something funny

[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.840]
I saw the bulge in your jeans

[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.360]
She looked like a lady

[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.140]
Like a lady

[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.200]
Walked like a lady

[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.900]
Talked like a lady

[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:22.540]
But I got wise

[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.460]
There's a difference between the thighs

[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.340]
Oh yes there is

[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.500]
A difference between the thighs

[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:35.700]
You were my perfect lover

[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.240]
But how I was surprised

[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.400]
Not only do you have one

[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.480]
But you're not circumcised

[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.020]
She looked like a lady

[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.880]
Like a lady

[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.900]
Walked like a lady

[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.600]
Talked like a lady

[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:56.660]
Talked like a lady

[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.260]
But I got wise

[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.220]
There's a difference between the thighs

[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.140]
Oh yes there is

[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.480]
A difference between the thighs

[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:07.940]
Oh

[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.380]
How do you like that?

[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.080]
I like that a lot, what do you mean?

[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.880]
Oh I'm just saying those bleeps weren't the world best

[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.380]
They're in there

[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.400]
That's why I dropped a little extra double bleep

[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.280]
1103 at 560 WQM

[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.240]
Because you never bleep it too much in these days

[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.640]
You know the way things are now in 2008 not so great

[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.680]
How does that Dow do in the ill?

[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.400]
Oh boy it's down 157 points

[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.420]
Oh I've a

[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.340]
Error of Yom Kippred and I boy

[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.520]
I guess this will give a lot of people good reason to be a toning

[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.320]
At the sundown

[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.320]
Fasting

[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.700]
You can't even eat halafel on Yom Kippred

[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.200]
How awful

[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.860]
And of course Ramadan you can't eat

[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.260]
What is it during the daytime or like I don't know?

[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:54.760]
Something like that

[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.000]
150 and a half points that I was on the negative side

[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.680]
Oh

[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.960]
Falafel says somebody Jerry is meat free

[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.780]
It's made from chickpeas just like humus

[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.600]
Humus

[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.420]
Humus

[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:06.740]
Humus

[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:06.900]
Humus

[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:09.720]
Humus

[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.760]
Humus

[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.100]
Clay and Pinecrest is a guy work with his member of the same golf club

[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:14.740]
Is OJ

[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.860]
He says that OJ had a big party already pre-arranged at the club to celebrate his getting off

[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.160]
Bad luck OJ

[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.760]
The arrogance of that man is beyond belief

[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.480]
Take care of Neil says Clay and Pinecrest

[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.540]
Thanks Clay

[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.780]
What if that's Clay Aiken?

[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:30.700]
Hey Clay

[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:31.240]
You fair

[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:31.780]
Oh sorry

[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.480]
You think Clay's Aiken?

[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.600]
I'm sure he is

[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.380]
For something

[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.680]
Down 129 I keep looking at all 137

[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.800]
Oh boy

[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.840]
Back in the correct book I really do

[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.060]
I think in the long run these cuts are going to work out

[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.680]
And the plan the 700-boi is going to work out

[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.140]
Then the long run

[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.840]
So just sit tight that's what I keep telling you

[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.480]
This stuff comes back so fast

[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.160]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.300]
Just sit tight

[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.820]
That's what your broker will tell you because you get broker and broker and broker

[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.420]
It's only on paper baby

[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.980]
It's only a paper loss

[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:04.400]
That's it there's nothing

[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.180]
And I've got a whole bunch of them here but I'm really shocked that they have to debate

[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.280]
Wouldn't you think we'd have thousands of emails?

[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:10.980]
I'd imagine it

[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.520]
But we don't

[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.760]
I mean there's a few there's this small pile

[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.160]
515 votes on our poll

[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.220]
Who won last night's presidential debate

[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:23.940]
Obama 342

[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.300]
65 and a half percent

[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.520]
Didn't watch it 82

[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.920]
A draw of 40

[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.820]
McCain 30 5.7% for insane old McCain

[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.620]
And don't care 28

[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.600]
Out of 522 vote

[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.260]
Chris is going to be real disappointed if we don't make it to 800 today

[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.100]
Yep

[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.220]
Let me go back to that IOD website

[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:46.720]
Which I used to get chastised for going there because you thought I had some session with footy

[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.220]
I think footy was brilliant compared to what they got on now

[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:56.260]
So in other words Jimmy was over there auditioning on the air which I hate stations that auditioned on the air like we always do

[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.420]
Remember we had the sports bay by an air for a while?

[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:03.860]
The fat sports day and people said oh my god not that disgusting cow bitch get her off of there and they did

[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.820]
Minus 133 on the regulatory side for your Dow

[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.000]
And the S&P is down 11 and a half

[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.360]
What about the NASDAQ?

[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.700]
It'll come up

[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.060]
And they give you hour by hour what Jimmy's going to do on the show

[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.060]
Jimmy will review and share his thoughts on the days top stories and issues

[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:22.160]
From 5 to 6 in the morning that is simple

[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:29.440]
Are you concerned with what Jimmy syphilis thinks about the days issues and top stories and the debate and politics and stuff like that?

[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.020]
Totally

[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:40.080]
Pay your fair share Jimmy okay pay your taxes you bastard you cheap jocks sniffing a goofball

[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.740]
He's not a bad guy

[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.520]
He's just terrible on the air but he's not a bad guy

[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:50.360]
He was very nice to me so I shouldn't really rip him so bad except that he's just torrentous

[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:54.940]
His dolphins work is it and again the x-jock it's the same old thing we got 3 x-jocks in the booth

[00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:01.220]
I'm not knocking little dog and mad dog or big dog or weener dog but I'm just saying

[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.460]
Wouldn't it be nice to have like a real broadcaster if you're gonna have three people in the booth with that?

[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.840]
Wouldn't it make sense to you to have like a real professional broadcaster?

[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.120]
Yeah

[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.820]
Somebody like a Joe Buck or somebody like that?

[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:20.340]
Somebody who's not an x-jock somebody who didn't you know hang out in the locker room and take showers naked with other guys and slap them on the ass

[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.520]
With the towel somebody like that

[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:30.400]
Bobby says I'm one of your white female listeners just to note to let you know I have two children at the University of Central Florida in Orlando

[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.960]
The school has been getting the students to change their addresses so they can vote in November

[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.680]
There were over 40,000 students at this campus most of the schools are doing the same thing

[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.220]
There was an article in the Sunsetta of this morning that Democrats have registered over

[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.880]
360,000 voters this year compared to 190,000 Republicans as in Florida she means

[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.720]
Let's see if Florida can get it right

[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:54.400]
Well Bobby, I hope so I have my doubts. I'm pretty confident about Ohio in the election in general

[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.580]
For Obama but Florida I'd be shocked if Obama won Florida wouldn't you?

[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:04.140]
Such a red-nicky Bible thump and phony baloney racist gosh dang place

[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:09.660]
I think you will. You think Obama's gonna win Florida? I do. I think he's holding that

[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:15.120]
That's marquee about the schwarza. It's a fake. Oh yeah. Of course. What would it mean of course?

[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:19.440]
That takes all the pizzazz out of it rich pactura sent me a little bit of luck

[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.320]
You can make your own you can create your own sure. Well, never less my ass

[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.140]
It would be great if somebody had that all had to do that. I think that's funny. But nobody does

[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.280]
Well, that's the problem. That's America for you everybody's a coward

[00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.640]
Everybody's a spineless jellyfish like Joyce and jolly joebell

[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.180]
That's why I'm delighted that Bob Dole's got that bum hand

[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:45.760]
Because it made me get this discount. Here's one called sergeant dildo

[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:51.580]
I'm sure we can't play that. Oh the clap. I bet we can play that

[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.780]
Yeah. The clapper?

[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.980]
First there was the club. They had the auto theft device that locked under your car steering wheel

[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.060]
But now there's an even better theft deterrent introducing the clap

[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:06.260]
The clap is the only automobile security system that protects your car by contaminating it

[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.180]
With a highly contagious and disgusting sexually transmitted disease

[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:13.220]
Properly applied to your steering wheel that clap discourages even the most determined fees

[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.200]
Hey, Charlie, look at that hot little convertible

[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.960]
Yeah, let's take a very spin. Oh, check out the sticker on the window, which is safe

[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:25.040]
This guy has the clap. Uh-oh, we better forget it. You said it. I stole a car with the clap a couple of months ago to still hurt when I beat

[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:30.060]
What a make sure nobody messes with you then get the clap and you might want to get a shot of penicillin while you're at it

[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.880]
But the better one, which is on the same disc was first there was the club

[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.040]
The anti theft device that locks to the steering wheel of your car then there was the cap

[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.800]
The anti theft device that prevents thieves from picking your airbags

[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:45.980]
Now there's the ultimate instinct of the art theft protection introducing the clap

[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:51.440]
Two and a half pounds of steaming human excrement that plots neatly to the front seat of all domestic and most foreign vehicles

[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.700]
Properly installed the clap deterrents even though it's determined fee

[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.100]
Hey, nice guy. They left it door unlocked

[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.860]
Let's take this for a little spin

[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.860]
Oh my god someone took a dump on the front seat and he's disgusting. I'm moving on to the next car

[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:12.620]
One roof of the crap and fees will move on to one other car that doesn't have a steaming pile of human excrement on the front seat

[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:17.940]
We guarantee it. Order the crap for your car today and anyone who tries to steal your car will be in teeth

[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:26.420]
Well, you know, yeah, we know crap Polar. Here's one perfect for a Sarah trailer trash woman

[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:33.900]
Can we take this? I don't know, don't remember it. Oh, I'm positive. I think

[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:40.140]
Her breath smells like bio she's got crust in her eye

[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.420]
She smells like a urinal that attracts lots of flies

[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:50.680]
When she sits on the porch she picks the scab underneath

[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:58.860]
Her teeth are brown when she smiles she's a trailer trash woman for me

[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:05.360]
Oh, right. She has lies up above. She's got crabs down beneath

[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.680]
I called a trailer and woke the family

[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:15.120]
Her father's her brother her uncle's her grapese

[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:22.120]
But I don't care she's the trailer trash woman for me

[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:30.660]
Oh, she never bathes herself

[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:40.400]
She looks like a smile her nose is running so slide

[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.600]
Oh, her hairy gun hangs out

[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:55.200]
She has twelfth teeth she has sweaty behind

[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.700]
Racco

[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.920]
She wipes her mouth on a shirt when she's eating

[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:07.240]
She stings at the time of the month that she's bleeding

[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:12.220]
She has a hairier chest and blue from taxi

[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:20.060]
I can't put this love on the shelf she's the trailer trash woman for me

[00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.840]
That's a loopy girl

[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.260]
You know, I mean this from the bottom of my heart

[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:25.920]
No one is as special as you to me

[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.240]
That's why you are my trailer trash woman indeed

[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.240]
You're fairer

[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.920]
Now what's wrong with that? There was nothing wrong really

[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.460]
Nothing at all

[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.780]
We need to start dubbing a bunch of these into the DCS

[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.180]
Alright, that's it. Hey, how's it going?

[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.980]
I thought that was a fine

[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:44.540]
That was perfect for Sarah

[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:46.040]
Okay, but weak

[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.340]
He's pounding around with terrorists

[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:50.840]
He's hanging around with terrorists

[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.260]
Yep, yep, I saw him

[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:54.840]
I'm a hockey mom from Alaska

[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:56.180]
You betcha

[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:59.520]
Oh Jim, in Getsville, New York

[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.460]
I thought Jim was a pretty good emailer until today

[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.360]
But Jim is trying to tell us the same thing that's so many of the collars and emails he's wanting to tell us

[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.020]
I have no life

[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.100]
Hey Neal, you're going to the bus, Bill's Dauffins game in Toronto

[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.060]
Or are you going to spend that Sunday at the track?

[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.040]
Well, let me check my personal secretary and get back to you, Jim

[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:20.760]
The biggest name

[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.820]
The God, Get a Life

[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.500]
The sports radio 560 QAM

[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.420]
The sports leader

[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.580]
Something such a sports leader

[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:32.580]
Excellent

[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.760]
Oh no, I can't believe you did that

[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.780]
Oh, sorry

[00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.240]
Raspberry from George

[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.240]
Yellow

[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.100]
Well, they say you're a little free

[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.800]
I think it was a poison game

[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.760]
I can't until I'm almost in a coma

[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:06.340]
How I eat my amy

[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.620]
And they never ever use any sunscreen

[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.980]
Sun with me, tan with me

[00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:13.240]
Hope you don't mind I'm a little fructal

[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.520]
If I'm innocent till we get melanoma

[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:17.700]
We date like a bun you can sell the aroma

[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.180]
Our lights are all on but there's nobody more

[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.180]
Hey Melon, no why

[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.400]
I spend all day at work planning

[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.020]
That when I get off on go tanning

[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.880]
I get naked and fake fake it

[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.280]
How much longer is my skin gonna take it?

[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:36.840]
My astrologist and your neurologist have to help me find the dermatologist

[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.880]
Bum bum bum bum bum brin

[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.240]
Bum bum bum bum brin

[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.180]
I am the sun till we get melanoma

[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.460]
We date like a bun you can sell the aroma

[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:48.320]
Our lights are all on but there's nobody more

[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.800]
Hey Melon, no why

[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.640]
We lie in the sun till we get melanoma

[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.880]
We date like a bun you can smell the aroma

[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.260]
We got lots on our skin bigger than the metronoma

[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.220]
Hey Melon, no why

[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.080]
We don't care if we get melanoma

[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.280]
We got the best tan from here to Arizona

[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.260]
We're glad we don't have genital congeloma

[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:09.760]
Hey Melon, no why

[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.260]
So, love an 19 to 560 WQAM

[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.440]
Johnny Ola says McCain will win Florida

[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.860]
and North Florida will do it for him

[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.400]
All them ridden eggs up there

[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.360]
I don't know

[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.180]
Maybe Dave County will do it for him

[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.400]
Cause Dave County is really

[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.040]
Thank you Dave

[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.360]
Dear people George

[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.620]
Hey sorry about that

[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:30.380]
Green tooth

[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:30.900]
Gamonista

[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:35.800]
The polls indicate that Elizabeth Litty Dool may well lose her Senate seat November 4

[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.260]
She and Bob may be able to have a tour of retirement together

[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.020]
Says Greg

[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.420]
Thanks Greg

[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.040]
And there's an article here from the Salisbury North Carolina Post

[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.340]
You know where that is Salisbury?

[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.580]
Not really no

[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:51.120]
You don't know much about North Carolina except that you got that house up in the Goyle

[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:51.980]
You got a map memorized

[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.560]
I know my area

[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:57.320]
What do we need a map memorized?

[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.940]
I don't have the map of North Carolina memorized I know my area

[00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:04.060]
I know all about Boone and Blown Rock and the North and Hickory

[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.840]
Jefferson West Jefferson

[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.340]
Oh, now for Wilson

[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.200]
I know about Albany and Skatecate

[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.380]
I know about Kingston and Asher Wab

[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:18.780]
I know about Two Egg

[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.900]
I know about Florida

[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.260]
I've been through Two Egg

[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.340]
You ever drive through that stoplight?

[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.400]
Maybe

[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.500]
That's Two Egg

[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.940]
I might have blinked and missed it

[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:30.880]
Recent polls suggest that Elizabeth Dool, the incumbent senator and Salisbury Native

[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.160]
is in for the political fight of her life as she seeks reelection this year

[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.320]
She's in of tourists

[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.760]
Real clear politics average results of all polls for September and found Dool's Democratic opponent

[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.920]
State Senator K. Hagen of Greensboro leading very slightly

[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.760]
44.3% to 43.5

[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.100]
In statistical terms that's dead even

[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.760]
Rashmason reports an independent pollster which has followed the US Senate raised North Carolina

[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.540]
puts Hagen three points ahead of Dool 48 to 45

[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.660]
Most political analysts have moved the US Senate race in North Carolina from a state

[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.760]
leaning toward the Republican Dool to a toss up as in toss up some months

[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:08.700]
Wow

[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.860]
It's never comfortable for an incumbent to be trailing this late in the campaign

[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.720]
Rashmason reports that on this website

[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.560]
And of course North Carolina the presidential race is even Stephen 49 each

[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:26.720]
Oh boy poor old John McCain

[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.520]
No wonder he's so grumpy you know

[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:29.880]
Wow

[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.800]
Life isn't fair

[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.340]
Yeah

[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.500]
I see a lot of similarities between him and old Bob Dool

[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.580]
Crotchety, limp

[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.580]
But nevertheless

[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.780]
I mean look at look at the candidates that we've had in our lifetime Michael Dukaka

[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.160]
Scary John Kerry aka Herman Munster

[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.300]
Dick Nixon

[01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:56.740]
Wow

[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.420]
Damn Koyle

[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.720]
The hockey mom from Alaska

[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:06.880]
You betcha

[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.820]
And you wonder why the

[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.360]
Everything's going to hell in the handbag I don't wonder

[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:18.880]
And then they put this damn gambling addicted phony fat fart build Bennett on there on CNN to pontificate about all this other crap

[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.820]
Who the hell is he?

[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.740]
Who the hell are you Bill Bennett besides a big fat gambling addicted piece of turd?

[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.400]
God

[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.960]
I wouldn't be surprised one day if I run in him it would buy him I'd like to run over him in the parking lot of woodbine

[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.840]
I would do serious damage to my beautiful Corvette

[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.240]
How is the market's doing?

[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.940]
Let me get over to a real network here and get off this damn CNN

[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.000]
Let's see oil

[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.920]
That was down E5 not that so bad huh?

[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.760]
The Toronto Stock Exchange is down 151 oh boy that's going to be have a minus in front of that number pretty soon

[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.980]
They're really hurting for a certain and of course the election here's next Tuesday

[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.580]
That Nazi that fascist Stephen Harper is going to get in again but probably again a minority government

[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:12.260]
Don't ask me what these people are thinking of course that's that's in the you know the outlying areas like in Saskatchewan like in Moose John

[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:20.100]
Places like that Alberta red necks oil is down to 86 bucks a barrel

[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:24.080]
Woo let's go out and buy some let's buy some milk at public in some oil

[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:32.840]
And the Canadian loony is under 90 cents for the first time I can remember 89.36 all right and the euro 136 let's go out and spend a whole bunch of money

[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.320]
I'm going to do a Jim Kramer in reverse course I have that tremendous power of QAM

[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.620]
I mean that hairy guy who was right about one thing at least syphilis is on a signal that somebody can hear we're on W

[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:45.880]
Hey M

[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.060]
Wow it's okay we're doing okay

[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.100]
You realize that a week from Friday you know what's coming out?

[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.980]
The book the book the good book says it better be a good book

[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:04.540]
Better be really good or George is going to be really on the hot seat hot seat

[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.420]
Yeah you're going to be on the hot seat on the turl it

[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.060]
You know they have those heated don't they have heated the toilet seats I'm sure they do

[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.120]
Well that's somebody somebody who's going to crank your stuff to the front and to fry your ass

[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.140]
Mark says yesterday I got a phone call from the Republican Party

[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:26.600]
The representatives asked me if I'd consider voting for John McCain all of my voters still going to a bomb a bite

[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.980]
Now let her speak a bit and at no time did she mention Sarah Palin

[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.120]
When she was done I let her know that I can't see myself voting for a war mug

[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.860]
There's got one foot in the grave and a functionally illiterate neo Nazi running mate

[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:42.160]
The representatives slammed the phone down and in the call nice go on Mark you go Mark

[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.100]
Sarah the hockey mom I mean she's a prop I thought the baby was a prop she's a prop

[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.120]
That's what she is

[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:57.920]
Just a fool all you all you hockey moms in Joe six pack

[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.480]
That you know that that's what I understand they've already got the red next wrapped up I'm sure that right

[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:10.260]
Oh yeah no question New York Times column by marine doubt mud pies for that one

[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.920]
I better send that to all I got to send that check out to your buddy Cortis

[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:25.180]
I'll do it I'll do it for sure today because I'm gonna like slab slather some vicks on my neck you know

[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.780]
Maybe drink some tea too but I doubt it

[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.520]
Just just to just to be nasty mud pies for that one

[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:39.140]
Marine doubt should I read your column I don't want to read any columns it's too much too hard on my voice it's long too

[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.800]
But it'll be on our website tomorrow

[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:48.500]
Who voted against it that one that one what a condescending miserable old and you know something

[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:53.680]
What what he does stuff like that when he starts doing his negative attack crap yeah and you watch that graph

[01:05:53.680 --> 01:06:00.180]
Oh yeah it goes in the negative it goes on the right it the flat lining isn't bad enough it goes in the minus

[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:05.220]
Kind of like the markets kind of like his numbers are gonna be in many states in the minus

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.520]
Poor insane McCain

[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:17.140]
That was down 33 points not not consequential it is consequential though the loony is under 90 cent I like that 89 cent

[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.020]
Are you happy I can go out and spend some some money oh yeah

[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:30.380]
Give me 11% of my money that hairy guy by the way never he never responded to my vitriolic attack

[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:35.540]
And rightfully so what's his comeback maybe you know maybe he's busy with his Jimmy syphilis blow up doll

[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:37.480]
Who are you kidding hairy huh?

[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:43.920]
I pay a crap load you think I'm happy about all the money I pay in taxes to these grave robbing bastards

[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:48.880]
He's right way in lunatics these neocons, but that's the law hairy that's the way it is

[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.760]
And if you don't like it they're gonna come and take your ass away and put you in there with OJ

[01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:03.000]
Oh that would be a good match don't you think OJ hairy and Jimmy syphilis together behind bars

[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:11.940]
Oh I think Jimmy might enjoy it the sports leader beware of exploding balls

[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:25.860]
There is a child living down in Mexico who has to go to work every day

[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:38.140]
Sit at his desk making clothes for Kathie Lee loves the work but doesn't love the pain

[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:50.260]
You're fair they are the kids who make the clothing they are the ones to make a bucket of days so quick complaining

[01:07:52.080 --> 01:08:02.620]
It's just clothes to make it look like you love to buy it's true they make a bucket of day with Kathie Lee

[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:10.580]
All right one of my least favorite people Kathie Lee what can she sing she got town

[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:18.000]
No, there's Joe Biden he ain't no Sarah Palem thank God

[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.920]
This is Tampa

[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:32.620]
This election in the words of folks I grew up in my neighborhood is literally about dignity and respect

[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:44.080]
The respect American people deserve is simply if you got a scuttle side cut through everything from our perspective it's about fairness

[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:51.840]
That's right Harry you better get right down to what Harry is a busy he's probably on his way to the IOD studios now catches a noon date with Jimmy

[01:08:53.780 --> 01:09:01.740]
That was down in mere 33 points what's not to like huh I mean it may never go up again but at least we'll try to keep the losses in double digits

[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:12.840]
Is that okay fine that's fine Jason who's a chronic but a good emailer usually says did you see all the notes McCain took with his sharpie

[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.420]
Yeah in fact before he had even sat down did you notice at the very beginning of the debate

[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:26.500]
Huh at the very beginning of last night's debate you know they went back to their chairs to sit down you know and that awkward

[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:36.120]
Stodgy format of this horrible debate and he was already making using his sharpie to make squiggly notes on that the thing was a preola

[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:51.380]
He was probably writing Tom Broca that's the name of the moderator Tom Broca I mean just what what are you going to be writing notes about when he just came out and the shook hands with the end of what he shows very clearly his personal contempt for Obama

[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:58.320]
In fact who they even will flip screen said that which usually he keeps his opinions except about Israel to himself you know

[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:04.420]
Said it was very clear that he had great contempt for Senator Obama

[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.040]
Yes, yeah you very

[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:15.800]
Michael says I was thinking about what you were saying about all these jocks and jocks nifers like Jimmy syphilis being right wingers wanting to look more mature or something

[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.780]
I think it was a little bit deeper Michael says I think they also think of a life as a series of ball games

[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:29.620]
Like wars for example who won the war who lost the war did we run the ball or throw a couple of bombs etc all of which

[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:40.740]
Could be just like the games they watched no participating if they don't participate in the war I think most adults know that the only way to win a war is not to have one in other words to win the diplomacy

[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:47.060]
Which is why watching McCain last night saying that he would win the war and Obama would withdraw and disgrace the laws was absolute insanity

[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:55.060]
Well of course that's a long question nobody he wants to ask what does winning the war in Iraq mean how what what constitutes winning the war

[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:02.120]
Can anybody answer that question when we own all the oil oh okay

[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:08.380]
Which we should have come and said to expect in sandy from the butchers use our military like pawns on a chess board

[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:12.500]
Which McCain should know even better since he was in the military and was essentially used in that manner

[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:17.920]
But of course war is relatively easy when you're pushing buttons in a plane at 30,000 feet until you crash

[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:22.040]
But I digress as Michael so politics war etc

[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:28.980]
It's just entertainment for these overgrown children because all they know is when's the big game who is playing what's the game plan who won who lost

[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:36.220]
Well, you're wrong Michael it's the macho thing we kick their ass that's that's what it's all about you got to be right wing

[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:45.020]
Because Democrats are you know lily livid pansy companies to you know weak weak you have to portray that strength of a jock

[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:50.960]
Even though of course you spent years and years taking showers together naked with other guys and God

[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:56.000]
We know is doing what else in that locker room you know what what they say what happens in the last days in locker room

[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.860]
But I heard on this station hill yeah that's right that's what some of our ex jock might be telling you just like the same ones

[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.860]
Who can't keep their political opinions of themselves even though this is supposed to be a sports station 20 hours a day but it's not

[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:16.840]
Thank God for this show we're surrounded by so much right winged Pablo such kaka

[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:19.380]
God

[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:29.000]
How is Chris do I have to pull I don't think you're gonna make no 800 votes today probably not you only got 585 and this is on the debate last night my God

[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.140]
We got 586 now yeah heavy heavy duty baby

[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.160]
Oh here's something to help your cold from somebody whenever I feel the cold coming on to a sore throat I take zycam

[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:49.260]
It comes in either a nasal swab swab or some funky tasting Schmidt that you mix into a drink I go with a swab it's easy and doesn't taste like crap

[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.560]
Zycam works I felt the cold coming on this past Monday I began using the zycam and my cold is practically gone

[01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:03.680]
Drink liquids to and you'll be better in no time have soup for something at wood buying oh no eating at wood buying I think that's what made me sick

[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:13.400]
Was my dinner with Hank's air tonight Lord my resistance the food there oh there's only one word to describe it F-E-H-F-E

[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.800]
You can't complain about the food at wood buying because they don't have any all the upstairs the macaroni and cheese is good

[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.100]
On the trackside level upstairs

[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:31.820]
Yeah macaroni and cheese I think I got some good sandwiches and some soup maybe I'll go to wood buying have some soup for two three thousand

[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:38.740]
I don't want to push my luck I lost yesterday I'm not going back today I ended my lengthy winning streak yesterday

[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.560]
That was down 147

[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:49.460]
Cecilia says I haven't heard the buffalo bills bit in a while the one where he calls asking for plastic I just played it yesterday

[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:59.720]
Calling asking for plastic surgery I heard draft from a constantly would love if you could play it just once I played it yesterday did I not Chris yep

[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.140]
Yep

[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:05.300]
You should be any able to play anything in your library of bits because they couldn't be well

[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:14.220]
They couldn't be as obscene as a man talking with fat juicy ferret turds in his mouth

[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:21.120]
Nothing worse than a man a mouthful of fat juicy turds if you can't play the buffalo bills up the butt song

[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:30.620]
Would also help me out to get out of here Cecilia take a hike honey I just played yesterday she wants me to play it again

[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:35.100]
Oh and the brand is as I can vouch for a Xi cam I took the up hills it was very helpful

[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:41.680]
You ever taken you ever hear of it I never heard of it Xi cam yeah I see the ads for it but no I haven't taken it

[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.120]
There's a drug that George hasn't taken yet oh that's here something with them

[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.060]
Well let me see I doubt that I'll be able to find it

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:59.980]
Where will I find it Nicole remedy a section in my local pharmacy probably right next to the pink grapefruit splash soft so body wash

[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:07.700]
I was thinking about that when I was taking a shower yesterday morning with my fabulous I've got that pomegranate and whatever the other one is

[01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:16.260]
With some other fruit mm-hmm. It's good stuff. It's key we got the huh key we no it's but it's got the scrubbing things

[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:23.140]
Oh nodules the nodules like just like the tangering one or whatever the other stuff is what's the other one we use?

[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.480]
Apricot oh yeah it's got the same scrubbing a nodule and I was thinking to myself these guys that are like

[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.820]
It's the same thing what we were talking about only moments ago

[01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:43.800]
You got to be my show that's that's only for pansies body wash yeah sure it's like saying real men don't wear shoes you know

[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:55.400]
They go out there and they they barefooted remember Robert Parker and barefoot and sure barefoot how much any K would be playing that on the show if he was still on the air

[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:03.360]
But he got screwed badly he got really screwed in tattooed by jolly jovelle and in the hump of the there's Robert Parker maybe his barefoot

[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:09.660]
That's a real man. Go on and step on that glass and break your ass everybody get on your feet what a talk

[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.900]
You make me nervous when you're in your seat

[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.280]
Yeah, take off your shoes and pat your feet

[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:23.340]
We're doing a dance that can be we we barefoot and how come you can say we barefoot and that sounds illiterate to me

[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:28.960]
It does because it's music you have artistic life. Oh, I see we do a touch up. We be we be pretty good

[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.080]
That's right Chuck says you know it's after the debate Obama's wife stayed much longer to meet with the town hall audience

[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.600]
McCain stayed very little and left fast maybe we can't had a turn in because it was past his bedtime

[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.280]
Spread them and say chief

[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:00.280]
Well, I bought some new potato chips cuz ain't got any fat

[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:08.340]
But now we're after I didn't in the job I said I knew they had some side of fix but I thought I'd take a chance

[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:12.400]
But right after I swallowed them I felt my colon dance

[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:20.040]
Ain't oh let's try my valve he gets a seize now I'm in the careless grottin with my pants around my knees

[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:27.980]
I'm afraid to sneeze because of my feels up and disgusting running down my knees

[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:35.720]
Oh, I should have seen that morning that they put on the bag and I should have been suspicious when the clerk gave me a rag

[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:44.020]
So if you eat them don't be surprised if your belly hurts and in about an hour you'll have the elicitor's squirts

[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:47.240]
Ain't oh let's try my valve begin to see

[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.020]
I'm in the careless grottin with my pants around my knees

[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:59.060]
Ain't oh let's try now I'm afraid to sneeze because of my feels up and disgusting running down my knees

[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:04.440]
You fell all right, but I'm screaming these during the break just to make sure good plan

[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.620]
Now that was one that you would have thought maybe there was like a few homes

[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:13.340]
Yes, but but there were not there was a clean execution. It was kosher for your own kipper. Let me tell you right now

[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:19.440]
Because the last thing we want to do is be playing like unapproved sounds right Joyce would have a nervous Schmidt about

[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:24.300]
600 one votes on Chris's pole good old fat Chris

[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:30.620]
He's gonna be with us on Friday by the way because flea couldn't do it correct flea was good yesterday

[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:36.380]
It was pretty good. You know he's from Tampa didn't know that George. He might have mentioned it but I forgot the vows down 203 points

[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:37.940]
I beg your pardon

[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.320]
I said I think I forgot he might have mentioned it but I forgot

[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:49.020]
He's from Tampa. I thought he was like a New York Jewie kind of guy. He's a Tampa Jew. No wonder we got out

[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.280]
They probably tried to litch his ass and temple terrorists

[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:59.720]
Who one Tuesday's presidential debate that's our poll question on neo-rogers.com don't forget nil at neo-rogers.com is our email address

[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:07.040]
And there's nothing in there. Oh, yeah, there is one Scott G says you might want to add this to your website if it's not already there the real John McCain

[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:14.260]
He's got a link. I don't have time to appreciate these but I don't have time to show to a link with the links. You know what I mean?

[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:22.560]
Also, so I came as a scam and they pay fines to the FDA for misleading advertising in other words it doesn't do a thing except empty your wallet.

[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:36.800]
It says Scott. Well Brandon says it works and Scott said, feh

[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:39.020]
Water

[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:44.960]
Who want try like I'm going to start fasting at the sundown you would you out of the kid me

[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.420]
These people who are

[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:55.800]
Manipulated by their religious upbringing and who observe these ridiculous insane things

[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:06.080]
I have one question. You know what the question is? Why would anybody over the age of 10 fast

[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:15.740]
Stop eating because it's a certain day of the year whether it's Ramadan you're on Kipper. Well, whatever the hell it is. Good Friday. Well, what are you doing? Good Friday? You can't eat meat is that the

[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:22.100]
Used to be you couldn't eat meat on Fridays at all you Catholics right God changes his mind. You know he doesn't God said oh meat's delicious

[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.200]
Go on with the famous burgers at Mickey D's with bacon and cheddar

[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:35.180]
God keeps changing his mind. Oh God. Who want to this presidential debate? 608? What's our goal? 610?

[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:46.180]
No, 610 that's the homo Jimmy syphilis who's now the permanent morning guy on there until they can't his ass till I'm W I O D. Oh I hate that station.

[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:58.840]
Obama 394 64.8% say he wanted a bait not nearly as high as the CNN people 82% of the CNN polls said he went and what was the CBS?

[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:15.240]
No, CNN was 79% and CBS was 84% give it to Obama didn't watch it 93 a draw 51 didn't don't care 35 and McCain 35. He's tied with don't care 5.7%.

[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:26.880]
So that's pretty close Obama 65% McCain 5.7% that's pretty tight not out of 611. Well, they just call the whole thing off. Okay before Carl Rove and the

[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:35.480]
Neocons figure out some way to fix it. So we still got almost four weeks to go. Four weeks from yesterday's the election. Well, you'd be glad to get it over. Sure.

[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:44.600]
And I'll listen to Obama. Mike. It like as many as 353 electoral votes which would be a glanslide. Oh, wouldn't that be sweet? Yep, they can't steal it if it's that lot of lopsided.

[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:54.880]
Frank says I don't think he their candidates stood out from the other, but both just kept rereading their talking points. Really coming close to answering a question that was asked for

[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:05.900]
for Schmitz and giggles. For a fun and games after the debate I decided to play channel hockey with MSNBC and Fox News. I don't watch Fox News. Frank ever, ever, ever.

[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:16.880]
Because I'm not a masochist. It's amazing the contrast between the two as Fox with Sean Hannity was overwhelming. We stayed in McCain won the debate. And MSNBC with Keith Obramon was stating Obama clearly won.

[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:23.680]
Personally, I believe it was closer to withdraw, but the contrasting points of view from so called media sources was unbelievable is what it was.

[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.680]
Unbelievable. There's the sirens again. They're coming to get us here. I hear. Oh boy.

[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:39.900]
It certainly proved positive. The news isn't about the fact it's more about the spin. The scary thing was that Fox had a call up poll on who won the debate.

[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:52.020]
The result was 89% or 80 something percent. I can't read it for McCain and 12% for Obama. I am for Obama, but I can't even say Obama won. But certainly McCain didn't say anything either. It was boring. Frank was very boring.

[01:22:52.840 --> 01:23:07.420]
One more thing. What the hell is wrong with Sean Hannity doesn't even bother to research facts. He so held that on disparaging Obama. He continues to insist that Obama voted to raise taxes of million times and already been researched. There's another ambulance. Oh, you hear those and another one.

[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:22.960]
Whoa. Something bad is going on. Not one of them. And many of these votes were just repeat for it. Just then he said on this bill. He was talking about how you wouldn't sit on the board with a guy who bombed the Pentagon.

[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:33.740]
Basically, insisting that bill is actually bombed the Pentagon. When was this not to mention that when Bill Harris was talking like a terrorist, Obama was eight years old. That's correct. Frank. He was eight years old when he was

[01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:03.720]
consulting with terrorists, paling around with terrorists. Anyone who pays any credence to anything, Sean Hannity has to say is complete total, total,

[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:24.280]
Oh, I guarantee he drops plenty of stool next to Joe Bell's chair. If I were you, I'd go drop some stool on his chair right now. A big, steamy pile. The loud mouth and loose lip pale and I was an apology to Obama over this one, Margot Howard writes.

[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:53.720]
He has a column on Yahoo. And she went into the family business. Her mother was and landers in the 90s as dear prudence. How do you like that? You heard her? I've heard of patients and prudence tonight. You belong to me on Liberty Records. Do we play that not that long ago? I think we did that tonight. You belong to me. Patients and prudence. That was a label ahead some silly stuff like we would stock your David.

[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:23.040]
I do that. What? I'm scratching with some. I came. I really thought I was done talking about Sarah Paley and Margot says, but life is what happens when you're making other plans. I wish there were a word that was across between a Paul and nauseated because that's what the ladies latest outburst has me feeling.

[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:53.020]
Saturday evening, Drudge picked up a Breitbart story where the headline was, palences Obama palen around with terrorists. As if this weren't bad enough, she went on to tell whatever group she was addressing. This isn't the man who sees America as UC American, as I see America. Well, I'll tell you what I see. A loud mouth loose lip nobody, whose drunk on media attention and a court low in the judgment department. I think both she and her agent Maverick buddy, oh, Mr. Obama apology for this one. To live on the same street and who have served on a board with Billy Ears, partly whether underground when Obama was in grade school and who is now a pro.

[01:25:53.040 --> 01:26:23.020]
Professor is not my idea of paling around with. I think this hockey mom at Muskin or fits perfectly into the class where she's helping perpetuate, even though she has no class. It would have been far more factual validity for Obama or a surrogate to publicize the fact that track the kid who joined the army did so because the judge told him it was that or jail due to his dealing drugs. I have a strong hunch. However, the Obama people would never get into that up until not ladies annoyed me because of her ignorance and arrogance, but now I'm furious, especially when her headline making remark from yesterday was that Obama was not fit to be

[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:51.460]
a commander in chief. I think the McCain people better lock the lady up and tell her to zip it because she isn't even fit to Ed Lib says Margo you go Margo. She's the pitful she's the barracuda the attack dog. She's the one that's out there making up crap. It's viewing it because she has no she has no scruples whatsoever. She'll say anything. That's her task. Track.

[01:26:53.020 --> 01:27:11.820]
I wonder how that little baby is doing. I think the baby is doing well bouncing markets down 140 points. Unemployment rate hit 6.1% in September. Oh boy. All bad news, man. Bad bad news. Oh, I got that. Doug Thompson. Call them the pain of being McCain. That's come.

[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:39.960]
The biggest name. The biggest name. The best talent. You're listening to sports radio 560 WQ AM. I am a for the other day. Where are you? It'd be the 12 to 1 hour on WQ a.m. Well, I've never thought I'd find the gun no ride that I think

[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:55.700]
the round is today. The right. It's a classic set of wheels fixed up the way a brother would like it. Now we've been beaten in China and the dream is cold and it dies to the mercy. I've got some kind of liquid. Jerry.

[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.020]
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.420]
Oh, baby.

[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.140]
China. Little, little, little, little, little. She. Princess.

[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:20.360]
Now. So I've bounced down the road in a big, dead, super bowing. Now in the office. Don't think he knows a day of getting around the beach in the breaks.

[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:28.960]
I'm 1979. My own boat, Catalina. She's your looking part. Now he's my baby, Cadillac.

[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.780]
Oh, baby.

[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:37.440]
Call them the cradon of Jerry and be beaten in the dark, baby.

[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:41.180]
Chinese, they will live in the space of this.

[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.180]
Yo.

[01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:13.270]
I've got my windows down. Now, now, I've so heard it because they hazy don't want to play.

[01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:19.610]
This way the freshman lawsuit starts to smell and gets the dusty look at over time.

[01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:27.870]
From a vaccine you find a shiny granite smell like lime, thanks my coffee, giant it too, because I've been washing it with all the road.

[01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:29.790]
Oh, baby.

[01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:42.730]
Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

[01:29:43.930 --> 01:29:47.310]
First for Lauren. You'll be back to be baby.

[01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:49.670]
Stop, baby.

[01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:57.130]
Hello to a 560 WQ I am. It's a Wednesday in the big city.

[01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:04.810]
Chris and four Lauderdale says I'm so tired of John McKin acting like this general portrays character is the second coming of Sun Sioux.

[01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:07.610]
Who that was Sun Sioux?

[01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:10.450]
Ancient Chinese guy.

[01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:12.770]
Ancient Chinese secret wrote the art of war.

[01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:18.110]
No, McCain never misses an opportunity to go over the surge like it was the most brilliant military strategy of all time.

[01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:25.890]
Really? When an occupation with other sovereign nations is going poorly, isn't it really a stroke of genius to send another 20,000 troops and spend another half trillion dollars?

[01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:27.950]
Prozac Ron could have come up with that solution.

[01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:33.890]
Question, the war is going poorly general. What do we do? Answer, hmm, let's send over a Schmidt load more troops.

[01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:40.070]
I guess I can and additionally there's no war. It is not a war. It was an invasion and now it's an occupation.

[01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:41.970]
There has not been any war in Iraq.

[01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:48.950]
The last war in Iraq was with Iran as fast as I can. That's why we stuck a Sodom in there in the first place. Right.

[01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.310]

[01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:52.250]
Our good buddy. He was he was the buffer.

[01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:55.490]
And now he's the dead buffer.

[01:30:56.370 --> 01:31:02.330]
I guess I can sleep better at night knowing our military has got such innovative leaders who obviously understand the difference between the strategy and the tactics.

[01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:06.670]
Chris and for a lot of the who sounds a little bit miffed. You know like Miff America.

[01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:14.450]
The Dow is down 137. Just relax. It's just NASDAQs down only 14.41.

[01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:17.950]
What's not there's the egghead he's going to solve it for us. Ali Feltching.

[01:31:17.970 --> 01:31:22.330]
Right now look the smartest minds on the planet are working on this thing down 154.

[01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:28.550]
Arrow after arrow after arrow out of the quiver. Yeah. And I don't know where we're going.

[01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:34.610]
Well it's asking a lot of everybody involved in this. I mean we've given I think the nation's got itself an economics course in the last three weeks.

[01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:41.010]
We wouldn't have expected. And we're digging deep into our own memories and repertoire. Christine we we we we and Jerry are both.

[01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:46.110]
We really have had to ask them because we're looking for some leadership. This is a confused market.

[01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:48.310]
And that's what you're seeing in the Dow. You're seeing confusion.

[01:31:48.710 --> 01:31:50.150]
Absolute confusion. Confucius.

[01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:52.990]
Into a tiny secret. Did I just say that?

[01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:56.770]
Yep. The old eyes in together.

[01:31:58.990 --> 01:32:01.930]
Here's one from sunny. Something.

[01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:05.190]
Neil I've never understood why Jews would vote Republican.

[01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:14.870]
This whole Israel like David from for example self-hating bastard. Richard Pearl and Paul Wolfowitz all these other far bison.

[01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:17.030]
Neocons.

[01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:25.310]
Not to mention the one in the who's the one New York Times who writes the right wing obligatory column.

[01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:28.430]
I can't think of his name. I heard it. Maybe he's not a Jew. I can't think of it.

[01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:35.850]
Not Bill Crystal. Oh don't tell me how to tell. Who Cal something with about haircut. Cal. Yeah.

[01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.750]
You know as much as I love Oberman you know.

[01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:40.890]
Before we this thing about the Jews.

[01:32:42.150 --> 01:32:47.770]
As much as I love Keith Oberman he's got big pair of balls and he's the one guy on TV who tells it like it is and isn't afraid.

[01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:52.550]
He doesn't pull back any punches. But the format of that show and I'm sure he's got a lot to do with it is just.

[01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:57.570]
The the whole approach to what he's got that thin faced guy from Newsweek.

[01:32:57.690 --> 01:33:02.810]
I can't think of his name with the glasses with the looks like a professor a geek professor.

[01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:09.610]
And he brings him on and he's got and then these guests are all the same people around and then Howard Feynman who I like Howard Feynman.

[01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.290]
Okay. He reminds me of Howard Kleinberg.

[01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:15.490]
But they all say thanks Keith. Thanks Keith.

[01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:22.270]
And they come on and Keith will pontificate and say something and then he puts the words in her mouth and they agree with it.

[01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:27.410]
You know what I mean? Well what's even the point of having them there other to say yes you're right and then he is right.

[01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:38.690]
But what's the point? God same tired talking heads. Oh and then of course he and then with their panel with their panel of 800 experts.

[01:33:39.710 --> 01:33:43.410]
They've got big fat bill bent it there and then they've got all these other 10 the glory.

[01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:45.030]
What's her name? The one that used to be on CBS.

[01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:51.630]
Gloria Borgher who you know who that is you'd recognize her.

[01:33:52.770 --> 01:33:56.130]
It's just I don't understand what who programs these shows.

[01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:02.530]
Same faces and in predictably in order to that's another thing.

[01:34:03.810 --> 01:34:05.830]
They're all on in the same order every night.

[01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:10.970]
The guy with a glove the guy with a thin face and a glass is he's on first for like two minutes.

[01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:18.350]
And he's like I wouldn't say non-committal but he's very low key and a very well I wouldn't go that far but.

[01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:26.190]
I just don't get it anyway Neil I've never understood why Jews have brought Republican this whole Israel first mentality is nauseating.

[01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:29.910]
You better talk to Jew Lieberman mister. He'll straighten your ass out.

[01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:35.030]
I'm a Jew and I certainly don't want to blow off the map it says but I think any president Republican or Democrat would protect Israel.

[01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:39.230]
I care about my country the US first before I care about Israel.

[01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:42.310]
Don't those idiots realize the only reason to religious right to send into Israel.

[01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:46.030]
So when would is because they're waiting for Jesus to come back and hold a parade in Haifa?

[01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:59.030]
They don't care about Jews all of these lunatic members of the tribe are talking my head off telling me Obama's a Muslim and I should vote for him or came because he's good for Israel plus Palin's ministers up there blaming the Jewish bankers for the economy should I just ignore that.

[01:34:59.950 --> 01:35:03.530]
Maybe he's going to do an exercise and we give it all the witches all the Jewish witches.

[01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:10.770]
God Israel firsters like Jew Lieberman he is I'm telling you he's the Antichrist.

[01:35:13.710 --> 01:35:20.450]
Makes sense they should they should examine his ball spot on live TV his ball spot his ball spot.

[01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:23.470]
Oh, we'll see that right near his back don't find that.

[01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:28.950]
In fact he kind of reminds me a little of Joseph Gekki they both qualify his penis face.

[01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:37.170]
Ron says don't count your votes yet Neil don't forget that he is still black and the polls could be skewed because people don't want to move into the polls to his that their brigets.

[01:35:37.710 --> 01:35:43.190]
You think Bush could pull some crap in a couple of weeks to get the attention off the economy on killing etc.

[01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:47.070]
Yeah, I'm killing. He's killing us I'll tell you that.

[01:35:47.230 --> 01:35:56.690]
Hey listen I wouldn't put anything past these bastards because they will do whatever it takes to keep the reins of power because they're stealing the world blind as we sit back and watch.

[01:35:57.510 --> 01:36:05.710]
They are raping the world not just Bush and his Saudi friends but all these other Neal cons hook up the big long to the oil and a rack baby.

[01:36:06.170 --> 01:36:07.850]
That's what it was all about in the first place.

[01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:11.930]
Maybe they could take over the poppy fields in Afghanistan.

[01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:18.130]
And we could send Iliana over there so you could do all the all the promotional spots I poppy.

[01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:26.510]
Can you see it now I can smell it the poppy's yeah I can smell Iliana from a million miles away don't smell good either.

[01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:31.490]
Oh talk about the girl with stank press I think we can play that I think so.

[01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:48.270]
Which one is it I think it's the girl the girl girl ain't cutting you better get with your cuts cold once I have a girl she was a beautiful girl but she had that stank breath.

[01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:58.650]
Her breath was so bad one time she put a tick tag in her mouth and it jumped right back out and said no this job is too big for me.

[01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:09.010]
Shut your mouth your stank breath is in my face.

[01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:19.550]
Oh baby your breath so bad it's thinking of the whole darn place.

[01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:35.170]
One little dolly won't you shut your mouth I just can't take no more a few more lifts of your stank breath.

[01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:40.730]
I'll be passed out on the floor.

[01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:46.530]
Oh that's it that was a Bob and Tom bid back in the days when they were funny.

[01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:49.710]
Remember those days I do.

[01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:50.130]
I do.

[01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:53.470]
I remember when we were funny too and I remember when we played to play funny things like that.

[01:37:53.650 --> 01:37:54.170]
That's right.

[01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:56.470]
Well that wasn't that funny but it was it was okay.

[01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.630]
No.

[01:37:57.170 --> 01:37:59.230]
If it was that funny we wouldn't have been allowed to play it.

[01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:05.110]
That's that's the barometer okay that's what Joyce tells us if it's really funny don't you dare play it.

[01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:08.950]
If somebody might get like a little chuckle out of it don't you play it.

[01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:10.790]
654 votes on a poll.

[01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:16.510]
Richard Wolf somebody thank you somebody emailed me and see the one thing about the emails actually be spawned away.

[01:38:16.510 --> 01:38:17.950]
I want to ask a question like that on the year.

[01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:23.610]
Remember yesterday Chris people were like emailing in stuff crap occasionally.

[01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:31.310]
I think I got the chills I think maybe you got the flu maybe got the money to croak this week.

[01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.530]
What?

[01:38:32.010 --> 01:38:32.750]
Don't do that.

[01:38:33.170 --> 01:38:33.710]
Don't do what?

[01:38:34.050 --> 01:38:37.890]
You got like five more years so and three months.

[01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:44.170]
What's the date today the eighth wouldn't be surprised if my paycheck shows up there today.

[01:38:44.170 --> 01:38:45.610]
Oh hallelujah.

[01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:46.410]
Oh happy day.

[01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:50.250]
I could go to Woodbine and lose half of it today but I won't.

[01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:52.790]
Richard Wolf that's the guy now you know which one it is.

[01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:53.090]
No.

[01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:57.670]
With the funny little goofy glasses like the granny glasses.

[01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:58.050]
No.

[01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:59.550]
And the skinny face.

[01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:01.270]
It doesn't really say much of anything.

[01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:04.470]
From Newsweek and from MSNBC.

[01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:09.250]
You know Oberman you're great but you know enough with these same talking heads all.

[01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:11.150]
First he did that with Rachel Maddow.

[01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:13.370]
Maddow whatever her name is that type.

[01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:18.110]
And she was on constantly just incessantly and all of a sudden she's got her own show.

[01:39:19.170 --> 01:39:21.770]
And that's because they don't have anything to put on the air on that damn network.

[01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:24.330]
That's the problem they got Oberman on six times a night which is great.

[01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.890]
That's fine.

[01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:26.290]
Somebody might actually see it.

[01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:29.350]
But oh these talking heads.

[01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:34.090]
It's like it's like it is to politics while what jerk jerks we just to sports.

[01:39:35.610 --> 01:39:38.350]
He's got absolutely no insight nothing to say.

[01:39:38.850 --> 01:39:43.630]
I saw him one time on ESPN on a pregame thing where they have the panel sitting around.

[01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:44.770]
That's a new deal now.

[01:39:45.670 --> 01:39:47.130]
Everybody in the world is on a panel.

[01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:48.750]
How come you guys are on a panel yet?

[01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:50.150]
I'm on several panels.

[01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:51.130]
Oh yeah?

[01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.690]
Yeah.

[01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:52.730]
A aluminum panel.

[01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:54.410]
Oh there's Sarah.

[01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:55.470]
There's Sarah.

[01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.730]
Yeah.

[01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:56.690]
He hasn't done it before.

[01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:02.110]
Sarah Palin is playing the traditional role of the vice president which is to get a little down.

[01:40:02.110 --> 01:40:04.270]
Patch it a little down a little bit dirty.

[01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:07.530]
My god talking about slapping with the pork.

[01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.950]
God.

[01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:10.930]
The best talent.

[01:40:10.930 --> 01:40:12.290]
He's slapping.

[01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:14.290]
4.60 QAM.

[01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:16.090]
The fourth leader.

[01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:17.970]
The biggest name.

[01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:19.430]
The best talent.

[01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:20.510]
It's the mad dog.

[01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:22.630]
I'm in the same team.

[01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:25.970]
You ride 60 QAM.

[01:40:26.190 --> 01:40:27.890]
The sports leader.

[01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:31.550]
The old guy.

[01:40:32.330 --> 01:40:34.370]
There's lady in town.

[01:40:35.170 --> 01:40:37.950]
She's another dog's due boy.

[01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:42.830]
And she needs to buy bread that is unlethavan.

[01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:44.010]
You're fair.

[01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:45.990]
Mmm.

[01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:48.290]
Mmm.

[01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:52.910]
And she's buying bread if seven.

[01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:54.490]
He let her.

[01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:03.570]
And the bread is one day.

[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:09.830]
And the bread is one day.

[01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:14.110]
And the bread is one day.

[01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:15.290]
And the bread is really one day.

[01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:16.810]
I wonder.

[01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:21.130]
Don't forget it's young Kipper with sundown and I told you dear Edy are going to burn in hell.

[01:41:23.190 --> 01:41:23.630]
No.

[01:41:25.330 --> 01:41:25.770]
No.

[01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:25.910]
No.

[01:41:26.150 --> 01:41:26.150]

[01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.350]

[01:41:26.690 --> 01:41:32.410]
Well if you ask like a 20 Jews, 20 different people who are Jewish, the questions about like heaven and hell.

[01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:39.410]
Oh, the Jews don't believe in heaven and hell or the Jews don't believe in hell or we don't practice these, you know, or we're hungry.

[01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:40.010]
Whatever.

[01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:42.390]
And then of course there's the real far bison.

[01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.230]
Right.

[01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:46.390]
The real like Jew Lieberman.

[01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:55.250]
The happiest day that that's my goal in life is to outlive the greatest moment will be to come in here one morning to sit down and to go.

[01:41:55.330 --> 01:41:57.110]
You know, start looking at my different websites.

[01:41:58.530 --> 01:42:03.910]
And the headline says Jew Lieberman croaks and I will go.

[01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.570]
Yes.

[01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:08.170]
See, I can barely even talk but I managed to squeak that one out.

[01:42:10.490 --> 01:42:10.890]
I'm right.

[01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:14.490]
It's one of these deals with the cold and I'm sure everybody has experienced this where you're like.

[01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:16.310]
You're right on the verge.

[01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:18.510]
You know, it's like it's like an orgasm.

[01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:20.710]
You know, you're like either on one side of it or the other.

[01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:21.190]
You know what I mean?

[01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.490]
Yes.

[01:42:22.530 --> 01:42:25.310]
And of course once you get to a certain point, there's no holding back.

[01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:26.490]
It's the same principle.

[01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:27.050]
Yeah.

[01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:28.210]
You know what I mean?

[01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.870]
Uh-huh.

[01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:31.510]
That moment of clarity.

[01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:33.290]
No, I'm not talking about the orgasm.

[01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:34.370]
I mean, you would obviously.

[01:42:34.570 --> 01:42:35.410]
I'm talking about the cold.

[01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:36.070]
Right.

[01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:43.570]
And the moment when it turns into like real full blown, if I can say that, I guess I shouldn't have said full blown in some context.

[01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:47.370]
Well, who on Tuesdays presidential debate, that's our poll.

[01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:51.990]
Everybody say and you'll be really amazed not just like we're not amazed at the result with our audience

[01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:55.110]
because we know that we got a bunch of commie pinko liberal people with a brain.

[01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:56.070]
Some of them.

[01:42:58.650 --> 01:42:59.610]
I'm your friend.

[01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:00.410]
Like that.

[01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:01.230]
Just like the McCain.

[01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.870]
Friends.

[01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:02.410]
Well, friends.

[01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:05.010]
And the IOD poll on this.

[01:43:06.090 --> 01:43:08.110]
They asked, who do you think is going to win the election?

[01:43:09.090 --> 01:43:12.450]
And it's like 67% McCain and 29% Obama.

[01:43:13.150 --> 01:43:15.830]
And the other 4% say the Jimmy Cifalist blows.

[01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:18.010]
Which is not news to me.

[01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:23.810]
Who on Tuesdays presidential debate, Obama 429, 65% of the 660 vote.

[01:43:24.010 --> 01:43:24.930]
What are we looking for 800?

[01:43:25.250 --> 01:43:26.350]
I don't think you're going to do it, Mr.

[01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:30.970]
We're going to kind of a weak start because Eric, well, adds my fault.

[01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:36.010]
Because as the debate was almost over, I factored to Eric.

[01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:38.170]
You know, and I don't know what to end.

[01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:41.370]
And by the time I went to bed, which wasn't that much later because I'm sick as a dog,

[01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:45.030]
the new poll wasn't up there to put on yet.

[01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:49.470]
And when I came in here this morning, it was up and there were 147 votes on it.

[01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.890]
See what I mean?

[01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:53.110]
So Eric was, you know, he was asleep at the swish.

[01:43:54.150 --> 01:43:55.190]
Not that I'm not going to Eric.

[01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.830]
Eric is great.

[01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:56.490]
We love you, Eric.

[01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:57.810]
Don't start getting sensitive.

[01:43:57.810 --> 01:43:59.510]
Whoa, like that again.

[01:43:59.670 --> 01:44:00.270]
We hate what you do.

[01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:01.530]
Whoa, George hates that.

[01:44:02.530 --> 01:44:06.610]
That's why George doesn't talk to Eric very often because Eric, you know, he likes Eric,

[01:44:06.810 --> 01:44:10.370]
but Eric, he now has a very sensitive uptight, just like chicken neck.

[01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:11.530]
I'm starving.

[01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:13.830]
How's he doing, chicken, ex?

[01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:14.410]
He's still starving?

[01:44:14.890 --> 01:44:15.350]
I don't know.

[01:44:15.450 --> 01:44:16.270]
I've got to send that chat.

[01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:17.590]
It was a rhetorical question.

[01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:18.910]
I know you don't want to talk about that.

[01:44:19.050 --> 01:44:19.190]
Right.

[01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:21.150]
And I'm sure he's got a lot of company.

[01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:22.730]
Just misery loves company.

[01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:27.130]
So the fact that you're starving, you shouldn't feel bad about it because a lot of other people are starving too.

[01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:29.690]
And since it's your own Kipper at Sundown, what a blessing.

[01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:30.610]
What a shonda, huh?

[01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:34.150]
What a mahaya at Sundown tonight.

[01:44:34.150 --> 01:44:36.050]
We're not supposed to eat until Sundown tomorrow.

[01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:39.170]
176 down on the Dow.

[01:44:39.930 --> 01:44:41.210]
Where's Candy Cowley lately?

[01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:42.070]
I haven't been seeing her.

[01:44:44.090 --> 01:44:47.090]
You know, Candy Cowley I like her actually to be honest with you.

[01:44:47.730 --> 01:44:51.110]
And there are damn few people on CNN that I like, but she's one of them.

[01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:53.250]
And Susan Candy, I have our close personal friend.

[01:44:54.150 --> 01:44:54.670]
Anybody else?

[01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:55.670]
End of Jack Cafferty.

[01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:59.790]
I'll tell you, he's been pretty good during all of this crap that's been going on.

[01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:02.970]
He ripped Sarah Pail in a major, you fat ugly smelly ass.

[01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:04.850]
I like more than one crusty cramajon.

[01:45:05.230 --> 01:45:05.630]
That's right.

[01:45:05.770 --> 01:45:06.990]
He's the crusty old cramajon.

[01:45:07.110 --> 01:45:08.290]
He almost smelled it in his underwear.

[01:45:08.890 --> 01:45:09.550]
The crust.

[01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:12.570]
Don't forget the crust.

[01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:17.590]
Anyway, Obama 429, 65%, didn't watch 100.

[01:45:17.850 --> 01:45:18.890]
15% didn't watch.

[01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:20.970]
And then, you know what, he didn't miss much.

[01:45:21.730 --> 01:45:22.870]
It was very boring.

[01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:25.690]
The first one was boring and this one was very boring.

[01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:26.690]
The format sucked.

[01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:31.510]
And Tom Volkaw, you know something the most entertaining part of the whole debate I thought was at the end.

[01:45:31.810 --> 01:45:36.010]
When it came out to like, you know, I don't think they ever did shake hands at the end, did they?

[01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:37.910]
I didn't see it.

[01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.490]
I don't think so.

[01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.910]
I think they did.

[01:45:40.050 --> 01:45:40.210]
No.

[01:45:40.210 --> 01:45:41.230]
I don't know.

[01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:48.190]
No, because McCain came over with his wife and Obama reached out his hand thinking McCain was going to extend his and his hand too.

[01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:49.970]
And the wife shook his hand, Cindy.

[01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:52.790]
Well, not rather shake her hand, not that she's all greater.

[01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:54.310]
Oh, come on.

[01:45:54.330 --> 01:45:57.030]
Are you going to tell me she's an old bag with a lot of money?

[01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:58.070]
Yeah.

[01:45:58.210 --> 01:46:00.390]
You wouldn't touch her with Chris's note.

[01:46:00.670 --> 01:46:01.810]
Oh, she gave me some of that money.

[01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.770]
Yeah, you would.

[01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:04.070]
Close my eyes and think of England.

[01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.550]
I'd take some.

[01:46:04.770 --> 01:46:05.530]
A draw of 58.

[01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:08.510]
McCain 38, 5.7%, don't care.

[01:46:08.610 --> 01:46:08.610]

[01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:09.110]
35.

[01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:12.830]
So Obama 65% McCain 5.7%.

[01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:15.470]
I mean, you'd have to be insane to think McCain won the debate.

[01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:17.770]
And you'd also have to be insane to listen to WIOD.

[01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:25.850]
And you'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.850]

[01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.850]

[01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.850]

[01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.850]

[01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:26.050]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:26.050 --> 01:46:26.990]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:28.250]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:31.030]

You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:37.210 --> 01:46:40.990]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:41.110 --> 01:46:42.510]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:46.490]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:47.250]

You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:57.630 --> 01:46:57.630]

[01:46:57.630 --> 01:46:57.630]

[01:46:57.630 --> 01:46:57.630]

[01:46:57.630 --> 01:46:57.630]

[01:46:57.630 --> 01:46:58.430]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:59.250]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:00.730]

You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:47:07.730 --> 01:47:09.930]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:11.270]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:13.030]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:47:13.570 --> 01:47:17.750]
You'd have to be insane to think about it.

[01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:19.310]
No speaking English.

[01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:26.390]
Well, think about this place.

[01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:27.310]
It's a funny place.

[01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:27.790]
You know what I mean?

[01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.430]
It's fun.

[01:47:28.650 --> 01:47:29.010]
Okay.

[01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:30.370]
I suppose the South Florida which is there.

He's been sending me two or three of these short little days.

[01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:22.290]
I guess this go must be homesick too or something.

[01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:26.130]
He's sending me comedy and so weak.

[01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:27.030]
Weak.

[01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.830]
Weak.

[01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:29.090]

[01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.090]

[01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.130]
Weak.

[01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:31.010]
Go take care of some runaway dog or something.

[01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:34.430]
I mean, Norma takes care of the other runaways.

[01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:34.810]

People who work for Newsweek in the Washington Post

[01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:51.570]
and they're all the same talking heads as you said.

[01:49:51.650 --> 01:49:52.090]
That's right, Bill.

[01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:52.750]
I love the show.

[01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:53.830]
I don't love the good.

[01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:55.310]
I like Howard Feynman just fine.

[01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:56.330]
Man.

[01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:58.110]
He's good.

[01:49:58.450 --> 01:50:00.010]
He actually says something once in a while.

[01:50:00.170 --> 01:50:01.810]
But it's always the same thing.

[01:50:02.190 --> 01:50:03.570]
And then Obermann always goes to them.

[01:50:03.810 --> 01:50:04.770]
Good evening to you, sir.

[01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:07.530]
And there's a long pause and then high Keith.

[01:50:08.190 --> 01:50:08.750]
You know, like that.

[01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:13.090]
Long awkward pause because the audio is waiting to catch up.

[01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.650]
You know what I mean?

[01:50:14.150 --> 01:50:14.250]
Yep.

[01:50:14.690 --> 01:50:15.610]
I'm not knocking the show.

[01:50:15.610 --> 01:50:16.950]
I know it's a great show and nothing is perfect.

[01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:18.690]
But boy, though, is guests.

[01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:19.290]
Ugh.

[01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:20.610]
What's the biggest name?

[01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:21.670]
The best talent.

[01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:23.070]
No jerks, jerks, you know what I mean?

[01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:23.250]

[01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:24.290]
Sport radio 5.

[01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:25.390]
60 QAM.

[01:50:25.670 --> 01:50:25.970]
I think.

[01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:27.270]
Fourth leader.

[01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:29.490]
Grab my junior, honey.

[01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.070]
The sports leader.

[01:50:32.370 --> 01:50:33.470]
Sounds illiterate to me.

[01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:37.690]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded

[01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:39.510]
to a dumb at people killed

[01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:42.090]
with the gas that we sold him.

[01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:43.790]
First time aggressor nation

[01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:46.010]
and the only one that's going.

[01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:48.150]
Now more blood will be spilled

[01:50:48.150 --> 01:50:49.790]
to get that oil flowing.

[01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:52.130]
Forget about Korea.

[01:50:53.010 --> 01:50:55.170]
The nooks there, Togananda.

[01:50:55.690 --> 01:50:58.830]
Right, Queen is drilling it over

[01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:01.870]
and over into our heads.

[01:51:02.150 --> 01:51:02.370]
Ooh.

[01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:04.710]
Ade rack has sunk.

[01:51:05.710 --> 01:51:08.250]
Empress of master's direction.

[01:51:08.250 --> 01:51:11.810]
You give you give you give you give you give you give you give you give you give you give you

[01:51:15.930 --> 01:51:19.490]
That was down to 17, it's down, it's down

[01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:25.050]
3,000 people killed, are now forgotten, let's exploit them instead

[01:51:25.050 --> 01:51:29.690]
Hey, there's oil to be caught in, going after sent down to

[01:51:29.690 --> 01:51:35.650]
Plankato Sama, there's no longer mention of the name in Lawton

[01:51:35.650 --> 01:51:40.130]
But no one seems concerned all, comfy and complacent

[01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:43.790]
Believe in every word of this cartel administration

[01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:49.450]
That controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right

[01:51:49.450 --> 01:51:55.270]
Wing is drilling it over and over and over to our heads

[01:51:55.270 --> 01:52:01.550]
Oh, that Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:04.650]
I'm dying, I'm dying on the hands

[01:52:11.330 --> 01:52:16.430]
Oh, the loss of civil rights is the rise that we're paying

[01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:20.430]
We're all suspects now, not the ash croft is saying

[01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:24.630]
I have nothing to hide, table talkers all are saying

[01:52:24.630 --> 01:52:28.550]
Blind obedient cattle don't have any reservations

[01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:32.990]
Out of provoked battle and world annihilation

[01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:36.630]
Old regimes must fall in halibut and install

[01:52:36.630 --> 01:52:39.050]
With no objection at all

[01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:42.550]
Then the crap don't have the false hand of right

[01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:49.230]
Wing is drilling it over and over and over to our parade wash heads

[01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:54.470]
Oh, Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[01:52:56.830 --> 01:53:02.750]
Only I've racked some weapons of mass destruction

[01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:05.970]
I'm dying, I'm dying on the hands

[01:53:05.970 --> 01:53:08.230]
About 33 a few I am

[01:53:08.230 --> 01:53:10.130]
Here's an email from yesterday

[01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:12.450]
Hey Uncle Neil, I love watching Maddo

[01:53:12.450 --> 01:53:16.350]
And thinking five hours ago her face was where mine wants to be

[01:53:16.350 --> 01:53:17.670]
Signed Joe Bell

[01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:23.670]
Yeah, I like that that sounds like something almost pornographic to me

[01:53:23.670 --> 01:53:25.050]
Almost almost

[01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:34.210]
I'm thinking of the beast in Joe Bell engaged in some kind of carnal act

[01:53:34.210 --> 01:53:35.490]
Why would you be thinking about that?

[01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:37.690]
I don't know, God, why not?

[01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:40.110]
Because it's a grotesque, right exactly

[01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:45.150]
Maybe it'll chase the evil spirits out of my throat and get my cold over with

[01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:47.310]
Actually, I sound pretty good today

[01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:49.830]
Do I?

[01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:50.310]
You do?

[01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:53.430]
I don't, better than you did this morning your voice is like all warmed up now

[01:53:54.370 --> 01:53:55.090]
Relatively speaking

[01:53:55.090 --> 01:53:57.250]
Yeah, I got that warmer on my throat

[01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:57.910]
Good

[01:53:58.730 --> 01:54:00.770]
Stasis is I have a little something that ed your show

[01:54:01.210 --> 01:54:04.810]
It's downright scary there are people in this country who still think McCain would make a good president

[01:54:04.810 --> 01:54:09.650]
But then again, they have a bimbo on the view defending the so-called conservative agenda

[01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:15.130]
America be afraid, be very afraid of these people who want to take away our rights and fill our heads with them

[01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:17.370]
Proper Uganda, which is what that bit is about

[01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:21.130]
Weapons of ass destruction, my ass

[01:54:22.810 --> 01:54:25.250]
Got a whole bunch of stuff here when you come right down to it

[01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:25.710]
Oh yeah

[01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:32.730]
Russell says searching the airwaves over the weekend and heard Gilbert on a radio telling the host

[01:54:32.730 --> 01:54:34.190]
He was moving to California

[01:54:35.010 --> 01:54:36.230]
Oh, thank God

[01:54:36.230 --> 01:54:36.870]
All right

[01:54:38.190 --> 01:54:43.010]
He didn't say how soon but South Florida was getting a little, well beginning, just a little bit better

[01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:45.030]
Maybe he can take the rest of the crazies with him

[01:54:45.630 --> 01:54:48.750]
I hope he moves next to Arnold it says says Russell

[01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:51.450]
Gilbert, Gilbert to California

[01:54:52.750 --> 01:54:53.170]
Good

[01:54:53.610 --> 01:54:54.770]
And I'm too soon

[01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:59.210]
Well, I guess he's such a big star now after that CD we put on our

[01:54:59.870 --> 01:55:01.430]
Website oh and speaking of the website

[01:55:03.310 --> 01:55:04.150]
Something here

[01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:06.570]
Where the hell was it?

[01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:09.510]
About moving, where I'll find it

[01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:10.670]
I got a pile you know

[01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:11.370]
Oh here it is

[01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:14.630]
Let me read the one that rips you first

[01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:15.730]
Oh goody

[01:55:15.730 --> 01:55:18.490]
Jim says new e-mailer here

[01:55:18.490 --> 01:55:20.670]
Georgia's back and now the pole in the shore slowed down

[01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:23.950]
Could be a coincidence but being

[01:55:25.130 --> 01:55:28.430]
A good conspiracy theorist like you I tended out it

[01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:30.850]
Big dogs and big trucks are another

[01:55:30.850 --> 01:55:32.850]
Effectation of the jock neocon mentality

[01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:36.670]
I think that the jocks nephers have brain damage from all that tough actin, tie actin

[01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:41.690]
And then it says needle my queen god sign Jim

[01:55:41.690 --> 01:55:44.910]
Hey Jim you fairy he doesn't like you I guess

[01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:48.450]
The Georgia's back he's just giving you some crap that's all

[01:55:48.450 --> 01:55:50.210]
He loves you

[01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:52.410]
He wants to have your baby

[01:55:52.410 --> 01:55:53.370]
Little baby

[01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:55.150]
Oh I can't have this

[01:55:56.010 --> 01:56:00.470]
Passing around it's a little baby Sarah popped it out a little bit she's popped out a lot of babies

[01:56:01.650 --> 01:56:06.850]
The one baby so I have her own baby illigit and then of course the other baby he's going off to Iraq because it was easy to do

[01:56:06.850 --> 01:56:11.050]
That to go to the slamer that that's the part of the story that they don't tell when they every time to talk about

[01:56:11.050 --> 01:56:14.850]
The son going off to Iraq and how proud she is the Adi Adi Adi Adi

[01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:20.910]
It was either that or go to jail go to the slamer you drug deal in the slime ball you trailer trash crap

[01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:26.210]
Oh I will say this her future son-a-log looks a lot better in her son

[01:56:27.070 --> 01:56:28.810]
What's his name?

[01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.450]

[01:56:30.230 --> 01:56:32.270]
No, trip trip tripped daddy

[01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:33.170]

[01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:48.430]

[01:56:55.130 --> 01:56:58.390]
Maybe maybe track and sell some crack to Zach

[01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:01.890]
I don't think it's that it's something like that it's with a Z

[01:57:02.630 --> 01:57:05.970]
Zeeck oh Zeeck is a good right now he didn't you know anybody named Zeeck?

[01:57:06.250 --> 01:57:07.450]

[01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:22.370]
Happens all the time Jim says I'm one of the few that actually read some of your bedtime stories on the website

[01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:24.730]
Thank God for you Jim because it's pretty embarrassing

[01:57:24.730 --> 01:57:27.630]
There's some damn good stuff on there if I say so myself

[01:57:28.570 --> 01:57:32.730]
And it's a cold day in purgatory when we get over 300 people reading the even the most red stories

[01:57:32.730 --> 01:57:33.750]
It's pretty sad

[01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:36.410]
I do have one complaint though Jim says

[01:57:36.410 --> 01:57:40.630]
It really makes me able to have to scroll past all the pictures of the bush and pale and please need a light

[01:57:40.630 --> 01:57:43.850]
Beg of you put them under the stories or move the stories to their own page

[01:57:43.850 --> 01:57:48.490]
Oh we don't want to do that I don't know but as far as the website's concerned

[01:57:48.490 --> 01:57:51.450]
Jim reminded me since I'm forgetful and old and senile

[01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:55.410]
He reminded me of a little something something remember um what was the guy's name

[01:57:56.810 --> 01:58:00.170]
That was gonna fix this up the website because it was so bad

[01:58:00.170 --> 01:58:03.150]
Oh I forgot Rick uh Rick uh something

[01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:06.090]

[01:58:10.050 --> 01:58:13.210]
Sookas by the way Sookas is coming up pretty soon

See one thing about us Jim's we'd like to lump the holidays together to keep everybody uh uh uh

[01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:22.490]
Keep everybody off the track

[01:58:23.690 --> 01:58:26.410]

When's the last time anybody sold anything on his show besides muff

[01:58:59.790 --> 01:59:00.530]

Who won last night's presidential debate?

[01:59:18.730 --> 01:59:26.350]
As leaders of major financial institutions and representatives from nations around the world gather in Washington soon

[01:59:28.650 --> 01:59:30.990]
But we are facing

[01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:35.950]
We are facing a serious challenge in the end

[01:59:37.410 --> 01:59:40.810]
We're facing a serious challenge what's going on up there

[01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:49.250]
Don't worry hey, hold on a second

[01:59:49.250 --> 01:59:52.370]

We're okay we're okay

[01:59:58.710 --> 01:59:59.690]
You're okay

[02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:07.610]
You know, we, uh, it has been one of the great things about this election is democracy.

[02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:09.250]
Everybody's got an opinion.

[02:00:10.090 --> 02:00:11.510]
And that is outstanding.

[02:00:11.650 --> 02:00:14.010]
That's what we're supposed to be doing during election side.

[02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:17.730]
Now, we're probably to some clansmen away there.

[02:00:17.730 --> 02:00:20.570]
You know, it's Indiana 713 votes on the poll.

[02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:26.490]
Now, let's see how it's attorney Obama 64 and a half percent 460 vote and McCain 45

[02:00:26.490 --> 02:00:27.690]
6.3 percent.

[02:00:27.890 --> 02:00:29.350]
See how McCain had a little uptick.

[02:00:30.370 --> 02:00:31.370]
Head a little tick.

[02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:34.490]
Oh, that's why he kept storming around the stage.

[02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:36.150]
So nobody would see it.

[02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:37.290]
The biggest name.

[02:00:37.570 --> 02:00:38.250]
The best towel.

[02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.470]
The little.

[02:00:38.910 --> 02:00:39.710]
The biggest nail Rogers.

[02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:42.010]
Fortnight, you'll 560 QAM.

[02:00:42.450 --> 02:00:43.790]
The fourth lead.

[02:00:44.210 --> 02:00:44.870]
The biggest nail.

[02:00:45.170 --> 02:00:45.990]
The best towel.

[02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.830]
The biggest nail.

[02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:46.830]

[02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:47.170]
The biggest nail.

[02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:48.410]
More Landu Alzergari.

[02:00:48.630 --> 02:00:49.650]
Mornings 5 to 7.

[02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:51.850]
Sports Radio 560 QAM.

[02:00:52.170 --> 02:00:52.170]

[02:00:52.190 --> 02:00:53.650]
The sports leader.

[02:00:53.650 --> 02:00:59.110]
Just tell me what your problem is.

[02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:01.410]
You're free.

[02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:03.250]
And freedom is beautiful.

[02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:07.510]
And, you know, it'll take time to restore chaos.

[02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.650]
But we will.

[02:01:10.050 --> 02:01:12.650]
So to stick inside our house.

[02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:16.950]
Such a kick goes my school's hours.

[02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:20.030]
So what's all that I'm all on for?

[02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:34.650]
That was down to a weight.

[02:01:35.730 --> 02:01:36.570]
Not so great.

[02:01:37.570 --> 02:01:39.830]
All that I've come through today.

[02:01:40.590 --> 02:01:42.310]
They're really easy to feel.

[02:01:42.370 --> 02:01:43.410]
I'm all so afraid.

[02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:47.210]
All the other things that is that bad of all.

[02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:49.510]
Let's get to my first towel.

[02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:50.630]
Freedom is power.

[02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:54.190]
Freedom is power.

[02:01:55.210 --> 02:01:55.310]
Freedom is power.

[02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:56.490]
Let's get to my first towel.

[02:01:57.070 --> 02:01:57.850]
Freedom is power.

[02:01:58.610 --> 02:01:59.850]
Let's get to my first towel.

[02:01:59.850 --> 02:02:01.350]
Freedom is power.

[02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:03.670]
Let's get to my first towel.

[02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:04.910]
Freedom is power.

[02:02:07.170 --> 02:02:07.550]
Freedom is power.

[02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.550]

[02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:21.650]
Club 46 at QAM.

[02:02:21.730 --> 02:02:22.950]
The brilliant Mitch Lewis there.

[02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:25.050]
He of a former ponytail famed.

[02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:26.350]
He wants to pound his time out of a ponytail?

[02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:26.970]
He sure did.

[02:02:27.330 --> 02:02:27.950]
Not anymore though.

[02:02:28.050 --> 02:02:28.190]
Nope.

[02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:31.350]
These guys, it's like Samson and Reverse.

[02:02:31.450 --> 02:02:32.170]
They cut off their ponytail.

[02:02:32.170 --> 02:02:33.290]
And then they really bootch up.

[02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:34.930]
Jeff Cohen and Mitch Lewis.

[02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:36.570]
All these Jewish guys.

[02:02:36.690 --> 02:02:38.230]
They cut off the ponytail for young Kipper.

[02:02:39.590 --> 02:02:41.470]
Maybe they'll have it for a snack later on.

[02:02:45.690 --> 02:02:47.010]
728 on Fat Chris's poll.

[02:02:47.150 --> 02:02:48.030]
We're going for 800 today.

[02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.610]
That would be good.

[02:02:49.170 --> 02:02:49.530]
Considering.

[02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:52.970]
Although quite frankly, if you know back in the day,

[02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:54.990]
we'd have had 45,000 on this poll.

[02:02:55.170 --> 02:02:57.950]
You know, if we still had the old audience before Joe Bell came to town.

[02:02:58.870 --> 02:03:03.490]
Thinking that we're commiserating Saturday night about what happened right after Joe Bell came to town.

[02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:05.970]
About how it was like the beginning of the end.

[02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:10.230]
For QAM and our careers and lives as we once knew them.

[02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:10.850]
But that's okay.

[02:03:10.970 --> 02:03:11.430]
We'll survive.

[02:03:11.730 --> 02:03:14.490]
We'll survive in Spuddy of Fat ass, jolly joe.

[02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.770]
You jackass.

[02:03:16.030 --> 02:03:16.370]
You.

[02:03:16.610 --> 02:03:17.150]
You fairy.

[02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:19.450]
Uncle Diel just tuned in.

[02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:20.990]
So I apologize if I'm repeating anything.

[02:03:21.070 --> 02:03:24.210]
Last night looked like McSane was going to fall over on the audience at any point.

[02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:25.210]
He was lurking.

[02:03:25.330 --> 02:03:27.270]
He was trolling around.

[02:03:27.670 --> 02:03:28.590]
Never stood still.

[02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:30.650]
Probably can't stand still or will fall down.

[02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:32.650]
With the whole Russia issue with him,

[02:03:32.650 --> 02:03:33.650]
he's another bush.

[02:03:34.450 --> 02:03:36.290]
With any issue, he's another bush.

[02:03:37.290 --> 02:03:38.670]
Anyways, love you, Neil, love you, George.

[02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:41.150]
Joyce is still the anti-human Gregonimobile.

[02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:42.510]
Obama, Yamama, says.

[02:03:43.590 --> 02:03:45.090]
Saved the drama for Obama.

[02:03:46.610 --> 02:03:48.890]
Each had the chance to make the case for change.

[02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:51.790]
To talk about what we would do differently.

[02:03:52.510 --> 02:03:55.170]
From the last eight years when it comes to lifting our middle class.

[02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:56.430]
He had a great line in his speech.

[02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:57.790]
I was listening during that stuff.

[02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:59.150]
He said, he used to be in politics.

[02:03:59.210 --> 02:04:01.570]
They would say, are you better off than you were four years ago?

[02:04:01.570 --> 02:04:03.290]
He said, pretty soon, the way things are going.

[02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:05.790]
They're going to be asking, are you better off than you were four weeks ago?

[02:04:07.170 --> 02:04:09.650]
That's how they're going under the Neil Khan job, man.

[02:04:09.970 --> 02:04:11.810]
A big rape of the world.

[02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:15.530]
Bush and Cheney, it's Herbert Hoover all over again, man.

[02:04:15.670 --> 02:04:17.730]
The chicken and every pot and two cars and every gay rise.

[02:04:19.150 --> 02:04:20.650]
George says, he'll pass on the chicken.

[02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:22.390]
He'll just take the...

[02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:23.650]
The Raj pot.

[02:04:25.810 --> 02:04:26.710]
Here's one from Phil.

[02:04:26.890 --> 02:04:28.370]
Neil, funny you bring up Phil Henry today.

[02:04:28.810 --> 02:04:29.110]
It says.

[02:04:29.110 --> 02:04:29.790]
Are you sure?

[02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:32.070]
Last night suffering from awful insomnia,

[02:04:32.070 --> 02:04:34.970]
probably due to the state of the nation, I turned on my portable AM radio

[02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:36.610]
and happened to bond the Phil Henry show.

[02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:38.570]
It must have been three AM, I think.

[02:04:38.890 --> 02:04:40.950]
Anyway, I was surprised to hear Phil actually defending Obama

[02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:42.890]
from a caller who was a McCain supporter.

[02:04:43.810 --> 02:04:45.150]
Luckily, Neil, I didn't hear too much.

[02:04:45.250 --> 02:04:46.290]
I was sound asleep in minutes.

[02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.910]
Thanks, Phil.

[02:04:47.630 --> 02:04:50.170]
How do you like that, our close personal former friend, Phil Henry?

[02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.830]
That turncoat.

[02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.670]
Mm-hmm.

[02:04:53.290 --> 02:04:55.090]
Who sold his soul to the company store?

[02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:56.550]
He ain't no Tennessee or any for it.

[02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:58.410]
How's Phil's TV show coming, by the way?

[02:04:59.250 --> 02:05:00.410]
Oh, yeah, I won't see that no more.

[02:05:00.810 --> 02:05:01.310]
Oh, really?

[02:05:02.650 --> 02:05:02.850]
Ah!

[02:05:03.630 --> 02:05:05.590]
That was back during the days when he was peddling himself

[02:05:05.590 --> 02:05:06.630]
as this great, you know?

[02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:09.090]
And he was very funny and I would do you as a great talent.

[02:05:09.490 --> 02:05:10.810]
And then he just became a jerk.

[02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:13.190]
The Dow was down to ten, two-oh-seven.

[02:05:14.230 --> 02:05:15.290]
You make it a nice comeback.

[02:05:15.550 --> 02:05:17.750]
Seven-thirty-two on the pole, all the numbers all the time for that.

[02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:19.250]
You're mailing it in, Rajas.

[02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:21.110]
You should be glad I'm mailing it in.

[02:05:21.170 --> 02:05:21.970]
Would my throat like this?

[02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:24.070]
I'm very glad.

[02:05:24.710 --> 02:05:26.170]
Maybe I had strep throat, think?

[02:05:26.170 --> 02:05:27.990]
Now strep throat's really painful, isn't it?

[02:05:29.090 --> 02:05:29.790]
Yeah, it is.

[02:05:30.190 --> 02:05:31.750]
It's like really hurts to swallow.

[02:05:32.170 --> 02:05:33.390]
Oh, nice to meet you.

[02:05:33.450 --> 02:05:33.870]
Not your problem.

[02:05:35.370 --> 02:05:36.730]
Nope, I swallow just fine.

[02:05:36.990 --> 02:05:37.310]
That's what I heard.

[02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:39.890]
Leo says, I watched the debate last and I became

[02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:41.130]
looked like a very old robot.

[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:43.810]
He must have said, my friends, over 50 times,

[02:05:43.970 --> 02:05:46.710]
50 times, 5,000 times, my friends.

[02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:48.630]
I'm your friend.

[02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:50.830]
Also, he kept saying the point is,

[02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:53.130]
it almost felt like I was listening to your show when he,

[02:05:53.630 --> 02:05:55.550]
you're my friend guy calls in 50 times,

[02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:56.590]
unless the not ready or show.

[02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:57.570]
That's right, same guy.

[02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:59.310]
Prozac Ron is John McCain.

[02:05:59.770 --> 02:06:00.410]
Prozac John.

[02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:02.530]
What's the point?

[02:06:02.710 --> 02:06:04.230]
It says he needs oil like the tin man.

[02:06:05.530 --> 02:06:09.190]
To keep raping the workers, the best workers I don't know about you,

[02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:12.290]
but oh, I can't understand this.

[02:06:12.490 --> 02:06:14.690]
But when someone uses my friend, I feel they're talking down to me

[02:06:14.690 --> 02:06:15.550]
or being sarcastic.

[02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:17.630]
God love him, but he's still in up case.

[02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:18.930]
What a liar.

[02:06:19.690 --> 02:06:22.090]
Can't believe the average bearer still thinks that he is for them.

[02:06:22.090 --> 02:06:23.710]
After all, we're going through anyway.

[02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:27.330]
Spelled strangely.

[02:06:27.650 --> 02:06:28.530]
Goal, bomber, it says.

[02:06:28.710 --> 02:06:29.990]
Keep it up in the fight for freedom too,

[02:06:30.250 --> 02:06:32.110]
because we're sure losing our so-called freedoms.

[02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:34.850]
Also sick Mrs. Palin's scare tactics.

[02:06:35.090 --> 02:06:36.470]
It reminds me of Bush's scare tactics.

[02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:39.350]
Last time I checked, we haven't been attacked since 9-11.

[02:06:39.690 --> 02:06:40.750]
From under my bed, love.

[02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:41.710]
I'll talk to you next month.

[02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:42.530]
Don't want to be chronic.

[02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:45.130]
Goodly, I'll get some English lessons, some spelling.

[02:06:47.930 --> 02:06:48.990]
Get some spelling.

[02:06:52.130 --> 02:06:52.850]
Sid says.

[02:06:53.390 --> 02:06:55.350]
I listen to your show almost every day on the internet

[02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:56.310]
when I get home from work.

[02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:58.650]
I live just outside Charlotte, North Carolina.

[02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:00.750]
I used to live in a high allea back in the 70s

[02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:01.550]
and in Palm Beach Gardens.

[02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:04.990]
Then Mo Howard David's pink-ass bokeh before I moved to the Bible belt.

[02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:07.870]
Do you remember the video phone that Jeff,

[02:07:08.050 --> 02:07:09.950]
aka Ponytail, had hooked up with the pizza loft?

[02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:12.830]
That linked you to the station which I believe was WIOD back then?

[02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:13.630]
The video phone?

[02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:14.250]
That's right.

[02:07:15.950 --> 02:07:17.130]
I was like, 10 minutes long.

[02:07:17.550 --> 02:07:17.550]

[02:07:17.550 --> 02:07:17.930]
What?

[02:07:18.250 --> 02:07:19.430]
I said that was about 10 minutes of fun.

[02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:21.150]
Is that how long it lasted?

[02:07:21.550 --> 02:07:21.710]
Yeah.

[02:07:22.190 --> 02:07:22.970]
I don't remember it.

[02:07:23.170 --> 02:07:27.130]
Talking to my Colombian coworker to get you linked up at the station

[02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:28.570]
which I believe was WIOD,

[02:07:29.130 --> 02:07:30.270]
and he talked to you on the video phone.

[02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:31.570]
You asked him, what do I have in my mouth?

[02:07:31.630 --> 02:07:32.210]
He said, a cigar.

[02:07:32.710 --> 02:07:33.790]
And you said, it looks like a cigar.

[02:07:34.190 --> 02:07:35.110]
Oh, I can't say that now.

[02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:37.690]
Anyways, that was like high tech for back then.

[02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:38.710]
We got a good life out of it.

[02:07:39.050 --> 02:07:39.890]
I saw a bumper sticker.

[02:07:39.890 --> 02:07:41.470]
They would tear a pale ins picture on it.

[02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:43.430]
It said, I can see Russia for my back porch.

[02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.950]
It was great.

[02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:47.170]
PS, shorties, barbecue and pizza loft are great.

[02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:48.750]
Go there every time I come back to South Florida

[02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:50.970]
and see my old friends and smell the clasmic bags

[02:07:50.970 --> 02:07:51.950]
of the early bird patrons.

[02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:52.810]
It's a sin.

[02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:54.030]
Oh, it's in the bag.

[02:07:54.730 --> 02:07:56.330]
Even with my cold, I could smell that.

[02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:58.470]
Mm, the stench here.

[02:07:58.490 --> 02:07:59.930]
Health insurance from the government.

[02:08:00.570 --> 02:08:02.430]
Or happy with it.

[02:08:02.590 --> 02:08:04.070]
Wouldn't trade it in for anybody.

[02:08:04.630 --> 02:08:07.250]
But suddenly they say, no, no, you, the American people,

[02:08:07.590 --> 02:08:09.170]
the folks who are paying our salaries,

[02:08:09.410 --> 02:08:10.630]
who don't have health insurance,

[02:08:11.210 --> 02:08:13.050]
or paying too much for health insurance,

[02:08:13.050 --> 02:08:15.990]
that somehow you don't want government involvement.

[02:08:18.130 --> 02:08:20.130]
So he's really fired up and pete off.

[02:08:20.210 --> 02:08:20.530]
Nice going.

[02:08:20.670 --> 02:08:22.470]
I like that when he gets a little animated, you know?

[02:08:23.150 --> 02:08:24.510]
As opposed to yesterday with McCain,

[02:08:24.690 --> 02:08:26.110]
of course McCain couldn't allow anybody

[02:08:26.110 --> 02:08:27.610]
into a deep shirt, into a coma.

[02:08:28.610 --> 02:08:30.550]
The debate was the bottom line for it was boring.

[02:08:30.730 --> 02:08:32.370]
He was really, you know, and Tom Broca, I mean,

[02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:33.270]
go, go, go.

[02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:36.690]
How come they can't have somebody animated on there?

[02:08:36.730 --> 02:08:38.150]
You know, like, all they could, but that's no fun.

[02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:40.090]
Let's have some real fair job, like Keith Oberman.

[02:08:40.090 --> 02:08:41.750]
Is that someone with a paralyzed lip?

[02:08:44.370 --> 02:08:45.090]
A paralyzed?

[02:08:45.390 --> 02:08:46.430]
Are you talking about McCain again?

[02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:50.690]
739 on Fat Chris' pool.

[02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:51.510]
He's pretty confident.

[02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:52.510]
We're going to get $800.

[02:08:53.690 --> 02:08:54.110]
Aren't you?

[02:08:54.690 --> 02:08:54.910]
Very.

[02:08:55.450 --> 02:08:57.110]
And if we get to $800, you can work Friday.

[02:08:57.730 --> 02:08:58.650]
Oh, you're so kind.

[02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.930]
Because we can't do it.

[02:09:00.150 --> 02:09:00.810]
So he would like to do it.

[02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:01.990]
He enjoys being on this show.

[02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:02.410]
Yes.

[02:09:02.970 --> 02:09:03.170]
He does.

[02:09:03.670 --> 02:09:04.590]
He actually likes the show,

[02:09:04.690 --> 02:09:06.410]
which don't tell anybody that or he'll be out of place.

[02:09:06.610 --> 02:09:08.310]
Hey, he's on Thin Ice.

[02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:09.510]
He's on the show.

[02:09:10.230 --> 02:09:11.250]
He's on the SNP list.

[02:09:11.250 --> 02:09:13.270]
You know, going to bat forest outside in the other office.

[02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:14.170]
He's on the SNP list.

[02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:14.310]
Right.

[02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:16.050]
Yeah, he won't see him for long.

[02:09:16.410 --> 02:09:17.810]
Doug Thompson, the Capitol Hill Blue.

[02:09:17.970 --> 02:09:19.790]
This is short and sweet, like he usually is.

[02:09:20.490 --> 02:09:23.050]
The old man took it, took on the new kid on the block for the second

[02:09:23.050 --> 02:09:25.470]
of three presidential campaign debates Tuesday night,

[02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:28.570]
and planned to expose the kid as a wild-eyed radical with dangerous ideas

[02:09:28.570 --> 02:09:29.850]
that would destroy the USA.

[02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.810]
He failed.

[02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:34.490]
Barack Obama beat John McCain handily in a town hall format

[02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:36.010]
that was supposed to be McCain's strength.

[02:09:36.010 --> 02:09:38.890]
He won by keeping his cool and being well, boring,

[02:09:39.290 --> 02:09:42.330]
and by contrast, exposed McCain is the hothead with dangerous ideas,

[02:09:42.690 --> 02:09:45.330]
which was one of the few moments of truth to come out of the extended hyperbole

[02:09:45.330 --> 02:09:46.750]
that passed his serious debate.

[02:09:47.490 --> 02:09:50.070]
McCain didn't lose his school either, but he still came across as the bully

[02:09:50.070 --> 02:09:53.490]
in the pulpit, the angry, bitter old man who can't stand his opponent

[02:09:53.490 --> 02:09:56.150]
and can't conceal his contempt for the uppity black man from Chicago

[02:09:56.150 --> 02:09:58.350]
who stands in his way on the road to the White House.

[02:09:59.090 --> 02:10:01.050]
Like Swellery Clinton and the Democratic primaries,

[02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:03.150]
McCain sees the presidency as something he deserves,

[02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:04.830]
something that's a right, not a privilege.

[02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:07.950]
He still can't grasp the reality that Obama and the American voters

[02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:09.930]
wanted to deny him that self-procieved right.

[02:10:10.590 --> 02:10:12.850]
A stupe viewer saw a desperate man on stage

[02:10:12.850 --> 02:10:16.350]
to deny the struggling political candidate who keeps throwing hail-mary passes

[02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:17.870]
that fell lifeless to the turf.

[02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:21.890]
His gamble on Sarah Palin is sinking into the mirror of his and her own political mud,

[02:10:22.230 --> 02:10:25.290]
his grandstanding toy on the economic bailout plan failed miserably.

[02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:29.190]
So upset was he over his failed performance that he left the arena abruptly after the debate

[02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:31.170]
while Obama lingued in talking shake hands.

[02:10:31.650 --> 02:10:35.530]
McCain went into the debate knowing the end is near he left with that end in sight.

[02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:38.330]
With nearly a month left in a rank-or-est political campaign

[02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:41.350]
that's defied all the rules a game-changing event is still possible

[02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:42.850]
to rescue the sinking McCain campaign,

[02:10:43.110 --> 02:10:45.170]
but a long-time friend and Republican political consultant

[02:10:45.730 --> 02:10:49.930]
may have summed it up in an email that arrived via Blackberry shortly after the debate.

[02:10:50.350 --> 02:10:53.650]
It said, it's over, time to start thinking about 2012.

[02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:55.650]
What's the biggest name?

[02:10:55.930 --> 02:10:56.770]
The best talent.

[02:10:56.970 --> 02:11:00.450]
People with new projects, sport radio 560 QAM.

[02:11:00.450 --> 02:11:02.310]
The fourth leader.

[02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:04.210]
It's Scott Barrell.

[02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:07.690]
When I'm up in Boca Tiga slapping old women with painted lips around the pool.

[02:11:07.930 --> 02:11:09.550]
I listen to the Neil Rogers one to two.

[02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:13.670]
I mean I listen to the Neil Rogers fair and balanced one to two hours.

[02:11:14.650 --> 02:11:15.930]
You've heard of the four tops.

[02:11:16.370 --> 02:11:17.490]
You've heard of the four seasons.

[02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:19.870]
And of course you've heard of the fab four.

[02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:23.710]
But now witness the newest sensation in musical groups.

[02:11:23.850 --> 02:11:25.650]
The guys with a little something extra.

[02:11:25.890 --> 02:11:29.090]
Yes, it's the four skins, live and uncut.

[02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:30.750]
Yes, there's Peter on Congress.

[02:11:31.770 --> 02:11:33.330]
Dick on Pongos.

[02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:35.610]
Robert on the drum kit.

[02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:38.010]
And Chubby on the Timbales.

[02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:40.030]
The four members of the four skins.

[02:11:40.270 --> 02:11:43.090]
These guys are nothing more than wrinkly skin bones.

[02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:46.590]
But they are the master beaters of percussion.

[02:11:47.090 --> 02:11:51.790]
This CD includes snippets of the four skins caught live at the zipper and helps my winner Germany.

[02:11:52.090 --> 02:11:54.210]
Run out and grab a unit of the four skins.

[02:11:54.610 --> 02:11:55.490]
Live and uncut.

[02:11:55.890 --> 02:11:57.850]
Peel back the wrapper and slap it on.

[02:11:57.850 --> 02:12:00.170]
It's the four skins, live and uncut.

[02:12:00.730 --> 02:12:02.650]
Wow, well that was right along the edges.

[02:12:02.810 --> 02:12:04.230]
You know what, right along the tiptoeing.

[02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:05.730]
Yeah.

[02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:08.870]
Better trim the hedges because that one was on the hedges.

[02:12:09.250 --> 02:12:09.530]
Edges.

[02:12:10.290 --> 02:12:11.010]
Benson and hedges.

[02:12:11.570 --> 02:12:13.150]
What kind of people smoke Benson and hedges?

[02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:13.890]
I don't know.

[02:12:14.670 --> 02:12:15.790]
Yeah, I don't know.

[02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:17.610]
I don't know what people smoke anymore.

[02:12:17.610 --> 02:12:19.050]
I'm talking about cigarettes, fags.

[02:12:21.590 --> 02:12:22.390]
Parliament lights.

[02:12:23.650 --> 02:12:24.090]
Okay.

[02:12:24.230 --> 02:12:25.370]
Here's one from somebody.

[02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:27.950]
It says, you ask about the same people on the cable shows.

[02:12:28.130 --> 02:12:30.410]
I believe they get paid under the table when a producer doesn't look.

[02:12:31.150 --> 02:12:33.410]
I agree they need new fresh people on these cable shows.

[02:12:33.590 --> 02:12:33.790]
Amen.

[02:12:34.450 --> 02:12:34.810]
Amen.

[02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:37.370]
Oh, this is from Nancy and Delray Beach.

[02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:38.890]
I enjoy your radio show.

[02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:40.910]
What about the Embers restaurant, Miami Beach?

[02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:41.530]
Happy New Year.

[02:12:41.630 --> 02:12:42.630]
Good year for all, says Nancy.

[02:12:44.530 --> 02:12:45.210]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:45.970]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:46.010]

[02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:46.190]

[02:12:46.230 --> 02:12:46.370]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:46.710]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:47.350]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:12:48.930 --> 02:12:49.490]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:50.050]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:12:50.170 --> 02:12:52.130]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:07.330]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330]

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330]

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330]

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330]

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330]

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330]

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.330]

[02:13:07.330 --> 02:13:07.430]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.430]

[02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.430]

[02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.450]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:07.450 --> 02:13:07.930]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:07.930]

[02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:07.930]

[02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:07.930]

[02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:08.730]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:08.730 --> 02:13:08.730]

[02:13:09.490 --> 02:13:11.590]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:11.590 --> 02:13:12.750]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:12.750 --> 02:13:13.310]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:14.310]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:15.090]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:15.090 --> 02:13:15.190]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:15.190 --> 02:13:16.310]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:17.170]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:21.290]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:21.290]

[02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:21.950]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:27.190]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.790]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:27.790 --> 02:13:28.370]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:28.370 --> 02:13:28.650]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:29.030]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.030]

[02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.390]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.390]

[02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.390]

[02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.810]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:30.470]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:30.650 --> 02:13:31.910]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:33.190]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:33.190 --> 02:13:33.850]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:33.850 --> 02:13:34.650]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:34.710 --> 02:13:35.710]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.470]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.970]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:36.970 --> 02:13:37.610]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:38.210]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:38.210 --> 02:13:38.230]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:38.890]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:38.890 --> 02:13:41.250]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:41.370 --> 02:13:42.730]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:42.730 --> 02:13:42.730]

[02:13:43.810 --> 02:13:45.250]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:50.250]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:13:50.250 --> 02:13:50.250]

[02:13:50.250 --> 02:13:51.870]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:03.590 --> 02:14:04.790]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.790]

[02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.790]

[02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.790]

[02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.790]

[02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.790]

[02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.970]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.970]

[02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.970]

[02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:05.330]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:05.370]

[02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.430]

[02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:08.050]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:08.050 --> 02:14:08.050]

[02:14:08.050 --> 02:14:08.050]

[02:14:08.050 --> 02:14:08.090]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:09.570 --> 02:14:11.230]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:11.230 --> 02:14:12.970]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:12.970 --> 02:14:13.770]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:13.770 --> 02:14:14.150]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:14.150 --> 02:14:15.170]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:15.170 --> 02:14:15.910]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.910]

[02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:16.390]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:16.630 --> 02:14:17.610]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:17.610 --> 02:14:18.230]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:18.230 --> 02:14:18.810]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:18.890 --> 02:14:18.890]

[02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:21.790]
Good year, Nancy.

[02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:25.690]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:31.030]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.030]

[02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.030]

[02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.170]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:32.050 --> 02:14:32.690]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:33.830]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:33.950 --> 02:14:34.110]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:37.110 --> 02:14:38.750]
down the cheek.

[02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:39.630]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:39.810 --> 02:14:40.490]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.490]

[02:14:40.490 --> 02:14:40.490]

[02:14:41.690 --> 02:14:42.390]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:42.410 --> 02:14:42.850]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.910]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:44.010 --> 02:14:44.390]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:44.570 --> 02:14:45.890]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:45.890 --> 02:14:46.570]
Down a cheek.

[02:14:46.570 --> 02:14:46.570]

[02:14:46.570 --> 02:14:46.570]

[02:14:46.570 --> 02:14:46.770]
Down the cheek.

[02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:51.770]
Down to an open back meal.

[02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:51.770]

[02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:51.770]

[02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:53.410]
You're enjoying listening to you having a great time.

[02:14:54.590 --> 02:14:55.830]
We're having a great time too.

[02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:58.130]
I'd have much greater time if I didn't have this.

[02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:59.190]
Oh, I don't know.

[02:14:59.190 --> 02:14:59.790]
It's okay now.

[02:15:00.110 --> 02:15:01.350]
I didn't have any tea either.

[02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:04.770]
Because the tea bags I've got are about 100 years old.

[02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:09.230]
And this is the little joke, joke of the day.

[02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:12.570]
Remember, doing a good job at WQM is like wetting your pants

[02:15:12.570 --> 02:15:13.230]
at a dark suit.

[02:15:13.590 --> 02:15:15.410]
You get a warm feeling, but no one notices.

[02:15:19.890 --> 02:15:20.810]
Should I read it again?

[02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:21.590]
No.

[02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:22.330]
Okay.

[02:15:22.490 --> 02:15:22.830]
I should.

[02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:27.010]
Doing a good job at WQM is like wetting your pants

[02:15:27.010 --> 02:15:27.950]
in a dark suit.

[02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:30.210]
You get a warm feeling, but nobody notices.

[02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:31.010]
It's cute.

[02:15:31.770 --> 02:15:33.050]
I think that's kind of cute.

[02:15:33.130 --> 02:15:35.330]
I give it about a six and a half on a scale of ten.

[02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:41.690]
What were those choices I had for sex partner?

[02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:42.730]
Somebody who faxed in yesterday.

[02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:43.190]
Remember those?

[02:15:44.010 --> 02:15:45.150]
It was Matt Castle.

[02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:47.310]
Come on, Chris.

[02:15:47.570 --> 02:15:48.270]
Don't you remember that fan?

[02:15:48.490 --> 02:15:49.330]
I remember that email.

[02:15:50.250 --> 02:15:52.130]
Yeah, I know.

[02:15:53.710 --> 02:15:54.590]
I didn't know.

[02:15:54.590 --> 02:15:54.750]
I know.

[02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:55.770]
You forget those males.

[02:15:56.770 --> 02:16:00.730]
In fact, the Chris wanted us to ask request e-females instead of emails.

[02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:04.010]
That's how I've taught he is about the whole deal.

[02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:06.090]
Not a taught, I just don't care.

[02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.870]
Well, why not?

[02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:09.530]
Because I don't like guys.

[02:16:10.930 --> 02:16:12.190]
Oh, look at this.

[02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:14.750]
Somebody says, George smokes the baloney pony.

[02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:15.550]
That's bad.

[02:16:16.430 --> 02:16:17.370]
That's nonsense.

[02:16:17.370 --> 02:16:18.430]
Yeah, they wish.

[02:16:18.590 --> 02:16:20.270]
Wishful thinking by whoever that is.

[02:16:22.090 --> 02:16:22.950]
757 under pull.

[02:16:23.070 --> 02:16:25.050]
Obama's got 64.4% McCain.

[02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:29.030]
6.2% of the rest of the people, you know, we don't want to.

[02:16:29.450 --> 02:16:30.170]
We don't want to.

[02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:32.730]
We should care, but we don't know we don't want to.

[02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:34.710]
We've got to find pile of stuff here.

[02:16:35.450 --> 02:16:38.310]
Oh, now anyway, you see, everybody's got a different take.

[02:16:39.930 --> 02:16:41.350]
That would be a good pull someday.

[02:16:41.630 --> 02:16:42.190]
What's your take?

[02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.670]
Right?

[02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.450]
Right.

[02:16:44.630 --> 02:16:45.910]
That would just be the whole pull.

[02:16:46.450 --> 02:16:46.930]
Huh?

[02:16:48.570 --> 02:16:50.830]
Okay, so I was talking about the fact I did not see them.

[02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:53.570]
I saw them obviously shake hands at the beginning of the debate.

[02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:57.770]
When McCain went rushing off to the chair and started writing stuff with his magic marker.

[02:16:59.270 --> 02:17:01.470]
But other than that, at the end, I didn't see it happen.

[02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:06.270]
And, well, first, here's this email from KB.

[02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:08.110]
They did shake hands at the end.

[02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:10.770]
That's when Tom B told him to get out of the way so he could read the monitor behind him.

[02:17:11.010 --> 02:17:11.590]
I didn't see that.

[02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:12.810]
I saw the part where he, huh?

[02:17:13.570 --> 02:17:15.150]
He said, get out of the way.

[02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:15.930]
I saw that.

[02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:17.730]
Yeah, I can't read my monitor.

[02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:18.530]
You guys are in the way.

[02:17:18.590 --> 02:17:19.050]
Get out of there.

[02:17:19.090 --> 02:17:19.550]
Are you idiots?

[02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:23.610]
But now I just found somebody sent this to me.

[02:17:23.950 --> 02:17:25.550]
McCain ducks Obama's hand shake.

[02:17:26.570 --> 02:17:27.990]
And it shows the video.

[02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:29.050]
It shows the video clip.

[02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:31.370]
Obama has got his hand out.

[02:17:31.650 --> 02:17:32.370]
I saw that.

[02:17:32.770 --> 02:17:33.710]
It was very noticeable.

[02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:35.490]
Obviously, the shake hands with McCain.

[02:17:35.930 --> 02:17:36.850]
And Cindy is there.

[02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:39.210]
And instead Cindy reached over and she grabbed it.

[02:17:39.570 --> 02:17:40.210]
And it's hand too.

[02:17:41.450 --> 02:17:43.070]
And she said, boy, what they say about you?

[02:17:43.170 --> 02:17:43.810]
Darkies is right.

[02:17:44.250 --> 02:17:44.810]
She grabbed it.

[02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:47.910]
And it says the headline on it is it says,

[02:17:48.050 --> 02:17:52.370]
John McCain veered away from a handshake with Barack Obama after last night's presidential debate.

[02:17:52.650 --> 02:17:55.590]
He's a bitter, sour, condescending old koot.

[02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:57.050]
A redneck.

[02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:59.430]
Real piece of crap.

[02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.950]
Insane McCain.

[02:18:01.530 --> 02:18:02.550]
All your people are in the McCain.

[02:18:02.850 --> 02:18:04.970]
Turn over to Jimmy Cifilis, Mourning's, and Iodina.

[02:18:05.350 --> 02:18:07.650]
You get all the right wing propaganda you can handle and then some.

[02:18:08.530 --> 02:18:09.270]
What a disgrace.

[02:18:09.710 --> 02:18:10.930]
Nice going there, Ken Charles.

[02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:13.030]
All fascist radio.

[02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:16.990]
I can't wait for the billboards to start going up for IOD with a swastikers on them.

[02:18:18.410 --> 02:18:23.690]
In fact, they ought to dress up all the IOD people with like little, the hats, you know, the KKK hats.

[02:18:26.390 --> 02:18:28.030]
They all be dressed up like that.

[02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.910]
Now, and I hope that's it.

[02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.730]
They blew out Le Mans.

[02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:33.010]
They blew out Fuddy because they were both to the left of a till of a hunt.

[02:18:34.430 --> 02:18:35.750]
And they both sucked on the air.

[02:18:35.850 --> 02:18:36.710]
But that's beside the point.

[02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:39.450]
It's not that whether you're good on the air or not or whether you belong on the air.

[02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:41.410]
It's if you're far enough to the right of Hitler.

[02:18:43.010 --> 02:18:44.030]
That's what it's all about.

[02:18:44.430 --> 02:18:47.110]
And Pailin, by the way, she makes Hitler look like a Sunday school teacher.

[02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:52.230]
The crap that she's spewing in the hate that just a hate-mongering bitch.

[02:18:53.810 --> 02:18:54.170]
God.

[02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:56.450]
Spewing it out.

[02:18:56.610 --> 02:18:57.630]
And the crowd will kill him.

[02:18:57.850 --> 02:19:00.170]
Kill him, you know, really good stuff that they're whipping up.

[02:19:00.170 --> 02:19:00.470]
Oh yeah.

[02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:01.450]
Mm-hmm.

[02:19:02.110 --> 02:19:03.030]
Whipping up the great hate.

[02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:11.910]
We will all need to pull our weight.

[02:19:12.850 --> 02:19:15.010]
All of us will need to pull our weight.

[02:19:15.330 --> 02:19:20.010]
All of us will have to redouble our sense of commitment.

[02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:22.610]
We're going to have to regain our nerve.

[02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:26.290]
Our vision has done only 81.

[02:19:26.610 --> 02:19:27.950]
Because now more than ever.

[02:19:28.090 --> 02:19:28.530]
74.

[02:19:30.050 --> 02:19:35.750]
What this crisis has taught us is that at the end of the day, there's no real.

[02:19:36.050 --> 02:19:36.490]
77.

[02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:37.770]
The remaining street of Wall Street.

[02:19:37.930 --> 02:19:40.770]
There's only the road we're traveling on together as Americans.

[02:19:42.110 --> 02:19:45.770]
We will rise or fall on that journey as one nation and one people.

[02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:51.750]
This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we haven't seen in the middle of a century.

[02:19:52.310 --> 02:19:58.250]
The future generations will judge us by how we respond to this test.

[02:19:59.110 --> 02:20:03.290]
Will they say that this was the time when America lost its weight, when it lost its purpose?

[02:20:04.110 --> 02:20:10.390]
When we allowed our petty differences, our broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession?

[02:20:11.410 --> 02:20:16.350]
Or will they say this was another one of those moments when America overtained?

[02:20:17.350 --> 02:20:23.310]
When we battled back from adversity, when we recognized the common stake we have in each other's success,

[02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:26.410]
this is one of those moments in Indiana.

[02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:28.350]
I realize, you're cynical.

[02:20:28.890 --> 02:20:32.050]
I realize some of you are fed up with politics.

[02:20:32.050 --> 02:20:35.450]
I realize you're disappointed and even angry with your leaders.

[02:20:36.290 --> 02:20:37.730]
And you have every right to be.

[02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:46.270]
But despite all of this, I ask of you what's been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil.

[02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:49.130]
I ask you to believe.

[02:20:50.590 --> 02:20:51.770]
Believe in yourselves.

[02:20:52.830 --> 02:20:53.990]
Believe in each other.

[02:20:54.930 --> 02:20:56.990]
Believe in the future we can build together.

[02:20:58.290 --> 02:21:00.130]
Because together we cannot fail.

[02:21:01.290 --> 02:21:02.550]
Look at this crowd here today.

[02:21:02.770 --> 02:21:07.910]
Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, rich, poor.

[02:21:08.490 --> 02:21:10.350]
We cannot fail. Not now.

[02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:15.910]
Now when we have a crisis to solve, now when we have an economy to save,

[02:21:16.510 --> 02:21:19.850]
now when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes,

[02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:22.690]
now when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor.

[02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:27.830]
Now that that was down to only 56 points, the CEO Obama speaks and people, their confidence is restored.

[02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:31.750]
And they call up their broker and they say, buy, buy, buy, buy.

[02:21:32.290 --> 02:21:34.190]
You know what they say? When they call up their broker.

[02:21:35.210 --> 02:21:35.990]
Buy, buy, buy!

[02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:38.370]
Down to only 44 now.

[02:21:38.470 --> 02:21:42.470]
I wouldn't be surprised by the time he finishes this speech in Indiana that it's in positive territory.

[02:21:42.470 --> 02:21:45.030]
You think they're just a coincidence? No way.

[02:21:46.430 --> 02:21:49.230]
Call up your bookie. Go to the phone as Brent Mausberger once said.

[02:21:49.410 --> 02:21:50.530]
Rush to call and get on the phone.

[02:21:52.410 --> 02:21:53.610]
He supports people, man.

[02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:55.710]
Such a bunch of hypocrites, such a bunch of phonies.

[02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:57.870]
Phony Baloney.

[02:21:58.530 --> 02:22:02.570]
Remember when we first came to this station and all these people, even Doug Donney B had a bookie.

[02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:03.010]
Remember that?

[02:22:03.210 --> 02:22:05.630]
Oh, he was a nasty, surly kid.

[02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:09.430]
Wasn't the kid, he was like, what was he about, 88?

[02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:12.430]
He was part of that whole gambling fraternity.

[02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:15.050]
Hank had the whole bullpen full of chronic gambors.

[02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:18.430]
And what was the kid, Jason Jerkball? What was his name?

[02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:19.750]
Bloss ball.

[02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.930]
Bloss ball.

[02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:24.150]
And he's the one that gave me that movie that I still haven't watched.

[02:22:24.330 --> 02:22:25.550]
What is it, the prison movie?

[02:22:28.530 --> 02:22:29.090]
Charshank Redemption.

[02:22:29.410 --> 02:22:30.090]
Charshank Redemption.

[02:22:30.430 --> 02:22:31.750]
Oh, do you watch Charshank yet? No.

[02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:35.570]
I watch that at the same time that I watch the one about the Jews.

[02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:40.410]
Shibos list.

[02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:41.450]
Shin Liz list.

[02:22:41.770 --> 02:22:42.990]
End of Mycene Man.

[02:22:43.450 --> 02:22:44.370]
In fact, you know what?

[02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:47.910]
There's a much better chance I'm going to watch of Mycene Man than I'm going to watch either of those other two.

[02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:50.050]
Well, you ought to watch a good movie.

[02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:53.790]
Now it's down to only 27.

[02:22:54.170 --> 02:22:55.270]
There's a place called America.

[02:22:55.730 --> 02:22:56.090]
Lizard.

[02:22:56.450 --> 02:22:57.070]
Well, let's go there.

[02:22:57.970 --> 02:23:02.090]
Lorian Baltimore says I have the Fox News pool when they asked him one last night to bait on a browser window.

[02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:05.270]
Right now, the score is Obama's 60% McCain 40%.

[02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:09.690]
Even on Fox fake news, as Keith Olberman calls it, fix news.

[02:23:10.390 --> 02:23:11.510]
It might be free, though.

[02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:13.050]
I've voted for Obama three times already.

[02:23:13.150 --> 02:23:13.970]
She says that's okay.

[02:23:14.310 --> 02:23:17.070]
If it's good enough for the right wingers, let the rest of the people free.

[02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:19.030]
When it out, get the old freak out.

[02:23:19.950 --> 02:23:22.790]
Catherine says, yes, old T-bags are really disgusting.

[02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.250]
Love you.

[02:23:24.310 --> 02:23:24.990]
43 feet.

[02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:27.290]
43 year old female listening for 20 years.

[02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.570]
How do you like that?

[02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:29.690]
All right.

[02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:30.850]
That a 43 year old lady.

[02:23:30.850 --> 02:23:33.870]
And as Joe Rose would say, how are you doing with the ladies?

[02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:37.890]
Who was he talking about in regard to that summer?

[02:23:38.010 --> 02:23:38.970]
Some old goat.

[02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:41.670]
And he was saying, how are you doing with the ladies?

[02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:43.290]
And I thought to myself, I don't know when.

[02:23:44.290 --> 02:23:46.450]
He was talking about that yesterday when it was first March 10.

[02:23:47.370 --> 02:23:47.610]
Oh, yeah.

[02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:48.270]
Jacques Martin.

[02:23:48.570 --> 02:23:49.510]
Is that who he was talking about?

[02:23:49.810 --> 02:23:50.310]
I think so.

[02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:52.010]
Oh, my God.

[02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:54.210]
How are you doing with the frogettes?

[02:23:54.650 --> 02:23:54.870]
God.

[02:23:55.430 --> 02:23:56.310]
The biggest name.

[02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:57.390]
The best talent.

[02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:58.130]
Your project.

[02:23:58.990 --> 02:24:00.110]
40,000.

[02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.190]
40,000.

[02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.730]
60,000.

[02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:01.650]
A Nick.

[02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:02.930]
Fourth leader.

[02:24:03.450 --> 02:24:04.610]
The biggest names.

[02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:06.010]
The best talent.

[02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:07.910]
It's the big dog, Joe Rose.

[02:24:08.110 --> 02:24:08.830]
That was up 1.

[02:24:09.310 --> 02:24:09.870]
4710.

[02:24:10.470 --> 02:24:12.150]
Sports radio, 560,000.

[02:24:12.270 --> 02:24:12.670]
A-M.

[02:24:12.930 --> 02:24:14.430]
The sports leader.

[02:24:15.390 --> 02:24:16.510]
Down 8 points now.

[02:24:17.530 --> 02:24:20.210]
Sports bag radio, WQA.

[02:24:20.290 --> 02:24:21.450]
Down 13 points now.

[02:24:21.790 --> 02:24:22.690]
That's so ****.

[02:24:24.090 --> 02:24:25.830]
And up on the alphabet, Gimelnetwork.

[02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:27.270]
It's the end of the year, spectacular.

[02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:28.690]
Everyone's stressing about.

[02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:29.490]
Deic Clarks.

[02:24:29.490 --> 02:24:31.130]
He brewed New Year's rock and eaves.

[02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:36.790]
They could buy it at 5768 and help blow the show far off of 5769 with a cast of Jewish stars.

[02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:39.270]
Featuring the Borscht Belt comedy-stylings of Jerry Seinfeld.

[02:24:40.650 --> 02:24:42.770]
What is the deal with Rosha Shana?

[02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:43.730]
What's the rush?

[02:24:44.510 --> 02:24:45.690]
I don't know who's this chick.

[02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:46.390]
Rosha Shana.

[02:24:47.330 --> 02:24:48.290]
Sarah Silverme.

[02:24:48.450 --> 02:24:48.650]
What?

[02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:50.870]
Amy Winehouse is in July?

[02:24:52.530 --> 02:24:53.990]
Someone should tell her fate.

[02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:57.010]
Look at my ****.

[02:24:57.010 --> 02:24:58.070]
The Beastie Boy.

[02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:59.170]
The Rassha Shana.

[02:24:59.330 --> 02:25:00.410]
The Rassha Shana.

[02:25:01.130 --> 02:25:05.810]
Plus David Swimmer, Lenny Kravitz, Andy Sandberg, Winona Ryder, and Adam Sandler.

[02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:08.150]
Not a Jewish rich kid here.

[02:25:08.810 --> 02:25:10.990]
It's the Jewish New Year.

[02:25:11.310 --> 02:25:13.470]
Dick Clarks Hebrew New Year's rock and eaves.

[02:25:13.650 --> 02:25:15.270]
It's gonna blow your took us off.

[02:25:15.450 --> 02:25:16.770]
What are you going to watch something else?

[02:25:17.010 --> 02:25:18.450]
About down 20 points.

[02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:19.590]
Well 20's not bad, huh?

[02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:23.410]
And they got Ali Feltching on it to reassure everybody that he's a real serial queen.

[02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:25.010]
Worth paying attention and...

[02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.890]
Oh my God.

[02:25:26.050 --> 02:25:27.130]
Get her off my screen.

[02:25:27.390 --> 02:25:28.770]
I'm going over to MSNBC.

[02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:32.410]
Maybe they got Richard Wolfhunter again with those funky little glasses.

[02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:35.730]
Now they got some other Bill Burton, the Obama campaign spokesman.

[02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:43.970]
The way to stir up feelings about Senator Obama that maybe are negative, but ultimately have nothing

[02:25:43.970 --> 02:25:46.970]
to do with the challenges that are facing the American people.
