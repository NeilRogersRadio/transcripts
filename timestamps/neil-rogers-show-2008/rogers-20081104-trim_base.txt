Maybe you can look at the image.

[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.060]

Rock says you're not it with them.

[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.740]
Looks like he's from much getting land.

[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.540]
How did he get?

[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.480]

[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.540]
All in the air there's a joke on his face.

[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.600]
How did he get?

[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.700]
Who is the better?

[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.840]
Rock looks like the cute zip of wax.

[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.280]
And how about an earwax tax?

[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.880]

And now it's time to end this song.

[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.960]
Like it is, it's going on too long.

[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.480]
We can still grab perfect terms.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.120]
It's like that.

[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.900]

expressed there are no items in this view all right sports fans all right

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.040]

[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.500]
about 75 people in line my precinct is east sunrise and the

[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.960]
relapse of elderly already out of 10 hour the morning I finally got into

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.900]
voted eight eight a.m. it took all of five to six minutes some suggestions to

[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.060]
help the voting go back to computers the amount of paper that's wasted with

[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.280]
these ballots is killing lots of trees it would have been so easy to adapt

[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.640]
to printed the prior electronic voting machines but our representatives would

[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.500]
rather spend money we don't have ballots in English only speak in English if

[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.520]
you can't bring in a read English you shouldn't be voting no speaky English

[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.440]
Paula no speaky English make the voting hours between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. for

[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.700]
people who have to get to work make a requirement that a high school high school

[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.160]
seniors work the polls for their community service hours but also expose them

[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.440]
to the civic duty that everybody needs to do do your civic duty I did my duty

[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.060]
this morning

[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.960]
aren't you proud of me yes very much so heavy duty the system isn't perfect but

[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.280]
it's all regards is Paula but we do need to allow more parties to be involved

[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.840]

disqualified will receive a notice but there's nothing can be done for it for

[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.200]

[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.340]
it back and make changes what's in the box the 200 disqualified ballots were

[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.880]

how it's reported of eighty five thousand dollars the contribution is so

[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.560]
voluntary that it must be made within ten days the FCC insists it's voluntary but

[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.040]
you better do it or else in exchange the complaints go away in the way it's

[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:18.760]

[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.720]
nevertheless I'm speaking of a Joe the plumber

[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.660]
he's had run ins with John McCain and Sarah Palin last few days and also had a

[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.840]
running with a Toledo police

[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.520]
can you believe that an upstanding guy like Joe

[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:50.920]
nope

[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.660]
Samuel Joseph or is a biker was stopped by two Toledo police officers after he was

[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.580]
clonco and fifty miles an hour in a thirty five zone on Doris Street until

[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:00.420]

[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.500]
officer realized who he pulled over a second officer gave werezel biker

[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.980]
a verbal warning and released him

[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:10.560]

[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.140]
they like his ball spot

[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.480]
a police report obtained by NBC twenty four states that the patrol unit did not

[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.780]
issue a citation to werezel biker because it felt doing so would have negative

[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.080]
repercussions of the department and city as a whole

[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.800]

[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.640]
gross misconduct after allegedly performing on lawful search of werezel biker

[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.740]

[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.080]
issued a citation since it was a legitimate traffic violation all we don't

[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.400]
Obama is the honest asswashing of my mostly my mostly unwanted prejudice says

[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.800]
whoever this is for all my years you know like when you're in a bad mood get cut

[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.280]

into your head oh yeah I know exactly I want Obama's election to make that

[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.220]
involuntary reaction somehow less durable and I really believe that a second

welcome benefit will be our African-American friends feeling better about

[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.820]

early voting totals from the various counties based on party

[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.340]
registration not based on who they voted for they don't count the votes to

[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.380]
the polls close they just hear what they want to hear

[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.740]

was curious to see what a large ass was spewing what such a big lead for Obama

[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.560]
the first thing I heard was an anti abortion commercial I immediately turned

you know the fact that he couldn't instant message me and like interrupt in

[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.880]
the middle of the show which which we had a lot of fun doing that but it was

[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.000]
just slowing down my computer and the aim of all those things man of all the

[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.280]
instant messaging things now aim is the worst and you want to know why because

[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.300]

[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.520]
coming to you away drives me nuts all those sirens just never stops

[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.240]
Danny a 26 year old white voter in brownwood says you want to add another factor in the early voting

[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:23.120]
stance you just read plenty of young registered republicans such as myself are voting for obama all

[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:28.220]
right Danny as a registered republican I'm at birthed about how weak McCain and Pail and R yes

[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.920]
McCain did serve our country honorably but his health care plan and worst strategy are paths

[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.020]
until America resolves these two important issues things will only continue to worsen

[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:41.440]
furthermore McCain is a dottering old koot very well said I couldn't have said it better myself

[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.660]
and I'm sure I did many times a dottering old koot who probably plays golf with Moe and his

[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:50.640]
campaign in Florida maybe Moe can lend him one of his Sunday dress hair pieces it can only help

[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:56.080]
maybe one day I'll vote for republican again once they can be physically responsible and not

[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.080]
be under the guise of will enact a spending freeze and take the corruption out of Washington oh yeah

[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.000]
forgot that's not likely to happen if they can't do it maybe the republican party's biggest

[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.100]
supporter Jesus Christ can do it send Sarah Pail and back to Alaska so she and her family can

[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.460]
make more babies that cute little baby maybe this will help her reconsider her stance on abortion

[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:20.600]
ps happy birthday and dodo dodo and bring Greg read back excellent facts email whatever it is Danny

[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.900]
already there why complicate things and move to another chat program for no reason when there were

[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.760]
no problems with aim first it was only courtous I wanted to put in front of a firing squad meaning

[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.380]

[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:15.700]
I don't get it oh well I'm sure it's really cute I just don't have time to pucks you around with it

[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:20.540]
jack says first off happy birthday in your life glad I voted on the fourth day of early voting only

[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:25.140]
waited two hours which seems like a fair shake compared to what others have endured for Obama of course

[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:31.140]
I hate Sarah Pailin McCain's guts there's nothing that makes me sicker than these two phony liars

[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.820]
actually something does make me sicker any gullible schmuck that buys into their agenda green

[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:41.080]
two three vote in crowd can hop back on a raft and use McCain Pailin signs as or as if they don't

[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.860]
like it after machine loses the election he can order Pailin to wipe his ass while his buddy joth

[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:55.080]
a plumber unclogs his backed up toilet wow a little bit on the surly side huh just a little Bobby says

[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.480]
went to a polling place in Coral Springs a hundred people in line about 50 minute wait the problem

[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.940]
is the ballot is printed in three languages English Spanish and Creole oh my god speak it in

[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:11.760]
English speak it in English the site had two machines to read the ballot only a one worked here we

[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:19.660]
go again in Florida says Bobby I did vote for Obama I like so food and reggae music not fried chicken

[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.660]
in country music I'm a white woman by the way says Bobby thank you Bobby she do like her fried

[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:31.800]
chicken she didn't say whether she goes to like her churches or Kentucky fry or bow jangles

[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:37.340]
all right I just got tons of stuff here so you ask for something and you get almost a little bit

[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:42.140]
hey can you play looking for a leader by Neil Young yeah like I got that happy birthday you old

[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:48.260]
coots his Greg I can see Cuba from my house go all by my you the best okay well they're just

[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.420]
uh-huh that's what you said yeah that's exactly what I mean then you got branded all P.O.D

[00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:02.760]
my good close personal buddy I've only got two friends from my space the professor and

[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.800]
brand and the rest of morale like uh and Ricky once in a while he's not busy trying to straighten

[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:13.380]
his life out but then aren't we all despite an average NFL player salary of more than a million

[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.640]
dollars it's hardly automatic that players overwhelmingly favor Republican policies often

[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.940]
associated with a wealthy more than 70% of NFL players are African-Americans and many are from

[00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:27.790]
Democratic backgrounds thank god because on QA and is that what we're concerned about is

[00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:34.530]
politics politics in the locker room you bet politics in the showers baby morals go into it

[00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:38.290]
says Cleveland Browns receiver Braille and Edwards you have to have some awareness what you're voting for

[00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:43.350]
yeah there's high morals in the NFL there's no question about that in this campaign the possibility

[00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:47.270]
of Obama becoming the first African-American presence appealing to some players for its social

[00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:52.130]
significance it's special to me but I think it should be special everybody really said if he

[00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:56.290]
told me he goes running back Brian Westbrook this country's built on diversity different races

[00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:00.030]
mingling different cultures from around the world mingling it would seem to me it would only be natural

[00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:05.150]
at it at this point in time the political scene would be diverse as well it's diverse and perverse

[00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:09.490]
Brian regardless of which side on the political fence they're on several players

[00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.810]
echo the nation at large inciting economic issues at the top priority for new present

[00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:17.330]
and driving force for how they'll vote some NFL players are not a world away from economic

[00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:22.650]
ails such as layoffs or plant closings that happen to the economy I think we relate very well

[00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:27.270]
says Scott most of us are from lower-class homes so where we may be blinded with our family members

[00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:31.570]
are not we feel it when they call and say hey man I can't pay my rent I lost my job can you help

[00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:35.750]
me with this we feel it because we carry the weight of so many people we can't continue to take

[00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:39.450]
care of everybody because eventually we'll be poor that's how I feel we want to see them help

[00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:45.430]
themselves even so some players don't want to hear endorsements or opinions from many of their

[00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:50.570]
colleagues Dallas Cowboys linebackers Zach Thomas speaking a red next says he watched all the

[00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:54.190]
presidential debates kept abreast of the news shows and study the issues but he doesn't dare speak

[00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.530]
publicly about the candidate he supports oh I can't even imagine can you imagine who's act

[00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:05.070]
Thomas supports well president Bush probably since he's a Texas guy whenever I've seen talk

[00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:09.810]
from actors football players whoever really rubs me wrong sack says most of the time they don't even

[00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:12.930]
know the key issues so I'm not going to be that cock because I don't know enough well that's for

[00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:18.250]
damn sure jets defensive tackle Chris Jenkins mean while the type of voter that both candidates have

[00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.190]
been trying to woo during the stretch run of their campaigns he's an underside independent

[00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:26.370]
after a stellar performance at Buffalo on Sunday Jenkins said he looks forward to the research

[00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:30.030]
they would help make up his mind he planned to huddle with his wife and compare the candidates

[00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:38.130]
positions on various issues he's gonna huddle with his wife oh my god oh these jocks it's just

[00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:43.970]
I don't know whether to laugh or cry it's hardly surprising that many players cite taxes as a

[00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:49.010]
key issue Tennessee Titans tight end algae crumpler despite his wealth isn't sold on the merits of

[00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:53.370]
tax credits of Bush Institute of three years ago and McCain's pledge to continue the overwhelming

[00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:56.650]
majority of the American people aren't doing as well as they were three years ago before those

[00:50:56.650 --> 00:51:00.190]
tax credits had crumpler and Obama supporter I believe in bottom line philosophy

[00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:06.370]
Commissioner Roger Goudelle whose late father Charles served in the Senate a Republican from

[00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:10.130]
New York is excited that interest in the campaign has inspired millions of new voters to engage in

[00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:16.170]
the process but a bit a bit about who cares about Roger Goudelle that would be like somebody

[00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:22.210]
caring about the Bud Light all these commissioners man well what is that all about oh and by the way Bill

[00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:26.970]
I got eight million emails here and you're letting me ramble on about dumb jocks in the locker room

[00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:32.310]
dumb jocks white jocks aren't allowed to vote by the way rednecks you're not allowed to vote

[00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:36.550]
the North of us do is definitely deny even try to vote they'll turn your ass away they'll take away your

[00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:44.470]
titsis is Geary Surner running around with titsis I'm not sure what that is

[00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:54.510]
and the Yarmulka and a tallest he has been around with this shirt half button and his like

[00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:58.070]
chest I think I want to talk Kevin Wallace with a tallest at the pump in a park

[00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:02.370]
bill says I had one of those burgers and it was terrible I went back in with one bite out and got my

[00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:08.830]
money back don't try it he took one bite out of it and he threw it at him said fah give me my money

[00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:16.210]
back don't try he said hmm then sound to promising then sound like hardy's doesn't no way I sure

[00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:23.170]
love hardy's no shroom burgers hmm why don't we have hardies in the south Florida I don't know

[00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:27.210]
no it maybe you guys get together open up a franchise I was gonna say why should you why

they look like that well. When I'm all done living

[00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.870]
so I want you to help go to hell. You are the living

[00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:49.310]
and hell of the edge. Feel like you're living

[00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.090]
and hell. Because when I die, then what I'm

[00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:56.170]
trying. You're going to have a dumb bitch

[00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:59.730]
hot mom who will be the most powerful leader in

[00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.370]
the world to carry on my friend.

[00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:03.330]
I'm not a fucking idiot.

[00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:07.410]
God is catching us. See my, my supporters

[00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:11.270]
want you to live. But yeah, he's not an

[00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:14.370]
a-rap, I'm a friend. For an intellectual

[00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:18.730]
but that one is a- I think it's a danger just

[00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:20.990]
not. Remember my would-I-shave-I-creation

[00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:22.950]
and I'm a crazy, great man. The

[00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.090]
maverick dish with a nightmare. Thank you,

[00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:28.170]
Brenda, man. Not long to go. Here I go now.

[00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:31.450]
I'm a filter, so that's it. Change my

[00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:35.230]
diaper. Go straight to wealth, children.

[00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:38.430]
Spread this. Go straight to the whole

[00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:42.370]
floor. Just give it to me. I'm riddled with

[00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:44.450]
deadly cancer. I'm suffering from Alzheimer's,

[00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.630]
but I'm all the red things got to keep the

[00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:52.770]
White House why I eat. And when I die,

[00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.730]
my friends, when I'm dead dead in time,

[00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:01.430]
you might die. You're going to have

[00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:03.470]
a big, chucky man who will be the most

[00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:04.610]
powerful here in the world.

[00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:11.370]
My friends. Cut some bad news from Virginia.

[00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.610]
Oh, massive machine failures spurred

[00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:16.250]
called to extend Virginia voting hours

[00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:18.550]
details soon on the raw story. I'll keep my

[00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:20.650]
eye on it. Coincidence? I'll keep my

[00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:24.530]
fly on it. Yeah. Massive machine failures

[00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:26.430]
spurred called to extend Virginia voting hours.

[00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:28.190]
They're trying to figure out how to get the

[00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:30.790]
old fix in there. Well, they just got to watch, you know, Ohio

[00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:34.750]
from the last election. Maybe the judge

[00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:37.190]
with a big eye or the big flaring eye from

[00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:38.810]
Palm Beach County. Maybe he moved to Richmond,

[00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:43.150]
a row and oak. Or someplace else

[00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.870]
we're in Virginia. Oh, just it's just amazing.

[00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:47.750]
If they steal another one, man, I'm moving.

[00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:51.450]
I'm leaving the US. Jason says you can

[00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:53.510]
configure aim not to start a window startup.

[00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:55.910]
I'm sure Chris could walk me through that.

[00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:59.170]
Yep. You could. Yep. Yep.

[00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:01.250]
Yep. Yep. Yep. You don't sound too enthusiastic

[00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.170]
about it. If you want me to walk

[00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:05.470]
to the tomorrow morning, my will work on it.

[00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:08.630]
I'll put that on top of my pile there, so I see it.

[00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.150]
And we'll think about it.

[00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:14.370]
Bill says last night in Stewart, my neighbors

[00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.530]
and I cut some old parts, seeming Obama signs.

[00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.590]
It was driving a Lincoln or something of this sort.

[00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:20.950]
And had a special Air Force floor to tag.

[00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:23.950]
We grabbed the sign back from him,

[00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.650]
noted many turn up Obama signs in the back of his car.

[00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:29.910]
We asked him what the hell he was doing. He said he wanted to sign.

[00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:35.310]
He said he wanted to sign for his yard as he made a getaway.

[00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:38.130]
I called the Stewart police. Now there's a joke.

[00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.130]
It says who didn't seem to care and gave him his tag number

[00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:42.190]
and voted for Obama today. Nice going, Bill.

[00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:44.970]
Shoot the son of a bitch. That's all.

[00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:47.670]
I wanted one for his own yard. Right.

[00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:53.050]
Your mama. Ed says mushroom swiss is great if you get it not loaded.

[00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:56.290]
I think you're loaded. I have no idea what that mean.

[00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:59.930]
Get it not loaded. I guess now is everything.

[00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:04.710]
What? Not with like, you know, pickles and lettuce and tomatoes and stuff.

[00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:06.630]
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce.

[00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:08.410]
Ooh, who would put that in fact? Chris.

[00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:10.570]
That's not a mushroom. That sounds gross.

[00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.070]
Anyways, who would put lettuce and tomato on a mushroom swiss burger anyway?

[00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:14.570]
A fool.

[00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:18.130]
Brandences have preferred burger king over McDonald's,

[00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:20.470]
but I don't recommend getting any specialty burgers from BK.

[00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.990]
They usually are not good except for the BK Stacker,

[00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:26.650]
which is very good. And there was a hearties in Haley a million years ago on 49th Street.

[00:59:27.610 --> 00:59:29.310]
Seems to be I may remember that.

[00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:33.930]
I lived in Haley lakes for like a few months.

[00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:42.170]
1976 I'm thinking.

[00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:45.210]
Well, what a nightmare that was.

[00:59:46.110 --> 00:59:49.690]
And the apartment was just loaded with bugs and flies and.

[00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:52.490]
But that's the way it goes. That's Haley.

[00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:55.390]
They probably came in from the racetrack.

[00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.270]
Nice going, Brunetti. You did a beautiful job on that place.

[00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.690]
Man.

[01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.630]
Anyway, the thing about specialty burgers,

[01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:05.290]
let me say again, you got to go a long way to beat the the.

[01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:08.830]
Anus burger with the bacon and cheddar and Mickey D's.

[01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:12.290]
I know you can't get it, but boy, someday you will be able to get it.

[01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:13.770]
And then you'll say, oh, and the old man was right.

[01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.570]
Someday when they have me in a box, somebody will say,

[01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:19.230]
you know, the old man was right. These are pretty good.

[01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:23.010]
Well, you know, like fat Chris, he'll be a chomping on two or three of them.

[01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:23.550]
Sure.

[01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:26.330]
You can't eat two or three of those. Let me tell you.

[01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.950]
They got those big pastry buns, whatever the hell that means.

[01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.830]
Even a fat cow like you can't eat two or three of those.

[01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:38.250]
Even a fat pig like me can't even somebody could either have gone on the ice cream in one sitting.

[01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.990]
I'm also you don't believe that, do you?

[01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.530]
That's just a while.

[01:00:43.350 --> 01:00:46.250]
So what? That's just wow to me. Wow.

[01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:49.470]
Oh, speaking of wow.

[01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.070]
The fuck is stopping at your desk?

[01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.950]
It's your desk.

[01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:53.250]
You have to work in a place.

[01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.030]
He's winking and blanking, honey.

[01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:57.850]
She, you know, something she may, I don't know who makes me angry or her or Julie Burman.

[01:00:57.850 --> 01:00:58.970]
Or Gary Sarner.

[01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:00.610]
It's close.

[01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:03.830]
Oh, that Gary Sarner. What a puss.

[01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:06.370]
If you look up puts in the dictionary, his picture is next to it.

[01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:10.890]
If you look up Schmendrich, Schlamazel, Hein Mjonkel, there is Gary Sarner.

[01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:15.150]
David says, hey, happy birthday.

[01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:16.810]
You know, I went and voted this morning in Hollywood.

[01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.550]
The line wasn't too long, but they only had five boots.

[01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.090]
I was there for about two hours.

[01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.350]
I voted for Obama. Hopefully my vote gets counted this year.

[01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:26.610]
Yeah, it would be nice if the Obama votes get counted, especially in Virginia.

[01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:30.070]
It would be nice where they seem to be having some defugal these already.

[01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:31.570]
It's not even noon yet.

[01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:33.630]
And they're already having some issues.

[01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.770]
Now, the polls closing for Virginia allegedly at seven.

[01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:38.830]
But they were thinking about maybe extending that.

[01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:41.310]
Let me see if this thing, uh, on raw story.

[01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:42.130]
If they have the details.

[01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:46.090]
Now, still says soon, soon.

[01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:51.750]
Rachel Maddow, that the pastie dog says, election day chaos may age EOP.

[01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.370]
Now, what does that mean?

[01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:56.610]
Not sure.

[01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:00.730]
The election day chaos, election system is the weak link.

[01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.930]
And the Obama strategy says Rachel.

[01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:04.970]
Well, you know, still can't deal with her.

[01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:06.950]
Pastie and weak.

[01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:08.410]
And she's got all the same.

[01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.990]
She's all the same talking heads from Oberman air every single one of them.

[01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:13.010]
She's like Oberman light.

[01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:15.010]
Exactly. Oberman, Jr.

[01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:18.130]
George says the marathon is over.

[01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:19.110]
I'm cautiously optimistic.

[01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:20.990]
I don't think the Republicans are going to steal this one.

[01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:24.190]
The truth is these guys don't have the campaign machine that bushed it.

[01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:27.430]
There were a lot less scary in that regard than the bushies.

[01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.270]
What I'm concerned about is the type of campaign McCain has run.

[01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:31.490]
It's not just the hate.

[01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:36.550]
It's the way the same catchphrases are repeated like a drumbeat, especially by that witch palin.

[01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:40.230]
It's like watching kindergarten teacher talking to her students about sexual predators.

[01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:45.710]
It should come off to these folks as instantioring condescending, but instead they follow suit and boo,

[01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:49.390]
along with some occasionally shouting, kill the nigger, just like a kindergarten class.

[01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:55.170]
Psychologically, these people are whipped up to an almost trans-like state.

[01:02:55.710 --> 01:03:01.730]
Where does that venom in vitriol go tomorrow morning when they wake up to a country headed by someone who many of them see as the antichrist?

[01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:02.890]
Scary stuff.

[01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:06.490]
Well, I guess it's fitting that tomorrow will be the birthday of...

[01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:07.210]
Oh, God!

[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.290]
What better way to watch her in the rain of the antichrist?

[01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:11.850]
Have a happy, safe, healthy birthday, sir, George.

[01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:12.450]
Thank you, George.

[01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:15.330]
See how it totally, they're all whipped up to a frenzy.

[01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:18.030]
We've got 80 billion emails now in spite of fact Chris saying,

[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:21.450]
oh, they're not going to talk to you today. They hate you. They want George back.

[01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:22.030]
Uh-huh.

[01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:25.830]
Brandon's right about you.

[01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:27.750]
You're evil.

[01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:31.930]
In fact, wouldn't be... wouldn't surprise me at all if you're on your days off from Joe Bell,

[01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:32.890]
like when he was out in Denver.

[01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.610]
You're doing gerry serner on the side.

[01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:35.490]
Oh, definitely not.

[01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:36.530]
Wow, definitely not.

[01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.750]
Oh, my.

[01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:39.370]
Oh, my what?

[01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:41.230]
That's just another bad visual.

[01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:42.230]
Oh, my God.

[01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:46.570]
Who will the top and who's the bottom and that situation?

[01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:48.570]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:51.930]
Fat Chris and Gary serner.

[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:53.050]
Good.

[01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:54.690]
I heard serner was the power bottom.

[01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:55.590]
You're really disgusting.

[01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:00.170]
A power bottom.

[01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:01.870]
Oh, God.

[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:03.270]
Woo.

[01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:05.150]
I hear he's got a power that's a rumor.

[01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:05.650]
I'm spreading.

[01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:14.150]
You know, I just liked him intensely before, but when you told me that he's running around shooting a mouth off about the fact he's voting for McKinna's wife is voting for Obama.

[01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:16.430]
I think that's solidified.

[01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:20.510]
That just, you know, solidified his standing in my mind.

[01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:22.710]
I think he cares, you know, because you know that seals the permit.

[01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:24.170]
They're all experts.

[01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:27.110]
1695 on that poll.

[01:04:27.250 --> 01:04:29.130]
I'm leaving it at the same until we get at least like 1700.

[01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:34.310]
All right, this is Chee Gordon-Liddy and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:36.730]
Absolutely.

[01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:48.650]
Ground control to major Patel.

[01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:55.650]
Ground control to major Patel.

[01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:05.090]
Take your curry pills and put your turban on.

[01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:09.670]
Hey, ground control to major Patel.

[01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:12.150]
Seven eleven.

[01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:15.930]
Countdown is commenting.

[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:17.450]
Yes, my friend.

[01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:20.470]
Two.

[01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.890]
Push your head dot and make she was loved with you.

[01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:30.830]
This is major Patel to ground control.

[01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:35.070]
I'm hating for the moon.

[01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:41.790]
And it looks like the moon dies in Neil III.

[01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:49.350]
And I'm so happy I have my space to be.

[01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:56.890]
This beach standing behind the counter.

[01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:04.590]
Twenty hours a day.

[01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:11.650]
On planet Earth, my friend, I say thank you come again.

[01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:17.010]
Thank you come again.

[01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:22.070]
Okay, FlynnJavi, 1131 at 560 WQM Happy Election Day tour.

[01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:25.390]
We got 50 billion emails today,

[01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:29.430]
boy it's going to take till midnight to read all these then all the returns will be in and then what

[01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:37.110]
I mean go to sleep and election monitoring group is asking officials in Virginia to address reports of

[01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:41.090]
massive voting machine failures and voters being turned away from the polls and it may go to court

[01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:49.110]
if no action is taken see they spread it around in 2000 was Florida in 2004 it was Ohio and now maybe

[01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:54.750]
it's going to be Virginia because they know that they you know they can't possibly win there in a

[01:06:54.750 --> 01:07:01.330]
fair election they're losing by like six seven points in Virginia they being the right wing the

[01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:07.770]
the Neocons the fascists the neo-Nazis election protection and nonprofit group aimed at cataloging

[01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:13.670]
correcting problems at the polls says it's received more than 27,000 calls from voters since five

[01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:18.250]
o'clock this morning most problems have been reported in Pennsylvania Virginia and New Jersey

[01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:22.850]
in Florida we don't want to be chicken little here said Jonah Goldman who directs the

[01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:27.090]
lawyers committee for civil rights campaign for fair elections what we're trying to do is

[01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:30.770]
respect what we're seeing out in the report what we're seeing out in the field unfortunately this

[01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:36.410]
is what we expected during a press conference this morning group representatives said they were

[01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:41.210]
asking election officials in Virginia to extend voting by two hours the group also wants elections

[01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:45.490]
to ensure that paper ballots are available in precincts where the electronic voting machines are

[01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:50.290]
down if elections officials failed to whack the group could file a lawsuit in federal court but

[01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:54.710]
it hopes to avoid that option we understand that litigation is the last and imperfect option

[01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:58.850]
goalberg said our first priority is to solve these problems collectively this isn't that same

[01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:05.510]
right wing self-hating Jew Jonah Goldberg is that the one it is no idea the group hope is voters are

[01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:09.010]
not discouraged by long lines or other problems throughout the day today federal law allows voters

[01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:14.270]
who are online at precincts before the polls close to cast regular ballots of course decide to

[01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:18.030]
extend voting hours people arrive at polling places after the polls would have closed have

[01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:23.350]
cast provisional ballots oh boy observers worry that voters in some areas have been given

[01:08:23.350 --> 01:08:27.970]
provisional ballots instead of regular paper ballots this creates the potential for disenfranchisement

[01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.910]
and complicates the process because provisional ballots aren't counted along with the rest of

[01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:35.110]
the election results here we go again i'm going to kill myself right now

[01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.390]

[01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.870]

races as a fellow scorpio in November 15 56 years old i wish you all the best keep on

[01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:31.670]
entertaining educating the masses what you do is important in relevant even if you

[01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:36.050]
don't think so oh i think so twice a month i think so on the 10th and 25th

[01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.410]
when those big fat paychecks come arriving at the box

[01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:45.090]
that's what i think another net it's not important

[01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:50.310]
mornas says would like to say happy birthday would also mention you give me

[01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:52.730]
years of enjoyment i moved to westchester new york after living in my

[01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:56.710]
me for 20 years i get up here in the first thing i hear is that joy reno's blah

[01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:59.210]
blah blah regards mct thank you mc

[01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:05.910]
mct my crop mcfriend how do you like that news from virginia

[01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:11.050]
well makes sense you know years and years ago

[01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:14.710]
we had voting machines with levers you know

[01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:18.190]
mm-hmm and you go behind a curtain and you flip the lever all the levers on the

[01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:21.310]
various races and that would be it would automatically tabulate in there

[01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:27.030]
and that was it that was it and when you watch the election coverage on tv

[01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:30.170]
didn't have any exit polling and they didn't tell you like at seven o'clock

[01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:34.810]
at night who won and who lost they would show you the actual hard count from

[01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:38.850]
each state and would go on for hours but it was like a dramatic you know

[01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:43.410]
like a little drama for your mama for obama

[01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:49.330]
now the people who cover the elections are much more important than the actual

[01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:53.510]
result itself or the candidates just ask them they'll tell you like chris mathews

[01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:57.310]
that's stupid who will never show up by the way he's annoying

[01:10:57.910 --> 01:11:02.310]
his his technique in interviewing is like starting to ask a question then when

[01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:05.810]
the guest starts answering the question he interrupts and keeps talking

[01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:09.530]
again blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah with his

[01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:13.950]
politics you know we can't even speak he is downright annoying he ought to be

[01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:16.290]
taken out with uri sarner put in a dumpster somewhere

[01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:21.890]
that's my assignment to flee after the election is overtake uri sarner out and put

[01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:24.670]

[01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:30.490]
door gladly stick his ugly nasty orthodox ass in there and then stick it in

[01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:34.390]
the next to a bunch of trief you know like bacon cheeseburger stuff like that

[01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:40.810]

[01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:41.970]

polling place had half the amount of voting machines eight that were available during the last

[01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:44.970]
election there was a huge line and the volunteers at the polling place were offering

[01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:49.930]
folks the chance to use paper ballots to expedite their voting no one took their offer we all

[01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:53.810]
waited a line about two hours till we were able to vote i guess they didn't count on the fact that

[01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:58.030]
folks are willing to wait in line rather than use paper ballots which can easily get lost or

[01:20:58.030 --> 01:21:02.770]
miscounted or just smith can now it appears that voting machines are having problems and

[01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:07.130]

Winter is the pizza.

[01:26:55.050 --> 01:26:58.030]
Special weather, fast and screwy of all food, dad.

[01:26:58.350 --> 01:27:01.390]

It's only one to four to eight to ten, I crashed at all.

[01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:10.950]
Final and time of the computers.

[01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:12.330]

[01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:22.490]
Final and time of the computers.

[01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:23.010]
Yes.

[01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:25.630]
Final and time of the computers.

[01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.610]
Yes.

[01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:28.850]
Final and time of the computers.

[01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:29.750]
Yes.

[01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:33.130]
Final and time of the computer.

[01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:36.710]
Final and time of the computers.

[01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:38.650]
Oh, there's Kerry Sanders in Miramar.

[01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:40.910]
Oh, there's a little bit of my shoulder here now.

[01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:42.050]
You can see the line here.

[01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:45.170]
It's been steady since, well, well before the poll's open,

[01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.950]
it's seven o'clock.

[01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.630]
Ain't no thing.

[01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.870]
Folks have been in line here moving through it

[01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:50.010]
about a two-hour clip.

[01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:51.730]
The line is shortened up a little bit,

[01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:53.170]
but you know, this is the lunch hour now,

[01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:55.010]
so people are just getting in their cars at work

[01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:57.330]
and getting out, so I suspect the line will probably

[01:27:57.330 --> 01:27:58.610]
lengthen up a little bit.

[01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:00.690]
One thing to note is a lot of people are going to be

[01:28:00.690 --> 01:28:04.450]
tuning in waiting for you to chuck to see what the exit polling

[01:28:04.450 --> 01:28:07.190]
and other suggestions are about which state is being called.

[01:28:07.690 --> 01:28:11.330]
The Florida polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

[01:28:11.730 --> 01:28:14.150]
But people forget Florida's a big state two-time.

[01:28:14.170 --> 01:28:14.670]
8 p.m.

[01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:17.770]
So, panhandle, baby, Pensacola, Tallahassee, all them rednecks,

[01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:19.110]
all them good old boys upstate.

[01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:22.850]
So the polls don't really close in Florida till 8 p.m.

[01:28:23.170 --> 01:28:24.650]
For you folks, till 7 p.m.

[01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:27.530]
Unless you're listening online in Pensacola and Redneck,

[01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:28.610]
we're all up there in the panhandle.

[01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:29.690]
Have we been in the panhandle?

[01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.670]
Oh, absolutely.

[01:28:31.150 --> 01:28:32.350]
I'd driven through it real fast.

[01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:35.710]
What do you mean, absolutely?

[01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:38.150]
Well, I went to Florida State and we drove it out.

[01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:40.490]
I lived in Tallahassee.

[01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:45.850]
And we would go over to Panama City to go to the Redneck River

[01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:48.490]
area that we'd call and hang out and do spring breaks.

[01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:49.830]
The beaches there are beautiful.

[01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:52.510]
Yeah, they are nice.

[01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:55.190]
And all the Christian retreats, they go over the beaches

[01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:57.210]
in Panama City and they screw their brains out

[01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:57.750]
on the beach.

[01:28:57.850 --> 01:28:59.390]
And Destin is real nice too.

[01:28:59.550 --> 01:29:00.290]
That's a nice beach.

[01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:01.450]
Destin?

[01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:02.370]
Mm-hmm.

[01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.990]
Ooh.

[01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:08.170]
Anyway, Bill says just to be correct, your repeated mistake,

[01:29:08.370 --> 01:29:09.790]
the loony was never at 72 cents.

[01:29:10.050 --> 01:29:11.510]
It was down to 77 cents, though.

[01:29:11.890 --> 01:29:12.930]
Well, excuse me.

[01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:13.870]
You made a mistake.

[01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:17.330]
And as far as never, not correct, it was 62 cents

[01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:18.910]
when I first came here about seven years ago.

[01:29:20.410 --> 01:29:22.390]
62, not 72, 62.

[01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:23.910]
Then it was a real bargain.

[01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:24.950]
Everything was like a bargain.

[01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:26.430]
The American dollar was worth something.

[01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:29.010]
Now it's back to like 86, 87 cents.

[01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:29.770]
That freaking loony.

[01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:30.510]
Oh my God.

[01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:31.770]
That's enough to drive you.

[01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:33.410]
Loony?

[01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:34.130]
Right.

[01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:35.770]
What happened to fat Chris?

[01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:36.570]
Is he like a laminar?

[01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:36.930]
I'm clear.

[01:29:37.570 --> 01:29:39.610]
I thought maybe the blood sugar rushed from all the food.

[01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:41.130]
You must have shoved in your pus this morning.

[01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:41.650]
Got to you.

[01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:43.450]
Oh, no, I haven't really had anything this morning.

[01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:44.210]
Well, why not?

[01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:46.310]
Because I get up and I come straight to work.

[01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:48.850]
I say, let's get some free food in there for the troops.

[01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.590]
It's election day for crying out loud.

[01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:52.930]
That would be the American thing to do.

[01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:55.230]
Yeah, except for your buddy, Jolly Jobelle.

[01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:56.370]
Oh, you can't do that.

[01:29:56.530 --> 01:29:57.270]
You can't do this.

[01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:58.070]
You can't say that.

[01:29:58.230 --> 01:29:58.930]
You can't say this.

[01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.790]
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum.

[01:29:59.790 --> 01:30:03.910]
A man who lives to make everyone else miserable.

[01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:07.750]
Good, God, no wonder the Lord

[01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:10.790]
smote him with a crooked penis or whatever.

[01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:13.130]
Remember, He was having some problems there about a year ago?

[01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:15.250]
Yeah.

[01:30:16.670 --> 01:30:17.330]
What do you mean?

[01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.930]
Oh, yeah.

[01:30:18.050 --> 01:30:21.750]
He was having some I don't know, no, the details of it.

[01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.930]
You're an airy thing.

[01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:28.390]
Like maybe a gigantic bloody tumor inside of his thing would be good.

[01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:32.690]
Huge dripping, pustil, bloody tumor.

[01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:36.070]
Anyway, Steve says, or whoever this is, this isn't Steve, somebody.

[01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:38.670]
I just voted in Margate.

[01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:39.830]
I was in line for two hours.

[01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:42.790]
I asked a poll worker if it was okay to just vote for Obama,

[01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:44.530]
leave everything else black and she said, oh yes.

[01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:47.010]
That's when I went to scan.

[01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:49.350]
Another poll worker said, if you do that, you vote won't count.

[01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:50.490]
I wonder who was right.

[01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:52.790]
I didn't take the chance and I filled everything out.

[01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:56.610]
You're supposed to be able to vote for just whatever races you care about,

[01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:57.390]
but nevertheless.

[01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:04.310]
I didn't know when we had the computer one where I guess the last election,

[01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:08.410]
if you didn't choose something for each choice,

[01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:09.870]
it said you're not done yet.

[01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.590]
And you couldn't submit.

[01:31:12.410 --> 01:31:12.770]
Really?

[01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:14.430]
You couldn't submit?

[01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:15.070]
See?

[01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:16.310]
Well, I must have got you upset.

[01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:18.010]
Yeah, well, you know.

[01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:20.350]
From what I hear from Clarence about submission.

[01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:23.830]
Well, there's Tom Bokon or his other NBC guy who can't speak.

[01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:26.530]
The system was unbelievable report by Harry at watch.

[01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:29.870]
And it's, you know, this is the greatest democracy in the world

[01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:31.290]
in a way we invented it.

[01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.570]
I know.

[01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:34.330]
Not amazing how they keep saying that they keep stealing the presidential elections

[01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:34.950]
every four years.

[01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:38.050]
And these bozos keep coming on their about the greatest democracy in the world.

[01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.650]
They got that.

[01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:40.530]
But the system is just broken.

[01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:42.130]
There's no other way to describe it.

[01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:42.830]
It's uneven.

[01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.850]
It doesn't work.

[01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:45.170]
People don't have faith in it.

[01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:46.730]
The lines are too long.

[01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:47.330]
This ballot.

[01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:48.070]
Look at this.

[01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:49.190]
The ballot is the Illinois ballot.

[01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:52.070]
This is the Illinois ballot and it's longer in California by the way.

[01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:53.590]
You can't read most of this stuff.

[01:31:54.210 --> 01:31:55.750]
So we, I think part of it.

[01:31:55.850 --> 01:31:57.350]
We got a lot of things to do in the next four years.

[01:31:57.470 --> 01:32:00.610]
Whoever wins, but part of it has to be getting the system back.

[01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.830]
What do you think?

[01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:04.550]
Where's that line that they're showing that isn't still in Margate?

[01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:04.890]
Is it?

[01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:07.910]
Are you watching a MSNBC?

[01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.590]
Of course, you're not.

[01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:13.230]
They're showing a line that's from here to a Yenomsville from here to the moon.

[01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:16.870]
You've seen two elections where there were the presidential realignment.

[01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:18.330]
64 LBJ.

[01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:20.110]
That didn't last very long.

[01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:21.770]
1980 Ronald Reagan.

[01:32:22.050 --> 01:32:23.350]
That did last very long.

[01:32:23.670 --> 01:32:25.150]
So how do you define realignment?

[01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:29.130]
Yeah, Christopher itchens and Grovidal will be on the BBC night.

[01:32:29.250 --> 01:32:30.910]
I get the BBC on my cable.

[01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:33.090]
Am I going to be watching election returns on the BBC?

[01:32:33.670 --> 01:32:33.870]
No.

[01:32:35.210 --> 01:32:38.810]
I'm going to be watching MSNBC, the Kami Pincou network.

[01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:39.490]
Good West.

[01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:40.550]
Everything else has been.

[01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:42.610]
We're in that poor Jimmy Carter, 1980.

[01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:44.770]
One Minnesota, Georgia, West Virginia, and that was it.

[01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:48.010]
Jimmy Carter.

[01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.550]
Are you faxing me something?

[01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:53.710]
Yeah, it's kind of long and ponderous.

[01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:54.570]
So I thought you might like it.

[01:32:54.930 --> 01:32:55.210]
Oh.

[01:32:57.490 --> 01:32:58.850]
Well, you don't seem to understand.

[01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:00.410]
I've got 50 million emails here, man.

[01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:01.650]
I'm getting way behind.

[01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:03.250]
And I say we start taking some calls.

[01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:04.970]
I say you're full of crap.

[01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:06.330]
I say dummy up.

[01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:07.290]
Sorry.

[01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:11.030]
Shut your pie hole.

[01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:12.090]
Tick.

[01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:14.530]
Tick.

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.750]

[01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:34.810]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.950]

[01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.070]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.090]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.090]

[01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.090]

[01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.090]

[01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.170]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:36.690]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:36.690 --> 01:33:37.170]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:40.090 --> 01:33:40.930]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:42.150]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:43.530]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:44.450]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:44.730]
I'm going to be watching you.

[01:33:44.730 --> 01:33:46.870]
One of those old people that have sisters about their bowels

[01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:47.710]
and health problems.

[01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:48.790]
Love Michelle and Key West.

[01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:51.470]
I don't obsess about my bowels.

[01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:52.450]
I just move them, honey.

[01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:53.890]
I move them.

[01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:57.830]
I'm as regular as an alarm clock twice a day.

[01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:02.210]
Now what they say about a broken clock, even a broken clock is

[01:34:02.210 --> 01:34:03.090]
still right twice a day.

[01:34:03.190 --> 01:34:03.430]
Correct.

[01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.650]
That's me.

[01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:05.530]
Two a days.

[01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:08.290]
Two and all's and two a days.

[01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:09.270]
I'm going to be watching.

[01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:10.090]
Let's see.

[01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:11.830]
Marist likely voter pulled the last poll.

[01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:13.130]
52.43 Obama.

[01:34:13.130 --> 01:34:14.330]
C. Span writer.

[01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:16.610]
Zogby 54.43 Obama.

[01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:22.070]
And a Gallup poll had it down to like 55.44 Obama with almost nobody

[01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.590]
on the side.

[01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:25.550]
So all that crap about all the undecideds are going to break for

[01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.790]
McCain.

[01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:26.170]
Yeah.

[01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:27.330]
They're not that insane.

[01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.870]
Okay.

[01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:29.250]
CBS.

[01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:30.330]
Last poll.

[01:34:30.450 --> 01:34:31.710]
51.42 Obama.

[01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:34.930]
Of likely voters.

[01:34:36.230 --> 01:34:39.530]
I mean, we're talking landslide, even if they can fix it in one or

[01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:41.890]
two states, I still don't see any way McCain can win.

[01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:43.130]
Do you?

[01:34:43.730 --> 01:34:44.350]
No, I'm not.

[01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:46.430]
Unless they fix it in about six states.

[01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:49.790]
You know, I Florida Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Missouri.

[01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:53.610]
Washington Post ABC last poll.

[01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:54.710]
Obama 53 McCain.

[01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:55.310]
44.

[01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:57.810]
And Tom Bulkaw still sitting there.

[01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:58.610]
He still can't speak.

[01:34:59.410 --> 01:35:01.630]
This is a network where they had now Bob a wall wall.

[01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:02.330]
She was on ABC.

[01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.990]
Wasn't she?

[01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.910]
Yes.

[01:35:04.410 --> 01:35:07.470]
She was not at NBC because I quit between Chris Matthews and Tom

[01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:07.810]
Bulkaw.

[01:35:07.930 --> 01:35:08.470]
They can't speak.

[01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.770]
Those are the territory at NBC.

[01:35:12.630 --> 01:35:13.830]
Even the peacock is blushing.

[01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:19.050]
All right, let me get back to my stuff and quit the facts and

[01:35:19.050 --> 01:35:20.430]
me stuff that I don't want to read.

[01:35:21.930 --> 01:35:23.290]
Judge your pie roll, flee.

[01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.970]
By the way, we're delighted to have flee with us this week because

[01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:29.110]
their clearance was nervous that we wouldn't have three people

[01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:30.590]
on the show and I would go ballistic.

[01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:33.770]
Which I wouldn't, but it would be, you know, it would be

[01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:36.070]
another example of how we get short-changed all the time.

[01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:39.170]
Because they hate this show.

[01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:40.510]
They despise it.

[01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:41.610]
They resent it.

[01:35:41.610 --> 01:35:42.230]
Am I right?

[01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:43.450]
Yep.

[01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:45.290]
Tick.

[01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:46.790]
Absolutely.

[01:35:47.670 --> 01:35:49.950]
Another female listener says, first let me say happy birthday

[01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:50.590]
many, many more.

[01:35:50.690 --> 01:35:51.310]
I love listening to you.

[01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:54.010]
Unfortunately, I have to download audio from your archives because

[01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:56.130]
my employer is blocked all live audio streaming.

[01:35:56.130 --> 01:35:57.370]
I can't get a singular work.

[01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.770]
Bastard.

[01:35:59.410 --> 01:36:02.070]
Thus, I have to listen the day after you show, but it's always worth listening

[01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.350]
to you.

[01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:03.110]
Always make me laugh.

[01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.810]
Out loud.

[01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:08.650]
I voted on Sunday, waited five and a half hours to do so.

[01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:10.650]
At first when I saw the line, I thought, this is lunacy.

[01:36:10.810 --> 01:36:11.390]
I'll vote on Tuesday.

[01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:14.490]
But actually kept me there were the two hateful bitches in line ahead of me

[01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:17.090]
who were spouting endless hatred and vitriol against Obama.

[01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:20.310]
I heard such classic lines as Obama is a Muslim.

[01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:23.970]
Obama's a terrorist and my new favorite, anybody who votes for Obama is an idiot.

[01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:26.450]
People are just voting for him because it's trendy.

[01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:29.810]
I couldn't believe these two didn't get their asses kicked,

[01:36:30.090 --> 01:36:32.110]
but I guess most people look better than pick a fight with mental defectives.

[01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:38.330]
first they were pissing me off and then they realized they were like too tiny annoying little dogs like tiny a lot of bark but no bite

[01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:40.070]
a lot of yapping

[01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:45.990]
Everybody stayed out have to say the majority there were voting for Obama least the people I spoke to were anyhow happy birthday

[01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:49.670]
Hope we see Obama take it will be nice to have somebody with a brain occupying the White House again

[01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:53.790]
Thanks, we need and thanks for your

[01:36:55.790 --> 01:37:01.470]
persistence oh Bruce Williams here's James says he's on XM and as yours a waste of time as it always was

[01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:08.070]
One thing about Bruce Williams what's doing is a do's day what's doing one of the worst excuses for a broadcast

[01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:11.490]
I've ever heard and he's made a lot of money just talking crap people call in there

[01:37:11.490 --> 01:37:16.230]
First of all, do you care about somebody you don't know some anonymous persons financial problems?

[01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:17.590]
I don't know

[01:37:18.210 --> 01:37:26.810]
What about you Tick I could care I couldn't care less couldn't care less even Gary Sarner if he stars to death I would I wouldn't throw my piece of spam

[01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:29.510]
I wouldn't throw my

[01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:36.250]
Stay a little piece of Hall of A if he was staring in that curious honor and you know what sounds like a plan

[01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:42.110]
17 out of 39 votes move we can maybe make 1800 and

[01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:44.950]
The pool's been on there for what a month

[01:37:45.810 --> 01:37:46.450]
Bottom of the

[01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:50.590]
Here we go redskins lost so Obama would be a president

[01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:56.950]
One of the great or stupid things about sports is how numbers can be worked and reworked into something that was supposed to have meaning

[01:37:58.090 --> 01:37:59.790]
The fact that the fate of the

[01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:05.570]
Presidency and the election of next leader of the free world hinges on an NFL game goes right to the top of those silly numbers

[01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:11.650]
Since the redskins have arrived in Washington how they perform in their final home game determines the presidential election

[01:38:11.650 --> 01:38:14.270]
It's true. It's called the redskins rule

[01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:21.370]
It has an accuracy rating of either 94 or 100% depending on how it's applied every time the redskins when their final home game

[01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:27.090]
Before presidential election the candidate representing the incumbent party stays in office every time they lose the incumbent

[01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:28.890]
Party candidate loses as well

[01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:34.630]
It's a predictor that has worked in 16 out of 17 presidential elections since the redskins arrived in Washington

[01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:40.910]
How do you like that? There it's over. I didn't even know that game was on last night. They lost to Pittsburgh

[01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:45.590]
Yeah, good. They started out a kicking Pittsburgh's button and then just like disappeared

[01:38:47.410 --> 01:38:52.210]
Really? Well, they probably threw the games since they knew the outcome would that's right. That's a good point

[01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:55.030]
That was ticked by the way that's the day through the game

[01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:59.950]
Here is one from Kurt. I guess your sales staff will have to go back to work

[01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:04.910]
I suppose they've been sitting on their collective asses collecting nice commissions off the political advertising

[01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:11.230]
That's a good point now. It's all over the last commercial break was at least 40% promos where football always matters

[01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:14.930]
Did we have promos in last break? I think it's probably listening online

[01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:15.630]
Oh

[01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:21.930]
I'm lying isn't where we make our money. Okay, Sonny. Let me tell you something only to Orlando this football always matter

[01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:26.770]
There's Orlando volunteer to do the teams f-ing laundry so we can sniff the jog straps you bet

[01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:30.630]
Tell the sales staff to get off their f-ing asses and sell something have a good birthday

[01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.530]
Why is Kurt so worried about our sales department whether they sell something?

[01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:38.030]
Maybe he's got stock and measly. I think oh who what are thought?

[01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:40.910]

[01:40:52.730 --> 01:40:56.750]
There's Bill Richardson on there looking really grim sue college

[01:40:56.750 --> 01:41:03.030]
Education's educational opportunities vocational schools the second is immigration reform

[01:41:03.650 --> 01:41:07.370]
Hispanics want to see the first year of an Obama administration

[01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:13.790]
Strong effort a bipartisan effort to have immigration reform that contains more

[01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:21.830]
Security at the border more legal immigration coming in but also a legalization plan a path to citizenship

[01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:24.390]
2012 if that was the case

[01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:29.910]
Then an argument could be made they should be supporting Senator McCain in bigger numbers because a

[01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:38.690]
Senator McCain a president McCain and a Democratic Congress probably could get immigration reform faster than a president Obama and a Democratic Congress

[01:41:38.690 --> 01:41:38.950]
No

[01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:44.050]
No, no because what happened Chuck was a like Chuck Todd man

[01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:49.110]
He's all over the place. He's like a disease an MSNBC like that Eugene Robinson from a Washington Post

Sound for Indians are likely to turn out in droves today says the herald and if the lines of the polls are tolerable they have early voters to thank

About one out of every four registered voters and date rowdance day wide cast their balance during the two week early voting period that ended

[01:42:14.010 --> 01:42:19.470]
Sunday that should help keep lines at a minimum respected as despite and expected 80% turnout

[01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:24.570]

Bring your own ants

[01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:47.590]
Aside from some sprinkles and early fog the election day forecast is mostly sunny with temperature in low 80s and light breeze

[01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:49.850]
One thing I don't like on my ice cream is sprinkles

It'll be the state's first big test of a new optical scan voting machines which election official promise will better serve voters than

[01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:46.650]
Broward election spokeswoman come prepared

He received just one parent complain about the play which was selected by committee that a noting rather that included teachers and parents

[01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:28.510]
This would be exactly what they want notice. I'm reading too fast. I'm stumbling and bumbling. That's because it's election day a lot of pressure heavy heavy pressure, baby

[01:46:29.010 --> 01:46:30.410]
Can you smell it?

[01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:30.710]
I

[01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:38.370]
Would use the protest as a teachable moment because it is he said the Westboro Baptist Church a bunch of real far-bison goyum

[01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:45.750]
Has staged live protest against the play nation wide including in about 20 high schools church members surely helps roper told the Detroit news yesterday

[01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:49.670]
The play has one purpose to teach you a bit into the sons and daughters of this generation

[01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:52.170]
Against the standards of God to call God a liar

[01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:57.590]

[01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:13.790]
They claim God allows soldiers to die in Iraq as punishment on the nation for tolerating

[01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:21.190]
Homosexuality. It's all those homos done it the church which is not associated with any nor Baptist conventions or associations is

[01:47:21.190 --> 01:47:23.630]
classified as a hate group by the Southern property law center

[01:47:24.650 --> 01:47:31.190]
It makes us all more passionate about the work we're doing said senior John Manchin L17 member the 20 student cast who plays multiple roles

[01:47:31.190 --> 01:47:36.250]
It'll heighten the message and show there are still people out there who feel so passionately that homosexuality is so wrong

[01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:40.930]
By performing the show we are teaching people that gave bashing is not okay

[01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:47.870]
Dan Jensen director of public safety for gross point farm said plans are in a worse-to-be-fum security opening night on November

Was that you don't you think it's a little bit suspicious when you vote on the machine and you punch

[01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:19.290]
Obama and it comes up and says McCain

[01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:26.110]

[01:48:51.570 --> 01:48:53.570]
We didn't take their crap

[01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:58.090]
Imperial Harbor or when the jabs dropped their bonds

[01:48:58.810 --> 01:49:01.030]
We found them back

[01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:07.730]
Another Saudis they hit us hard and on our cards are little flags wave

[01:49:07.730 --> 01:49:14.170]
Has that Saudi love and retard voice of bombers the wrong way

[01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:21.290]
And oven barris to be in America

[01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:23.010]
Where they follow

[01:49:23.010 --> 01:49:24.690]
Bush like she

[01:49:25.210 --> 01:49:27.510]
The United States of

[01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:30.790]
Arrogance led by Bush and his family

[01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:32.750]
They got this country

[01:49:34.330 --> 01:49:37.890]
Abberling tors the barges days and artists are

[01:49:37.890 --> 01:49:42.270]

What's a few thousand innocent lives

[01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:57.990]
Stop living in the past

[01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:02.370]
If you want that SUV to drive

[01:50:03.150 --> 01:50:08.870]
You're gonna need more gas. It's the greatest country in the world

[01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:11.510]
They drain us to believe

[01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:14.530]
And anyone who says that

[01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:15.690]
Obviously

[01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.910]
And to for to be

And oven barris to be in America

[01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:28.810]
Where we take triadically

[01:50:28.810 --> 01:50:32.910]
Wave a flag in one hand with our head in the sand

[01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:36.930]
And lightly follow the powers that be apathetic

[01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:38.470]
And that's also for the dark

[01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:42.710]
Washington State Front News on a 65 inch screen

[01:50:42.710 --> 01:50:44.030]
Scratcher

[01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.810]
Five

[01:50:44.810 --> 01:50:46.750]
Everything's okay

[01:50:48.490 --> 01:50:49.110]
In the

[01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.510]
US

[01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:53.730]
Call 33 at selection day

[01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:56.710]
Everybody's out there voting and pushing and standing in line

[01:50:56.710 --> 01:50:59.550]
And the crowd and around and getting all worked up aren't they?

[01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:03.010]
Must be it's lunch hour everybody's voting during lunch hour

[01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:05.890]
Because our emails have stopped just to a halt

[01:51:05.890 --> 01:51:09.270]
Just like tick all of a sudden stuck his finger in the in the thing

[01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:11.990]
And what's the secure finger in there?

[01:51:12.170 --> 01:51:12.690]
No, I don't think so

[01:51:12.690 --> 01:51:15.090]
Wouldn't be the first time that's what Johnny Joe Bell told me

[01:51:15.090 --> 01:51:15.370]
Well

[01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:19.570]
You said you like sticking your finger in there all the time

[01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:20.450]
Correct them

[01:51:22.190 --> 01:51:24.270]
And he says after two or three fingers

[01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:25.910]
It kind of like makes way for your head you know

[01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:26.430]
Wow

[01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:28.830]
Opens up a little little headroom

[01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:30.770]
Remember max headroom?

[01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.750]
Yep

[01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:32.530]
Diacchia

[01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:35.390]
Khan Mechanin his aides are still banking on a come from behind victory today

[01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:37.910]
But the republicans most famous political strategist

[01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:41.130]
And crook and thief has already called the race for Obama

[01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:51.210]
Carl Rove the man widely credited with stealing bushes to a successful White House bids is predicting the Illinois Senator will take the White House an intellectual college landslide

[01:51:52.230 --> 01:51:54.910]
Winning 338 votes to John McCain's 200

[01:51:54.910 --> 01:52:02.290]
That would be the largest electoral college victory since 96 when Bill Clinton defeated Bob Dole in a route 379 to 159

[01:52:03.970 --> 01:52:10.810]
And an electoral map posted on Rove's website the Republican mastermind predicts Obama victories in several key battleground states

[01:52:10.810 --> 01:52:15.030]
Including virtually all of the states were posting just he currently enjoys a slim advantage in fact

[01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:20.250]
Robely's Missouri is the only crucial battlegrounds stay McCain will carry while Obama scores victories in Florida

[01:52:20.250 --> 01:52:23.310]
Ohio Pennsylvania, Colorado, Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa

[01:52:23.310 --> 01:52:26.070]
Rove also thinks Obama will win traditionally Republican Virginia

[01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:28.230]
Yeah, if they ever get to the voting machines working

[01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:31.070]
If they ever start counting the votes in Virginia

[01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:34.870]
Let people vote let the people vote you morons

[01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:40.790]
Did you see the turnout that Obama had last night for his late night rally in northern North America?

[01:52:40.810 --> 01:52:41.270]
Virginia

[01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:43.130]
Staggering

[01:52:43.130 --> 01:52:45.350]
A gazillion people

[01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:49.970]
And McCain's last rally they barely had I got a thousand people

[01:52:51.370 --> 01:52:52.550]
For insane McCain

[01:52:54.430 --> 01:53:01.410]
Yep, no items in this view on the email although I've got about 405 6,000 to still read

[01:53:02.850 --> 01:53:06.190]
So you maybe tick maybe right through might have ticked a couple of calls what do you think?

[01:53:06.190 --> 01:53:12.350]
Yeah, I think Eric said you had to restart the email server so what yeah, it's having some problems

[01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:15.090]
So he's rebooting it so to hopefully back up

[01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:20.710]
Oh my god, can we do anything on election day no less? This is like the vote counting in Virginia

[01:53:22.210 --> 01:53:28.230]
On Neil Rogers dot com all of a sudden Eric is having technical issues with our damn outlook expressed

[01:53:29.610 --> 01:53:34.130]
Outlook distress I told her that outlook distress see there's nothing going on in here now and you want to know why?

[01:53:36.190 --> 01:53:40.710]
Because all these people have been desperately trying to like reach out and touch us

[01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:46.550]
They've been blocked Eric's got his foot on a break again. So so is it tell me again exactly what he said to you?

[01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:50.930]
There was having or we're going to reboot the email server pretty soon. It's running very slowly

[01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:54.550]
He will get errors when it's restarting. I just asked how's the email reboot going?

[01:53:55.610 --> 01:53:58.970]
Hmm and he said has not answered just yet

[01:54:00.450 --> 01:54:05.150]
Come on Eric. That's the last thing we need today on election day of all days. We don't need it any day

[01:54:05.150 --> 01:54:07.450]
I knew there's something going on with his damn email thing

[01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:09.450]
sabotage

[01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:16.970]
Now how can that be why does he need to restart it? I don't understand that I don't know I guess it gets a screwed up sometimes when you go posh

[01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:17.970]
Geed exactly

[01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:20.410]
There's no items in this view

[01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:26.030]
Nothing and I think it's Eric behind it to eras probably voting for a McCain up there in Orlando

[01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:27.890]
20 or 30 times

[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:33.730]
Remember the job Eric did on the guys across the street one and you probably that's before your time

[01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:38.790]
When we had that survey about your favorite sports talk people remember that?

[01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:44.930]
No, I don't and clearance it. Oh don't even dig the fire. Oh that's fine. Yeah, clearance the whim

[01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:48.050]
Oh, they're poaching around next door again here. Do you hear that they're drilling?

[01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:52.430]
All right, he says it's restarted so hopefully it's okay

[01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:59.270]
They're drilling right next door here. I'm trying to do in a high-paid radio show and they're they're out to make as much noises as they possibly can

[01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.890]
Crazy connox

[01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:04.310]
Probably a bunch of illegal aliens

[01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:08.350]
1760 on fat Chris's pool by the way

[01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:15.530]
Okay, the coast is clear Neil at neorages.com. And sure enough there's three came puking through immediately came puking right through there

[01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:20.330]
Because Eric had his big fat foot on the big fat break

[01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:26.690]
Neil if you notice how much smooth of the elections are going in date and broward it says lines in date are much shorter

[01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:32.290]
Everything seems so much better. I know you're a broward guy, but the past five years browards really gone down the toilet

[01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:40.930]
In the past five years Dave versus Broward meeting age much lower in date than Broward meeting income has surged in date now higher than Broward

[01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:44.810]
Crime has dropped significantly in date crime rates in Broward now much higher than Dave

[01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:48.430]
Newspaper the scum sentinel mouse sucks while the herald is improved slightly

[01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:53.050]
I can't argue with any of those points and you live in date County because I ain't gonna. I don't want

[01:55:54.630 --> 01:56:00.430]
Here's one that says Neil there must be a glitch with your browser because the headline that the herald says pulls busy, but few glitches reported

[01:56:00.970 --> 01:56:05.390]
Have you upgraded the latest Firefox 3.0 yet? Yeah, much to my dismay. I have

[01:56:06.230 --> 01:56:11.070]
Also now that Obama is present when you're moving back to America. No, what do I care about that?

[01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:16.250]
Like I'm gonna change my life here. Of course. I want him to win, but what's that kind of it where I'm gonna live?

[01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:21.310]
Well, I'd be moving back to America. I live in plantation florida sir

[01:56:22.090 --> 01:56:27.490]
That's my legal address and don't you mess with it Marty from point and says just voted glad

[01:56:27.490 --> 01:56:31.970]
I didn't wait on those early long early voting lines just walked in and out in 10 minutes

[01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:36.750]
I don't think everybody is as lucky pointed what I'm seeing on TV plenty of long lines around the country

[01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:38.330]
Vicksville not she I know

[01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:42.110]
No, it says voted 15 to 0 for Obama no 15 to 6

[01:56:43.090 --> 01:56:46.590]
Unheard of we're talking landslide. Yeah, Dicksville not means landslide

[01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:52.450]
Those two little towns in New Hampshire. He want them collectively 32 to 16 and two for Ron Paul

[01:56:55.210 --> 01:56:59.070]
Send me some more emails with some more information that I passed along at the beginning of the show

[01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:05.350]
Like a Lincoln is still dead something important like that and then of course the blue states lighter to the red states

[01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:06.130]
Don't forget that one

[01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:13.310]
You can kiss my rear end the following is a paid political message

[01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:18.830]
Joe the plumber says he's got a plan to fix your leaky drain pipe

[01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:27.950]
But what he doesn't tell you is that your trap primer needs a new threaded coupling to a 90 degree socketed radius

[01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:36.430]
He also claims a combo T with a 1 8 bend would reduce the likelihood of clocks when

[01:57:36.430 --> 01:57:44.710]
Everyone knows a sanitary T would better minimize the possibility of siphon action in the trap bar

[01:57:44.710 --> 01:57:53.870]
When Joe the plumber bends over to loosen your flange bolts the crack in his agenda is playing to see

[01:57:53.870 --> 01:58:00.930]
Back to Joe the plumber wrong for your PVC supply fitting wrong for America

[01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:01.490]
Right

[01:58:02.370 --> 01:58:09.190]
Hey, Joe mama 1244 at 560 WQA and we got the big O rock saw up at two o'clock with some election returns

[01:58:11.610 --> 01:58:14.730]
Pretty amusing isn't it you know, I got to tell you this

[01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:19.690]
When I was working at IOD the packs and IOD after Cox sold it to PAXN

[01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:24.270]
And we made made the deal to come over here to QAM

[01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:30.530]
And and I really never listened to it because I'm not interested in sports talk to me

[01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:36.430]
It's just ponderous just rehashing the same swill over and over again and so I you know, I'm coming on the station

[01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:37.730]
So I forget I better start listening

[01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:43.730]
And I started listening to their like and I don't I don't know if they do it anymore

[01:58:43.730 --> 01:58:46.050]
That's a top of the hour. I guess we don't do it no more

[01:58:46.050 --> 01:58:51.070]
But they used to have like you know breaking news. It was it was sports news. I will you the updates

[01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:58.030]
Is that what that was the updates news updates spend the news updates had nothing to do with the news even if like the world was coming to an end

[01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:04.890]
Dolphins are gonna win again this week and the yada yada yada and you come out them canes and

[01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:09.250]
And I thought to myself this is a radio station that and then of course on 9-11

[01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:10.970]
Guilty

[01:59:12.110 --> 01:59:14.750]
insisted on talking the sports even though they were you know

[01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:19.290]
knocking down a world trade center and the Pentagon and Guilty is what are we gonna say about that?

[01:59:19.290 --> 01:59:25.410]
What can we say we got to talk about sports now most people probably think I'm exaggerating. I'm embellishing it

[01:59:25.410 --> 01:59:26.290]
It's a true story

[01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:29.930]
Until finally somebody convinced Greg Rita

[01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:34.270]
I think it was Joe Castello that we ought to stop playing the spots and that they ought to put me on early

[01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:39.430]
And I opened up the pot on ABC on channel 10 and we played you know what was going on?

[01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:46.670]
I mean, it's one thing to be a Josh nifer. It's another thing to be like sick sick

[01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:51.770]
Yeah, there's certain things in the world that you kind of want to pay things super see ball games, okay?

[01:59:52.170 --> 01:59:55.850]
Mm-hmm unless of course your jerks reads doing a ball game nothing's more important than that

[01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:59.850]
By the way, I just emailed you a story about voting stuff in Deerfield Beach

[02:00:01.250 --> 02:00:05.310]
About doing what I just emailed you a story about voting problems in Deerfield Beach this morning

[02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.890]
Let's see

[02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:15.130]
You emailed it to where to your kneel at your Rogers dot com. Well, I sure sell long got it should be there soon

[02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:19.690]
I don't got it and you know what I'm thinking

[02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:25.950]
During that break I'm thinking of myself when you know it's election day and I'm just one of those people who's like I watched

[02:00:26.770 --> 02:00:30.290]
Just tons during the primaries. I just watch all the stuff. Here's a link by the way

[02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:32.150]
That's not from you. That's from John somebody a link

[02:00:33.590 --> 02:00:39.850]
Attempted sabotage for all in Florida. That's it. And I just sent you the article. Oh

[02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:44.610]
Am I supposed to read it if I suppose attempted sabotage for all in Florida?

[02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:54.250]
It's on TMZ from Deerfield Beach. Okay, I'll print it out because you know me. I don't like reading off the damn thing off the monitor

[02:00:56.330 --> 02:01:00.890]
So you just forwarded that is that what you did? Yeah, I forwarded it from their website today to any of the article

[02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:06.010]

[02:01:06.590 --> 02:01:06.950]

M-A-U-R-O-M-R-O

[02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:11.550]
I wonder if he's kin to Edward R

[02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:13.430]
Moral

[02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:17.410]
By the way, that's a bad movie. Don't anybody go and see that

[02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:20.730]
Which one good night and good luck. Oh

[02:01:22.570 --> 02:01:27.930]
And the fact that overman stoles from Ed Moore just I don't know it just bugs me. I like overman a lot

[02:01:27.930 --> 02:01:33.310]
But he does some things. Oh, they're drilling again. They're gonna come right through the wall here. I'm positive of it

[02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:41.650]
You hear that yep, Jesus. Hey, Christ. Are you people crazy? What why couldn't you do it after two o'clock?

[02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:44.210]
Yeah

[02:01:47.630 --> 02:01:51.530]
If it isn't one thing here, it's another if they're not doing the euphony fire alarm, you know

[02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:56.710]
They're doing something else. It's called how can we annoy you have a nice day a

[02:01:57.830 --> 02:02:02.410]
Later this week's is an email or is part of your birthday? I'm like should they celebrate? Oh anyway before I get to that

[02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:05.670]
So during the break I was thinking about food because I'm gonna be you know

[02:02:05.670 --> 02:02:07.550]
I'm gonna have to go out and get a whole stash of stuff

[02:02:08.050 --> 02:02:10.690]
Because I'm gonna be glued watching this stuff all day long

[02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:16.270]
By the way, tell me what you think about speaking of cars the Mercedes C300

[02:02:16.890 --> 02:02:17.630]
It's a nice car

[02:02:20.010 --> 02:02:23.310]
You like it? Yeah, we'll drive good for the wintertime too

[02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:28.690]
You should check out the Audi's they got some good Audi's the a8. Yeah, they got that Audi a

[02:02:28.690 --> 02:02:33.930]
What is it with the one that's 141 grand? Oh, yeah, that's a little bit more than I planned on spending okay?

[02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:37.050]
That's a little pricey. Yeah, that's it beautiful car though

[02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:42.090]
But if you're gonna spend that kind of money why not buy the new vet the one that's like a hungry grand

[02:02:43.630 --> 02:02:48.750]
Which I hear is ugly as sin that's the one where I'm hearing so what do you think of the C300 good car? Oh, yeah

[02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:53.410]
It's a great car. Thank God because I bought one last night really yeah nice

[02:02:56.250 --> 02:02:58.710]
It's no solace, but no

[02:03:04.290 --> 02:03:06.170]
I'm not gonna try to overtalk that drilling

[02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:10.750]
I'm gonna go next door. I'm gonna go into that apartment. I'm gonna like kick ass

[02:03:13.190 --> 02:03:16.590]
Anyway, here's this email later this week is part of your birthday and election day celebration

[02:03:16.590 --> 02:03:21.570]
Are gonna put to death all those bush bits by playing them one last time are gonna wait till the officially moves out in

[02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:24.410]
Augeration day can't wait till we no longer need to hear president

[02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:28.010]
Dumbest met at the end of every show as a reminder of our eight-year journey to darkness

[02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:33.210]
That's why I play it. I don't want anybody to forget so long bushing good riddance. It says amen to that yeah

[02:03:34.290 --> 02:03:37.690]
Eight years of hell and there are people are still like deciding well

[02:03:37.690 --> 02:03:43.370]
I don't know that McCain seems like a nice old man and that Sarah she's such a wonderful bitch

[02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:45.670]
We did do the break at 40 right?

[02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:51.310]
Yep, because I didn't cross it off on my log. Why get really why do one of two things once in a while

[02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:56.430]
What's that when I'm under tremendous dress like an election day? I either get ahead of myself and I crossed out the break ahead

[02:03:57.650 --> 02:04:00.510]
Which we haven't done yet or I forget to cross out the previous one

[02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:04.430]
I think like oh gee did I skate on by the break you need to just settle down

[02:04:09.090 --> 02:04:10.670]
Dummy up tick

[02:04:12.850 --> 02:04:18.410]
I like this tick man he comes in there the one thing about flea he feels like even though he's just the promotions director

[02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:23.590]
Probably overpaid dramatically. Oh crazy overpaid. Yeah. Well obviously since we don't do any promotion

[02:04:24.330 --> 02:04:27.490]
I mean I could understand if we really went out there and promoted and we were doing you know

[02:04:27.490 --> 02:04:32.170]
Getting involved with the public and doing stuff like that appearance at Gulf Stream that day that was pretty good

[02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:33.710]
Yeah

[02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:38.870]
No, I think more I'll get more I'm sorry. I thought it was great

[02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:43.310]
Did they get more people to the sports appearances and stuff? No

[02:04:44.170 --> 02:04:48.330]
What are you laughing about I mean if by more you mean five or six people? Oh?

[02:04:49.450 --> 02:04:51.550]
Anyway, here's that story check this out

[02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:56.110]
It says dear field beach an hour south of Palm Beach nearly 400 people were firmly planted in line

[02:04:56.530 --> 02:05:01.390]
615 this morning waiting for the post-opened 7 a.m. There's one voting machine to accommodate all of them

[02:05:01.810 --> 02:05:07.670]
The area is almost entirely African-American many of these people have never voted before one woman was 101 years old

[02:05:07.670 --> 02:05:12.790]
She was wheeled in the polling place on her way out. She said that before she died she wanted to vote for a black man

[02:05:13.290 --> 02:05:14.510]
And it's got a picture of the

[02:05:15.010 --> 02:05:21.250]
Performing arts center. I guess which is where they had the voting and all the people are showing there except for one lady everybody else is dark

[02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:26.390]
Election monitors noticed a man in line who appeared to be a voter turns out he was a saboteur

[02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:31.390]
Telling people the Democrats were supposed to vote at a different location some of the voters said they were robo called last night

[02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:34.030]
The message Democrats weren't supposed to vote until Wednesday

[02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:41.130]
Right update election officials just delivered seven more voting machines cut them with their machines down there in dear field beach you bastards

[02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:51.390]
I hope that Gary Sarner infects your community and moves into dear field

[02:05:52.630 --> 02:05:54.010]
Then then you'll get what you deserve

[02:05:54.850 --> 02:06:01.510]

[02:06:24.930 --> 02:06:27.270]
Until it just goes nuts like that

[02:06:28.210 --> 02:06:33.470]
David Miramar says just before going to vote you put a reporter from TV saying there was a two-hour waiting mirror mark

[02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:37.670]
I voted district W16. I walked right up waited and no vote at all. No wait

[02:06:40.210 --> 02:06:45.190]
Walked right up and voted and no wait at all. I hope that some voters don't get the wrong idea and aside not to vote to the long lines

[02:06:45.190 --> 02:06:50.110]
Thanks, David Miramar. Well, I was Carrie Sanders with propaganda those are probably all MSNBC people

You got till seven o'clock tonight to vote if you're in line by seven you still can vote and of course in the pan handle

[02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:08.730]

The Florida polls officially don't close to late in all of Florida. Do you understand that?

[02:07:15.490 --> 02:07:19.890]
Mm-hmm because when it's eight o'clock in the pan handle at seven o'clock in Ojas

[02:07:21.710 --> 02:07:25.430]
Ralph says I heard you say the emails have stopped so I decided to send you one. Thanks Ralph

[02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:32.730]
They stopped because Eric is dealing with it again. Oh, we got a restart the server and we go. Oh my god. I don't get it

[02:07:35.130 --> 02:07:41.530]
And George has always pooped poo and on like you know, hot mail and Yahoo mail. He's always pooping that crap

[02:07:41.530 --> 02:07:46.430]
And give me a son of an ounce about our look or express how wonderful it is

[02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:51.450]
Does Eric have to restart hot mail to get my hot mail going again? You bet you're sweet as he don't

[02:07:53.590 --> 02:07:53.870]
Right

[02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:55.230]
Correct

[02:07:55.970 --> 02:07:58.470]
So what's the problem with hot mail that it's not so?

[02:07:59.470 --> 02:08:00.630]
It's just it's not very

[02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:05.950]
What a lot of stuff gets through like a spam stuff. Oh, yeah

[02:08:06.650 --> 02:08:13.230]
Oh, thank god. I'm not getting all that 80 billion spams on I'll look every day which I am the middie stale news and

Lottery. Oh my god. The stuff that comes through there. I wouldn't wish on Joe Bell

[02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:24.630]
Anyway, I'm listening to you over the internet in Atlanta

[02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:28.350]
I used to listen to you when I live in Coral Springs, but I took your advice and left happy birthday Ralph

[02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:30.770]
Thank you Ralph. Good choice. Good decision

[02:08:31.690 --> 02:08:33.650]
You're not in that place before it's too late

[02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:36.830]
Look what happened to poor George. He's like a prisoner

[02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:43.730]
At least he's got that joint in North Carolina. He can get away to once in a while, you know without the wife and the dog and the kid

[02:08:47.290 --> 02:08:49.450]
And the girlfriend and

[02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.710]

Here's one from Maryland. Hey happy birthday. I live in California in Los Angeles a little rainy

[02:08:56.470 --> 02:09:02.990]
But as dark folks are voting early and often for Obama will win the landslide. He will win in the glanslide in California and New York and

[02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:08.590]
In the end the election all depending how much more the shenanigans goes on

[02:09:09.570 --> 02:09:13.350]
Aren't you a little bit nervous about what we're hearing dear field beach? How do you like that?

[02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:16.030]
The guy that was telling people that they had voted another location

[02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:18.150]
They should take him and just shoot him right on the spot

[02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:20.750]
So this is this is what we do to people at F with the election

[02:09:21.610 --> 02:09:21.970]
Right

[02:09:21.970 --> 02:09:30.530]
Can't get charging with voter fraud they can charge him with being a professional a whole just like although not as bad as Gary Sarn

[02:10:09.650 --> 02:10:10.010]
Oh

[02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:17.570]

[02:12:41.450 --> 02:12:43.630]
I like it. I think it's a fine car

[02:12:44.630 --> 02:12:51.950]
Susensational car and everything that he says in there is BS gets decent mileage. Oh

[02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:53.370]
All these negative people

[02:12:54.070 --> 02:12:58.170]
Nazi car. I like Germany myself. I love Berlin and hey the Germans know how to make a vehicle

[02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:03.650]
That's correct. And I love a Cologne Cologne and Berlin are true the greatest cities in the world if you ever made a Cologne, Germany boy

[02:13:03.650 --> 02:13:05.150]
Then then you know what life is all about

[02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:12.370]
Here's a guy who says I spent 15 minutes to vote on the heart of Boka with all the Alta Cokers only 15 minutes

[02:13:12.370 --> 02:13:14.090]
Okay, all you old

[02:13:14.490 --> 02:13:18.570]
Alta Cokers in Boka vote for the Schwarzenegger now get it right get it right

[02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:23.850]
Or we're gonna send you for the weekend to Gary Sarner's house then you'll really then you'll know what sources

[02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:27.570]
When you got to be in close proximity to do if

[02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:33.970]
Kathleen says my third Obama sign was stolen yesterday morning in Miami lakes my real design was knocked over

[02:13:34.670 --> 02:13:41.350]
I went yesterday for another two signs and picked up a quality of a quantity of nasty smelling stuff at the grocery store to put around them

[02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:45.610]
Catfish herring pickle sardines anything I could think I've to ruin the shoes of the thieves

[02:13:46.070 --> 02:13:50.650]
I ended up getting an off duty comfortable signs above my garage door this morning only

[02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:53.590]
One was stolen the other was only half-downs

[02:13:53.590 --> 02:13:56.890]
So I guess I'm getting the hang of things in this mean spirited right wing little town

[02:13:57.690 --> 02:14:03.070]
Miami lakes. I used to have a sticker on back of my truck that said a chainy is a dick and somebody took it off

[02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:13.250]
Are we gonna have to dump him fat Chris maybe put that's his name the chainy. Yeah

[02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:15.270]
It all depends on how you

[02:14:16.190 --> 02:14:19.490]
Say it now. We just got our license yesterday

[02:14:20.570 --> 02:14:25.150]
Or at least the news just leaked out and right off the bat. You're you're coming on there and Joe

[02:14:25.150 --> 02:14:31.430]
But jolly Joe is gonna turn on you like a corner to rat like a big fat rat. No, he's got pictures

[02:14:34.410 --> 02:14:34.810]
evidently

[02:14:35.450 --> 02:14:36.690]
jolly Joe and fat Chris

[02:14:38.810 --> 02:14:40.690]
And and fat Chris and Gary Sarner

[02:14:41.890 --> 02:14:42.370]
No

[02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:45.710]
Where are these long lines they keep showing on Amazon?

[02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:52.310]
The reasons Andrew they think things are going so well is that because there was early voting at about 30 million people

[02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:58.350]
Voted early and Colorado which you pointed out the turn out so far among a few prints the precincts

[02:14:58.350 --> 02:15:04.790]
They're reporting what is she essentially has been a little light so far, but they're reminding us the day is very early

[02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:09.570]
Okay, we're hey, man. Oh, thanks so much for watching over all of these people

[02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:14.810]
There's that Andrea Mitchell just remember she's married to Alan Greenspan. Oh my god

[02:15:14.810 --> 02:15:17.770]
Is there anybody in the world who would touch that old man?

[02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:23.230]
Apparently will yeah, evidently she'll touch it for a dollar

[02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:30.570]
Let's see here's one who said just voted I voted here in New Jersey where Obama's expected to win a popular vote by 15 to 20 percent

[02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:34.390]
And my lifelong Democrats I would have voted for whoever made it through the primary process

[02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:39.330]
But it sure felt historic casting a vote for the USA's first non-white president presidential candidate

[02:15:39.330 --> 02:15:43.010]
A major party ticket go Obama he says eight years from now

[02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:46.210]
Maybe a woman will make it through the Democratic primary process to break through that milestone

[02:15:46.210 --> 02:15:48.330]
Yeah, maybe a woman, but certainly not swallery

[02:15:49.730 --> 02:15:54.110]
Haven't been able to listen to your show this morning any issues being raised with the election our voting process today as

[02:15:54.110 --> 02:15:58.750]
Those Palm Beach callers called your show eight years ago about them as infamous butterfly ballot. No not really

[02:15:59.490 --> 02:16:00.290]
just Virginia

[02:16:01.090 --> 02:16:06.110]
But I do remember that eight years ago. There was a lady called in and she started we had a few calls from Palm Beach

[02:16:06.110 --> 02:16:08.910]
I think I just voted for Pat Buchanan by mistake

[02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:09.830]
Oh

[02:16:10.570 --> 02:16:17.070]
She tried to vote for Al Gore but she had that butterfly ballot and she wasn't even old or probably even Jewish. I don't know

[02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:18.830]
I didn't ask

[02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:22.010]
I didn't ask if she was circumspect

[02:16:24.190 --> 02:16:32.170]
The old Jews who voted for a Pat Buchanan in 2000 better redeem themselves now or they're certainly gonna burn in hell if they don't vote for Obama

[02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.770]
Yamama

[02:16:35.250 --> 02:16:36.790]
How's Christy when on his pull here?

[02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:43.250]
1790 you're only generally from the vaunted 1800 margin a poll that might might leave the poll on there forever

[02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:47.470]
Have a happy birthday. You are still young says John. Oh, yeah, I'm so young

[02:16:51.490 --> 02:16:56.690]
And again, they send me the same thing about the Miramar thing two out of two voting stations empty over 300 people in line

[02:16:56.690 --> 02:16:59.490]
We did four hours to vote says Rick well, it was well worth it and

[02:17:00.090 --> 02:17:06.390]
And they're drilling and drilling and drilling their next door like a bunch of lunatics probably a bunch of illegal Chinese man

[02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:10.750]
If any idea how many illegal aliens they have here and

[02:17:12.570 --> 02:17:17.710]
Especially if you come if you come to customs and you have like a turban on and a beard and you look like a terrorist and

[02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:21.850]
You're carrying like a like a hand grenade. Oh, welcome to Canada

[02:17:23.710 --> 02:17:24.590]
It's the truth

[02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:30.170]
If you're like a law-biting just general schmuck like me like that time coming back from Amsterdam

[02:17:30.170 --> 02:17:35.230]
They put me through the ringer my god. Remember I told that story. Yep

[02:17:36.610 --> 02:17:38.290]
Well, what are you doing here? What do you do?

[02:17:38.470 --> 02:17:40.690]
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah? Oh

[02:17:40.690 --> 02:17:46.650]
John Veeces. I'm not your friend good. I'm Georgia's friend and watch the sugar and he's got a link

[02:17:46.650 --> 02:17:51.110]
Well, you're not my friend. I'll write because you send me a link. I don't join inside your apartment

[02:17:52.250 --> 02:17:58.050]
Just about sounds like it. Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. I mean ordinarily I can put up with a lot of distractions

[02:17:58.050 --> 02:17:59.830]
Don't bother me. I'm used to it

[02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:06.330]
Christ almighty when it sounds like they're gonna come flying right through the wall

[02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:13.230]
There's one young Asian guy who works in maintenance here if he came flying through the wall

[02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:16.210]
I wouldn't do it. I would just say hey here's a flee in the fat Chris

[02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:20.070]
But I'm sure it's not him. I don't think he does the drilling, you know

[02:18:20.610 --> 02:18:22.210]
I'm thinking in the right union for that

[02:18:23.370 --> 02:18:24.470]
Asian Oriental guy

[02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:28.190]
Now George isn't here today so he can't argue with me about that thing about Oriental's

[02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:31.250]
I know what an Oriental is when I see one. Okay, throw it

[02:18:34.890 --> 02:18:39.130]
Don't don't don't don't yeah, I wonder if Moe had an Oriental rug that used to wear like on Chinese New Year

[02:18:39.950 --> 02:18:43.130]
Rick says voted in Cooper City 7 this morning through just over an hour

[02:18:43.130 --> 02:18:48.470]
The longest wait was aligned to insert the completed ballot in the tally machine looked like a paper shredded to me

[02:18:51.770 --> 02:18:52.170]
Oh

[02:18:52.170 --> 02:18:55.470]
Yeah, oh the paper shredder that's cute

[02:18:56.290 --> 02:19:01.850]
My wife just left the same polling location 15 minutes in and out the old rick old dude and dizzy bitch are going down

[02:19:01.850 --> 02:19:05.390]
Not on each other. I hope it says this Rick they're going down

[02:19:08.010 --> 02:19:12.670]
Oh, what's your name Andrew Mitchell is still on there no wonder I don't watch you MSNBC during the daytime and

[02:19:13.590 --> 02:19:18.190]
Then of course if I go back to CNN it'll be either that horrible awful Tony Harris or

[02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:21.290]
Kira Phillips who makes him seem like the Prince of the city

[02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:27.730]
Joe and popinos is longtime listener one time caller first time emailer first happy birthday from another old fart

Second voted this morning in popin O a beach and precinct 23 no crowds perfectly organized on in 20 minutes

[02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:42.630]
Most that was filling out the lengthy ballot done in three languages making sure I had the right vote in the right place

[02:19:42.630 --> 02:19:46.150]
Based on overheard comments the vote had to be at least 75% Obama

[02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:52.570]
Finally knowing how well you do your research you may have covered this but just in case an article appeared on page 29 a the Sunday

[02:19:52.570 --> 02:19:56.590]
Harold Saudi Arabia sheep readers hold first beauty pageant

[02:19:57.690 --> 02:20:05.250]
Summary a Saudi Arabian pageant where sheep rather than human beauty took the runway offered a chance for breeders to and business a rare outlet for entertainment

[02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:10.450]
article provides enough material to kill these 30 minutes while they like their sheep in Saudi Arabia

[02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:20.110]
When you think and of course in Saudi Arabia they've been screwing the world for a long time with the help of their good friends bandar a bush

[02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:26.430]
Well, no if if their guys bandar a bush then what's he just an a whole

[02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:48.350]
However, it's a lifelong Democrat. I've got to say Obama's going to make a bad president

[02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:56.570]
Make as bad president is George W. Bush has been not that opponents any better

[02:20:57.390 --> 02:21:03.090]
You'll have a good time making fun of his misadventures next four years now. Why would Bill and Melbourne say that unless he's a clown

[02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:10.290]
Got any idea no comparing Barack Obama to George W. Bush

[02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:15.630]
Now what was he again in Melbourne maybe he's a hooded freak

[02:21:17.070 --> 02:21:18.490]
Maybe he's in the wrong hood

[02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:22.690]

Grovermorequist one said we must shrink government and round it in the bathtub and let the free market govern itself

[02:22:23.250 --> 02:22:27.010]

My precinct is in South Miami high school. I arrived at 1210. There were no lines

I was out of there by 1230 to all new people who spent hours in line for relief voting you must be nuts

[02:23:11.470 --> 02:23:13.510]
The only thing is that I should go back to work

[02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:18.150]
But you know, I'm gonna rule a fat one take George for ride on my motorcycle to snap her head

[02:23:21.490 --> 02:23:25.270]
John sends me this info from Huntington West Virginia WS A Z

[02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:33.530]
Are we concerned about the voting in West Virginia? First of all, that's McCain country. There's no chance of bombing going to one West Virginia none

[02:23:34.490 --> 02:23:35.830]

When you hand in the polls it says to vote you better check your wardrobe and choose wisely

[02:23:40.430 --> 02:23:46.730]
Wearing the wrong clothes could cost you your vote surprised listen up the law restricts one's right to allow you the privilege of another

[02:23:47.570 --> 02:23:51.590]
You can't wear a shirt hat or button supporting your candidate issue or even an idea when you go to vote

[02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:55.510]
It's called electioneering and see equivalent of carrying a yard sign into the pool

[02:23:56.090 --> 02:24:00.430]
Pull workers are trained to west and the cover or remove the object if they don't have anything to cover up with

Not to wear shirts pins or hats informing them it's against the law and you can be turned away

[02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:21.190]
The law isn't new, but it's not well known either and given a highly charged political season parties on both sides are

[02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:23.710]
Minding their voters to dot their eyes and cross their teeth and

[02:24:25.210 --> 02:24:26.070]
Pat their ass
