Wow, so what do you say flavor wave is going to be on?

[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.540]
Right, flavor waiver

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:27.520]
I don't know. Subject passions. This just makes me want to cry. I might just go ahead

[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.760]
and cry anyway. I don't know why I had a really big night at Woodbuy last night, Chris.

[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:43.960]
Oh, right. $13,400 bucks. Nice. $3,400. That's more you make in six months, correct. And

[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.180]
I put in a $100 bill. There was one machine open. I hit the button twice. Twice. It's

[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.840]
been six bucks. And there was a spin. $500. And you're thinking, oh, boy, that was pretty

[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.140]
nice. But then the machine got dead. The machine died and took most of it back. So I went

[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.320]
to another machine. That one stuck. And I went to a third machine because a guy who got

[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.960]
in a thousand on the wheel that machine, I figured, this is the jackpot machine. And

[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.800]
you know what? What? It was. I played it for about ten minutes. There's three grand

[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.120]
on the line. And then within 30 seconds, there's a young, dark, compacted couple about two

[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.760]
machines away. They just had just walked up to the amp thing. They also got three grand

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.840]
on the line. And the bells are ringing and the birds are singing. And it was pretty

[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.580]
nice. And they came and paid me. And I ran out of there. You never saw something move so

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.680]
fast in your life, on my life. Can you please ask Neil to give an update on passions

[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.780]
currently on channel 101? I don't even know which channel 101 is. That like direct TV

[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.800]
or something? Outer. Which I don't have, obviously.

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.440]
Question one, not here. Did Ben Master's character of Julian really get his wrinkle

[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.020]
whacked off the get reattached by a drunk eve who reattached it backward minus a few

[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:06.900]
winches? His winky. Oh. Two is Julian and Eve's illegitimate, the illid zebra son really

[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.160]
pregnant by daddy Julian. And three, what's doing with Teresa Lopez Fitzgerald Crane

[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:20.760]
Winthrop Crane? Tegan, you need to get a life, please. I have no life. The latest news

[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.240]
I heard was that passion has been canceled. A final episode filmed on March 28th. Last month

[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.140]
we'll air some time in August. Today passion has been nominated for Best A Time Drama

[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.880]
with several cast members also nominated. So that being the case, what happens if passion

[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.900]
wins for the Best A Time Drama? You know what happens? Tegan and Tegan? Yamama. With

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.080]
the drama. And vote for Obama. Well, cancellation still be an effectable passion to get a

[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.460]
reprieve. It's not getting no reprieve. It's going off the air. What don't you understand,

[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.600]
honey? It's going off the air. What's Neil's take on passion, shall? What on what a

[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.500]
cancellation. I don't know. I don't care. I haven't watched it in the Zebra's age. I don't

[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.500]
care. I don't know. And I don't want to. How do you like that? So somebody spent all that

[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.240]
time to send that lengthy email about the better beat, better boot, but about I don't care.

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.120]
I'm not interested. We don't get it here anyway. And I wouldn't watch it if it was not

[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.900]
right now. I wouldn't watch it. I got eight million channels there on my Rogers cable.

[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.440]
I don't need no channel 101. Whatever that is. I'm in a romp here by Dreamless Hall.

[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.720]
We are Johnson saying out these six-shell mayor by Dreamless Hall and Trevor Henry in the

[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.640]
Bible. Oh, Trevor Henry, good man. Never saw a fature in that Trevor Henry.

[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.940]
Who? Trotten Trevor. At the decision, this shot goes off and my

[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.600]
commissar excite just finds his face above the pad and under the gun still.

[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.860]
Had a more flyer as I hate the flyers by a haze of Canadian. Much, much worse than a Canadian's

[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.520]
took it right up the old nose. That's good. They damn near blew it there at the end of

[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.660]
the flyers, but they held on by the skin of their teeth.

[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.340]
Here's the most important story. All I got to do is read the story and I can go back

[00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:01.040]
to bed. I felt great when I came in here this morning. Sorry, I told them it's very

[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.940]
complicated. There's a million cords and wires and stuff down here. And I almost wound

[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.860]
up in a situation where I lost my damn internet. You're asked what the grass right now if I

[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.480]
wouldn't have gotten that back together. That would have been bad.

[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.960]
Because especially in its current form, the idea that I'm going to do this show without

[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.880]
the internet is lunacy. Lunacy, man. Insanity.

[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.140]
Now I wouldn't have been able to get that email from our close personal friend, the professor

[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.040]
there, who's changing cars every couple of weeks like some people change their underwear.

[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.040]
Oh, I'm just worn out. Well, don't go back to bed.

[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.380]
I had a great day yesterday. Everything was fine. Went up and had a couple hours with

[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.380]
a paka up there and talked a lot of crap and I went to a walk to a wood vine and had

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:55.780]
a great night. And then I came in here. And then he brought those goop balls and knew

[00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:06.400]
that the terrible duo, flea and the steve. Just wear me out. It's called taking something

[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.380]
very simple and making it really complicated. Which seems to be what they're very good at.

[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.000]
Oh, and you're going to handicap 15 races from six different tracks and we're going to have

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.640]
a special giveaway to all of the retards and you know, something I think the whole thing

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.480]
may have been a really bad idea. I mean, I'm coming down there anyway. I got you know,

[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.000]
been missed to take care of, but I think this whole thing may have been a really bad idea.

[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.400]
Your fault, George. Yep, believe me. What do you mean, Blaine, you was here? You're

[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.980]
gotten the middle of it. Yeah, it was my idea. I wasn't the one that suggested it. Let's

[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.180]
have Neil do it. appearance. Of course not. You're a crazy person as if we didn't know.

[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.020]
Yeah, like I care. You care. I don't. Now, what do you get out of it? Are you getting paid

[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.040]
your usual costume appearance? Yeah. Yeah. Well, good. Yeah. So what do you bitch in me

[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.660]
out about having a couple of extra bucks, Mr. I'm desperate and I can't feed my family

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.140]
and drive on an aside and buy a lot of dope. Happy to get it, but it wasn't my idea.

[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.160]
What turns out to make whose idea was? I just made it sound like it was. People in whose hands

[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.460]
it lies are a couple of well-reached and tight people. Right. Mumble, jumbo,

[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.880]
move balls. Okay. How would you want us to be? This is full man. You know, it would have been

[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.660]
much worse as if they'd planned a whole bunch of crap and then done it anyway and then you

[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.080]
wound up going there and a whole bunch of stuff happened that you didn't want to happen

[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.520]
or a whole bunch of stuff that you wanted to happen to. I'm just gonna go there and sign those cards.

[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.940]
There you go. I always thought you got to do it. I'm not gonna get up on the thing and be the

[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.000]
MC and nobody wants to do it. Nobody asks you to and the greeter like Larry G.

[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.280]
Yes, and my lemonade's dead. I'm not even suggesting it. It's not even suggested it. Good.

[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.520]
Now, you might want to ask Eric what happened with the stats on those news stories yesterday

[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.140]
because it's either him or Curtis. I'm not sure which one. Well, that's that now I'm beginning

[00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:01.060]
to understand what happened. Eric probably throws those stats on the stories from yesterday when

[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.920]
Curtis fooded all up in order to get me pissed off even more at Curtis so that Eric could do the

[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.120]
stories that could pay him because I never knew. I mean, George told me before the show this morning

[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.340]
that Eric is desperately wants that money. And then what you said? That's what I said. Well,

[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.040]
something like that. That's what I said. You said he's always belly aching about he wants to put

[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.740]
the stories up and let me pay him every three or four months. That's what I said.

[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.940]
Which would be the least I could do because Eric is, you know, he's one of the few people in the

[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.260]
world that gives a crap about this show and about our, certainly about our website. He does. There's

[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.760]
no question about our website which the station doesn't want to be associated with because we

[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.720]
used to have those naked pictures on air, whatever else. Oh, they're disgusting. It's not about sports.

[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.860]
We don't want to be associated with the eruditor show. We're so old. We're feeling and the embarrassment

[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:49.800]
is mutual. Yeah, screw them. So the goodness for Chris is we got the new poll up there ready to go

[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.080]
for him off. Thanks to Charlie V who sent actually a few fairly decent polls for him. Not great.

[00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:04.340]
And we got 955 on this one already. What do you got? 956. What what happened to the long?

[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:09.260]
57. I was reflecting like kind of lean over in the chair and just slump all like dead. No, I was

[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.800]
refreshing it. Yeah, refresh this. No, thank you. 957. What's the worst thing that pisses you off

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.960]
most about your neighbor? I like all my neighbors. It's a good thing. I put that on her yesterday. See?

[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.360]
Smarty pants. 191. Although if they shocked me and sound floater, they like all their neighbors. Oh

[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:31.740]
my god. They should all live in my neighborhood. I don't I don't pay any attention when I'm

[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.240]
married to my neighbors. Even when I was all those years. I'm you know other than my friend Bernie

[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:42.020]
and his wife rest in peace. The Bernie moved away after his wife died and now I got like strangers

[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:47.300]
and across the street. That's the problem. Right directly across the street. That's the problem,

[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.380]
Cindy. Anyway, I like all my neighbors. 191. Sticker knows everybody's business to grade

[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.240]
trouble. 139. Lowing their dogs and cats to crap all over your lawn. 114.

[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.000]
Lowing their outside dogs to bark all damn night. 107. Last of noxious music and party until

[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.020]
midnight several times a week. 98. Park their cars partially on your yard or in front of your house.

[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:15.740]
67. Don't deal drugs. 49. Don't pedal their religion. 30. Leave their garbage cans out all

[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:21.220]
week with that smelly garbage in your raccoons crawling around at 29. Never more of the grass. 27.

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.160]
Work on your vehicles. Jacked up on center blocks leaving parts all over the place. 24.

[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.980]
Paint their house in insane color like rural blue or plow or brindle brown. 19.

[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.180]
neglect their kid 16. Leave their Christmas lights hung on their house all year 15.

[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:42.480]
Deal drugs 13. And don't share. Always ask for favors 10. Never return stuff they borrow. 7.

[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.180]
Can I borrow a cup of sugar? I need to give back a cup of sugar.

[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:55.040]
Oh when you get the sugar? They give it back to them. I see. Is that how that works?

[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.800]
Yeah when you go to the store. I wouldn't trust anybody in my neighborhood with food you know.

[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.100]
They brought a cup of sugar probably poison probably arsenic. And is that ever actually happened?

[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.760]
Well I'm anybody wants to borrow a cup of sugar. I don't know that's the example I always use.

[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.980]
I don't know they do that on TV and stuff. They borrow a cup of sugar really?

[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.220]
What are you going to do with the cup of sugar? We're going to stick it for food.

[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.040]
Oh yeah as we're baking something then they are. Oh geez I'm short on sugar.

[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.400]
That's for all those people who are like Leslie Stella want to look ass you know.

[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.120]
Was that it? Like Scalia. Maybe Scalia had sugar in his ass because she was looking at oh my god

[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.660]
Licky Licky Licky Licky Licky. Oh honey's better.

[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:38.900]
Kissy kissy kissy honey bears. That's what Aaron Summers used to come honey bears that bitch.

[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.840]
I don't know if she can do a good show but she sure has a great ass.

[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.800]
That was Steve Nichols comment our degenerate program director.

[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.280]
Now let's see I'm going to be doing today. I got my expectorant. It did not them

[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:01.380]
make me come up a big almost anything. And yet, oh much better than yesterday.

[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.340]
In fact, what we'll do is we'll have a regular feature on a show between 10 and 10

[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.680]
30 every morning. Here Neil Breeve. Right. Okay. The flunch check. Yeah the flunch check.

[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.740]
We'll get a dipstick. Well, a lung checker. Yeah we can lie check it.

[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:19.400]
We'll check the lung level. We'll get a dipstick and check the flum level.

[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.380]
That's why he is a dipstic. Oh no. Oh god Neil.

[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:22.960]
Oh.

[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.300]
Well, I saw him on the Oprah television show saying he is a man.

[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.620]
But to me, it looks like the mama.

[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.960]
M-A-M-A-M-A-M-A.

[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.660]
Look at his belly. It hangs over his head.

[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.660]
It's not a beer gut. He says he is pregnant. He'll be a mama.

[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.980]
Or is it a papa?

[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.500]
Oh mama, mama, mama.

[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.360]
Mama, mama, mama.

[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.160]
Well, I tell you this guy is quite a size.

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.020]
He's with sharp, but his pants ain't right.

[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:17.800]
And when he gives birth naturally, he'll still be glad that he's a sheep.

[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.960]
Well, I'm not the world's wasn't telling you guys.

[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.960]
But it's a big battle line that a woman can be a papa.

[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.240]
Papa, papa, papa.

[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.520]
He's really a mama.

[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.760]
He's talking about papa.

[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.280]
Papa, papa, papa.

[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.640]
10, 19, and 5, 60 WQA.

[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.660]
And don't forget to join George's Friday at Gullstream.

[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.840]
He's going to be out there again for one of his 8,000 appearances.

[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.700]
He needs the cash. That's right.

[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.260]
I tried to win him a few bucks again on a races from La Calder, I guess.

[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.880]
Or maybe we'll bet on the meadows.

[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.560]
We can do it all.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.860]
We're not going to be simultaneously in the meadows.

[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.580]
I don't know.

[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.240]
Maybe they will. I don't turn this crazy.

[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.460]
Maybe they won't. Maybe they won't.

[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.020]
I don't know. Maybe they do. Maybe they don't.

[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.120]
Maybe I do.

[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.820]
Maybe you're going to be really upset with me because after I won my 34-hundred

[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.220]
bucks yesterday at the...

[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.580]
See, I hit the 3,000 on the line and then you would have thought I'd

[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.500]
have gone home right away, right?

[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.900]
And I was on the way and I thought, oh, there's this one nickel machine I love.

[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.360]
It's got quick hits on it.

[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.140]
Okay.

[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.760]
And if you get a little bit...

[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.500]
So quick hits. What?

[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.360]
Quick hits.

[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.180]
No, not those kind.

[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.020]
And it's one of those multiples where you can play like up to 10 bucks every

[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.680]
year time you hit the button, which is too damn much for a nickel machine.

[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.800]
But anyway,

[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.000]
and I said I thought of that thing and I got a bunch of free spins.

[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.540]
It's really a nifty thing.

[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.460]
If you get...

[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.080]
There's a little thing comes up free spin.

[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.160]
If you get three of those, you actually get two...

[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.560]
There's a board that comes up and when you get...

[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.880]
You punch the buttons the different ones and when you get three of the same ones,

[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.020]
you get X number of free spins.

[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:47.440]
Okay.

[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.980]
And then on this particular time, I got 20 free spins.

[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.640]
Times three times credits.

[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.560]
And so you sit back and the music goes, bam, we got out and the thing keeps spinning

[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.460]
and spinning and whatever you get, whatever lands on each time you get the credits.

[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.320]
And the last time it came up with five quick hits, which is I think I don't know what it was.

[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.420]
So anyway, 431 bucks on a nickel machine.

[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.140]
Right.

[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.140]
So there was added to the three grand.

[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.700]
I won on the dollar Wheel of Fortune machine and I went upstairs and I had macaroni and cheese.

[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:17.660]
Oh no.

[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.800]
Why had I celebrated some of my own?

[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:20.940]
By Kyrgyz.

[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.500]
And I went home.

[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.620]
I waited here this.

[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.200]
Okay.

[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:29.660]
Shortly before he rose to deliver his rambling, angry sarcastic remarks at the National Press Club

[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.220]
yesterday.

[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.860]
Revolge Jeremiah Wright said next to enchanted with Barbara Reynolds in New York Daily News

[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.040]
Arrow Lewis begins today.

[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.820]
A former editor-in-chief board member in USA Today, she runs something called Reynolds

[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.600]
News Services and teaches ministry at the Howard University School of Divinity he adds.

[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.040]
It also turns out that Reynolds introduced Monday as a member of the National Press Club

[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.380]
who organized the event as an enthusiastic Hillary Clinton supporter.

[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.380]
I'm going to tell you this Reverend Wright, this is self-aggrandizing,

[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.860]
egotistical, selfish, obnoxious douchebag.

[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.080]
This son of a bitch who is going to rot in hell if there were such a place.

[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.120]
He doesn't care about Obama.

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.560]
He doesn't care about the country.

[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.720]
He doesn't care about anything other than his own ego.

[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.320]
Just another egotistical preacher with a big stupid mouth.

[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:14.860]
That's all.

[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.680]
On a blog going to a website, ReynoldsNews.com.

[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.500]
Reynolds said in the February post, my hope for Hillary and the Maryland primary was my way of saying

[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.860]
thank you to Clinton or husband for the successes of Bill Clinton's presidency.

[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.900]
The same post criticized Obama's audacity of hope theme.

[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.860]
Hope I never definition is not based on facts, Reynolds.

[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.440]
It's an emotional expectation.

[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.800]
Things hope for may or may not come, but help based on experience trumps hope every time.

[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.840]
In another blog in Fuy Reynolds gives an ever sharper critique of Obama.

[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.140]
It's a sad testimony that protected exponentials has the unifier above the fray.

[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.800]
The senator is fueling the media characterization that Dr. Wright is some retiring old uncle

[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.580]
in the church basement.

[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.380]
I don't know if Reynolds' egotist to help Wright stage a disastrous news conference

[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.360]
of the National Media was where trying to help Clinton.

[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.000]
My queries to Reynolds by phone and email weren't returned yesterday,

[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.400]
but I'd say she didn't see any conflict between promoting Wright and supporting Clinton.

[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.120]
This is on Ross' story this morning.

[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.160]
I'm pretty rough, he asked me.

[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.840]
How do you like that?

[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:12.380]
I don't.

[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.140]
They will do anything and everything to Clinton.

[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.360]
They will smear.

[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.380]
They will smear.

[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.180]
They will be great.

[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.480]
I'm in a drugstore yesterday getting that expectorant.

[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.280]
And here's the National Enquirer sitting there on the stand.

[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.300]
I didn't buy it, thank god.

[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.480]
I'm cured myself of that.

[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.180]
Big front page story.

[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:35.140]
Oh, Obama's wife is the marriage is on the rocks and Michele's whipped up to her friends.

[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.420]
He's been cheating on the side.

[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.320]
This is an enquirer.

[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:46.740]
They will make him out to be Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, and Ganges Khan,

[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.100]
all combined, all rolled into one.

[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.980]
And I just noticed on the new Indiana pull,

[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.820]
Swellri's nine points ahead in Indiana.

[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.400]
This is the big smear and smear.

[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.040]
These are the final acts of desperation and believe you may either take an airy shot they can.

[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.780]
The Clintons, evil doers.

[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.240]
Not as evil as the Bush Mises, but nevertheless right in their own category, evil doers.

[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.420]
I hear the most important story that I promised I would get to when I didn't

[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.560]
saw already on the stand 30, which is my way of killing.

[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.060]
I saw much better today, don't I?

[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.540]
Yes you do.

[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.960]
Ah, must be that expectorant.

[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.660]
Thank you so much.

[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.320]
Although I still say I haven't, you know, there's still some stuff in there.

[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.520]
I know I guess today, right?

[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.900]
It ain't going to happen overnight.

[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:35.920]
Why not?

[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.480]
Because that's how God punishes you.

[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.980]
Well, screw God, okay.

[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.200]
That's the same God that put that jackass here on my right on that stage yesterday talking a lot of crap.

[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.020]
God, I didn't do that.

[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.780]
Don't blame that on God.

[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.520]
God done it.

[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.620]
No, he didn't.

[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.180]
He put him in.

[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.060]
All him to no ministry.

[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:55.000]
We say God that made the cock roaches and the mosquitoes and the armadillos and the crocodiles.

[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.080]
God created a crock.

[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.600]
This is what he did.

[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.540]
Ray Crock and he invented the McDonald's.

[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.440]
Which like I told you, although I haven't been here in a while now, maybe this afternoon for lunch, I'll go to Mickey D's.

[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:07.360]
I

[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.520]
am so worn out for man, always like an hour ago, but I'm just, you shouldn't done it.

[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.740]
No, it was two hours ago.

[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.900]
I had no idea the power cords were so, you know, jump a riot back to the party.

[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.660]
The whole thing here is like a like a big mishmash.

[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.040]
Okay.

[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.800]
There are cords and there are wires and it all works just fine.

[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.420]
But you dash and mess with the mystery and for just a second, I went into a panic because I thought,

[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.420]
oh, I can't get the damn modem back on again.

[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.280]
The lights won't come on.

[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.100]
It's got no juice.

[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.660]
And then I realized it's got that little on-off switch.

[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.080]
Little teeny tiny on-off switch, the size of, um,

[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.680]
Mickey Mouse's thing.

[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:43.940]
No juice.

[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.040]
Oh, man, different.

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.480]
No juice.

[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.220]
I'm about to get that.

[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.280]
And I thought, oh, we're not going to get that modem working again, which means I lost my

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:49.500]
internet.

[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.920]
And if that would have happened, Mr.

[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.340]
I'd have been pretty p-o-de-your-ass.

[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.720]
Well, I would have had to do the show then.

[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:54.900]
Why?

[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.440]
Because there's no way that you can do the show without the internet.

[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.680]
I got already got all my stuff printed.

[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.240]
Oh, okay.

[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.480]
Like it said, you're going to take a chance with that without all my material printed out.

[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.140]
Right.

[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.220]
I may be crazy, which of course I am, but not that crazy.

[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:07.920]
Okay, good.

[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:08.360]
Not yet.

[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.300]
I may be stupid, which I am.

[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.660]
Now, I got to do the break and then we'll do this important story.

[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.640]
Mending McCreety weeks as she confirms a fair with Roger Clemens.

[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.180]
How about who's more important in American history?

[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.660]
Samuel Langhorn Clemens or Roger Clemens?

[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:26.700]
Who?

[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.280]
Mark Twain.

[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.080]
Oh, no, I know that one.

[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:30.860]
It's the other one.

[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.080]
The whole is Roger.

[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.500]
26 past 10 a.k.a.

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:36.820]
m.

[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.840]
Attention, male golfers.

[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.460]
How many times this happened to you?

[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.240]
You arrive at the course.

[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.120]
You hit the restroom one last time before you tee off and then you're on the 18 holes with

[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:45.740]
your best buddies.

[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.260]
After drinking sports aides, water, beer, and whatever you're on the third hole with no

[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.820]
restroom anywhere inside, no trees, no bushes around you just got to go.

[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:54.760]
What are you going to do?

[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.700]
Introducing the Euro Club, the discrete sanitary way for your urgent relief.

[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.980]
And believe me if there's anybody who knows about the need for urgent relief, you're listening to them.

[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.560]
Created by a board certified urologist who looks like an ordinary golf club,

[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.460]
a condenser reservoir built into the grip to relieve yourself.

[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.960]
The Euro Club comes with a special towel to keep your privacy and looks to everybody else

[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.080]
who just checking out your club.

[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.020]
Sanitary leak proof easy to clean no more embarrassing moments in the bush.

[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.720]
Only $49.95.

[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.660]
Let me say it again just $49.95 for a limited time order now and get a second Euro Club for a half price.

[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.420]
Call Euro Club now at $8.66.994.000.

[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.160]
That's $8.669.994.876.

[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.440]
The Euro Club, the only club you'd in your bag guaranteed to keep you out of the woods.

[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.800]
The biggest name of the best town of fiat.

[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.200]
The largest sport in the five sixty-two-a-am.

[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.920]
The sports leader.

[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.400]
Bit you slept you wore.

[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.100]
That's a new name.

[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.260]
Oh, I can get a gig dummy.

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.520]
A play me home.

[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:13.340]
Oh, I like to think politics is something I know.

[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:19.020]
Oh, I don't know too much, but it's the best.

[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.280]
This bag can be good.

[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.680]
You, you, you, you'll favorite.

[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.840]
We ride in my thoughts to say.

[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.500]
Yeah, that hill is for you.

[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.200]
Huh?

[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.500]
You may think that I live here.

[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.760]
But then again, no.

[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.140]
No, no, no, no.

[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:40.660]
No, no, no.

[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.360]
And you, no.

[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.680]
And you, no.

[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:51.460]
I have a man chilling with a ringlid because your country blows.

[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.260]
Oh, oh, it's no life.

[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.040]
Only want your money so a few concerts that do.

[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:06.260]
Oh, hill of me is the biggest bad guy I ever used.

[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.580]
So I'm telling everybody,

[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.920]
for all the bad-ass girls,

[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.740]
and make the dumbest powerful.

[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.100]
It's in the world.

[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.580]
The world becomes wise.

[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.620]
The world becomes wise.

[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.760]
And keep the world house wise.

[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:40.520]
I want a children pager who thinks he'e aponento, pull'd high.

[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.920]
I wouldn't be surprised.

[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.340]
He wouldn't shock me completely if the accountant started using the N-word.

[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.340]
You know, just out of desperation in the next couple months.

[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.840]
They, if they thought it would work, they would.

[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.740]
But that's what I'm saying.

[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.360]
The N word, having new people notice he's an N, you know, like that.

[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.840]
And of course there in A, there are a couple of A's, holes.

[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.300]
We got a thousand votes, I changed the poll Chris.

[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:02.620]
Oh well.

[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.460]
See, you can keep up with me no more, you're just a big fat old toad.

[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.100]
Sitting on that big old chair.

[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:09.900]
Uh-huh.

[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:10.920]
Three days.

[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.400]
It would be about a 20% increase of all crude oil production over US levels.

[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.700]
And it would likely mean lower gas prices.

[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:21.720]
Yeah.

[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.420]
And yes, such efforts to explore them.

[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.600]
And N word have been consistently blocked.

[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.740]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:29.800]
Right.

[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.040]
This is a crazy person.

[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.680]
And of course the people who still support them are even crazier.

[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.700]
Thousands of votes on the poll it's done.

[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.200]
It's finished.

[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.320]
What's the worst thing that fills you off about most about your neighbor?

[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.140]
I like all my neighbors, 199.

[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.940]
Twenty percent of the audience, they love their neighbor as they love themselves.

[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.520]
Like the Bible says, the good book.

[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.680]
The good book says, stone your children to death and they disappear.

[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.060]
That's what the good book says.

[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.320]
Kill all your enemies.

[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.280]
Every last one.

[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:56.640]
That's right.

[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.520]
And the babies and the goats.

[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.160]
Right.

[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.180]
Oh, let's see.

[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.620]
Neverstick, the nurse, everybody's business.

[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.920]
We're a treble 142.

[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.120]
A lot of their bells and cats to crap all over your lawn.

[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:05.720]
120.

[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.360]
Allowing their outside dogs to bark and bark all night.

[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.120]
Long 150.

[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.540]
There's a solution for that.

[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.720]
Not for the dogs for the neighbors.

[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.340]
Last but not least is music and party until midnight several times a week 103.

[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.420]
Park their cars partially on your yard in front of your house 70.

[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.360]
Don't deal drugs 52.

[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.580]
Pedal their religion 33 like Cindy.

[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.400]
Cindy quit peddling your religion party.

[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:27.960]
Get lost.

[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.600]
Cut the crap.

[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.820]
Leave their garbage cans out all week 29.

[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.320]
Never more the grass 29.

[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.820]
Work on their vehicles jacked up on center blocks leaving parts all over the place 25.

[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.440]
Paint their house in insane color like real blue or plaid or all of these apocodotes 19.

[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.560]
Neglect their kids 18.

[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.760]
Leave their Christmas lights hung under house all year 15.

[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.300]
Deal drugs 13.

[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.220]
I wonder if that drug house is still operating in my neighborhood.

[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.420]
You better go check it out.

[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.040]
Okay.

[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.060]
The right drug house.

[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:58.980]
I think there's two of them now.

[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.020]
Really could you drop me a map?

[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.540]
No, it's easy to find.

[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.240]
Send me Google map.

[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.260]
Always ask for favors 11 and every turn stuff they borrow like that.

[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.060]
Copy sugar like a lump of a coal 7.

[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.560]
What else in a bus borrow?

[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.040]
Flower like a lot of your into this story and I never do what the long or flower.

[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.340]
Yeah, I guess.

[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.860]
Tools screwdriver.

[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:21.340]
Sure.

[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.280]
Berricaded behind tightly drawn blinds at a Nashville home yesterday.

[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.660]
Country singer Mindy McCreedy never heard of her.

[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.680]
Confirmed a long-term affair with the battle picture Roger Clemens.

[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.700]
You ever hear Mindy McCreedy?

[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.300]
Nope.

[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.280]
Country singer baby in Nashville.

[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.380]
Ha ha ha.

[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.080]
I've actually picked it a lot.

[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.800]
I can't refune anything in the story.

[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.820]
A cheerful, but resolute McCreedy told the New York Daily News which broke the statement

[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.320]
night Sunday.

[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.020]
More for Roger.

[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:46.900]
He's got more problems.

[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.000]
He's got hemorrhoids and steroids and asteroids and now he's got this bitch on the

[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.380]
side.

[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.820]
The news reported that the two men in a Florida karaoke bar when McCreedy was a 15-year-old

[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.140]
aspiring singer and Clemens was a 20-year-old ace for the Red Sox and married father of

[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:02.440]
two.

[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.080]
She was a 15-year-old ace, firing singer.

[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.840]
Yes I know Roger Clemens for a long time at McCreedy said reading from a prepared statement.

[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.200]
He's a kind and caring man.

[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.660]
He's also a legendary athlete.

[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.260]
The central topic of debate, however, regards his professional life not his personal life.

[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.800]
There are legal matters working their way through the system that have nothing to do with

[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:20.900]
me.

[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.740]
She said, for my point of view, that's where the focus should remain.

[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.280]
After the teenage McCreedy met Clemens at a Fort Myers-Barr call the hired hand.

[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.620]
Oh my God.

[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.700]
I wonder where that hand was.

[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.180]
Correct him.

[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.860]
She returned with the rocket to his hotel room but there was no sex that night sources

[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.600]
told the news.

[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.880]
It wasn't until later that McCreedy had moved the Nashville and become a country-sing star

[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.540]
that the relationship turned intimate.

[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.820]
A lot of it would take a 15-year-old girl to a girl to his hotel room.

[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.000]
Tell her stories about his baseball career and let us be it.

[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.280]
Maybe to share some of those rights?

[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:54.820]
Sure.

[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.520]
Clemens is under FBI.

[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.320]
Well we know about that.

[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.340]
The rocket filed a defamation suit against McNamee on Oh, oh, Brian McNamee.

[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.280]
On January the 6th McNamee's lawyer Richard Emory said, revelations of the affair would

[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.800]
have a big impact on the case because the influence Clemens claimed that his reputation

[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.480]
was damaged.

[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.360]
If the case had to travel as not dismissed as we feel it should be, we'll be calling McCreedy

[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.320]
as a witness, Emory said.

[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.600]
The point is whether he was damaged by the allegations that he used steroids, he claims

[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.480]
he was hurt, but if there are other women and is not just one case in this case but many,

[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.840]
and he holds himself out as a family man in American paradigm, it's relevant.

[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.560]
None of this would have been revealed but for his lawsuit in Sanctomoneas testimony before

[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.020]
Congress.

[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:42.160]
And a statement Monday, Clemens' lawyer Rusty Harden confirmed McCreedy was a long-time

[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.200]
friend to Clemens and his family that said the relationship was not sexual.

[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.280]
Instead of mis-issuing or sending, had no time to lodge or engage in any kind of inappropriate

[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.940]
or improper relationship with her, he said, but sources would acknowledge the relationship

[00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.360]
between the singer and Clemens say, McCreedy has never met Rodgers' wife Debbie Clemens.

[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.580]
And what does that prove?

[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.040]
I don't know.

[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:04.940]
You got a wife?

[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:05.860]
You got a wife?

[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:06.360]
Yeah.

[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.920]
Debbie Clemens had already emerged as a character in the Mitchell Report Sagan February

[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.700]
when news first reported that Mac made an injector the former cheerleader with human growth

[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.080]
hormone before she posts for a sports illustrated swimsuit issue.

[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.540]
When it doubted, who saws babies up?

[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.600]
Clemens later confirmed his tale in his congressional testimony.

[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.280]
The news also reported Monday that Clemens sent bundles of cash to McCreedy and FedEx packages

[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.080]
to help out her family financially.

[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.980]
He sent her bundles of cash and FedEx packages when that's going to start coming here.

[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.480]
I get a lot of FedEx packages every week but when's the cash start coming?

[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:39.800]
Right.

[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.100]
Huh?

[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.920]
Hey, chicken, that's when's the cash going to start coming in those FedEx packages?

[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.360]
I think there's one coming today.

[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.440]
And also I got a case of fax paper coming in there.

[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.280]
Well, what a banner day in my life.

[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:51.580]
Wow.

[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.580]
Woo!

[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:53.480]
Heavy duty.

[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.060]
And you'd be pleased to know I got some more of that oxygen, some more of those as a

[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.720]
halls oxygen?

[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.280]
All right.

[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.740]
Which aren't loaded with all that crap that make you a...

[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.160]
Yeah, no.

[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.680]
She suffered some legal troubles which included a 2004 rest for prescription fraud and jail

[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.260]
time last year for violating probation.

[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.980]
She's got some issues, baby.

[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.040]
And I just hate that expression.

[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.980]
Or he's got issues, she's got issues.

[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.940]
Who the hell doesn't?

[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.340]
You know what I mean?

[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.320]
No right, you're right.

[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.800]
Stupid expression.

[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.760]
Stupid, stupid idiotic expression.

[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.240]
So is this till the news McCready also received hefty checks, courtesy of Clements, some

[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.900]
of the amount of 25,000 dollars that were channeled to the singer through an intermediary

[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:33.500]
through a Pimp.

[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.220]
Pimp my check.

[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.500]
Such an arrangement raises questions as to why Clements would go through a third party

[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.700]
if you'd money to McCready if she and the rocket were just friends.

[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:42.620]
The rocket.

[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.100]
I wonder if he had a younger brother like Maurice Recher, the pocket rocket, Henry Recher.

[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.580]
Remember Henry Recher?

[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:49.720]
Nope.

[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.100]
Do you remember Maurice Recher, the rocket?

[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.260]
I remember him talking about these people.

[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.100]
We need to get some hockey on here, man.

[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:58.920]
This station is lost.

[00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.920]
It's touched with hockey.

[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.100]
Well, we'll be doing it, Boris Miranov, but he's almost as ugly as his brother, not

[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:14.440]
quite.

[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.900]
The Meets you Miranov.

[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.640]
I remember that he played for the Leafs, number 15.

[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.760]
Well, what a memory I got.

[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:20.520]
For crap.

[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.020]
Such an arrangement raises questions as to why Clements would go through a third party

[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.180]
to give money to McCready if she and the rocket were just friends.

[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.280]
It's a suspicious conduct and it's something we'll question Clements about in a deposition

[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.320]
magazine or a reward said, every avenue will be explored at the deposition in Clements

[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.540]
data, Deformation Seuth.

[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.480]
McCready did her part to put some positive light on Clements and his legal morass.

[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.640]
I have no doubt that Vagiar has had excellent legal representation emerged from this a strong

[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.980]
person and a revered athlete.

[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.020]
She said, I wish him and his family the best.

[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.040]
My comment is, hope and be enrared.

[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.260]
Details and relationship could also emerge in several media projects and recreates involved,

[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.140]
including a documentary film, which is to begin filming soon, a new out-of-meadow reality

[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:01.420]
show.

[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.700]
All of these stand-stands, how do you like that?

[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.340]
She's busy.

[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.240]
And in the McCready.

[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.740]
Probably because she ain't getting those FedEx packages no more with big bundles of cash

[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.140]
in it.

[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.980]
Wouldn't be a nice thing if people would just send us FedEx packages with just tons and

[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.540]
tons of cash.

[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.680]
The address is 202.25.

[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.320]
Yeah, Northwest Second Avenue, Miami 331 and the 95.

[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:21.480]
Sixth grade.

[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.180]
Three, two, one, six, nine.

[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.480]
Like I said, don't get it wrong.

[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.500]
It'll get there.

[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.020]
All right.

[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.980]
That's Jorge Rodriguez, Kera Vigil.

[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.880]
Oh, so much better today.

[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.960]
Maybe during the break, I'll take me a couple of teaspoons.

[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.600]
And this stuff doesn't taste all that bad.

[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.040]
It's the Rexall House brand, you know?

[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.940]
I couldn't find it when you were talking about FedEx.

[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:42.500]
Yeah.

[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.020]
But I got an expectation.

[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.300]
It will make me all over the place.

[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.340]
All over the mic.

[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.200]
Through the radio buttons.

[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.180]
It's up to the switch.

[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:51.640]
It's a little rough.

[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.000]
Jorge, you're 5.

[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.120]
52 AM.

[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:54.660]
And big.

[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.940]
Fourth leader.

[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:56.800]
Oh, God.

[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.900]
MFL films present.

[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.460]
Don't let the door hitcher with a good Lord's blitcher.

[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:14.400]
Whether it's mustering one win in a 16-game campaign or making a 13-in-3 contender into a

[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.740]
5-and-11 meteor of mediocrity.

[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.640]
NFL head coaches know it's not just quarterbacks who get sacked.

[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:32.360]
And so on any given weekday, Mindy from HR will issue your final paycheck and discuss

[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.500]
co-bra healthcare options.

[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:41.620]
Then with security leading the way, you'll clean out your desk, grab your fight-his-plant,

[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.960]
and age it the facility to the battle cry.

[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.840]
Don't let the door hitcher with a good Lord's blitcher.

[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.840]
Rack them.

[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.320]
Okay, 10-47 at 5-60 WQ AM.

[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.780]
I didn't do the schedule yet today, man.

[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.620]
You better get win-out.

[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:55.940]
Come on.

[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.940]
The Herc Show 2-4.

[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.740]
With the one and only Jason Jerks.

[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.340]
Mad Dog 4-6-50.

[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.220]
What answer have we got?

[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.060]
The first pitch.

[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.760]
We've just the angle before the Marlin game.

[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.140]
Even though we don't carry the Marlin games.

[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:38.120]
But those 10 minutes allow us to get about 8-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.980]
Of course, there could be a lot of other things, but we would have to be religious but not any more 11.

[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:51.320]
Voted from Bush. Now, I hate him, 6. Good. Used to be Republican now Democrat, 5. Even better. Used to be atheist, but found God, 3.

[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.820]
Deal, God! We're different.

[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:47.800]
We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different. We're different.

[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:47.880]
Down payment Mumworth and

[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.140]
Piyan Bank. B.'s worth value is...!

[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.140]

[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.140]

[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.140]

[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.660]
...in Brinn-

[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.480]
That's seven bucks ago-

[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:17.780]
It's cash donations-

[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:23.360]
of higher petrol and diesel costs. The price of oil came close to 120 bucks a

[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.100]
barrel yesterday was trading starting lower at 118 early train today. Let me take a

[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.200]
puke getter right now. I'll tell you what it is. You want me to take a puke getter?

[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:38.040]
All right. I'll get the puke ready. Oh boy. Oh 1696 and dropping. Oh all right.

[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:45.940]
Let's sell it. 1697 going back up. Let's have a party. Meanwhile the price of

[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.060]
petrol continues to rise because of supply concerns in Scotland where the

[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.420]
grain's mouth refinery will shut down for today's because of

[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.780]
industrial action. It always got some good excuse. You know. Let's act out to do

[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.500]
the price of peas in an up here. Workers have now returned to grain's mouth but

[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.380]
it'll take about three weeks to get the refinery which produces 10% of the

[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:10.280]
UK's petrol up to four capacity of grain. The automobile association said that

[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:16.860]
petrol price had a national average of one oh nine point eight pounds. Equivalent

[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.320]
to four ninety nine pounds a gallon. Now that's a leader. Four ninety nine that's

[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:26.360]
like ten bucks. Petrols expected to pass the five pound mark possibly as

[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.560]
released today ten dollars a gallon for the poor Brits where they deserve it.

[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.780]
Shell's earnings of seven point seventy eight billion were had a market

[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.100]
estimates of six point seventy eight billion as production rose from three point

[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.120]
five oh nine million to three point five two two billion barrels of oil

[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.500]
equivalent a day. The company share raised its quarterly dividend by eleven

[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:49.220]
percent to forty cents a share. Jason Kenny oil anglers that in said they look

[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:55.320]
like blow away numbers. Yeah they're blowing everybody away. See and if I thought

[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.700]
it would affect the price oil positively I'm seriously concerned. Oh yeah sure

[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.660]
you would you you robber you grave robber you bastard you butcher you and your

[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.460]
buddies the Saudis man you should all ride a wicked death in hell.

[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.080]
Shell's total cash flow is fifty percent up on the same period last year at sixteen

[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.580]
point nine billion but this was offset by higher capital investment in new production.

[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.300]
Your invader here.

[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.760]
Shell chief executive said good operating performance combined with increased oil

[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.360]
gas prices offset the impact of downstream condition in the first quarter so

[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:30.080]
every time you fill up your tank and you say oh my god dang dang damn crap and a

[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.920]
bunch of other stuff that I can't say on a year just think about the fact that

[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.420]
the oil companies are making record profits again year after year after year

[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.320]
record profits on the back of the pro shlup were out there and here's your

[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:48.300]
present up there. It is vision is incredibly dark I mean it's very important for

[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.100]
the American people to remember what life was like in Afghanistan prior to the

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.580]
liberation of the country. Yeah we know a lot about that government in place that

[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:02.620]
used people human rights and women's own money off and pop it all school

[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.120]
just still doing and they provided safe haven't al Qaeda.

[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.140]
In the liberation of this country we've achieved some. Yeah they're doing some

[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.340]
damn good things over there. Carls I almost got assassinated yesterday do you see

[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:19.000]
that? No. Well I want to get you to depressive about that here's some more

[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.480]
depressing. New research challenges the notion that you can be fat and fit.

[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.720]
Finding that being active can lower but not eliminate heart risks faced by

[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.620]
heavy women. It doesn't take away the risk entirely. Wait still matters to

[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.020]
Dr. Martha Gulati high specialist Northwestern why do these stories always

[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.600]
about women? I mean don't don't we men count for anything or what? No that

[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.360]
anymore. How about fat men they don't count either? Well they're going to be

[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.360]
jetting. They're going to be in a bad environment around this place around this

[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.860]
nation. God. Previous research has gone back and forth on whether or

[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.560]
tomorrow's George is big meeting with Joe Bell speaking of fat people at

[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:58.380]
the time. I'm George's future with WQM and his big pay raise.

[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.180]
Previous research has gone back and forth on whether exercise or weight has

[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:11.800]
a greater influence on heart disease risks. The new study involving nearly 39,000

[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.720]
women helps sort out the combined effects of physical activity and body mass.

[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.180]
A woman's chance is developing heart disease at Gulati who wasn't involved in

[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.620]
research. The study by Harvard Affiliated researchers appears in yesterday's

[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.000]
archives of internal medicine which I'm sure you guys read religiously. Oh yeah.

[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.420]
Everyday. Participants were women age 54 on average who filled out a question

[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.200]
there at the study start detailing their height their weight amount of weekly

[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.980]
physical activity in the past year including walking jogging, bicycling, and

[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:41.060]
swimming. They were then tracked for about 11 years. Overall 948 women developed

[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.780]
heart disease. Women were considered active that they followed government

[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.900]
recommended guidelines. Got at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of

[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.400]
week including wrist walking or jogging women who got less exercise than that

[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.760]
were considered inactive. Weight was evaluated by body mass index compared with

[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:00.340]
normal weight active women the risk for developing heart disease was 54% higher

[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:05.740]
and overweight active women and 87% higher and obese active women. By contrast it

[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.660]
was 88% higher and overweight and active women and two and a half times

[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:15.140]
greater and obese and active women. You found all those stats? I don't. About two

[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.080]
and five US women at age 50 will eventually develop heart attacks or other

[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.140]
cardiovascular problems. Access weight can raise those odds in many cases.

[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.140]
Well in other words just do a lot of exercise I got to cut the mustard.

[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.660]
Assuming of course that fat people do a lot of exercise which is a false

[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.940]
assumption because we don't. We'll be hit by nature. We'll leave a lot of

[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:41.280]
exercise. You wouldn't be fat. My exercise is like wadland from here to the

[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.240]
refrigerator and then to the couch turn on the TV. If you change in the channels

[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:49.360]
on the remote was like exercise man I'd be slim. I'd be slim pickings. There you go.

[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.880]
It's not our nation's interest. We're in a global struggle against thugs and

[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:58.120]
killers and the United States of America has got to continue to take the lead

[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:03.460]
and so in Afghanistan yeah we're making progress. Is that mean? You know that

[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.720]
over? No it doesn't mean it's over. Where in a long struggle? Your

[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:12.980]
president is the main crisis of losing it if he ever had artists. You defeat

[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.740]
him ultimately by the advance of democracy. Oh yeah. This is an ideological

[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:23.160]
struggle. These aren't isolated in law enforcement moments. We're dealing with a

[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.640]
group of ideologues who use asymmetrical warfare that means killing innocent

[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.920]
people to try to achieve their objectives and one objective is to drive us out

[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:37.700]
of Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East or anywhere else where we try to

[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.980]
confront or just drive us out of our mind of which he's doing a great job.

[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:48.740]
I got the rest out. I'm going to be the fourth leader.

[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.460]
He's the third or five. He's the third or five.

[00:44:52.460 --> 00:45:01.540]
So who is the third? Oh, Dr. Dory. Any question? Some people call me the

[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:11.500]
fourth runner. Yeah. Some call me the next president. Some people call me

[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:21.540]
Hussein because my success is something the frankly they resent. But there's

[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:30.580]
something about me, baby. The folks, oh, some folks think it's wrong. It's very

[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:41.460]
wrong. I have an addiction to nicotine. Now, baby. I tried to quit. I tried to quit.

[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:47.520]
It's just too strong. Yes, I'm a smoker. A two-packer, a butt bummer, a morning

[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:57.860]
hacker. Hiding from the press is so much fun. No joking. I love smoking. But one

[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:05.020]
thing I'm sure hoping that my campaign won't be undone.

[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:10.360]
Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo.

[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.700]
It's 11-11 at 560 WQ. I mean, I knew where by your president in

[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:21.300]
train just engines. And he even in virtually and he still couldn't get it out.

[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.800]
When it doubt he blurted it out. Fresh sports. More.

[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.700]
Mishra is a species. He's illiterate. He's a moron. He's an idiot. And he's a

[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.560]
president of you. Yeah. And the people in the media like take it seriously,

[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.140]
like business for real. You know, not some kind of a moron who was born with a

[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:48.800]
silver spoon up his ass. Here's another very important story. Ashley Duprey from

[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:53.380]
Spitzer College World case. Suits girls gone wild for $10 million over photos and

[00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:58.600]
videos. What could be more important than that? Except maybe that Roger Clemen story.

[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:04.440]
The college girl who triggered the downfall of former New York governor Elliot Spitzer sued the

[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.780]
founder of the racey girls gone wild videos Monday for $10 million.

[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.960]
Sliming her image and name are being exploited.

[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.800]
Actually, Alexander Duprey also contended lawsuit that she was only 17 to

[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.520]
young this sign legally binding contracts and drunk on spring break in 2003.

[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.200]
When she agreed to be filmed for girls gone wild and my meat beach.

[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:29.740]
Beach. Duprey did not understand the magnitude of

[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.200]
reactions nor that her image in like this will be displayed in videos and DVDs.

[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.900]
Since the lawsuit filed by Miami Attorney Richard C. Wolfe, I wonder if he's

[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.520]
kin to Michael Wolfe? I don't know. I ask.

[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:45.140]
And a lot of think Wolfe. Or maybe he's just kin to the big band.

[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:50.580]
The lawsuit filed in federal court. Miami names the defendant's girls gone wild founder Joe Francis.

[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.200]
Two of his companies and a man purportedly involved in creation of two internet sites.

[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.860]
The lawsuit contends and properly used Duprey to sell DVDs and other products.

[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.860]
Francis 35 has built a soft porn empire filming and marketing videos of young women

[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.760]
exposing their breasts and being shown in other sexually provocative situations,

[00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.900]
often in public events such as Marty Roth or Beach Spring Break Locals.

[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.980]
Duprey got famous in March as the high price call girl named Kristen, who was hired by

[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.240]
Spitzer for at least one twist at a plush washroom in hotel for one bang.

[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.620]
I wonder if he got more bang for his buck? I'll ask him.

[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.140]
Spitzer known as client young and court documents reside as New York Governor

[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:32.920]
a few days after the scandal broke as we all know. Francis made public a million dollar offer

[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.360]
for Duprey to appear in girls' vile video and go on promotional tour then rescinded the offer

[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:43.460]
after her archival footage from 2003 surfaced. Duprey's lawyer also warned she was only 17 when

[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.980]
the video was shot. Not 18 is Francis claimed. Uh-huh.

[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:48.640]
jail beat.

[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.080]
Francis said in March that Duprey spent a week on a girls' gun of mouth bus made seven full length

[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.720]
tapes after signing release papers. He also said he bought a robusta at home to North Carolina.

[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.280]
Nothing could be finer than go back to North Carolina. Francis said he was surprised by the lawsuit.

[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:09.020]
It's uninccomprantable that Duprey could claim she didn't give her consent to be filmed by

[00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:13.480]
girls gone wild when in fact we have video tape over giving consent while showing her identification

[00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:19.920]
Francis said in the statement. Francis said the photos were taken in front of room full of people

[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.520]
including two newspapers and multiple crews we had in the room according to the statement.

[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.400]
He also said he would be happy to discuss the millions out offer with her again.

[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.360]
The lawsuit claims Duprey's the victim of unfair trade practices false advertising

[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:39.120]
on authorized use of her likeness. Francis has no stranger to legal problems in Florida. He spent

[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.120]
a year in jail was released in March after pleading no contest to charges of child abuse and

[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:47.320]
prostitution charges for filming underwrapped girls in the pan-handled beach town of Panama City.

[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.900]
All those good religious kids go there on the buses to Panama City and they screw their brains out

[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:58.800]
on the beach. All right for for the Lord that's right there's school and for God baby. Oh God

[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:03.280]
that's good there's screaming they're yelling and wheeling. Four women who crammed they were

[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.480]
17 or underwent filmed a filed civil lawsuit against Francis. Francis also faces federal

[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.820]
tax evasion charges in California prosecutors say companies control my Francis claim more than

[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:17.860]
20 million dollars in phony deductions in 2002 and 2003 and that Francis used offshore accounts

[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:26.420]
to conceal income. Right he's got sores he's got issues when you're saying indeed although

[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:35.280]
although what what a great idea like to be that guy. I mean as you knew after Wednesday maybe

[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:41.720]
there's you know patients sure after you tell jolly joda stick his offer of a pay decrease

[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.960]
where the moonbones try. What if he says to you like he said to me I'm going to cut your pay by 50%

[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:55.540]
uh nice no give you what nice knowing you. We'll give you five more years after this year of what

[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:59.980]
of five more years ago and deeper in the day. Oh yeah yeah desperation right exactly.

[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:10.660]
Uh lack of cooperation no promotion all of these things. A lot of BS, a lot of Rahu Rahu

[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:19.080]
sis boom ba yeah not even. I wouldn't do it. No. 71 votes on this new pool. What do you think of

[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:26.520]
the new pool Chris? They were missing a couple things okay. Hillary and Bill. Oh yeah.

[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:34.040]
Used to like the Clintons but now hate him right. Good one. And a good one yeah.

[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.840]
Got it. You go in and out. Here's what we got so far. Used to be religious not anymore 23.

[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:48.980]
Voted for Bush but now hate him 10. Hate him. It helped. Rumors about Iranian help.

[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:57.500]
And these countries are just named our all written for us to wipe them off the map that's right.

[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.280]
Used to be Republican now Democrat 8. Used to be conservative now level 6.

[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.800]
Used to be a little now conservative 5. Used to hate Neil now like him 5.

[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:14.080]
Used to be an atheist but found God 5. Used to support war now opposite 5. Used to like Neil

[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:21.720]
now hate him 3. Used to be a Democrat now Republican 1. Used to be gay now straighting out one.

[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:28.920]
Once hated Bush now like him 1. Oh let's find that one. Used to oppose war now supported none

[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:33.520]
out of 73 votes. And what are we adding on there. Used to like the Clintons now hate him.

[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:42.860]
Hate them like poison. There you go again. I did not say that you're trying to put words in my mouth

[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:48.080]
and you know do this all the time follow me around. Do you do that finger man wagging that finger

[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.220]
when he waves the finger the lies just keep getting bigger his nose keeps getting longer.

[00:52:54.820 --> 00:53:00.100]
First you know what I said you and I don't like that in trangesons either.

[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:07.880]
In what a sense he just stands up there in front of all these media people and makes all these

[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:14.820]
errors and it talks like a moron like a high school dropout like an elementary school dropout.

[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.700]
And they continue getting up there and asking well Mr. President thank you so much and

[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.960]
you have a good BM this morning how you doing Mr. President.

[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:29.520]
You and Laura still are doing the nasty. Well what I thought that is.

[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:38.080]
Sorry to ruin your day. Although you see I'm trying what I'm trying to do is make today really

[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.040]
bad for them tomorrow. Whatever happens tomorrow will be better. Yeah I doubt it.

[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.860]
Why do you say that? In other words you're pessimistic going into your big meeting with the

[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.860]
guy. No no no no it's just you know it's one of those unknown things it's like you know what's

[00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.640]
in the box that sort of thing. Yeah it's like that offer that they made me unknown.

[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.820]

And rightfully so they will do anything it doesn't make any difference what it is they will do

[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:24.840]
anything to get her the nomination. They don't give a crap about the country they don't give a crap

[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:28.240]
about the Democratic Party they don't give a crap about the world about anything.

[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:33.200]
All they give a crap about is themselves and getting back their asses back in that door man.

[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.540]
They liked it they had eight years of a good life and how they wanted back.

[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.100]
And they only made $109 million last year I mean you know times are tough George.

[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.660]

[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:27.320]
coming up until this afternoon in spite of public outcry. Here's the facts from somebody who says

[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.800]
here's one for the poll. Used to be obsessed with sports watching now I couldn't care less.

[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:39.780]
Why don't we say that? Well however they said it. Used to be obsessed with sports watching now I

[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:44.280]
couldn't care less. You got room for that on the poll. You're crazy. We can write a book on there.

[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.720]
On what? You can write a book on it. No you couldn't because you never were obsessed with

[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.380]
watching sports. No but I mean any answer that we put on there. I watched the hockey game last night.

[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:57.380]
I watched the fire's beat the Canadian. It could be better Neil but Marty Turko has been

[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.200]
still in the devil. Nobody wants to know about the dance.

[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:14.440]
Wow how do you like that huh? That's that screaming Gary Thorne on ESPN screaming and

[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:19.620]
wailing and just carrying on. So we're going to put that on there. Used to be obsessed with

[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:25.100]
watching sports now I couldn't care less. Yeah. Oh look at that the Clintons have moved to the

[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:30.720]
second place. They're going to be on top so to speak. They're rushing to the top

[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:37.840]
because anybody with a brain realizes that they're just a devious and dangerous and full of crap.

[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:45.340]
Just mindless hate and then to find out that Edna of course doesn't surprise me.

[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:49.020]
They're one of her close allies and supporters who was behind that whole thing with bringing

[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:53.600]
Reverend Jeremiah back there to the National Press Club yesterday. This bastard needs to go

[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.440]
into a broom closet somewhere and not come out to Christmas.

[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.220]
Miserable obnoxious son of a bitch. Yeah let's report.

[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.740]
I don't like him. Oh.

[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:12.040]
116 votes on the new floor. That's not too shabby. Used to be religious not no more or 26.

[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:19.200]
Used to like the Clintons but hate him now. 22. Oh yeah they're moving in the first place.

[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.060]
Hopefully I'm moving back into the White House.

[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.720]
And if anybody wonders why the Republicans are just rubbing their

[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.520]
hind legs together and urging everybody. Oh vote for him. Oh yeah.

[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.480]
Oh yeah. Can't imagine why.

[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.800]
Obonisca is the crap out of them but Hillary oh she's their man.

[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.000]
That's funny on so many levels.

[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.240]
The number of you this is not funny. Well a lot of bad news today man.

[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:50.600]
Not a good day to be doing these things. Let's just play comedy but stuff play all over.

[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.540]
You got to love to play. Oh right.

[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.760]
Oh that should take you still midnight. Easy.

[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.420]
The number of US homes heading toward foreclosure more than doubled in the first quarter

[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:05.200]
from your earlier as weakening property values and tightening petal lending left many homeowners

[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.100]
powerless to prevent homes from being auctioned to the highest bidder.

[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.260]
Among the hardest hit states were Nevada. Florida.

[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:17.760]
And in particular California were stocked in the nation with the foreclosure rate.

[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.540]
There was six point six times higher than the national average.

[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.760]
Nationwide 649,917 homes received at least one foreclosure related filing in the first three

[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.080]
months of the year up a hundred and twelve percent from the San period last year.

[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:37.000]
The latest tally also represents an increase of 23% from the fourth quarter of last year.

[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.880]
All told one in every 194 households received a foreclosure filing during the quarter

[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.680]
foreclosure filings increased in all but four states.

[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.580]
You might want to take this story to the Sun Central and put it on the desk,

[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:51.680]
slap it right in front of his face on the table when you were to lunch with Jolly Jodamau.

[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:52.340]
Okay.

[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:58.180]
And say I don't want to be number 649,918.

[00:59:59.060 --> 00:59:59.280]
Yeah.

[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.660]
The unavailability of loans for people without perfect credit and a significant down payment

[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.720]
is slowing the process. It's a cycle that's going to be difficult to break and we're certainly

[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.100]
not at the breaking point just yet. The surgeon foreclosure filings also suggests that the much

[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.900]
stout of campaigns by lawmakers in the mortgage lending industry ended helping adverse homeowners

[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:23.060]
are not paying off. Hope now, a Bush administration organized mortgage industry group,

[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.500]
said nearly 503 homeowners would receive mortgage aid in the first quarter.

[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.900]
Most of the aid was temporary however. Pennsylvania was a notable standout in ladies foreclosure

[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:36.940]
data. Number of homes in the state to receive a foreclosure related filing plunged 24.4%

[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.600]
per year earlier. They quitted into the client of the states foreclosure relief measures,

[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.340]
noting that cities such as Philadelphia put a place put in place a more

[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.500]
German offer of closure auctions for April implemented other measures aimed at

[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:54.800]
helping slow foreclosures. Nearly 157,000 properties will repossess by lender's nationwide during

[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.980]
a quarter. George is going to be next unless he starts getting some serious, serious money.

[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:09.460]
Doesn't have to be serious. Well, some hilarious money. Yeah. Right. Some funny money.

[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:16.720]
And some sarcastic money. Right. Florida had 87,893 homes

[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.440]
you putting at least one foreclosure filing, a 178% jump from the first quarter last year,

[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:25.900]
and a 17% hike from the fourth quarter of last year. That translates into a foreclosure

[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:31.340]
rate of one in every 97 households. The other states among the top 10 of the highest foreclosure

[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.720]
rates were and I'm going to seize all. Let me back. Colorado.

[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.080]
Georgia. Ohio. Michigan. Massachusetts and Connecticut.

[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.460]
Why would anybody live in Connecticut unless it was like right next to New York City?

[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.620]
Can you imagine? I don't know. I haven't been there. I've heard mixed reviews. Not good.

[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:58.080]
Really? Never been to New Haven? Well, no. Hartford? No. What's bad about it?

[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.840]
Sucks. You know compared to here. Oh, that's great. I see.

[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.860]
Well, if I found out there, I'd move to Connecticut tomorrow. All right.

[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.380]
In fact, I'd be on my B-packing right now. I might be.

[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:16.680]
I'd be packing it. I think these these halls zone, I think they're more harmful than they're

[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.420]
helping. Really? Did that sound better earlier than the show? Well, you were fresh.

[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.860]
Fresh my ass. Refresh your ass. I was fresh. Look at what that was. I mean,

[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.500]
I wasn't fresh. I was fresh from crawling around on a floor, trying to do it a whole bunch of

[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.740]
wires and you're trying to do it by psychic powers from Florida from Florida miles away. Yeah,

[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.120]
I could have done it. You're in Tencent. So what? We could have done it.

[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.920]
I'm not doing it again. Okay. Get the engineering here. He can do it in five minutes. So,

[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.000]
all set up. In fact, if they would have told him to pick up a cheap router on the way over here

[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.700]
last week or when I only showed up, it would be already done and over with. But no, that's not the

[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:59.500]
George Corso way. That's not the Beasley Corp. Way. Oh, no, we might have to spend 50 bucks. Oh,

[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:05.320]
geez. And especially, I might have to spend 50 bucks that we don't have to spend. Maybe the

[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:10.240]
router is not done. But guess what? What? What? Done. And what's it's done? It's done.

[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.240]
What? It's only one vote behind. I like Alexinev rising to the top like this scum,

[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:25.460]
months, it can super refrigerator. Never see the way that works. Sure. The congeals on the

[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:33.700]
top are sitting there. Yeah. Like a layer of thick layer of pus-filled skin. Yeah. And that,

[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.640]
of course, he put a spoon in it and you mix it all back up in the soup again. He'd hit it up and he'd

[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.760]
to soup with all that chicken fat. They're lard on top. Well, that's not lard. What would

[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:50.740]
is lard? Lard is fat. But it can be chicken fat. I don't know. Yeah, you're going to say sure,

[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.120]
sure. Well, why would you say that when you don't know? I don't know. That's why it's not. Sounds to

[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:00.180]
me like lard is beef fat. I don't know. I guess. Sounds right. I'll put a lard. Do it. You'll see,

[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:08.820]
you'll see, um, this is picture there. Under lard asked, fatty pork. Really? A soft white solid or

[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:15.080]
semi-solid fat obtained by rendering a fatty pork. So it's not chicken. It's pork. Chicken fat is

[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:21.200]
different. Chicken fat is here as high in pork because it's kosher. It's Jewish. Jewish fat like

[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.560]
Ron Jeremy. And there was some show on cable. I don't know what it is. Maybe one of you

[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.280]
knows what it is. Another one is eating. Mead and panel shows, you know, like the view where

[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:36.000]
they got a bunch of losers sitting around. Erica Strada was on the panel. Oh, Ron Jeremy. And I

[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.440]
thought the other ones were. It was the most pathetic cast of misfits I've ever seen in my life.

[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.040]
And they were, I don't know what they were talking about. I didn't stop long enough. Erica Strada,

[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:58.080]
hey Eric, you're fairy. Well, Ella Sheikin and Ron Jeremy. I just don't get it. I don't understand it.

[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:04.280]
Although the day he was in that studio, man, all the people in especially the females,

[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:10.220]
all gathering around, oh hey, Ronnie, well, I like my, I hit something movie star. I told you the

[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:15.240]
rule. And what is it? Jays and movies. You see, they've seen your face on something other than your head,

[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:21.920]
your famous, and they love you, and they want you. That's how chicks are. It could be unwanted poster.

[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:26.580]
They want him. It could be unwanted poster. It could be on a roll of toilet paper. It could be on a

[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:31.780]
box of cereal. Ron's had a roll of toilet paper. It could be on the news for murdering 500 people

[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:39.140]
and children. I don't like hearing trans citizens. What? Oh, God.

[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.380]
You look at that stuff and you just, you just shake your head.

[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:53.200]
And then you want to see a covenant again. Please do. I do. What are your stories? I'm curious

[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.400]
about your review. What is it? Tories does. Well, what am I going to find out? It's running

[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.620]
around the cable. It's on all the cable channels. You'll trip over by accident. Not here. That'll be

[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.660]
there. I got 75,000 channels. Well, let's see what's on my movie channels right now. Okay.

[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:16.260]
Before I find any more depressing stuff. Oh, here's Haven. Oh, oh. Some white dude and some

[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:20.680]
a dark dude. Oh, he's got a gun. The white dude. Well, I think he's it out. Oh, the cradle.

[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:29.000]
That looks pretty mysterious cradle. Little fish on the reef. Everything put together.

[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:39.120]
Or here comes the among. Really? Body snatchers. Oh, I guess one movie's been remade and I have no idea why.

[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:47.060]
The Hitcher. Yeah, we talked about that. We did. Yeah, we did. Why do they remake the Hitcher? To make money.

[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:54.880]
Oh, to be the ottoman. What is that? There? You have any idea what that is? No. Oh,

[01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:03.160]
Indigo Autumn. Paradise Falls. Student bodies. That's what I think it is. Oh, wow.

[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:17.040]
What is it? Old comedy. Oh, my god. There was nothing funny about that. Let me tell you. That

[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:24.260]
Teen Wolf Street Fighter 2 killer image. I mean, it's probably not going to be on in the middle of the

[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:29.600]
day. Why not? Water movie for Christ's sake. Oh, well, good. What could be better than the middle

[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.200]
of the day than a good slaughter movie? I agree with you. You know how they are. Yeah, I know how they are.

[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.700]
Oh, we don't want to put in. Of course, all the kids are in school right now, so they can't see

[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:43.860]
it now. So what's wrong with that? Why don't they think like that? Like I do. Like this show. We

[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.660]
can say because all the kids are in school. They won't hear it. It's not like when the kids

[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.660]
used to listen to their headphones and there is Sony Walkmans in school because the show was

[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:54.980]
racing and launching and wanting to hear all that funny stuff on the show. We can't tell you

[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.300]
that anymore. No. So we can say whatever the hell words we want. Just like Charlie Beesers.

[01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:03.600]
Well, you know, grab them by the balls and make them do this and make them bring the farts out.

[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:12.760]
I mean, this man is in such a state of denial. No, not denial. I don't know what state.

[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:19.080]
Well, Florida is bad enough. Totally separate from anything to do with reality.

[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.600]
I'm busy with planning a name. The best out here with neurologist.

[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:27.620]
Forty-two-five fifty-two-a-am. And they. Forty-fourth. Later.

[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.780]
Had your breasts are beautiful. Well, I was shot by an epic storm for some food.

[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:36.280]
Buying groceries never felt so good. Too bad it didn't know that credit was waxed.

[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:40.820]
Store security was breached in the database. That ACR-A-D that spells me.

[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:45.460]
But credit is crap dot com baby. I'm as crude as I can be.

[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.280]
Thought about pulling myself maybe now instead of eating, getting fat.

[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.300]
My identity was stolen and now my life is just crap.

[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.420]
C-R-A-D that spells me. My credit is crap dot com baby.

[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.940]
Now you ought to play that bit at the beginning of your lunch with Joe tomorrow.

[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.180]
You ought to have that on your little thing. You know, I'll take a boom box.

[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.420]
Now take a big little boom box and blast it.

[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.500]
And then say I'm dying out of here.

[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.520]
And see what happens. When Joe stops laughing.

[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:18.760]
More than half the teenage girls taken from a polygamist compound in West Texas

[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:21.620]
have children or our pregnant state officials said yesterday.

[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.060]
Must have been a lot of school and go on that place.

[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:29.900]
You know, a total of 53 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 are in state custody.

[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:33.380]
After three and a half weeks ago at the yearning for Zion Ranch Neldera.

[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.020]
They were yearning for something all right.

[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.880]
They found lying. They're Zion.

[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.660]
Abo's girls 31 either have children or our pregnant said child predictors.

[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.200]
Service spokesman Dero Azar. He didn't specify how many our pregnant.

[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:51.340]
All of his kindergarten to Rick Azar. He used to be the voice of the Buffalo Bill I think

[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.620]
100 years ago. And Borek Azar?

[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:54.600]
No.

[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:55.660]
A-A-U.

[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.200]
It shows you are pretty distinct pattern that it was pretty pervasive, he said.

[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.860]
State officials took custody of all 163 children at the ranch and controlled by

[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.160]
fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints saying a pattern of teen girls forced

[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.800]
into underage spiritual marriages and cessed with much older men,

[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.880]
creating an unsafe environment for the sex children. No crap.

[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.400]
Under Texas law children at the age of 17 generally cannot consent to sex with an adult.

[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:23.140]
A girl can get married with parental pre-mortem permission at 16,

[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.000]
but none of these girls has believed they have legal marriage under state law.

[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.280]
State officials said earlier that they found girls who have pregnant or had children

[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:33.420]
of their own at the ranch, but hadn't provided more than rough estimates till yesterday.

[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.520]
Church officials have denied that each other more abused at the ranch say the state's

[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:43.540]
action to perform a religious persecution. That's right. That's my religion. I want to go out there

[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.900]
and grab a whole bunch of kids off the street and rape them and they have my way with them and then

[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.960]
say hey it's my religion. We'll talk about the Catholic community. What? We'll talk about the Catholic

[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:57.320]
again. Yes. Oh there's a whole McCain insane McCain. Corporate abuse. Oh they got all the crazy

[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:03.740]
people on a bush and McCain and McBush. FLDS spokesman Rod Parker said it doesn't believe the

[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:08.820]
CPS Count is accurate. He said that from talking to ranch residents he believes at least 17

[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:13.360]
of the girls may actually be adults but have been labeled by CPS as minors.

[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.060]
Agency officials have called into question claims of it all home among the girls since the

[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:22.180]
raid and in some cases of the speed documentation provided saying the girls look younger than 18

[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:26.740]
because many FLDS members share similar names of complicated family relationships. I didn't

[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:31.140]
find all the children taking the custody has been a challenge. Many of the girls look younger

[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:35.660]
than 18. Oh there's the phone. I'll be back. Oh really? Yeah. I don't have any music ready?

[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:43.000]
Bucharest? That's all I know. Damn. How long do you think this is going to take?

[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:48.980]
That looked time to redeploy for this play. Going on Friday? Sure. One up. Quest.

[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.620]
Group from Caledadette University going to be doing a play. Howard named Library Auditorium.

[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:58.380]
Raised money for the Alliance for Families of Deaf Children to the Friday. For the people. Seven to eight PM.

[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:03.240]
Okay. Go online. That was important is a good thing because the my

[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.120]
Fax papers downstairs. Oh that is important. And they got a temporary concierge down there who don't

[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.020]
know me from Adam and well well yeah otherwise you can see I got up here. Do you have much

[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:18.400]
those cases of a Fax paper way? I don't know. A buck. A pound. But uh 8,000 pounds. Wow you got

[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.600]
a hand truck. Oh well that's when I go down here get it on the trolley man. Right on. Later on I'll

[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.780]
go down there get the old trolley and mosey back on up here. I have now Fax paper last me for months.

[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.560]
Great. I'm not like over there with the beesleys you know this nickel and dime. Oh we can't afford

[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:40.560]
Fax paper and paper clips and office supplies. And we sure couldn't afford that router that the

[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:47.080]
engineer up there could have put in weeks ago. Now we couldn't do that. No. Well at least they

[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:50.940]
suck me into buying one anyway. Not that I wouldn't have bought the other one. Yeah.

[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.380]
They just don't want to do it right there where they won't listen. You got to tell Jolly

[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:02.500]
Joe that tomorrow. Give him that message from me. They will not listen. Okay I'll be sure to do that.

[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.600]
There is nobody and I mean nobody working in that radio station now who has ever seen this studio.

[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.860]
The only people who put this studio together were Fat Julio who was a great engineer who they

[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:20.980]
can because he was making too much money. They thought Bob Bermuth was also wrong gone thank goodness

[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:27.060]
and the engineer here was a real engineer and a good guy. There's the only people that work on

[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:33.720]
this studio. There's nobody in that place at all who's ever seen this place. We got it. Got it.

[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.900]
I just mentioned enough that I want to invite them here. Remember when Fixi tried to invite

[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:43.700]
himself up here. And that would have been a good thing too if I could get the audio from the

[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:50.960]
computer through the board. That would be great. Yeah. It wouldn't be that big of a project but I'm

[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:55.620]
fix it sticking his nose in here. I don't want him pochkin with his studio. You might want to

[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.900]
mention that it's a very handy tool. I want to mention what? Getting your tickets to the engineer?

[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:06.860]
Yeah. See what it would take. Maybe not. Maybe that was a good guy. Of course I want to get paid for it.

[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.080]
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:19.120]
In fact I'm thinking of it next year is going to be this gigantic budget cutbacks you know

[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.500]
including my salary. I don't think it maybe they should build me a big studio in my house.

[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.940]
Remember when they offered to do that? Yep. Of course that was Greg Reed I believe.

[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:32.580]
Remember how different things were with Greg? Well you know Greg Reed had all that money and he

[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:37.920]
used to spend the his own money. Bubbly I like that. That's what Joel said. I say that's his excuse

[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:43.580]
for everything. Oh it's it was easily read. It's not easily bell. That was his line to normal. I see.

[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.940]
And of course you'll blame the beesleys for everything you know. Oh well I can't do

[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:53.500]
anymore money because Bruce Beasley is a tighter to drum and he won't. I got orders from him.

[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.340]
That's what he's going to say. I see. How much they respect what you do and they appreciate it.

[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.260]
How valued you are on the show and how important you are to kneel and bop bop on.

[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.940]
But then he'll give you a mountain. I'm just thinking that maybe I'm wrong. I'm thinking

[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:12.460]
out loud you know. Even very wrong. I hope we'll see. I hope they say to you hey guess what you're

[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.220]
doing a great job. You're going to be on all and you'll one thing you've got going is that the

[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:23.220]
summer time's coming up. Yeah. It's not that far away. You realize today is the 29th of April

[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:29.840]
and that Thursday is El Umode Mayo. See El Umode Mayo when you know happens around

[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:35.960]
L.D.A.C. say stay hunyo don't you see right. I still work in Tuesday and Thursday all summer long

[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.380]
three months and you're on three days a week. Yep. It's a scary thought but never less than

[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:46.560]
long. No. Be afraid. I'm not afraid. You've done just fine. You've held up your end for the last

[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.740]
how many years we've been news. 2000 was the first year so this will be the eighth year. Wow.

[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.860]
Wow for the summer you know it was during the fillings before that. I know that you know

[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:03.240]
how they call it. I never forget as long as I live to look on your face. Yeah the shock

[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.660]
the more that's because I was crapping myself when you said that. I don't know if you know that

[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:10.840]
because I was getting ready to take my first rotation on this station. We were down on a second

[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.080]
force to it. Labor day it was though. Yeah I said those tapes just absolutely suck. George

[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:20.960]
controlling. Yeah my face went white. Why do they use you? You have a shade of pale. Oh you'd be

[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.780]
happy I got a little bit of a tan now but yeah I I I've joist myself or practically. Why will I

[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:28.220]
be happy that you've got a tan? Is it bothering me that you're pale? No but you roll away. It just

[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:32.400]
means you're healthier if you've got a little bit of a tan. Looks like it. You got some vitamin D in

[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:40.820]
you. Got a out of the sun. You got a little something in you. Sure. Something something. I mean

[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:46.680]
I know what I like to do is my foot. My foot. Welcome. Did anybody ever confagulate with Eric

[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.020]
about why the stats? Oh he mentioned that earlier. He said be probably because

[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:55.660]
Josh Cordis had him take some of the ones off for the stories that he put on twice or by mistake

[01:16:55.660 --> 01:17:02.280]
or something. That was like hours ago. The stats are probably screwed up because Josh asked

[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.760]
me to delete the ones he put up by mistake. That's what Eric wrote in the little box.

[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.580]
Yeah they're screwed up. They're still frozen up what they were yesterday.

[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:17.640]
Nice going Cordis. You're an idiot. Okay. I mean it's not really that thing of a job. You think

[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:23.260]
Eric wants to do it. Ask Eric. Send him a message. Now how would you feel about that? Would you

[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:27.340]
feel that I was like screwing over our Josh Cordis? I was thinking out of it you know because I have

[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.260]
I like that. Guess what Eric? I don't care what Josh Cordis looks like. Okay now if he looked

[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:35.260]
like one one Pablo that would be a different story. Then you could blame me and say oh and he

[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:41.600]
also got a soft heart because the kids are really hot looking guy you know. Josh Cordis is a nice

[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.840]
kid but he's just he's a little like George you know he's just like a person a guy. Thank you

[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.640]
I'll take it. I mean I don't want to get involved because I like them both as you know.

[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:57.440]
Well what about Chris can you be after we do the break? Maybe we'll have a discussion about this

[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.040]
and you can leave the insider like no it's a present you can be the shyer. What do you think?

[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:10.640]
Um and don't be enthrangered you then. Um well think about it. So I think I got a tie between

[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:20.700]
Cordis and Eric. Yeah. Don't give me an answer now. Okay. I love him 41 a QA and the Kentucky Derby

Hills Kitchen 12 campaign staffers face new challenges each week with only one deranged supreme.

[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.360]
Oh this bitch huh? I did Hill. I'd rather vote Republican than revishe.

[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.960]
Hillary Clinton has a short fuse. I need both both both now.

[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.060]
The issues are hot but her temper is hotter. Hills Kitchen.

[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.460]
My dad you call that the campaign closer? I don't know Hill.

[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.400]
I wonder why bail this with this get out of my face.

Let's figure that guess is in first place or 180 return pull.

[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:15.240]
Clinton. What have you done 180 return on? I used to like the Clintons now I hate him 38.

[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:20.240]
Wow used to be religious not no more 36 voted for Bush now hate him 20.

[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.560]
175 vote I'm not going to read the whole thing because we got important minutes to take care of here.

[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:33.500]
Chris is going to be the um arbiter the arbitrator the arbitrator the arbitrator.

[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.860]
Oh fighting morning the book is out oh all the sudden got very sick.

[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.480]
I'm having a relapse so what do you think should we let give the stories now did you send

[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.260]
their message about that or what? No.

[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.300]
Why just got through town you're doing the last segment then we ought to send him a little

[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:55.220]
little little little box there. Send him a message and say to Z we didn't want to do the stories

[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.620]
and would be okay if I sent him a check every three or four months.

[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:02.640]
Well he was listening said I don't really want to do the stories I will if I have to but it's not

[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.280]
what I prefer. I told you that I see George is the one that's stirring us all up.

[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.760]
So I have heard that said when like when the two of them would come and go back and forth about stuff.

[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.700]
Yeah um Eric was like well fine I'll just do the story then you know what I'm saying I made that up.

[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:23.720]
Yes okay no okay I don't know. I'm not saying you made it up but he you know he keeps changing his mind.

[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:28.160]
He's a busy guy he's got a business to run there okay he's not a wife and a family to feed

[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.740]
he's got a business to run that's why he wants money.

[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:36.360]
The amount of money that I would send him for doing those stories isn't going to change his life okay.

[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:45.720]
You think I don't think I cannot think a thousand bucks every three or four months is going to change in adult's life.

[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.840]
So it was yeah no one.

[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.660]
Oh I thought I said you the money okay great.

[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:54.400]
There's a good idea Eric can do the stories I'll send you the month sounds great.

[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.760]
Well Eric's busy I like I said Chris can do the stories I'll send you the money.

[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:11.780]
Okay he's pretty quiet about no no that's just right there with a silly look in his face to get red and I'll pay.

[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.780]
He's always got to look at his face I know I'll puff up like a bullphotote.

[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:22.580]
So we don't have to that's good we don't have to resolve that I guess not because he doesn't really

[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:25.660]
want to do it. Curtis doesn't really want to do it he just wants a good pay.

[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.700]
Right well it's like most of us on our jobs we don't really want to do it we just want to get paid.

[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:31.400]
Right.

[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:31.500]
Right.

[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:35.380]
I could do another two hours today but you know what?

[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.280]
I don't want it.

[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:36.780]
Right.

[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.280]
And I have a choice.

[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.520]
It's called survival is what it's called.

[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:42.920]
Right.

[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:46.460]
The business about people who love their job so much I mean I don't mind it.

[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.400]
It'll be great when we take calls again in fact let's take a call this segment that beats

[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.400]
didn't dig in bitches.

[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.580]
It beats the digging in your nose.

[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.120]
Oh I don't know.

[01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:57.500]
Some of that.

[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.260]
Well last couple weeks though.

[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:02.100]
Sometimes you guys will be paid off both of them.

[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:07.040]
And with the big pay off with Randy Merriman on TV you know they see a way meant coats 3 pm every

[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:07.480]
afternoon.

[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.840]
That's back in the 50s man old TV Jack Bailey queen for a day.

[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:13.980]
Eric says.

[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:14.180]
What?

[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.320]
Eric says what?

[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:20.880]
I said I'd take them over because I'd rather do the stories than have a hassle from it but I

[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.400]
prefer someone else doing it.

[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.240]
Right of course I knew that.

[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:29.180]
And you're the one that's trying to get him involved in doing it.

[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.680]
He doesn't have the time to miss with that.

[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:31.220]
Okay.

[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.560]
It's a time consuming bunch of crap.

[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:33.380]
I made the whole thing up.

[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.340]
And I expected him out when I sent courtes 400 stories and he like looks at that.

[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.960]
Oh geez what do I do now.

[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.940]
Now his end it will go out then.

[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:42.100]
What is it?

[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:43.460]
His internet will go out then.

[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.220]
Yeah that's right his internet will go out again.

[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:49.600]
If I send more than a dozen stories courtes his internet connection goes out.

[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.180]
Oh I got no internet at the house.

[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.460]
I also had no internet here this morning thanks to George.

[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:57.760]
That's my greatest fear.

[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.440]
I don't mind trying to get this fixed and get that fixed.

[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.220]
Well I was not.

[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.800]
I'm reaching under there and there's all these power blocks you know.

[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.940]
Right power strips.

[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.800]
Power strips and I can get electrocuted real easy in there.

[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.060]
Yeah.

[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:10.880]
And very easily.

[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:11.940]
What?

[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.740]
No that was the electrician sound effect.

[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:15.280]
I don't know.

[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:16.280]
I could.

[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.040]
Because these things are like it's not like having a couple of light switches around or something like that.

[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.960]
There's 80 million different power strips and plugs and cramp if you had no idea.

[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.240]
You have no idea.

[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.660]
Do you know what's under this counter here okay?

[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:34.680]
No I don't.

[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.540]
Maybe even a couple of dead bodies for all I know.

[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.240]
Maybe that's what a fat boy will disappear too.

[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:38.720]
I don't know.

[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.800]
At least don't smell bad.

[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.040]
After six and a half years.

[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.860]
I'd be delighted to do it if I thought I was going to be able to do it and get it done.

[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:51.080]
Get it done.

[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.140]
I heard Dan Morino saying get it on.

[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:53.600]
Get it on.

[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.000]
Did you really?

[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.120]
No.

[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:55.480]
No.

[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.240]
There's that idiot Rob the Marciano on CNN.

[01:24:59.080 --> 01:24:59.440]
Jerk.

[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:01.220]
Total jerk.

[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:04.080]
Just give the weather.

[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.640]
Don't be given no editorial opinions okay about global warming or anything else you jackass.

[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.920]
Just give the weather.

[01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:14.600]
The last thing anybody wants is editorial opinions from some jackball meteorologist on TV

[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.660]
who's an expert on all right wing all things right wing.

[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.300]
Probably another self-hating queen.

[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.340]
Maybe I'd introduce him to David Brock and Miss Fudge.

[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.340]
At least David Brock saw the light.

[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:28.620]
Right?

[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.560]
How's Miss Fudge to me?

[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.800]
That's one one side that I never go to anymore.

[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.740]
I never went to it ever.

[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.020]
I used to.

[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.720]
Long time ago and I stopped.

[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.900]
And now my life is so much better without Miss Fudge.

[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.160]
And you know who else I who else's website I don't go to anymore?

[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:45.440]
Speaking of Miss Fudge.

[01:25:45.620 --> 01:25:46.520]
Her girlfriend.

[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:47.340]
Oh, Lynn.

[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.560]
Lynn Samuel's.

[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:49.700]
I know.

[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:52.540]
I said I won't get out of Lynn Samuel's.com.

[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:55.640]
No, but it was something that was like a whole bunch of other people sharing it.

[01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:56.520]
Oh.

[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:57.860]
I don't know.

[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:58.380]
I never went to.

[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:02.180]
Bob Herbert in the New York Times this morning says the pastor cast a shadow.

[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.400]
The Reverend Jeremiah right went to Washington on Monday.

[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.380]
Not to praise Barack Obama, but to bury him.

[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.360]
Smiling, cracking corny jokes, mugging it up for the big time news media.

[01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.000]
This Reverend is never going away.

[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.500]
He's found himself a national platform and he's loving it.

[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:17.860]
It's a toofer.

[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.680]
Feeding this by Senator Obama.

[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.720]
Mr. Beckett's revenge on his former follower while bathing a spotlight

[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.300]
better than any he could have ever imagined.

[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.420]
He's living a narcissist's dream.

[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:28.680]
At the long last, his 15 minutes have arrived.

[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.800]
So there he was like to be an audience of the National Press Club.

[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.060]
About everything from the Black Slave experience to the differences in sensing

[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.060]
from possession of crack and powdered cocaine.

[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.080]
All but swooning over the wonderfulness of himself.

[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.960]
The Reverend acts like he's the first person to come up with the idea that Blacks

[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.820]
too often get the short end of the stick in America.

[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.520]
Nothing, the ligament influences of slavery and the long dark matter racial discrimination

[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.700]
are still being felt today.

[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.420]
Then in many ways, this is a profoundly inequitable society.

[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.660]
This is hardly new ground.

[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.240]
The question that cries out for an answer from Mr. Wright is why,

[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.900]
if he is so passionately committed,

[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.420]
deliberating and empowering Blacks,

[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.600]
does he seem so in-system wrecking the campaign of the only African-American

[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.640]
ever who had a legitimate shot of the presidency?

[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.200]
On Sunday night and in appearance before the Detroit NAACP, Mr. Wright mocked the

[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.460]
regional dialects of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.

[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:17.180]
I'm not sure how he felt he was helpful in his supposed quest to bring about a

[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:20.280]
constructive discussion about race and reconciliation in the U.S.

[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.020]
What he is succeeding in doing is diminishing the stature of Senator Obama,

[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.800]
a candidate who stands handlessly vies as former spiritual guide

[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.760]
Rome is the country dropping one divisive bomb after another is in very little danger being

[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:34.060]
seen by most voters as the next JFKRLBJ.

[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.600]
The thing to keep in mind about Reverend Wright is that he is a smart fellow.

[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.820]
He's been a very savvy operator politically and otherwise for decades.

[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:44.600]
He's built a thriving, politically connected congregation on the south side of Chicago

[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.960]
that sounds some very good work over the years, powerful people to turn to him for guidance and advice.

[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.860]
So if the Kate Sermons and the Roof K. Denon, Mr. Reverend Wright's reputation,

[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:56.900]
Senator Obama had no choice but to distance himself and he did his gently as he felt he could.

[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.180]
My guess is that Mr. Wright felt he'd been thrown under a bus, but an ungrateful

[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:04.440]
comrade who had benefited mightily from his association with the Church and who should

[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.080]
have rallied to his former pastor's defense. What we're witnessing now is Reverend Wright's,

[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.280]
I'll show you, tour. For Senator Obama, the reemergence of Reverend Wright has been

[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.120]
devastating. The Center has been trying desperately to bolster his standing with

[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.280]
skeptical, even hostile, white working class voters. When the storyline of the campaign shifts

[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:23.680]
almost entirely to the race in your face, addicts, of someone like Mr. Wright, Mr. Obama's chances

[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.260]
can only suffer. Beyond that, they've turned helplessness of the Obama campaign in the face of

[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.980]
the right onslaught contributes to the growing perception of the candidate as weak as someone

[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:36.680]
who's unwilling or unable to fight aggressively on his own behalf. Hillary Clinton is taunting Mr.

[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.260]
Obama about his unwillingness to participate in another debate. Reverend Wright is roaming the

[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:44.800]
country with a press corps in tow, so happily promoting the one issue Mr. Obama tried to avoid, race.

[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.600]
Mr. Obama seems more and more like someone buffeted by events rather than in charge of them.

[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.060]
Very little has changed in the super-delegate count, but a number of those delegates have

[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:56.960]
expressed concern in private over Mr. Obama's inability to do better among white class working

[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.060]
voters and Catholics. Reverend Wright is absolutely the wrong medicine for those concerns.

[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:39.540]
The economy is drowning, they got us behind us growing.

[01:29:42.920 --> 01:30:03.220]
I could do some driving butider for which to go to the border,

[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:08.280]
After time of death, the stage was set

[01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:13.220]
For the Leo concept grab all the grisket

[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:17.360]
They trickled it up to the one percent

[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:22.580]
It does fall and left us for death

[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.140]
Could this be a recession?

[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.560]
The deadline's boiling news

[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.440]
There's people going hungry

[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.800]
You won't see that on the news

[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:46.400]
It's like the 1930s

[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.820]
On another quits of bread

[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.040]
We're just the rich of berries

[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.060]
And a fortune by gas

[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:08.380]
The corporate newspapers take it with them

[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:12.940]
The ones that I use for the sheets are my thing

[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:17.620]
You take the dog, take the defendant and the patrol

[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:22.280]
They have dust blind and then we try to dust poll

[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.200]
We're in the heat of crashing

[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.260]
But they don't want you to know

[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.480]
For the world which is country

[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.460]
Just a pressure to blow

[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.300]
Yeah, just a pressure to blow

[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.720]
It blows like choice

[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.660]
Just a pressure to blow

[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:51.120]
It blows, it's cover to at 5.60 WDQA

[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.380]
And happy Tuesday to you

[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.600]
I feel like almost back to normal now

[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.500]
Alright, that's what

[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:56.720]
Don't I?

[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:58.100]
Well, I don't know

[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.000]
I don't know what you look like

[01:31:59.000 --> 01:31:59.340]
How do you know?

[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:01.700]
You don't know what normal is for you

[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:03.520]
Logi, who's thought

[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.540]
That's a fat, tired, old

[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.480]
You know, I feel better than that

[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.420]
Maybe it's the fact that I had all these three winning days

[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.720]
That would buy in a row like that

[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.460]
I don't want people to think that the slots are the way to make some money

[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:15.940]
Okay

[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.680]
Well, I mean, you can get lucky once in a while

[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.520]
Because I'm sure that somebody's old cockers out

[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.840]
Oh, he talks about he wins every day at the slot that the gambling may

[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.940]
Like that, you know

[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:27.980]
No, I do not

[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.440]
Because like I always said, here comes the money

[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:32.760]
Yep

[01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:33.800]
And here goes your money

[01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:38.600]
221 votes on the pool

[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.340]
And guess who's in first place

[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.380]
Look, what do you want to say?

[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.200]
I'm right

[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.340]
You know, we have the Osborne's and we have the...

[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:47.880]
What are the other ones?

[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.860]
Or the Kardashians?

[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:50.640]
Yeah

[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.600]
The cops may like have their own sitcom

[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.080]
What have you done?

[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:58.180]
180 return on in your life

[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.080]
I used to like the Clintons now I hate them 53

[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.200]
They'd gone from nowhere if not even beyond here

[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.460]
To being the leaders and pulling away leaders of the pack

[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.420]
Used to be religious not anymore or 40

[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.740]
Voted for Bush, now I hate them at 22

[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:17.520]
Used to be Republican, now Democrat

[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:20.260]
19

[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.280]
Used to be obsessed with sports watching, now I could cure less

[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:29.900]
16

[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.600]
Used to support the war, now I oppose it 16

[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.880]
Used to hate Neil, now like him 11

[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:40.700]
Used to be liberal, now conservative 8

[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:43.780]
Used to be conservative, now liberal 8

[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:44.840]
A wash

[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.220]
Used to like Neil, now I hate him 8

[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:47.900]
HATE HIM

[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.540]
Used to be gay, now straightened out 8

[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:55.020]
Oh yeah

[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.060]
When did that they got straightened out?

[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.660]
Now they're one of those seminars and everything

[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:02.260]
I know they got straightened out too

[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:04.280]
I've heard those stories

[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.560]
Used to be an atheist but found God 6

[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.820]
Used to be a Democrat, now Republican only 3

[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:10.520]
Thank God

[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:13.260]
Once hated Bush, now like him 2

[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:14.540]
2 crazy people

[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.620]
Used to oppose war, now support it 1

[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.700]
Out of 223

[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.960]
The cledons have moved to the top of the pack

[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.460]
In the used to like, oh I'm not doing bad my soul I got 8

[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:29.380]
By a lizard

[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:31.760]
Really, must have been a big lizard

[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.800]
After a 2006 election in which it helped get the most

[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:38.360]
Biciously anti gay politician serving in the US Senate voodoo from Orphus

[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:40.000]
The Human Rights Campaign

[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.000]
Uh oh

[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:45.280]
Hotels.com, get out of here, go away from my face

[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:51.320]
The Human Rights Campaign is right wing fear based assaults on equal rights for gay's lesbians

[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.480]
They're no longer as relevant as they were even a decade ago

[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:59.360]
The gay rights group by Monday endorsed 14 senators at candidates for Senate and it says we'll continue advancing these years ago

[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:05.400]
In 2006 the HRC and at 700,000 members were involved in 200 House and Senate races

[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:10.200]
Of which it's candidates 194% of the time, so the organization's president Joe Salomonese

[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:16.960]
Hoping to duplicate that success rate HRC announced the National Mobilizing Effort this year for the elections

[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.140]
Headquartered a new website

[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:21.220]
HRC.org slash year to win

[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:26.080]
Anti gay messages do not have the political potency they once had Salomonese said

[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:32.380]
Senators and candidates endorsed by the HRC this year are Max Bockers of Montana Joe Biden and Delaware Susan Collins of Maine

[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:37.620]
Dick Durbin of Illinois Al Franken of Minnesota Tom Harkin of Iowa John Kerry Mary Landel of Louisiana

[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:40.780]
Frank Glottonberg of Jersey Carl Love and Amishik and Mood of Silly Bifokels

[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:46.860]
Jack Rita Hurrahland Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire Mark Udala Colorado and Tommy Udala New Mexico

[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.840]
HRC has not announced its endorsement in House races

[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:58.760]
The HRC effort also includes camp equity sessions in more than a dozen cities that intervide campaign training for at least 1500 activists

[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.180]
Paul Pagalla who is on TV every four minutes along with James Carville and Papu Cannon

[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:09.060]
And what's that what's your name Rachel Maddow from skill America

[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:12.520]
Oh get her off of there already please all these people

[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.620]
And what's her name that the black activist it looks like Aunt Yamama

[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:24.720]
Sorry I'm talking about no don't yes you do don't watch those shows I'm right I don't

[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:28.800]
She's one of the big DNC she's in a deal see super delicate

[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:34.100]
You know I'm talking about no well it'll come to be a second

[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.160]
No Jay no not here

[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:41.920]
Oh Paul Pagalla who served as political advisor and Bill Clinton's White House when the controversial don't ask don't tell policy on

[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:47.600]
Gays the military was crafted said yesterday he believes that policy's done nothing to better the armed forces can be repealed by the next president

[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:55.840]
Pagalla was speaking to reporters on an HRC sponsored conference call he said don't ask don't tell which prevents gay service men and women from serving openly their own forces

[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.760]
Who from the need for political compromise as Clinton was entering the White House in 93

[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:10.480]
He was asked about proposals from this used Democratic presidential candidate Obam and Clinton to repeal the policy that requires gay soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines remain in the closet they want to keep their jobs

[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:17.040]
I think senator Obama's right he said I think with the right leadership he can get rid of that ban I don't think it's helped our armed forces

[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:22.500]
Times have changed in the 15 years he's certainly continuing don't ask don't tell us untenable

[01:37:23.780 --> 01:37:31.520]
When the military is stretched to the sten as it isn't fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq the US can hardly afford to fire aerobic linguists because of their sexual orientation

[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:42.200]
Pagalla statements yesterday contrasted with the arguments he put forward in his 2006 book take it back which argued that Democrats should not make allowing Gays to serve in the military a primary issue

[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:53.520]
Pagalla and Solomon E.C. said right when tactics to divide voters with opposition to issues like don't ask don't tell and gay marriage are becoming less effective as time goes on and his younger voters make up a larger proportion of the electorate

[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:00.620]
Pagalla said self-described conservatives under the age of 30 are more in favor of gay whites than our self-described liberals over the age of 65

[01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:12.580]
How do you like that? I'm going to read that last sentence again dude the Gallus said self-described conservatives under the age of 30 are more in favor of gay whites and our self-described liberals over the age of 65

[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.600]
They get an old coup like the ones who are all vote in Ohio Pennsylvania for swallowing

[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:28.520]
The former Clinton advisor also quitted the gay rights organization with helping Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey to favor extent to him who was one of the most viciously anti-gay politicians in the Senate in the 2006 midterm election

[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.940]
We got a help run Casey's campaign at year times on our side he said the country is moving our direction

[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:37.320]
That's what he'd be saying Paul the Gallup

[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.320]
What the hell is her name? I don't know

[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.200]
Oh come on I don't know

[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:51.740]
She's on every day on CNN every single day I still wouldn't have seen her she sits on air with that compulsive gambling bill Bennett a hole at right wing piece of

[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:55.920]
Third don't watch it what do you mean you don't watch CNN?

[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:05.440]
What do you watch besides sex? That's it or what I'm having it you know I watch funny shows if I can and

[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.360]
When I was starting about when was coming on it was something night on five and whoever heard of somebody named

[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:17.260]
Contessa you know it's not that enough we got so many day and all these other stupid names of these bubblehead brawds on the news pale

[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:21.540]
Contessa I mean the very first contestant right well, obviously they named after that

[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:28.620]
Well, do you know anybody else named Contessa never seen one never met one and then is this this abroad on one of those two

[01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:32.760]
I'm not sure I think it's in Fred Fred Rika and I hope they're all right. Oh,

[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:37.220]
What I said our are I wonder if she's a lesbian I

[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:42.040]
Don't know. I don't care. But her name is Fred Rika and all the other propulsive

[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:50.200]
Yeah, like they're all buddy buddy. Oh, there's that screamer again that Ellie felt it and what happens?

You're gonna be a little more intellectual and cool. So you're all thinking boo by asses

[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:06.780]
That's like that. Uh-huh spaking and and the body parts. That's right bloody parts bloody body parts

[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:10.780]
And when you have your meeting with Johnny Joe Demar tell me know all the right to people of the swing clubs

[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:15.820]
Okay, you know I do you do well no not there

[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.660]
But I can hook him up

[01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:23.680]
Hook him up with what whatever you like you keep saying that every like whatever he's into I'm gonna get out

[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:29.300]
I don't front people one of the things he's into is cutting your salary in half. I know well

[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:31.740]
How are you gonna hook him up with that? Yeah, I'll hook him up to something

[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.060]
From it it's actually known as 560 WQM Georgia Gulf steam this Friday

[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:45.480]
10 to 2 go out there and they're in the hangout with him bring him a bucket bunch of money some drugs

[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:48.520]
Give him some my surprise job

What

[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.280]
Up

[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:28.640]
I saw a kid in my shaving grease, so I left it on my face.

[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:35.640]
When I went to work, I looked like a jerk, and I was fired in the street.

[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:42.760]
Driving home, I was all alone, thinking someone's playing tricks on me.

[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:49.820]
But if the rear-view mirror, I could see Jesus staring back at me.

[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:56.820]
Jesus, I saw Jesus for the greatest thing of all of all.

[01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:03.980]
So I hid on my path up to the stair and I see Jesus in my heart.

[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:11.100]
All my friends think of blood and the written heart.

[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:18.700]
All my friends think of blood and the written heart.

[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:25.200]
All my friends think of blood and the written heart.

[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:32.100]
I saw him on the side of the taco and the look that I caught.

[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:39.420]
I saw him in a bowl of sticky candy and the shine of his mother's car.

[01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:48.040]
Jesus, I saw a kid in his bowl of sticky candy and the written heart.

[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:52.980]
Jesus, I saw Jesus for the greatest thing of all.

[01:42:54.280 --> 01:43:00.540]
I saw him on the top of the stair and the seat of my car.

[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:07.700]
All my friends think of blood and the written heart.

[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:16.800]
I saw Jesus on the side of the taco and the seat of my car.

[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.320]
Jesus Christ, are you here again?

[01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:25.780]
Oh my Jesus Christ.

[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.320]
I saw money on the top of the toast to the toast.

[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:36.020]
Profile or the full regaining of the robes and the sand and the work of the Lord.

[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:37.360]
Yes, that's why I knew where Jesus was.

[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:40.640]
And I looked at him and I said, you're fairy.

[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:43.700]
From 18 to 560 W. DeKuem we got the church show.

[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.480]
A two mad dog is four and then the D8 night and it's not to you.

[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.780]
And we ever find out who's doing the show?

[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:48.600]
John Linder.

[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:50.600]
John Linder, I should know him.

[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:52.520]
Is he King of Paul Linder?

[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:53.980]
No, not yet.

[01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:56.980]
John Linder.

[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:00.260]
How about Paul Peter Lindhase and what was his early name?

[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:06.700]
What? Peter Paul and Mary? Peter Lynn Hayes and Mary Healy. Oh, really?

[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.860]
There's a TV back in the 50s. Wait before your time. How's that life? His name was Hayes and her name was Healy.

[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.620]
I don't understand that whole thing. I don't get it. Lots of professional thing. You know people with fake names like that.

[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.180]
Oh God! A lot of people out there with fake names.

[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.700]
So, a strictor. Oh, I thought we were going to take some calls.

[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:31.560]
Okay. Do it. Do it. How about you, Chris? You want to take a couple of calls? Sure. Why not? I didn't say a whole lot.

[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:37.100]
Now, it's going to take a while because the audience is not used to this since we don't have that router hooked up and I can't get it done.

[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:41.900]
And the engineer will come one of these days. Do they say anything about that? Any update on that? No.

[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:45.460]
No. I told them they said, you know, acknowledged.

[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:51.760]
Yeah, get them to come back out there and hook it up and then we can do a show, you know. Or not.

[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:54.200]
5670560.

[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.300]
Pound 560 and a Verizon singular wireless line.

[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:02.040]
Then quite a few days since we took any calls. I guess before I had that crud, you know, which is mostly grown now.

[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:06.800]
Oh, let's not get that is. That's how much better? Looks better.

[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.400]
And during the next break, I'm going to go out and take two more teaspoons of that crappy taste next week.

[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.160]
Although it's much better tasting than that Bentley's coffee. Oh God.

[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:21.700]
Battery acid would be a compliment. I'll take your word for it.

[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:25.900]
I wonder what battery acid tastes like, but it's got to be better than Bentley's coffee and it's all still out of fix.

[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:28.240]
What? I'll stick with this.

[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.920]
Stickly a stucy-steezy-steezy-steezy-steezy-steezy.

[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.160]
I don't know, man. Bruns a little bit. That's a my college, I'm a phone.

[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:35.260]
2 a.m. Hello.

[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.740]
Hello? Yes, sir.

[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.740]
Hey, I got that name for you. Please. Donut of the beast Brazil.

[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:46.300]
Donut of Brazil, that is correct. That's all I got.

[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.680]
Then now, doesn't she look a little like Aunt Yamama?

[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:50.480]
She's the beastly looking, then.

[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.900]
Yeah, she really is nasty. And she's not very articulate either, but other than that.

[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:58.680]
Donut of Brazil, don't give me no thrill. Okay, have a great day, sir. That was a pretty good call. There you go.

[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:01.160]
There you go. Bow. Donut of the bull, my nose a little bit.

[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.180]
Start making a little bit of a comeback. QAM, hello.

[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:10.200]
Okay. QAM, hello.

[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:14.200]
That was him. That was him. That was him. That was him. That was a good one. Yes, sir.

[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:17.740]
Hello. Hello.

[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:18.940]
Hey, Neil.

[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.740]
Yep. How are you?

[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:21.700]
Dan, good.

[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:25.260]
All right, man. Congratulations on your D.O. I guess.

[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.580]
I guess, yeah.

[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:29.880]
Welcome back to Florida.

[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:34.000]
I'm not sure it's done, but anyway, I got nothing to say.

[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:36.880]
Just what does that mean? I bet.

[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:43.020]
You're pretty good, actually. Yeah, it was.

[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.200]
That's the way I'm. Hello.

[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:48.420]
Hello. Hello. How are you, sir?

[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.760]
I'm good. How are you? Good. Good. I'm a bolder pick with you.

[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.980]
Yeah. My name is a house cat. I'm strong cat's brother.

[01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.620]
Oh, God. Yeah. House cat, storm cat, bull cat.

[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:04.600]
Uh-huh. Yeah. I'll hurry up on it.

[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:06.080]
Oh, why'd you do that?

[01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.020]
Oh, he's been so entertaining. He definitely is not strong of cat's brother.

[01:47:09.340 --> 01:47:12.780]
Whatever. I'll say I look like a racially mixed family or something like that.

[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:13.880]
He's an older, because of messages.

[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:18.300]
You better tell storm cat to lead Joe alone or Joe's show is going to be, you know,

[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.420]
just like the worst team.

[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:23.600]
So we ever find out where he was this morning or is it not supposed to ask that?

[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.860]
No idea. You can ask just that. You know, nobody told us.

[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.180]
Oh, who has no idea? Anybody?

[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.040]
None of us. No. We could go to work on that show.

[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:33.720]
I mean, not what I saw.

[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.300]
What's the guy's name? Um, Zach. Zach. Yeah, this morning.

[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.620]
I was like, so what's up? He goes, I don't know. He just told me yesterday that he's not be here today.

[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.720]
I was like, oh, okay. Don't you want to tell him yesterday?

[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.360]
Yesterday is another. He was planning to be sick or something like that.

[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.940]
I guess I'm going to be there in 90 years.

[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:53.160]
George, I won't be there in next couple of years.

[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:56.040]
Okay. See you. I don't understand.

[01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.620]
I'm not that it's my business. I don't think I could grudge anybody else.

[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:03.380]
And especially with that really nifty summer schedule, my kind of very, very, very soon.

[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.180]
You all got scams.

[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.040]
Various. What? You all got scams.

[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:07.580]
Slacker scams. One or another.

[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.160]
Oh, you high-priced talent types.

[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:11.680]
Mm-hmm.

[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:15.620]
Anyway, we got jerks coming up, but two. So don't worry about anything else.

[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:19.800]
Once we got jerks on here, believe you me, we better not worry about nothing else.

[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:23.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, so you know, I've been taking too many of these.

[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.260]
Just, you know, they're all good.

[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.140]
Just to what I'd be a little bit they are.

[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:27.820]
That would be QA and hello.

[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.620]
Back there, my daily kill them.

[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:32.640]
All right.

[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.620]
Want to try that one?

[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.860]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:41.160]
See, you don't know how to get the most out of these colors, okay?

[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:41.960]
Oh, trust me.

[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:43.940]
There you go.

[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:45.960]
Let's see if I could put real less of that.

[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.420]
Let me do QA and hello.

[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.860]
Hey, yeah, how are you brother?

[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:52.480]
Okay, sir.

[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.820]
Hey, listen, I was listening to you.

[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:56.760]
A couple shows back.

[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:58.780]
You were mentioning you were coming down to Miami for a week.

[01:48:59.300 --> 01:48:59.480]
Yep.

[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.020]
Anyway, to suck up to a KJ picture of and get a picture with you.

[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.200]
Sure, Mark, may 17th at Gelschrein Park 3 to 5.

[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:11.100]
Fantastic. Thank you, brother.

[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:11.680]
Okay.

[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:12.540]
All right, bye.

[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.340]
Cross your $1,000 with a picture though.

[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:16.520]
We'll have a tip chart.

[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:19.220]
Yeah, that's a good idea.

[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:22.140]
Like one of those big giant brandy snifters like the paper players have.

[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.260]
Yeah, I've been started practicing for next year.

[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:25.420]
What I'm going to be doing my spare time after January 1.

[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:26.780]
Spare some change, mister.

[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:27.320]
Yeah, be good.

[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.060]
Is it going, eh?

[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:29.280]
Play the piano.

[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.520]
Be it a lounge wizard?

[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:31.440]
Mm-hmm.

[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.340]
No, I'll try the piano.

[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:33.600]
I'm just with a tin cup.

[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:34.720]
Hello.

[01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:36.520]
This is big.

[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:38.820]
Why are you making fun of me?

[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:39.540]
I love it.

[01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:46.960]
I love it.

[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.060]

[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:49.720]

[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:49.720]

[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:49.720]

I love it.

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.840]

[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:03.940]
I love it.

[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:04.040]

[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.880]
I love it.

[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:18.320]
I love it.

[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:18.940]
I love it.

[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:18.940]

[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:19.180]
I love it.

[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:19.360]
I love it.

[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:19.360]

[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:19.840]
I love it.

[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:20.560]
I love it.

[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:20.860]
I love it.

[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:21.860]
I love it.

[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:22.700]
I love it.

[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:23.840]
I love it.

[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:26.900]
I love it.

[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:27.720]
I love it.

[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:28.900]
I love it.

[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:29.560]
I love it.

[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:30.360]
I love it.

[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:30.900]
I love it.

[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:31.680]
I love it.

[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:32.900]
I love it.

[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:32.960]

[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.740]
I love it.

[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.040]
I love it.

[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:36.720]
I love it.

[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:37.500]
I love it.

[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:38.660]
I love it.

[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:38.740]

[01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:39.360]
I love it.

[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:44.180]
We have a, but somebody said it in the other day and we talked about it and the soup was great

[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:47.400]
and the steak was, uh, uh, not too great.

[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:50.560]
How do you, how do the Clintons do on the pole?

[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:53.040]
First, oh, they're pulling away.

[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.160]
We're in the homestretch and the Clintons, they've got an almost insurmountable lead on our pole.

[01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:00.120]
The biggest name, the best talent.

[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:01.400]
You're 15th in the politics.

[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:02.680]
Fort, maybe a 5.

[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:03.760]
60 qu am.

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.620]
The fourth leader.

[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:06.480]
Pack it on.

[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:12.120]
This is Joe Boyle on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority, Neil God.

[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:18.440]
I said, my campaign on you, but I'm losing my race.

[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:23.400]
Can't explain what has gone wrong.

[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:24.880]
Broken I play.

[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.400]
I thought you were not special.

[01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:32.080]
You little name is the same.

[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:36.660]
I wanna be a president.

[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:50.680]
This is my destiny over all the surprises I put up with all the bills for writing.

[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:52.860]
This can't be right.

[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:59.680]
You can be not unless we're feeling I even wish I could kid.

[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:04.240]
I wanna be a president.

[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.200]
The last time I freaked out, I just kept talking loud.

[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:14.680]
I kept getting a couple when I fixed your up around the mall.

[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:16.500]
Feels like it's the best dream.

[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:18.080]
They all put it on me.

[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:21.280]
My heart is jumping, pedal she's just paying Hillary.

[01:53:22.060 --> 01:53:23.260]
I can't win.

[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:26.220]
No way I will be a bit more president-ly.

[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.060]
A red oh, oh, oh, yy.

[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:32.240]
A president-ly.

[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.200]
Oh, oh, yy.

[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:37.420]
A president-ly.

[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.400]
It's pretty funny.

[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:42.020]
I think more of that flame is coming up.

[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:42.780]
Not that the audience needs it.

[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:44.860]
They just claim her.

[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:45.360]
Why?

[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:48.780]
Because they need every keeping track of the guy that has a long, you know it.

[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:52.560]
Oh, maybe I have a lot come out of my lungs. I don't know. Let me know

[01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:57.360]
Look at that they're pulling away by 22 points. They're clinton on our pole

[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.180]
And how you doing on your total there is the new pole we got a thousand on the first one

[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:07.300]
This is a Charlie B pull by the way 283 that's not too impressive

[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:09.740]
We're going for 400

[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:11.180]
Okay

[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:17.820]
What are your thoughts about that? I think we should get Mr. Pool man. We can definitely do it all year one point four minute

[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:18.420]
We can do that

[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.980]
You really need to get so detailed with all the stats. I mean, I'm bad

[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:29.620]
I'm gonna get all the air I get a little bit up there. So we're gonna use them oh

[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:34.840]
Now you're stuck in the air excess is that video no why not he doesn't pay me

[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:39.620]
See he doesn't want to do the stories. It's a time-consuming thing

[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:46.120]
I'm sure I'm sure that even bugs him that he's got to do this pull thing a little bit. You know, they're probably times he's busy

[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:51.740]
Maybe once and while his wife even takes like a second look at him. I doubt it, but you know it's possible

[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:56.300]
He's got two kids so he must have she must have taken a second about now and I don't know

[01:54:56.300 --> 01:55:01.820]
Okay, you know what happens once the kids pop up so hold it from ballgame. Well, you know that

[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:03.320]
Yep

[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:08.520]
John McCain's white supremacist problem by cliff shactor in the smoking chimp

[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:15.940]
One would have to strain to be shocked that a racist ed is fighting its way out of the balls of conservatism in North Carolina

[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:18.600]
For political observers from the 80s and 90s

[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:24.060]
They'll remember that Senator Jesse Hums was a master of using divisive tactics to inject race and it just about everything

[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:27.760]
He did outside of brushing his teeth whenever he wasn't straining through the holes in the sheet

[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:30.660]
He was wearing to see his deffice and do this embrace in toothbrush

[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:36.800]
He had racism for electoral gain obviously did not go away with Hums retirement from politics

[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:41.960]
And neither is Republican humidity in doing anything to control the extreme elements in the party or their base if he will

[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:48.480]
So once again just as other conservatives said idly buying claim Jesse was just being Jesse now John McCain throws his hands up

[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:52.520]
In the airs if there's nothing he can do when a racist is as is run by the North Carolina GOP

[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:57.560]
And when a racist ad is run by the North Carolina GOP against Barack Obama

[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.180]
The typo here on smoking chimp shim on you

[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.100]
ABC news is Brett Havill and Russell Goldman reports Senator McCain said last Thursday

[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:12.380]
It's elected president and becomes the defect of head of the GOP who would not to made a change in leadership of the North Carolina

[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:18.460]
Republican Party despite condemning his plan to wear ads attacking Senator Obama and his controversial minister

[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:24.880]
It's good to know where the senator stands on this issue issue at least today in my book to real McCain

[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:31.360]
My conservatives don't trust him or my independent students. I recount McCain's questionable past on issues of racist entire career

[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:38.800]
From the many years he rejected a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday pretty much the entire 70s and 80s to a serial flip-flops on the Confederate flag in

[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:45.940]
2000 which he admits he did for political reasons no way not you Johnny who was close association with the white supremacist named Richard Quinn

[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:52.760]
Who found himself hired as a political advisor by McCain in 2000 and still is from what I can tell after openly praising David Duke

[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:59.420]
Selling t-shirts praising the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and writing an editing from magazine that reminded us that slave masters

[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:01.100]
Just really weren't all that bad

[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.560]
That's the real McCain for you now

[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:08.640]
I'll be waiting for the media to do their job and report on his close association with a white supremacist

[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:14.240]
Just as they have every aspect of Barack Obama's life and I'll be most assuredly holding my breath since close shactor

[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:17.380]
Hold it and hell now hold it

[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:23.840]
Yeah, we'll send you telegram. We'll send you a letter in a bottle. I should know when to let it out and your breath too

[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:32.020]
Rudy Giuliani should not have received holy communion during the povus visit because the former presidential candidate supports abortion rights

[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:35.400]
The York Cardinal Edward Egan said yesterday the Cardinal I

[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:40.240]
Wonder if the Cardinal's gonna left over altar boys from Cardinal Spellman at

[01:57:41.300 --> 01:57:42.140]
the rectumry

[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:47.780]
These days to bring him in limos anyway. That was nice. Mm-hmm. I

[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:50.440]
Wonder if Norma can't ever wrote a lot. They let a Jew in her. Do you?

[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:54.960]
I don't know it depends. We're along in limo while they're out. I'll pick it up runaways

[01:57:56.140 --> 01:58:00.540]
Egan says he had an understanding with Giuliani that he's not to receive the Eucharist a Catholic Church

[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:03.640]
He just abortion is a grave offense against the will of God. He can say

[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:08.480]
Donna brazil. I got it. I got him. I remember that name. I keep I have a blood block with her name

[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:11.360]
She just bugs me

[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:15.080]
And she doesn't really say anything

[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.520]
The Cardinal said yesterday that Giuliani broke that understanding when he received the Eucharist during Pope Benedict the

[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.160]
16th visit earlier this month Jesus it seems like the Pope just got here and

[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:28.140]
Now he's gone and you know what they say once he's gone

[01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:31.480]
That's right. He's gone now a hubbun and drear

[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:37.760]
He received communion during the April 19th service Giuliani did for more than many clergymen who offered the sacrament

[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:43.520]
Not directly from the Pope though the Pope didn't seek anything in Giuliani's mouth that we know of

[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:50.500]
Egan says of he's seeking a meeting with Giuliani who insists that he abide by our understanding. Oh, yeah, we have an understanding

[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:53.440]
Remember the bishop. Yeah

[01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:59.520]
Giuliani spokeswoman some day a Sunday Mendel said Monday that he's going to meet with the Cardinal

[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:02.420]
But added that his faith is deeply personal and should remain confidential

[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:11.440]
Confidential by the who did that sunny night on dot records. Wow. Well, if you've got that it'll be one of the great miracles of all time

[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.200]
confidential

[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:17.980]
I bet you're taking that. I can remember that you got it. It's on the dot

[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:24.560]
You know who else was on dot no, put bad boon. Oh Billy Vaughan

[01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:58.940]

[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.600]
And that's the music that they're playing them there

[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:09.320]
Are you a crazy person or what well, yeah, I'm a crazy person, but I'm pretty sure that this is the music in the

[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:09.440]
country

You have got guns guns guns up there on the streets today

I think we need a lot of equity here

[02:05:54.990 --> 02:05:57.550]
If we're going to have college students running around to open guns

[02:05:57.550 --> 02:05:58.990]
Why not high school kids?

[02:05:59.250 --> 02:05:59.690]
Sure, why not

[02:05:59.690 --> 02:06:03.030]
And then makes sense to me how about elementary school kids

[02:06:03.970 --> 02:06:05.170]
Army garden kids

[02:06:05.710 --> 02:06:06.590]

[02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:10.950]
Don't just begin with all the guns then then college punks

You know Jeff Cohen?

[02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:22.410]
No, I don't need other ones

[02:06:22.410 --> 02:06:25.810]
He's the founding director of the Park Center for Independent Media in Ethics or College

[02:06:25.810 --> 02:06:30.130]
And his latest book is Cable News Confidential by Mr. Ventures and the Crobert Media

[02:06:30.130 --> 02:06:30.990]
I read a lot of his stuff

[02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.810]
He's good

[02:06:32.650 --> 02:06:35.070]
Military propaganda pushed me off TV he writes

[02:06:35.590 --> 02:06:41.170]
In the fall of 2002, week after week I argued vigorously against evading a racket debates televised on MSNBC

[02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:44.170]
I used every possible argument that might sway mainstream voters

[02:06:44.170 --> 02:06:46.270]
No real threat, cost, instability

[02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:48.410]
But as the war neared my debates were terminated

[02:06:49.190 --> 02:06:53.270]
In my 2006 book Cable News Confidential I explained why I lost my airtime

[02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:57.370]
There was no room for me at an after MSNBC launch count down a rack

[02:06:57.370 --> 02:07:00.790]
A 81 hour show that seemed working on glamorizing a potential war

[02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:02.590]
Then scrutinizing or debating it

[02:07:02.590 --> 02:07:05.390]
Count down a rack featured retired crunals and generals

[02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:07.950]
Some sometimes resembling boys with war toys

[02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:12.010]
As they used props, maps, and glitzy graphics to spin invasion scenarios

[02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:16.770]
They reminded me of pumped up X football players doing pregame analysis and diagramming plays

[02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:19.830]
It was excruciating to be silenced on an MSNBC

[02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:23.790]
Watching so many non debates in which myth and misinformation were served up unchallenged

[02:07:24.810 --> 02:07:28.030]
It was better not to be silenced much worse to see that these X generals

[02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:32.310]
Many working for military corporations were never in debates, neuracetile question by an anchor

[02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:36.590]
I wasn't allowed on MSNBC unless balanced by at least one truck-ulent bywinger

[02:07:37.570 --> 02:07:40.350]
Except for the brazeness in the scope of the Pentagon spin program

[02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:43.830]
I wasn't shocked by the recent New York Times report exposing how the Pentagon

[02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:47.950]
Junketed and cost-of-retired military brass into being message-forced multipliers

[02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:50.550]
And surrogates for Donald Rumsfeld's lethal propaganda

[02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:55.050]
The biggest villain here is now Rumsfeld or the Pentagon, it's the TV networks

[02:07:55.050 --> 02:07:59.050]
In the land of the First Amendment was their choice to shut down debate and journalism

[02:07:59.610 --> 02:08:04.230]
No government agency forced MSNBC to repeatedly feature the hockey generals on a post

[02:08:04.230 --> 02:08:08.650]
Or fire-filled Donahue or Smirno-Weapons expert, Smirno-Weapons expert, Scavridder

[02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:11.030]
Or Blacklist former Attorney General Ramsey Clark

[02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:16.410]
It was top NBC MSNBC execs not the feds who imposed a quota system on the Donahue staff

[02:08:16.410 --> 02:08:21.310]
Required two pro-war guests that we booked one war advocate affirmative action for Hawks

[02:08:22.150 --> 02:08:26.030]
A malphoric and racial investigation in the Pentagon's direct propaganda operation

[02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:30.850]
Which included an active duty general exhorting ex-military-turned-paid pundits

[02:08:30.850 --> 02:08:33.110]
That the strategic target remains our population

[02:08:34.230 --> 02:08:40.270]
But I'm also for keeping the focus and on us on CNN, FoxNBC, ABC, CBS, Edith NPR

[02:08:40.270 --> 02:08:43.250]
Who are partners in the Pentagon's mission of information dominance

[02:08:43.250 --> 02:08:46.710]
And for us to see that American TV News remains so correct today

[02:08:46.710 --> 02:08:49.270]
That it's hardly mentioned the time story of the Pentagon pundits

[02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:54.430]
Which was based on 8,000 pages in journal Pentagon documents acquired by a successful times lawsuit

[02:08:55.730 --> 02:09:00.010]
It's important to remember that at the same time corporate TV outlets voluntarily abandoned journalist

[02:09:00.010 --> 02:09:05.570]
A gethits in the run up to the Iraq war independent media boomed in audience by making totally different journalistic choices

[02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:10.670]
Programs like democracy now feed you genuine experts on Iraq who want a shock got the facts right

[02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:15.310]
Independent blogs and websites propelled by warscap fuses and began to soar

[02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:19.350]
As for the major TV networks they were not hoodwinked by a Pentagon propaganda scheme

[02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:21.990]
They were willingly complicit and have been for decades

[02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:29.450]
As fairs director began questioning top news executive years ago about their overreliance on nine debate segments featuring former military grass

[02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:37.590]
After the 91 go for CNN and other networks realize that their use of ex-generals had helped the Pentagon dazzle and disinformed the public about the conduct of the war

[02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:45.370]
CNN actually had me debate the issue of ex-military on TV with a retired US Army colonel military analyst aren't used to debates and this one got heated

[02:09:45.870 --> 02:09:55.050]
Me, you would never be recovery the environment by bringing on expert after expert after expert would all retire from environmental organizations after 20 or 30 years and were still loyal to those groups

[02:09:55.590 --> 02:10:02.250]
You would never discuss the workplace or workers by bringing in an expert after expert after expert will be in labor movement and retighting good standing after 30 years

[02:10:02.250 --> 02:10:06.570]
When it comes to war and foreign policy you bring on all retired generals, retired secateurs of state

[02:10:06.570 --> 02:10:13.610]
The colonel irritably, what do you want a tax auditor come in and talk about military strategy? Me, you hit on the nail colonel which you need

[02:10:13.610 --> 02:10:18.090]
Beside the generals and the animals who can talk about how missiles and bombs are dispatched you need other experts

[02:10:18.090 --> 02:10:24.130]
In experts in human rights you need medical experts you need relief experts who know what it's like to talk about bombs falling on people

[02:10:25.170 --> 02:10:30.230]
Before the debate ended I expressed my doubts that corporate media would ever quit the addiction to unreliable military sources

[02:10:30.230 --> 02:10:37.590]
There is this ritual, say from a paper routine, where mainstream journalists after the last war interventions say, boy we got manipulated we were taken

[02:10:37.590 --> 02:10:44.810]
But next time we're going to be more skeptical and then the next time comes it's the same report is interviewing the same experts who buy the same distortions from the Pentagon

[02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:52.090]
A few years later during the brutal US NATO bombing of Serbia any goodman of democracy now interviewed CNN Vice President anchor Frank Sezno

[02:10:52.610 --> 02:10:57.990]
Goodman if you support the practice of putting his military men generals on the payroll to share their opinion during a time of war

[02:10:57.990 --> 02:11:07.190]
Would you also support pulling peace activists on the putting peace activists on the payroll to give different opinion times of war to be sitting there with the military generals talking about why they feel the war is not appropriate?

[02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:13.430]
Sezno we bring the generals in because of their expertise in a particular area we call them aimless we don't bring them in as advocates

[02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:21.070]
It's clear war experts are neutral analysts peace experts are advocates even when the Pentagon helps select and pet them network's military analysts

[02:11:21.070 --> 02:11:27.450]
Shortly after the Iraq invasion CNN's news chief Eason Jordan acknowledged on air that he'd run the names of potential analysts by the Pentagon

[02:11:27.450 --> 02:11:30.130]
We got a big thumbs up on all of them that was important he said

[02:11:30.710 --> 02:11:35.750]
Of all the excegiating moments for me after having been terminated by MSNBC along with Phil Donny and others

[02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:41.570]
The worst was watching retired General Barry McCaffrey NBC's top military analyst repeatedly blustering for war on Iraq

[02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:48.330]
Undisclosed viewers the general was a member along with Lieberman became crystal and pearl of the pro invasion committee for the Liberation of Iraq

[02:11:49.210 --> 02:11:57.270]
A leading figure in the Pentagon's punitive court no one spewed more nonsense than such an authoritative voice than McCaffrey for example on the top notch events planning for securing Iraq

[02:11:57.270 --> 02:12:06.430]
I just got an update briefing from Secretary Rumsfeld and his team and what's the aftermath of the fighting and I was astonished at the complexity and dedication with which they've gone about thinking through this

[02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:12.450]
After the invasion began McCaffrey quote on MSNBC thank God for the Abrams tank in the Bradley fighting vehicle

[02:12:13.610 --> 02:12:26.490]
No federal agency fourth MSNBC and NBC to put McCaffrey on the air on a post no federal agency prevented those numbers from telling viewers that the general set on the boards of civil military contractors including one that made millions for doing God's work on the Abrams in the Bradley

[02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:37.730]
Genuine separation of persons state is one reason that growing numbers of Americans are choosing independent media over corporate media and independent media doesn't run embarrassing promos of the kind NBC was proudly wearing in 2003

[02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:41.510]
Showdown Iraq and only NBC news has the experts

[02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:47.870]
General Norman Schwartzkov allied commander during the Gulf War, General Barry McCaffrey he was the most decorated four star general in the army

[02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:54.890]
General Wayne Downing former special operations commander in White House advisor and bastard Richard Butler and former UN weapons inspector David Kay

[02:12:54.890 --> 02:13:01.810]
Nobody is seen Iraq like they have the experts the best information from America's most watched news organization NBC news

[02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:04.790]
They should only croak and social all the others

[02:13:05.290 --> 02:13:05.770]
Yep

[02:13:07.530 --> 02:13:12.710]
News media in my ass to ask him more on baby they gotta get no news from these bastards

[02:13:12.710 --> 02:13:19.450]
Ray rovers is more like it then there's always your buddy Lou Dobbs screaming about the Mexican

[02:13:19.450 --> 02:13:49.430]
Bapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapapap

[02:13:49.430 --> 02:14:19.410]

[02:14:27.610 --> 02:14:35.810]
I'm not trying to cause a big altercocation but I'll fight to the death of my nomination.

[02:27:57.730 --> 02:28:01.950]
In December 2006 Hanrahann arrived in Cleveland from California by bus

[02:28:02.530 --> 02:28:05.670]
Penaless and the shovel his tango here hanging with shoulders

[02:28:07.430 --> 02:28:14.430]
All he had with a close on his back a bag of tobacco and rolling papers even as false teeth were missing and his Emmy was in Hawk

[02:28:18.910 --> 02:28:19.350]
Yeah

[02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:27.050]
He tried to connect with relatives, but his state of mind and needs were too much saddled and if you said so Hanrahann lived on the streets

[02:28:28.810 --> 02:28:34.150]
Let me ask you something I'm a little bit confused that I did the spot in a wrong break or what yeah you did oh

[02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:38.070]
But we did it though right yeah, I got done so it's all good

[02:28:39.290 --> 02:28:42.890]
Raised in a big Irish Catholic family on the West Side Hanrahann attended a seminar before

[02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:48.130]
Seminary before working as a cartoonist from American greetings in the early 60s while working freelance in New York

[02:28:48.130 --> 02:28:50.450]
He met Phil Han a writer for Hamart cards

[02:28:51.490 --> 02:28:55.430]
Hanrahann and Han would soon become a Hollywood's most successful writing duos and

[02:28:55.430 --> 02:29:00.670]
66 looking to hit the big time the pair of pal that Han's 65 Mustang and Rubey LA arriving on Mayday

[02:29:01.210 --> 02:29:06.030]
Hanrahann and only ten bucks in his pocket within three weeks. They were writing cartoon scripture Hannah Barbera

[02:29:06.610 --> 02:29:11.690]
Soon they were writing for Get Smart and November 67. They're working on a new upcoming show called Lackin

[02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:16.150]
The duos stood up after writing for the Andy Williams showing the early 70s. I can understand that

[02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:23.090]
One of the reasons Hanrahann didn't take your business was due to his addictions to booze and drugs for years

[02:29:23.090 --> 02:29:28.970]
He lived in Tinseltown's fast lanes partying a heart with the stars and Malibu mansions and running with the drug crowd George

[02:29:28.970 --> 02:29:36.770]
Mm-hmm. The lifestyle eventually took its toll Hanrahann and Wilty Eureka California became an eccentric bum a strange from his first wife Rosemary

[02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:39.130]

[02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:45.070]
After Kendrick Cleveland and the dead of winter he lived on the streets and in shelters for about three months looking for handouts

[02:29:45.070 --> 02:29:48.950]
And going to the lady mass. He called it the magic show at the Saint John Cathedral downtown

[02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:56.030]
The bags he packed before coming to Cleveland were founded in California Airport. He couldn't come up a destination remember why he ended up on a bus

[02:29:57.970 --> 02:30:05.650]
In March 2007 Hanrahann called a reporter at the plane dealer saying if you want a rich-in-storage story pal. I've got a good one for you

[02:30:05.650 --> 02:30:11.930]
How do you like that rich-in-storage baby? Oh well, that's what's gonna happen to me next year

[02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:17.590]
Oh, I'm already wearing a rag. Maybe I'd come for that appearance like in a blue-wifes sack. There you go

[02:30:18.750 --> 02:30:22.790]
All right, just wear a cardboard box around your eyes. That would be good. Loins

[02:30:25.310 --> 02:30:31.630]
350 nine on Chris's pull 38 minutes for 41 votes. Oh, that's within the grass now. Told them

Yes, well-stied. I don't know somebody else you never heard of where to make stored

[02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:46.550]
Who's US surge in general from 1985 to 1989?

[02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:52.430]
The federal anti-smoking crusade called for warning labels on cigarette advertising and using the interaction of Medicare to

[02:30:52.430 --> 02:30:54.050]
De-State. We get hospitals throughout the country

[02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:58.850]
9 April 22 of kidney failure at Oxford Medical Center in New Orleans. He was 86

[02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:05.290]
86 that's sold enough I reckon I can be 21 more years

[02:31:06.430 --> 02:31:10.270]

Still was a career public health. Well, I'm never gonna be able to retire

[02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:15.830]
Apparently not

[02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:18.470]
It'll be all harboring work until you croak

[02:31:21.050 --> 02:31:21.770]
He's dead

[02:31:22.870 --> 02:31:27.150]
Is we missed it career public health service officer became a surgeon general your actors predecessor

[02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:33.270]
Luther Terry released a landmark report that doing explicitly between smoking and lung cancer method diseases like

Infosima and stuff like that

[02:31:38.610 --> 02:31:43.870]
Slure it was a pediatrician and epidemiologist and more than speak out against smoking like newsurgeon generals before

[02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:50.630]
Orstance it became a medical activist he called for an end of racial discrimination in health care and advocated expanded medical services for the poor in a

[02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:57.170]
67-speed she criticized the type of the world of medicine and glass curtain which often did not help care of those who needed it the most

[02:31:57.830 --> 02:32:00.750]
I'm on side of the curtains to glean the antiseptic world of medical excellence

[02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:07.050]
It's wonders are totally visible to those outside but admission is by ticket only and the line of the box office stretches out of sight

[02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:11.170]
After Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare Medicaid in law in 1965

[02:32:11.170 --> 02:32:14.850]
Stewart used the programs to compel Southern hospitals to desegregate

[02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:20.230]
At first some hospitals adapted roosters to give the appearance that they were offering integrated services

[02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:26.050]
But by time Medicare funding to the Civil Rights Act of 64 which prohibited racial discrimination in any federally assisted program

[02:32:26.050 --> 02:32:30.390]
Stewart threatened to withhold money until the hospital's ban discrimination and emissions and treatment

[02:32:32.390 --> 02:32:33.170]
These days

[02:37:40.450 --> 02:37:41.710]
That can't tell you much

[02:37:41.710 --> 02:37:44.030]
We've been getting the latest information about research

[02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:46.170]
By writing to an age

[02:37:46.170 --> 02:37:47.130]

For the next time we do that favorite

[02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:34.690]
The TV theme song

[02:38:34.690 --> 02:38:35.890]
We haven't done that in a long time

[02:38:35.890 --> 02:38:36.770]
It's about one or five minutes

[02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:38.170]
Right?

[02:38:38.430 --> 02:38:39.950]
We haven't done that in a long time

[02:38:39.950 --> 02:38:40.750]
Months and months

[02:38:40.750 --> 02:38:42.490]
Have we ever done that since you've been on a show Chris?

[02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.390]
Yes

[02:38:43.390 --> 02:38:44.810]
The TV theme we have?

[02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:45.250]
Yeah

[02:38:46.010 --> 02:38:46.350]
When?

[02:38:47.370 --> 02:38:48.410]
Oh, last year at some point

[02:38:48.850 --> 02:38:49.510]
Last year

[02:38:49.510 --> 02:38:50.990]
Well, who cares about last year?

[02:38:51.090 --> 02:38:51.850]
This is this year

[02:38:51.850 --> 02:38:52.670]
Oh, I always remember

[02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:53.830]
And this is now, you know?

[02:38:56.250 --> 02:38:57.930]
And of course the fact that Raymond Burr was

[02:38:57.930 --> 02:38:58.150]
Yeah

[02:38:58.150 --> 02:39:00.030]
Well, it's just more than some people

[02:39:00.030 --> 02:39:00.790]
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh!

[02:39:00.930 --> 02:39:01.990]
Missional names could handle

[02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:03.510]
I don't wanna mention personalities now

[02:39:04.110 --> 02:39:04.510]
Right?

[02:39:04.690 --> 02:39:05.550]
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh!

[02:39:05.610 --> 02:39:05.690]

[02:39:05.730 --> 02:39:07.150]
Or anyway

[02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:09.670]
You never saw that show?

[02:39:12.070 --> 02:39:12.470]
Chris?

[02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:15.650]
He's a Raymond Burr

[02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:18.550]
No, not Raymond Burr, you never saw Perry Mason?

[02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:21.390]

I'm sure you ever saw Iron-Size

[02:39:24.970 --> 02:39:26.190]
Likewise, briefly passing

[02:39:26.190 --> 02:39:30.070]
I never paid any attention to it. You know, I saw the open. That's the only thing I can say that I remember from it

[02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:32.290]
You open them what? Are in size? Yeah, the show open

Open it safe with the thing

[02:39:37.570 --> 02:39:39.190]
The watch is to San Samuel's

[02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:40.410]
Angel Barnaby Jones

[02:39:40.410 --> 02:39:43.350]
Goods this man pop shows the type of shows y'all y'all y'all

[02:39:43.350 --> 02:39:48.090]
Well, that's where you hit them off. You're all the same if you saw one you saw them all and they all saw not true at all

[02:39:48.090 --> 02:39:52.410]
Oh, in other words, Barnaby Jones and Cannon were the same whatever they caught their man

[02:39:52.410 --> 02:39:58.950]
Somebody did something in the cotton and Cannon was a fat old show would start somebody would do some crime

[02:39:58.950 --> 02:40:00.930]
I would catch them. Yeah, and

[02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:13.150]
374 you 26 votes and 25 minutes we can do it the challenge is there lay down the godly baby lay down the challenge to your audience

[02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:17.830]
I wish we had our audience back you and me George. I don't

[02:40:17.830 --> 02:40:21.210]
I miss those days. Yeah

[02:40:22.610 --> 02:40:24.070]
Back oh used to be on a radio

[02:40:27.090 --> 02:40:29.710]
You might mention at tomorrow, well jolly Joe

[02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:32.350]
Okay

[02:40:33.550 --> 02:40:36.450]
If they want to take that aboard a kiss crap, you know

[02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:40.970]
Uh-huh put a real station on FM wouldn't that be something?

[02:40:42.010 --> 02:40:42.250]
Wow

[02:40:42.250 --> 02:40:44.190]
What keep dreaming?

[02:40:45.010 --> 02:40:49.090]
I'm not dreaming. I'm just thinking out loud. That's all a

[02:40:49.090 --> 02:40:52.730]
New analysis, but I just took a two teaspoons of that what you call it

[02:40:53.930 --> 02:40:56.010]
Surry call cough syrup or whatever

[02:40:56.010 --> 02:41:00.370]
Expect our concert with some what you call it expect the way expectorant. That's right

[02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:07.490]
So now I'm sitting here expecting the expectorant expecting a bunch of big gobs, you know, well, we want details

[02:41:08.290 --> 02:41:12.830]
But there's nothing happening yet. Oh, what it does, you know, oh, not so much better

[02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:18.210]
Remember yesterday. Mm-hmm yesterday was thick man like pea soup

[02:41:18.210 --> 02:41:23.750]
That's what I want like Linda Blair man. I want to be blowing a big dark green chunks like Linda Blair

[02:41:25.490 --> 02:41:27.490]
Covering all the walls with it

[02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:34.070]
A new analysis by University of Georgia. I associate professor very Hollander finds it between

[02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:39.610]
1998 and 2006 Americans became increasingly polarized in their news gathering habits

[02:41:40.890 --> 02:41:44.870]
After 70 five national puest center for the people in the press during that time

[02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:49.390]
Honder concluded that the public now lives in a huge echo chamber of attitudes and ideas

[02:41:50.350 --> 02:41:54.430]
The Atlanta General Constitution's political insider reports in 1998

[02:41:55.270 --> 02:42:01.930]
27% of Republicans and 25% Democrats tuned in regularly to a light-of-base CNN eight years later the number of Democrats

[02:42:01.930 --> 02:42:03.130]
It risen to 29%

[02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:08.270]
But the number of Republicans into an inch shrunk 19% or do you think they went?

[02:42:09.350 --> 02:42:14.690]
Over the same period Fox News share Republican viewers jumped from 14 to 36%

[02:42:16.090 --> 02:42:21.290]
How under also on set conservative dramatically dropped new sources that they've perceived has been biased against their position

[02:42:21.290 --> 02:42:25.370]
Evidently this included C-SPAN which also side dramatic dropping conservative viewers

[02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:30.710]
These findings are similar to a Norman Lewis Center's I've been a national poll from November of 2007

[02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:38.650]
Which found that 22% of conservatives say they never enjoy entertainment that reflects values other than their own as just to a post 7% liberals

[02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:46.690]
Fox News was also the most politically divisive TV channel with 70% of conservatives and just 3% of liberals watching it daily

[02:42:48.110 --> 02:42:51.830]
But too much Fox News may be bad news for conservatives in April 2007

[02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:58.210]
She research study found that the viewers of the conservative Fox News channel had the lowest knowledge of national and international affairs

[02:42:58.210 --> 02:43:00.470]
I can't imagine why can you know G

[02:43:00.470 --> 02:43:03.650]
But I've actually they know plenty plenty of proper gander. Yeah

[02:43:04.210 --> 02:43:10.190]
Top and points and the lowest knowledge of what's going on in the world that's because they watch Fox News Fox fake news

[02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.990]
Hmm

[02:43:12.690 --> 02:43:15.330]
What have you done a hundred need to return around in your life

[02:43:17.310 --> 02:43:20.390]
280 votes. So you got 22 minutes for 20 votes. They're swore

[02:43:20.390 --> 02:43:24.450]
I'm quite now on the camping trail. She's talking now about high gas prices

[02:43:24.450 --> 02:43:28.530]
Of course all of us the economy issue number one. Let's just have like women martesily

[02:43:28.530 --> 02:43:31.110]
On top of global competition

[02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:34.330]
All you're facing some pretty challenging times

[02:43:34.810 --> 02:43:42.410]
It's harder for companies to hire new employees into a Ford healthcare cost and it's he sure is dynamic in she man

[02:43:42.410 --> 02:43:45.030]
She sure does it for me. He's sitting on fire. Oh, yeah

[02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:48.910]
I want to get up in the middle of the room and start spinning around like a human cradle like a top

[02:43:50.190 --> 02:43:54.250]
What have you done a hundred to be turned on? I used to like the Clint's now. I hate them 103

[02:43:55.470 --> 02:43:57.810]
Used to be religious not anymore 56

[02:43:57.810 --> 02:44:01.150]
Boy, I tell you they pulled away the Clintons. You can't touch him with a stick

[02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:03.270]
A lot of people would like to

[02:44:04.710 --> 02:44:07.750]
Used to be obsessed with sports watching now couldn't care less 43

[02:44:08.310 --> 02:44:13.010]
Used to voted for Bush now. I hate him 38. Used to be Republican now Democrat 28

[02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:18.810]

Used to hate Neil now like him 12. Used to be gay now straight now 11

[02:44:27.810 --> 02:44:28.530]
Straightened it out

Used to be Democrat now Republican 10 used to like me and now hate him

[02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:34.610]

Used to be the atheist but found God seven once hated Bush now like him seven. Oh, now that's just gotta be a joke

[02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:49.170]
Isn't it? I'm sure it is you know, there's always the joyers. Just to piss me off

[02:44:49.170 --> 02:44:54.850]
Used to oppose war now supported too out of 383 only 17 away. Can you smell it?

[02:44:55.610 --> 02:44:57.330]
I think it might be the best

[02:44:58.970 --> 02:45:00.330]
408 fight

[02:45:02.250 --> 02:45:03.450]
Wonderful

[02:45:06.410 --> 02:45:08.210]
w pepper

[02:45:08.210 --> 02:45:08.210]

[02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:11.870]
PDF

[02:45:24.890 --> 02:45:26.310]
At the airport

[02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:31.290]
Checking the wires on all of the planes

[02:45:31.290 --> 02:45:33.890]
My temper's about to slow

[02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:37.890]
But safety's first since the FAA

[02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:42.230]
Thanks guys, I sure am glad you care

[02:45:42.890 --> 02:45:46.230]
I really like this flight

[02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:50.350]
Today, but I don't wanna fall out of the air

[02:45:50.890 --> 02:45:54.190]
Oh, grounded jet liner

[02:45:54.890 --> 02:45:57.990]
That's the cancel 5 to 6

[02:45:57.990 --> 02:46:01.250]
Oh, grounded jet liner

[02:46:01.890 --> 02:46:05.610]
Cause I won't be taking off today

[02:46:05.610 --> 02:46:09.990]
Oh, grounded jet liner

[02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:13.730]
Not going very far

[02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:17.850]
Oh, grounded jet liner

[02:46:17.850 --> 02:46:21.510]
Let's get drunk at the airport's bar

[02:46:23.290 --> 02:46:26.910]
What a bargain man, oil's down $150.47 of barrel

[02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:28.790]
Let's go out and collect some money in the bar

[02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:31.750]
All right, or a hundred barrel

[02:46:32.290 --> 02:46:36.470]
I'll just jump into it and then when we do that appearance I'll come all covered in oil

[02:46:36.470 --> 02:46:37.370]
That's right

[02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:41.290]
With the 97 on the pool, during this segment, we're going over 400

[02:46:41.290 --> 02:46:43.270]
And Chris is gonna get up and dance naked on the counter

[02:46:43.270 --> 02:46:45.970]
No, George is gonna barf Pukas guts out?

[02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:47.650]
No, no what?

[02:46:47.930 --> 02:46:48.610]
Not gonna dance

[02:46:48.610 --> 02:46:50.590]
Good, thank God

[02:46:50.590 --> 02:46:52.830]
You know, you're gonna give up and give yourself like a high five?

[02:46:53.170 --> 02:46:53.810]
No, that's okay

[02:46:53.810 --> 02:46:54.890]
How about a low five?

[02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:55.470]
Maybe

[02:46:58.710 --> 02:47:04.050]
I'm pretty impressed I gotta be honest with that thought 400 was way beyond our capacity today on a Tuesday

[02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:05.510]
Well, they came through

[02:47:06.090 --> 02:47:07.590]
I mean, Tuesday is kind of like a...

[02:47:08.410 --> 02:47:09.870]
You know, it's either a fish and a foul

[02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:12.210]
It's like, trief

[02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:15.370]
George will tell you about trief

[02:47:15.370 --> 02:47:17.570]
And you get excited about that meeting tomorrow or what?

[02:47:18.950 --> 02:47:20.730]
I don't know if excited was right there

[02:47:20.730 --> 02:47:22.230]
For you, I would tomorrow morning be serious

[02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:24.670]
For you, I would be good before you go to that lunch with Joe

[02:47:25.410 --> 02:47:26.450]
I do that every morning

[02:47:26.450 --> 02:47:29.650]
No, well, more so than usual, if I could take a high colonic

[02:47:29.650 --> 02:47:29.910]
Yeah

[02:47:30.530 --> 02:47:31.430]
How about a low one?

[02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:33.430]
398

[02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:35.490]
400 will be really great

[02:47:36.030 --> 02:47:36.650]
Don't wait

[02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:40.910]
And George will be out of costume this Friday again from 10 to 2

[02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:43.350]
Now, you got some regular suit come like every time you go or

[02:47:43.350 --> 02:47:45.150]
Are there different people that come by?

[02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:47.310]
Yeah, no, they're both, both of those things

[02:47:49.350 --> 02:47:50.310]
Regular's regular's and irregular's

[02:47:52.510 --> 02:47:53.230]
Mmm-hmm

[02:47:53.230 --> 02:47:57.890]
Sure, be eyes of a whole bunch of new and fact what they can do is they can come out and congratulate you on your new deal

[02:47:58.390 --> 02:47:58.750]
Right

[02:48:00.530 --> 02:48:02.810]
Or say sorry with you on your lack of a new deal

[02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:03.190]
That's right

[02:48:05.550 --> 02:48:07.130]
Maybe in Northern 399

[02:48:07.130 --> 02:48:08.290]
Maybe normal will come by

[02:48:08.290 --> 02:48:09.050]
Uh-huh, sure

[02:48:09.550 --> 02:48:09.910]
Yeah

[02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:11.570]
Right, that's what I have to you all

[02:48:11.570 --> 02:48:12.050]
Uh-huh

[02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:12.870]
That's right

[02:48:14.770 --> 02:48:16.690]
You don't want normal is the assistance?

[02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:18.210]
Uh-huh, it's all the same

[02:48:23.010 --> 02:48:23.810]
He hates you

[02:48:23.810 --> 02:48:24.410]
That's fine

[02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:25.710]
No, I don't think so

[02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:26.430]
Oh, it wasn't bad

[02:48:26.430 --> 02:48:28.610]
When I said he hates you, he just don't want to be bothered with you

[02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:29.410]
It's a roller, that's the thing

[02:48:29.410 --> 02:48:30.570]
It's a roller, that's the thing

[02:48:30.570 --> 02:48:31.490]
That's exactly

[02:48:32.250 --> 02:48:34.750]
The small potatoes, you know, what are you going to give him?

[02:48:35.130 --> 02:48:35.730]
What are you going to give me?

[02:48:35.810 --> 02:48:36.950]
I maybe got him some good weed

[02:48:37.370 --> 02:48:40.050]
Let's see, if you would just use your mind a little bit if you had one left

[02:48:40.050 --> 02:48:42.530]
Listen, what he can do for me is negligible

[02:48:43.170 --> 02:48:44.390]
Maybe we can find you some good weed

[02:48:44.390 --> 02:48:46.210]
What he has done for me has been negligible

[02:48:46.210 --> 02:48:46.830]
Yeah

[02:48:46.830 --> 02:48:48.590]
So, no, thanks but no thanks

[02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:50.090]
I was only doing what you told me

[02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:51.150]
You said he said thanks but no thanks

[02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:52.330]
Right, well, there you go

[02:48:52.330 --> 02:48:53.870]
So I guess it's mutual now, huh?

[02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:54.350]
Sure

[02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:57.410]
I don't need him, he doesn't need me

[02:48:57.410 --> 02:48:58.610]
I'll be damned

[02:48:59.890 --> 02:49:03.990]
Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and the government of President George W. Bush

[02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:07.730]
were to blame for the West Financial Crisis, no Belowary to Economist Joseph Stiglitz

[02:49:07.730 --> 02:49:09.250]
has said the magazine interview

[02:49:10.270 --> 02:49:13.170]
This man, Greenspan, has unfortunately made a lot of mistakes

[02:49:13.170 --> 02:49:15.150]
that form a World Bank Chief Economist Stiglitz

[02:49:15.630 --> 02:49:17.830]
According to a preview of the interview to be published in

[02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:20.530]
Something magazine

[02:49:20.530 --> 02:49:23.030]
Oh, don't tell me this is chopped off of the other ad too

[02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:25.010]
Oh, my God

[02:49:25.650 --> 02:49:26.510]
That's how we get you

[02:49:27.050 --> 02:49:28.290]
Now, I think this is okay

[02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:34.850]
He was, he was for his first romance to support all the tax cuts which were introduced under Bush

[02:49:34.850 --> 02:49:36.710]
They didn't stimulate the economy very much

[02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:39.350]
This task was then transferred more toward monetary policy

[02:49:39.350 --> 02:49:43.730]
but then Greenspan created a flood of credits for low interest rates Stiglitz is quoted as saying

[02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:47.250]
Earlier in April Greenspan said that if he would see NBC

[02:49:47.710 --> 02:49:49.550]
that the U.S. economy had the gambling channel

[02:49:49.550 --> 02:49:51.290]
the U.S. economy was in recession

[02:49:51.290 --> 02:49:56.550]
and defended its chairmanship of the U.S. Central Bank against charges that this policy missteps had laid the groundwork for the crisis

[02:49:57.490 --> 02:50:01.750]
He said the decision during his charge had been rationally constructed based on evidence at the time

[02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:03.890]
Stiglitz had Bush's government was also to blame

[02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:09.050]
I reproached them that the economy was not as resilient as it could have been to the ongoing tax cuts

[02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:11.810]
and the huge cost incurred by the Warner Racken was quoted as saying

[02:50:12.350 --> 02:50:15.310]
He said it was a method Europe could decouple itself from the U.S.A

[02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:21.090]
Especially the weak dollar will continue to hit the European economy hard because it will make it much harder to export

[02:50:21.090 --> 02:50:21.930]
He'd be saying

[02:50:21.930 --> 02:50:23.610]
How do you like that, Alan Greenspan?

[02:50:23.930 --> 02:50:25.790]
And George W. W. W.

[02:50:25.870 --> 02:50:27.170]
Oh, there's the phone. I better go get it

[02:50:27.570 --> 02:50:28.830]
Okay, go ahead

[02:50:29.270 --> 02:50:30.870]
I promote this play going on in the Friday

[02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:35.250]
For the death and the hearing put on by Gallaudet University

[02:50:36.190 --> 02:50:40.250]

[02:50:40.250 --> 02:50:42.690]

Bring your children, bring your children whether they can hear or not

[02:50:48.550 --> 02:50:49.550]
You have an address on that?

[02:50:50.810 --> 02:50:53.650]

[02:50:57.370 --> 02:50:59.130]
Land performed by Quest Arts for everyone

[02:50:59.130 --> 02:51:01.710]
They're going to be speaking it, they're going to be signing it, it's going to be cool

[02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:02.850]
Cool, I'll be there

[02:51:02.850 --> 02:51:04.150]
Oh my God!

[02:51:04.470 --> 02:51:04.930]
What happened?

[02:51:05.270 --> 02:51:06.210]
It's my face paper

[02:51:06.210 --> 02:51:07.190]
Oh, again?

[02:51:07.630 --> 02:51:08.710]
Yeah, for the second time

[02:51:08.710 --> 02:51:12.170]
I don't know what the other thing was the, maybe the other thing was the Bokapackage

[02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.830]
Might be

[02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:15.250]
Yeah, I would think so

[02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:19.570]
Because this concierge we got down here now is not the regular guy and this guy is very confused

[02:51:19.570 --> 02:51:20.270]
Very confused

[02:51:20.270 --> 02:51:24.950]
And the guy that I just spoke to was some very illiterate guy from, oh there's a shocker

[02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:25.670]
And the, yeah

[02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:28.590]
And this way the delivery place with my fax paper

[02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:30.270]
And extremely illiterate

[02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:32.810]
And I said, leave it down there to Frambezko, okay?

[02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:35.370]
Oh, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

[02:51:36.170 --> 02:51:37.910]
For all three, I just go on there Chris

[02:51:38.310 --> 02:51:39.070]
I know what I want

[02:51:39.610 --> 02:51:40.690]
I know you could do it

[02:51:40.690 --> 02:51:41.290]
Thank you

[02:51:41.770 --> 02:51:42.730]
Thank you, thank you

[02:51:42.730 --> 02:51:44.510]
Nobody else cares but that's where it goes

[02:51:44.510 --> 02:51:47.110]
It's a little murky, it's mostly it's partly sunny

[02:51:47.790 --> 02:51:50.450]
It's going to be 50 degrees today, it's not too bad, not too good

[02:51:51.470 --> 02:51:53.670]
When you consider the first of me it's only two days away

[02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:56.630]
But that's alright, it's not snowing, it's not blowing

[02:51:57.690 --> 02:51:58.850]
Only my nose is blowing

[02:52:00.030 --> 02:52:01.050]
Yeah, what do you blow it?

[02:52:02.910 --> 02:52:03.250]
Chucks?

[02:52:03.730 --> 02:52:04.630]
No, I wish

[02:52:05.650 --> 02:52:09.790]
I really do, I wish I get all that thick crap, you know out of my system because you know that's the stuff

[02:52:10.210 --> 02:52:11.750]
See, it's still in there a little bit

[02:52:13.010 --> 02:52:16.950]
Much better, for all six, look at that, I wouldn't be surprised to go for 600

[02:52:19.530 --> 02:52:20.210]
What are you saying?

[02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:22.150]
No

[02:52:23.050 --> 02:52:24.430]
How about 800?

[02:52:25.210 --> 02:52:25.850]
Tomorrow sir

[02:52:26.610 --> 02:52:27.970]
No, it's a mountain right now

[02:52:27.970 --> 02:52:28.450]
No

[02:52:30.190 --> 02:52:31.550]
Take it alcohol, go on to your head

[02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:34.210]
Oh, is there a boost net expectorant?

[02:52:35.210 --> 02:52:35.350]
I would

[02:52:35.350 --> 02:52:37.850]
I'd be, the formula 44 as it, that's what I like it

[02:52:37.850 --> 02:52:41.450]
I don't have formula 40, alright, 20 net before, I know this is your knockoff

[02:52:41.990 --> 02:52:42.630]
Yeah, Rexall

[02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:43.870]
Yeah, there might be alcohol in there

[02:52:43.870 --> 02:52:45.590]
Which is probably made by, you know

[02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:47.870]
You want me to get the bottle and look and see if there's any boost in it?

[02:52:47.870 --> 02:52:48.370]
That's alright

[02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:52.250]
It'll kill about 20 seconds, really

[02:52:53.570 --> 02:52:54.310]
Alright, go ahead

[02:52:55.370 --> 02:53:00.090]
I would have been something if I would have gone down there and thought that that package was there from, oh my god

[02:53:00.090 --> 02:53:00.870]
From what?

[02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:07.150]
It's just true, I got the FedEx package from ChickenEck and I got my case of facts paper man

[02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:08.890]
Right, it's the way important day in my life

[02:53:08.890 --> 02:53:10.030]
The way you would have been disappointed

[02:53:10.410 --> 02:53:14.690]
That's what I tell you, however a lot about my life when it's an important day when the facts paper shows up

[02:53:15.210 --> 02:53:21.210]
That should give you a real good idea, although I am getting in with my Okabi with my lesbianies cab driver and going to Woodbuy

[02:53:21.210 --> 02:53:21.790]
Getting in where?

[02:53:22.690 --> 02:53:23.830]
The cab, oh, okay

[02:53:24.670 --> 02:53:26.530]
At 215, let it sound like something else

[02:53:27.890 --> 02:53:28.730]
Getting in what?

[02:53:29.010 --> 02:53:29.290]
Chubblet?

[02:53:29.450 --> 02:53:31.450]
Yeah, okay, something like that, yeah

[02:53:31.450 --> 02:53:36.010]
I'm on a roll, man, in spite of what Chris there, Mr. Negatory says, I'm on a roll

[02:53:37.010 --> 02:53:41.650]
Saturday, Sunday, and yesterday, I want more than he makes in a year, probably, 50 bucks

[02:53:42.470 --> 02:53:43.190]
Close, yes

[02:53:44.330 --> 02:53:49.950]
Now I don't know how I'm going to sleep all the night and I have to worry about George's big meeting him out with Jolly Joe

[02:53:51.230 --> 02:53:55.070]
To take a dream, you want to take a close along for it with you for a moral support?

[02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:57.190]
Get me a bit of it

[02:53:57.190 --> 02:54:01.150]
I'm not a sport leader, I'm a 50 QAM

[02:54:01.150 --> 02:54:02.890]
I'm a sports leader

[02:54:04.770 --> 02:54:07.370]
It's day high, if I have a town

[02:54:07.370 --> 02:54:12.190]
Oh, at 56, oh, WQA

[02:54:16.910 --> 02:54:21.510]
Thank God, they turned the AC in my building on on Friday, there is a gun, thank you

[02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:24.650]
Hold John Paul is gone, I just read

[02:54:25.310 --> 02:54:29.990]
He'd been hanging on by a thread when they found him

[02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:37.870]
Instead, they, all the Catholics said they all said, bye Paul

[02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:41.410]
They said, bye Paul

[02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:48.430]
They said, why did you have to go and die Paul?

[02:54:48.730 --> 02:54:55.690]
You know who was really up, now he's still the cop that you hear his last dance

[02:54:56.690 --> 02:55:02.490]
Now it's time to have, now it's time to have

[02:55:02.490 --> 02:55:10.030]
Now it's time to have, now it's time to have, no less, at last

[02:55:17.730 --> 02:55:24.130]
Later of the church was his role, but old age had taken his toll

[02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:33.850]
Heaven is now his soul's gold, put that hole in a hole as we say, bye Paul

[02:55:33.850 --> 02:55:43.130]
We'll say, bye Paul, I say, I feel so bad I'm gonna cry

[02:55:43.850 --> 02:55:51.930]
Paul, when you reach the pearly gates, bears Saint Peter waits, here's your final in wars

[02:55:52.930 --> 02:56:05.450]
Paul, I'll pontiff now, he's still the cop, I'm dying of a illog

[02:56:09.850 --> 02:56:16.030]
In nominee, Patriot, he'll be expected to die, I don't feel so good

[02:56:17.350 --> 02:56:18.890]
Bye bye bye

[02:56:18.890 --> 02:56:23.190]
