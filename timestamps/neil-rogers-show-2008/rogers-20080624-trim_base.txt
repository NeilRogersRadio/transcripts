[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.980]
And Kobe forget about Kobe.

[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.540]
I got a bad call I can't talk I'll see you.

[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.340]
About Kobe?

[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.820]
About called 5-6-1-WQAM process.

[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.460]
The Neil Roger Hennel I got to to Neil.

[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.980]
Dial 5-6-7-5 is never seen.

[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.800]
Date and a Brown.

[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.260]
In unaccounties.

[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.680]
There was a guy why would he be 7-7-8-5 Neil would call him Poundless.

[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.220]
5-6-10 on your AT&T-1 and Verizon all the things he does.

[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.020]
And this is a crack by Neil.

[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.420]
His guest, Neil and he were the size of the number.

[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.920]
Every cent those have double-gulls.

[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.880]
He can manage vintage staff for sponsors.

[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.880]
And the Neil Roger Hennel.

[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.300]
On 5-6-10-WQAM.

[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.700]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.320]
I miss his suboring.

[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.280]
Looks better than a live radio show every morning on TV.

[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.580]
Well, just about anything.

[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.080]
But that hasn't stopped him as NBC from teaming up

[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.580]
with radio's original bad boy.

[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.020]
Who now looks like a nasty old lady.

[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.000]
Listen Bernie, I'm a sell-out intern as coffee socks.

[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.760]
Yes, every morning, see I miss, listen to a tape of other people's county-bits.

[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.000]
Why, Bob the air?

[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.620]
I need a hammer to bite into this muffin.

[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.080]
Somebody have asked for a fresh one, please.

[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.640]
His wild behind the scenes addicts.

[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.740]
I also need a different thing.

[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.800]
I am the Iman-Urall-Wolver's Kukoukachu.

[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.560]
Now get me some fresh coffee or your fire.

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.160]
I miss.

[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.140]
He's irreverent.

[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.420]
So, I'll let's adil the party.

[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.400]
He's topical.

[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.100]
I'll let's adil his water game, please.

[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.520]
He's incoherent.

[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.620]
I'll tell you what, that's a double-represident.

[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.640]
What does it matter?

[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.760]
He's.

[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.120]
I miss Andy's daughter.

[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.940]
And he's only on MSNBC, a cable channel nobody watches,

[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.440]
and a bunch of AM radio stations.

[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.420]
Nobody listens to him.

[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.800]
Somebody get some fresh jiggle.

[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.720]
It's Iris.

[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.180]
Oh, he's got more in-sourced, man.

[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.080]
They just won't leave that poor old Kukouk alone.

[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.120]
Look at this, explosion near the French president at the airport.

[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.680]
They got sourced over there, too, now.

[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.280]
And I run a bomba grande.

[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.200]
Yeah, I do have a bad, oh no, it's on the way out.

[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.180]
Remember Thursday I said I had a scratchy throat,

[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.700]
and I was like in the beginning of something.

[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.140]
And while this goes to show you, I had that nice four-day weekend.

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.400]
One of few bucks of woodbind, but nevertheless.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.380]
All right, nevertheless.

[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.680]
Now, I know I was not there for the, oh,

[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.700]
let me tell you something, it really crossed my ass.

[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.300]
And maybe you can explain it since you're the genius.

[00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.440]
All right, I'll pretend.

[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.780]
Well, now listen, they had the queen's plate

[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300]
is like the Kentucky Derby in horse racing in Canada and Toronto.

[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.960]
OK, so you know, it's a once-a-year big race,

[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.320]
and they had $1 million per person.

[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.120]
They had it someday.

[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.220]
So for the last three or four weeks,

[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.860]
the security people of woodbind have been on strike.

[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.540]
So intermittently, what they do to piss off the public

[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.820]
so that the public will complain and it'll hurt business

[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.120]
and try to get their way is they block the entrance.

[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.560]
There's about four or five of them.

[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.400]
And they, you know, were you driving?

[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.780]
And they block it off.

[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.560]
And then they stall around, cars get backed up, and you wait.

[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.160]
There's half a dozen cars, 10 cars.

[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.280]
A dozen ahead of you.

[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.800]
Well, Sunday, I go early, OK, and as I was leaving,

[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.300]
and it was only 10, 15 in the morning,

[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.600]
the races don't even start you like 12, 30 or something.

[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.020]
So they brought in all these union workers

[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.020]
that came into support their cause.

[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.180]
OK.

[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.120]
They had the traffic backed up for like,

[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.920]
I don't know how many kilometers is about,

[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.140]
let me like 100 cars.

[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.020]
Now, isn't it, correct me if I'm wrong,

[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.760]
and there's cops there sitting around, you know,

[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.080]
seems to me, and I could be very wrong,

[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.780]
that it's against a lot of block traffic.

[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.100]
I mean, who the hell are these people?

[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.660]
For example, one day last week, in the middle of the week,

[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.780]
I think last Wednesday, I went in the middle of the afternoon,

[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.300]
and they had the usual crap blocking off.

[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.220]
And there's four or five cars in front of me.

[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.420]
And they'll let three or four people go.

[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.060]
And of course, these people are so damn stupid

[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.640]
that a couple of people go and instead of being right on their ass

[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.360]
and just hauling ass and getting through, they just stop.

[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.300]
You know what I mean?

[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.000]
OK.

[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.940]
So you become increasingly frustrated.

[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.320]
So three or four cars go.

[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.400]
And now I'm the first one.

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.660]
And this bitch puts her hand out like for me.

[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.720]
And I just kept going, of course.

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.780]
I'm not going to stop, honey.

[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.820]
What right is she got to be standing in the middle of a public road

[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.500]
stopping traffic?

[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.860]
And this is the protester.

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.540]
Right.

[00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.720]
OK.

[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.660]
The security people, right?

[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.540]
Now, maybe you can explain that to me how

[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.580]
they have the legal right to do.

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.520]
If you're pissed off about something,

[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.360]
if you have a grievance, can you just walk out

[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.640]
in the middle of the street and stop traffic?

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.260]
Is that legal?

[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.920]
I don't know how to lie as in Canada,

[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.400]
but it's not legal here.

[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.900]
And it shouldn't be anywhere.

[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.100]
Right.

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.360]
And they can haul you off.

[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.600]
It's like the same with J.

[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.800]
What?

[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.600]
Why the hell don't they?

[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.300]
Yeah, you just can't go out and stand in the middle of the street

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.200]
or anything like that and block people.

[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.920]
That's what they do.

[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.400]
And they got their big picket signs.

[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.620]
And they walk back and forth in front of their first car.

[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.620]
And they walk and challenge you like to run them over.

[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.100]
Well, if I'm first in line one of these days,

[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.480]
I think we're just going to run a bitch over.

[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.200]
Do it.

[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.260]
So, and you know, see you then.

[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.760]
Because yesterday's exchange between Irons and Spur.

[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.340]
Oh, sure.

[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.360]
They are not watching the story out of this.

[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.300]
This is not even a story.

[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.200]
And Jones.

[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.060]
Here it is.

[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.800]
Recently signed by the Cowboys.

[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.780]
It's the guy's owner.

[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.320]
And it all 2007, following the shooting

[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.560]
in a Vegas nightclub, well, stuff happens.

[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.140]
We're at a nightclub for God's sake.

[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.160]
What if it's going to happen?

[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.600]
At a nightclub, people are directly to drone drones.

[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.960]
Yeah.

[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.800]
They're women there and then the people have guns.

[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.900]
So they're a drone.

[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.040]
Well, he's also, he's been arrested six times

[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.760]
since being drafted by Tennessee in 2005.

[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.840]
And what a color is he?

[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.820]
He's African American.

[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.800]
Oh, long time ago.

[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.020]
No, no.

[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.200]
And the point he explained at this morning

[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.680]
is if he should have had to explain it,

[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.420]
point I must say, and believe me, for me to defend him,

[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.120]
I'm the last person in the world to defend him.

[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.260]
He's like a dead man in a chair.

[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.480]
And he's even better now than he was on MSNBC.

[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.960]
But the succession they got with him with this racial thing

[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.300]
and what he would, the point he was trying to make

[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.200]
is that in America, if you're black,

[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.240]
you're going to a good chance, you're going to get busted

[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.520]
over and over and over again.

[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.520]
And maybe even shot.

[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.660]
That was the point he was making.

[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.220]
And so CNN is like obsessed with this story this morning

[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.900]
and they got Al Sharpton with his big stupid mouth

[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.500]
on there again.

[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.160]
And Dick Regri and all these other agupols,

[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.020]
you know, making it into a big racial thing.

[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.240]
Why can't they just leave this poor old bastard alone?

[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.780]
I don't care.

[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.520]
You don't care what.

[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.440]
They could fry him in oil, hubbubble-bubble-mall of them.

[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.260]
And ignoring his family members of the program

[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.000]
or black, Carol Foster and Tony Powell.

[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.340]
What, how insane am I?

[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.620]
What, what, what, what, what I'd be thinking?

[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.280]
What, what I mean?

[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.660]
Well, why would I sit here and say, oh, yeah, there you go.

[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.920]
I mean, how does anybody, how does anybody kill?

[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.980]
How do you get, make that connection?

[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.220]
And there was a Charles Kissing's ass again.

[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.140]
What his ass must be, red is a beat, you know?

[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.200]
He's probably going to ask Kissing's sitting around.

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.760]
I think that we don't have that on this show.

[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.080]
Right.

[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.540]
Yeah, people, it doesn't matter what I'm stupid

[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.140]
and I'm old and I'm, you know, which is all true.

[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.500]
Bald.

[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.520]
Bald.

[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.660]
Right.

[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.160]
Lazy, shifless, fat, disgusting, diabetic, grotesque.

[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.900]
Right.

[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.900]
Oh, no.

[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.620]
That's not how they're going to.

[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.820]
That's right.

[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.180]
And I got this nasty cold with this heavy-duty flim.

[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.120]
Oh, my God.

[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.180]
Like I said, if there was a God, there'd be no flim.

[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.900]
So George Colin died and he got Larry King, a panel last night.

[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.660]
And that's the end of that.

[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.920]
And about 40 seconds at the end of MSL,

[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.220]
at the end of NBC News last night.

[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.080]
Well, he didn't have no friends in the media like tonight.

[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.460]
David L. Lee, one of them, he was,

[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.600]
it's because he was an anti-establishment

[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.200]
as opposed to being part of the establishment.

[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.540]
Right.

[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.580]
Therefore, he's not going to give 1% of what Tim Russ did.

[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.460]
All right.

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.300]
Now, as somebody we know might say,

[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.220]
who did mold for American culture for entertainment

[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.260]
for the media?

[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.760]
Hopefully.

[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.720]
Who did more in the media?

[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.640]
Tim Russard or George Carlin?

[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:31.940]
Yeah.

[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.440]
And George Carlin didn't have those little dry raceboards

[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.240]
during the elections.

[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.180]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.920]
He didn't have that.

[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:37.400]

[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.360]
Oh, my God.

[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.680]
Just same old crap again.

[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.540]
You know, he'll get about two minutes worth of uology.

[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.800]
And Sunday night, MSNBC ran the Russard Memorial again.

[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.260]
I watched about four seconds of it.

[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.380]
As soon as I saw what they had on, I immediately

[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.520]
I dove for the remote.

[00:07:59.440 --> 00:07:59.920]
Yeah.

[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.360]
I dived for it.

[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.840]
I squeezed it.

[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.900]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.460]
Now, what was that?

[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.060]
Did you see that?

[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:09.560]
Yeah.

[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.240]
Q-A-M, hello.

[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.060]
Neil?

[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:12.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.560]
Yeah, I'm sound a two-good buddy.

[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.480]
Now, no.

[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.600]
I'm a little under the weather.

[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.100]
Yeah, I see you, bad.

[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.280]
You need to let George take over for you.

[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.320]
Yeah, quarter shot.

[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.300]
Oh, um-hmm.

[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.460]
Quarter shot hole, huh?

[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.800]
You're going to get on it, Neil.

[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.960]
Yeah, you better get off it.

[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.540]
Oh, he's sitting right there waiting for you to get back.

[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.900]
In the end of the edition, we're hovering over there.

[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.400]
We got the dime-slot guy now.

[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.980]
You're an old-year-old news, man.

[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.280]
On Thursday, we had a new car, the dime-slot guy.

[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.400]
I want to go there.

[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.460]
A half-pence-slot guy to come.

[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.060]
I'm waiting for the 50 cents.

[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.700]
Slot guy.

[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.460]
That's what I'm waiting for.

[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.020]
50 cents.

[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.820]
Don't make me play that.

[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:47.820]
What?

[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.540]
50 cents.

[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.920]
Don't play no 50 cents.

[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.440]
Oh.

[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.720]
Or that's what you're going to be making out of the street corner.

[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.440]
Already, yeah.

[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.540]
Don't be giving me that.

[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.620]
I had a phone call from Jolly Jobele on Thursday.

[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.640]
Yeah, I heard that.

[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.800]
No matter how many times I tell him, don't call me.

[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.740]
He keeps calling me.

[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.780]
And I said, don't play it.

[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.820]
And I can understand if he had something new or interesting or informative or anything

[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.640]
to talk about.

[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.580]
But it was the same thing that we had emails about that, about George and about, you know,

[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.140]
do I have any problem if you do some recorded spots?

[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.940]
I said, whatever I'll make George more money, I'm all for it.

[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.420]
That's what I said in the email.

[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.700]
And that's what I said in the phone.

[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.720]
I said, have a nice weekend.

[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:30.300]
Joe, goodbye.

[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.040]
He won't stop bugging me that.

[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:33.940]
Third.

[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.080]
And of course, he starts out the call by trying with his pathetic, sit down, attempt at humor.

[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.960]
He says, oh, I don't know if you've got bad news.

[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.440]
Got up there.

[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.360]
He had to Toronto, Neil.

[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.420]
But a terrible thing happened.

[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.320]
Everybody's talking about Tim Russell died.

[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.620]
Oh, the full.

[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.260]
I'm sorry with my bad head cold.

[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.280]
I can't do the really good.

[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.820]
Oh, like I usually do.

[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.280]
WDQYM.

[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:56.500]
Hello.

[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.260]
Second blood sugar.

[00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:58.920]
Check it off.

[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.240]
WDQYM.

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:00.460]
Hello.

[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.120]
QYM.

[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.400]
Hello.

[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:03.740]
Hello.

[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.560]
Hello.

[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.980]
Yeah, with Neil Lee.

[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:07.820]
Speaking.

[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.840]
Good morning, sir.

[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.320]
How are you?

[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:10.880]
Okay.

[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.460]
How are you?

[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.360]
Good.

[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.240]
I hope you feel better.

[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.020]
And, uh, mm-hmm.

[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.300]
Get away from my problem, will be ill.

[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.620]
WDQYM.

[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:22.900]
Hello.

[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:23.940]
Yeah.

[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.620]
What, uh, what happened here?

[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.940]
What, how loud?

[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.900]
I had a cell.

[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.780]
Because of my pain.

[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.080]
I don't know how radiation pours in.

[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:31.720]
No, I had a cell.

[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:32.600]
Cell too.

[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.380]
Who would want the heck?

[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.220]
Homeless.

[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:35.800]
Oh.

[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:36.960]
Homeless.

[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.260]
Homeless, homeless, homeless, yeah.

[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:39.640]
Yeah.

[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:40.560]
Yeah.

[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:41.400]
Ah.

[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.260]
I heard her.

[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:43.960]
What?

[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.020]
This is already better than I thought it was going to be.

[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.480]
This is great.

[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.700]
What's wrong with that?

[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:49.320]
Oh, this comedy.

[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.080]
This is awesome.

[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.140]
It ain't no, I think it's russier.

[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.940]
But what is?

[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.080]
Here's George's poll from yesterday.

[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.220]
How high would gas prices have to go to make you change your driving habits or the vehicle

[00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.760]
you drive?

[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.240]
I've already made changes 418.

[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.580]
Thank you again, Mr. President, by the way, for those low gas prices you've mastered.

[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:06.960]
418.

[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.180]
And the, uh, Prince Abdullah says, uh, well, but if you put a boot, they're going to

[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:12.560]
worry him.

[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.520]
Pump out another, another ounce.

[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.580]
It doesn't matter.

[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.100]
It won't change.

[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.000]
I won't change the thing.

[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:18.900]
123.

[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.720]
No matter how much they charge, they're just going to keep by, you know, they think 7 bucks

[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.760]
or more 52, 5 bucks, 41, 6 bucks, 34.

[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.900]
And nobody know the single hope for that's because it was none.

[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.020]
It might have been cute to put that on there, but sorry, because then you could have played

[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:39.400]
that.

[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.500]
Mm-hmm.

[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.960]
517 votes on a poll today.

[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.720]
Chris is positive or can make 600.

[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.400]
Yep.

[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.900]
You know, if you would ask me last night if I was going to be on today, I would have

[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.360]
told you there was no chance because when you get all the, yeah, I'm sure you've had

[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.380]
it where you get the heavy flame and they're like, um, lodges in your throat.

[00:11:59.560 --> 00:11:59.800]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.040]
And your throat is as raw as it's been cut, you know, like your nuts after the very bad

[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.880]
sector, me like that.

[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.860]
They're only worse than you can feel it.

[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.400]
Really?

[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.860]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.240]
Yep.

[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.480]
Nasty heavy flame.

[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:11.980]
Yep.

[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.620]
There is no God.

[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.460]
Most of the world's serious problems are caused by, we have 517 votes, religious fanaticism

[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.060]
318.

[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.320]
Money 65.

[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.460]
That's right.

[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.520]
Don't get a lot of money because it causes nothing but trouble.

[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.400]
That's what Joe said about Georgia.

[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.260]
He said we don't want to get a lot of money because it'll create a lot of problems.

[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.360]
Politics takes 48.

[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.020]
Overpopulation 47.

[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.060]
The Pope don't like that.

[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.940]
That it's on the poll.

[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.480]
Just keep making babies.

[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.480]
Greed 29 and stupid sports shows 10.

[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.560]
Oh, there are so many.

[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.480]
Isn't that a little, is there a redundancy in there?

[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.560]
That's great.

[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.700]
I came in 8.15 this morning.

[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.560]
I was in here early.

[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.580]
I don't know why because I want to see if I could talk.

[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.860]
And you always do in the, um, shack and Kobe and Kobe and then it wrapped thing in.

[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.220]
And then at the end of the day when you, well, potted up again, there at the end.

[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.460]
Yeah, there was a Kobe and a wrap and shack and, uh, got it.

[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:10.600]
God.

[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.080]
How's the tiger doing?

[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.300]
He's still out of commission.

[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.380]
Yeah.

[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.280]
And who won at the, uh, at the Wimbledon?

[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.320]
The latent hewitt, Lena thing against that freaky looking kid?

[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.280]
I don't know.

[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.220]
Well, why not?

[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.380]
I was watching a little about that.

[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.060]
Not that I care about tennis, but latent hewitt is late.

[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.720]
What is his name?

[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.760]
Foster Hewitt.

[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.060]
From Australia, latent hewitt, man.

[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.160]
He sure is a pretty guy.

[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.440]
Wasn't he, uh, he was, uh, dating or screwing or something with some British broad.

[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:38.040]
Boda.

[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.400]
What, why not?

[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.560]
You don't even know who that is, do you?

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:40.780]
Nope.

[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.520]
You would block it.

[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:41.780]
Nope.

[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.520]
Man, he is a pretty, pretty young man.

[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.680]
Who is not so young anymore?

[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:45.960]
What?

[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.420]
Who?

[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.540]
And I did see Breach with, uh, Ryan Filipi, which you recommended.

[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.360]
It's a true story.

[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:51.800]
Right?

[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.420]
It's pretty good.

[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.920]
I'll recommend it.

[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.300]
It's not, it's not scintillating.

[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.500]
It's not, uh, spout time.

[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:56.860]
Ripeting.

[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.380]
No, but it's, because it's a true story.

[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.960]
How much true story is pretty about embellishing.

[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.220]
10, 14, a.k.a.

[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.460]
And week after week, more and more people are taking advantage of meals, half price deals

The store opens around noon at wqam.com on Thursday.

But act fast, because once they're gone, they're just gone.

[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.320]
The deals have price deals only available at wqam.com.

[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:07.740]
The first time ever gas prices have reached a national average of $4 of gallon.

[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.960]
What President Bush plans to do about the skyrocketing price of gas?

[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:17.520]
Gasoline prices are high, energy prices are high, I am high.

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.060]
I love to smoke pot every day.

[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.260]
And best of all, people of Ukraine will return home to attack law Bush.

[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:36.100]
Wow, 1018 at 560 WQA and we got the jerk show at 2 this afternoon.

[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.260]
How's he doing?

[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.140]
Is he still on the air?

[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.300]
Yep, as far as I know.

[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.220]
Is he still?

[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.160]
Come back, y'all.

[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.820]
See all the time.

[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.520]
Mad dog 4 to 650, because 650 we have that 10 minute Marlin crap.

[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.140]
I heard Joe Rose saying this morning, guaranteeing that after this coming road trip, the Marlins

[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.700]
will be back in first place in the division.

[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.800]
You believe that Chris?

[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.240]
Road trip or home?

[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:55.880]
Series.

[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:56.840]
Oh, is there a home stand?

[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.240]
You know, home for I think 9 or something.

[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.040]
Whatever it is.

[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.300]
He said there'll be in first place.

[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:06.580]
Yeah.

[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.440]
I'm waiting for Chris's response.

[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]
I don't know.

[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.260]
I mean, Billy's not.

[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:11.740]
Why not?

[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.320]
He said, yeah.

[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.180]
Why not?

[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.140]
What do you mean you don't know?

[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.080]
Joe, the little dog said it.

[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.420]
Well, I guess it's true.

[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.580]
You don't have any confidence in him, no fiduci?

[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.520]
Sure I do.

[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.600]
First page with Jesse Aguer, 6.50 to 7.00 a.m.

[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.020]
10 minutes of spots.

[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.240]
The offense tonight, 7.00 a.m. and then we got Curtis for D.A. 8 to 11, because D.A. is

[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.400]
on for Orlando and a morning who's on vacation, I guess.

[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.980]
The big O, who is really.

[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.860]
Brock solid.

[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.780]
And then we got ESPN radio overnight to make sure that nobody's listening in the morning.

[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.300]
That all the radios in town are turned off.

[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.240]
Now see, you said that yesterday the phone was dead as a door nail.

[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.920]
Well, that's not exactly what I said.

[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.160]
I said it was like pulling teeth.

[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.840]
And look at the tremendous response I had there in the first problem.

[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.220]
I mean, there's nothing under now.

[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.720]
And I'm taking it really easy today.

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.940]
I'm taking it nice and slow.

[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:58.400]
Yeah.

[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.980]
Well, I'm just not even mailing it into them.

[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.600]
Like what would be I'm rolling it in.

[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.140]
I'm like putting it in the bottle.

[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.160]
I'm putting in a bottle and putting it in the material and just, you know, pushing it

[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.000]
down because I'm just I don't know.

[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.000]
I'm coming out of this nasty cold or flu or whatever was.

[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:23.940]
I guess it's the flu when you feel chills and like, you know, not really, not really

[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:28.340]
chills, but like several times during the day I go and take a hot shower because I feel

[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.300]
not not warm enough.

[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:29.960]
You know, I'm right.

[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:30.400]
Right.

[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.420]
That could just be old age too.

[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.380]
You know, that's why they all come down here.

[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.080]
And they're always wearing them cardigans because they're always cold.

[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.120]
But oh, oh.

[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.920]
See, there he goes again.

[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.860]
And I just put another good word in for you with Joe Bell.

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.200]
I'm going to send an email and say I don't want no damn recorded spots on this show.

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.220]
All right.

[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.760]
We're all making it one of our salespeople is going over to a power.

[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.180]
I'm going to open it.

[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.080]
I'm going to go to the EM.

[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:00.380]
Hello.

[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.200]
Good morning, my lord.

[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.240]
Yes, sir.

[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.300]
How you doing today?

[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.240]
I'm okay.

[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440]
I'll get over this.

[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.140]
Take a little film.

[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.280]
I'll take your area.

[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.200]
And then get a smoothie.

[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.840]
I don't make you feel better.

[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:13.380]
Yeah.

[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.320]
Now, it was it.

[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.400]
That was his material.

[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.340]
See, that started.

[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.360]
You started that and now that they're all because they have nothing original.

[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.920]
I mean, there was nothing wrong with that.

[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.720]
But it's just a monkey.

[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.360]
See monkey.

[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.060]
Monkey here.

[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.560]
Monkey dude.

[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.620]
Just keep repeating this thing.

[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.100]
Same crap that somebody else said.

[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.760]
Over and over and over again.

[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.940]
First, it's tragic.

[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:42.240]
I'd almost rather hear from the nickel schlackai, a ton of clones.

[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.320]
Yeah.

[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.160]
And that's a good one.

[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.040]
Send loads of bad taste.

[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.280]
At least copy something good.

[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, 5, 6, 10, you've raised in singular wireless line.

[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.080]
I got stuff here like Obama's got to lead and stop throat of new poll shows.

[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.240]
I'll get to it eventually.

[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.760]
But I don't, with this kind of a voice and this kind of cold,

[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.480]
I'm sure he's not going to sit here and puke my guts out reading for four hours today.

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.260]
So the ball is in the audience's court.

[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.920]
Heavy duty.

[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.320]
The ball's in the court just like that.

[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.360]
I don't want to hear about him anymore.

[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.620]
Maybe it's just me.

[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.020]
Am I the only one who thinks Chris?

[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.120]
No, I think a lot of people don't want to hear about him.

[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.280]
I don't care about him.

[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.400]
I never did in the first place.

[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.880]
You know, he's got a big head and he's got that icy sleeve and all that other.

[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.060]
He's just the boring.

[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.560]
That'll envy anything is boring.

[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.500]
Is it over now?

[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.840]
Yeah, the Celtics won't do it.

[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:30.860]

[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.260]
Correct.

[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.780]
I don't care.

[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.080]
I don't pay any attention to it.

[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.780]
I don't, yeah, I could, but I don't want to.

[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.740]
I'd rather watch Layton.

[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.440]
He would play tennis.

[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:38.880]
And he did win.

[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.040]
He did win.

[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.580]
Yeah, he was, he was a winner, but he was like, you check that out for me, huh?

[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.200]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.040]
Well, good.

[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.400]
That means he's going to be playing some more.

[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.640]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:49.860]
Hello.

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.300]
Neil.

[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.640]
I'll be down like the mother.

[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.160]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.380]
Hello.

[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:55.940]
Roger.

[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.320]
Oh.

[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.200]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:00.420]
Hello.

[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:01.860]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.220]
How are you?

[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:02.740]
Okay.

[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.360]
Uh, two things.

[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.660]
First thing I think is always wrong with the world are the people who run it.

[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.160]
Mm-hmm.

[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:16.300]
And the biggest country, the 135 prostitutes and hordes that we call Congress, who sell themselves

[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.420]
to the highest bidder.

[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.300]
And every one of them should look into the mirror in the morning and say, I have found my

[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.480]
responsibility.

[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.640]
If they're in a bank account, they say, I've succeeded.

[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.800]
Yes, I know.

[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.260]
But the rest of us, uh, get the big one.

[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.400]
That's correct.

[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.680]
Have a good day.

[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.700]
Okay, bend over.

[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.480]
566705, 60.5, 60 in a Verizon.

[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.100]
I can't, like I started to say before, before, under the break.

[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.340]
Uh, I never would have dreamed last night that I could have possibly been on here today

[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.220]
because I had that raw.

[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.920]
I'm just, and, uh, this morning I woke up extra early and I cleaned out all the nasal

[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.260]
passages, you know, really.

[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.380]
So if you snout rockets, so flying, I don't, I don't have those anymore.

[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.620]
Last week, though, Friday to the weekend, I was blowing snout rockets all over the place.

[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.420]
And like I told you before, the show today, you have to be extra careful.

[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:07.840]
That's right.

[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.360]
You want, you want to trace those babies.

[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.980]
You have to have a GPS thing on it.

[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.200]
There needs to be at the counting.

[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.960]
So that you know where they land.

[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.020]
I had one land on the door to this studio.

[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.240]
You know, at some time, right?

[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.680]
Sometimes you'll find a missing wood later on and that's really embarrassing.

[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.900]
It was a huge one.

[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.260]
Oh, just, I thought I'd better find out where that one.

[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.460]
You know, I'm looking at my shirt and I'm, was it shaped like anything or anyone?

[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.200]
No, it wasn't you.

[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.620]
Yeah, okay.

[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.600]
Jesus was on it.

[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.620]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.760]
It should have saved it.

[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.980]
It's got an auctioned it on eBay.

[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.820]
I am.

[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.860]
It's already up there.

[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.520]
Jesus was on my snout rocket.

[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.060]
50 bucks to start.

[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:42.260]
Webini QAM.

[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:42.560]
Hello.

[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.500]
Yeah, Neil, let me get some more of that.

[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.240]
QAM.

[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.540]
Hello.

[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.720]
Hello, Neil.

[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:49.380]
George.

[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:50.620]
Oh, yeah.

[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.760]
Good, good fake voice.

[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.340]
So I just took out where they both of them.

[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.720]
Five, what?

[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.120]
Oh, geez.

[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.920]
And as soon as I looked over there to see how many votes we had, the accrawler, the aquarium

[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.400]
came up.

[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:03.960]
556.

[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.600]
Well, we're on disabled in that one of these days.

[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:08.500]
Why?

[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.840]
Or at least putting it more of a delay on there so it doesn't keep coming up.

[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.980]
It doesn't keep coming up.

[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.320]
It's only once very of it.

[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.340]
That's just my luck.

[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:18.840]
Okay.

[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.420]
That's my lot in life.

[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.280]
My Trent lot.

[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.920]
Webini QAM.

[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.260]
Hello.

[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:24.920]
Hello, Neil.

[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:25.720]
Yes?

[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.200]
I'm sorry to hear that you're doing bad today.

[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.240]
We sure feel better.

[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.320]
There's the one thing.

[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:31.860]
Yeah.

[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.000]
I know it's a lot of fun.

[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.700]
I'm not worried.

[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.540]
I'm not worried.

[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:37.620]
Let me tell you the night.

[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.300]
I didn't tell you the last week.

[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.620]
Don't ever call the show again.

[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.700]
Did I tell you that?

[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.280]
Don't call the show again.

[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.120]
Ever.

[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.720]
Under a penalty of death.

[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.740]
Over and over.

[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:51.520]
He's the worst.

[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.460]
I told you that, didn't I?

[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.660]
You think some others are the worst.

[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.220]
Now you're wrong.

[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:54.740]
Nope.

[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.660]
He has become the new worst.

[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.820]
He's still got far to go.

[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.180]
Webini QAM.

[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:00.480]
Hello.

[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.600]
We have to call the white people.

[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.020]
Webini QAM.

[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.620]
Hello.

[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.800]
Hello.

[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:08.940]
Hello.

[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.200]
Yeah.

[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.660]
Is this your show?

[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:12.380]
Yeah.

[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:13.660]
Okay.

[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:19.920]
I was just curious what you were told about the black at the heart rock.

[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.580]
I'm sorry.

[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.180]
What about the blackjack?

[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:24.120]
Yeah.

[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.580]
Not the Apple Blackjack down at the heart rock.

[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.580]
I don't care.

[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.840]
You don't think it's going to put a dent in some of the other gamblers?

[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.160]
Sure.

[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:31.960]
Of course it is.

[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.320]
I don't think you have to ask me that question.

[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.200]
Of course it is.

[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.020]
Okay.

[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.280]
Well, I just think it's one of the few positive things that's not been done here.

[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.860]
Of course, I'm a degenerate gambler, but I thought it was a real good day.

[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:43.440]
A lot of people.

[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.060]
Okay.

[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:45.780]
Have a good time.

[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.360]
Lose your ass.

[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.680]
I don't know one of the good things that ever happened.

[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.260]
Like I said, the same hypocrites that were screaming and yelling and curing on.

[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.580]
Oh, gambling is evil in the slots.

[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.380]
But they were having a nervous breakdown.

[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.500]
It's okay for them to have it, but if somebody else has it, that's bad.

[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:01.980]
You're going to lose all your cash.

[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.180]
By the way, the lotto tomorrow night is 30 million here.

[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.480]
Yeah, if I win it, what's the odds are astronomically against it.

[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.960]
But if I should win it tomorrow night, Thursday, Georgia will be on.

[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.100]
And reality.

[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:16.860]
Get named.

[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:17.540]
The same.

[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.120]
The three.

[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.920]
The last one is sport.

[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.760]
You'll find it.

[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.120]
Send it all.

[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.200]
I'll send it.

[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.500]
Fourth leader.

[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.180]
You'll got out the WQL.

[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.380]
Where the bag it is.

[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.380]
STD Layton Strip Joyz.

[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.520]
Approved by Joyce.

[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.480]
Farts out.

[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.540]
Rejected by Joyce.

[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.740]
Online gambling scams.

[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.800]
Approved by Joyce.

[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.260]
Words containing the word bag.

[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.160]
Rejected by Joyce.

[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.680]
Directile dysfunction spots.

[00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.280]
Resoundingly approved by Joyce.

[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.820]
Tuba sounds resembling Farts out.

[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.700]
Rejected by Joyce.

[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:12.060]
Layton's fortulated factory and sports show hosts encouraging kids to rob liquor stores.

[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.860]
Happily approved by Joyce.

[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.000]
Farts out.

[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.960]
Rejected by Joyce.

[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.140]
1031-560 WQA.

[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.500]
I'm happy Tuesday to you.

[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.280]
24th June.

[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.500]
I had to write down the dates for the trends.

[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:26.820]
Did I?

[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:27.480]
I'm a calendar.

[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.200]
Did you?

[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.580]
Yes I did.

[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.280]
July or Chris.

[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.200]
July something.

[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:32.680]
What is it?

[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.400]
Second all the word?

[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.000]
Flip it.

[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:34.360]

[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.460]
Yeah what?

[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.720]
He's flipping the calendar now.

[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.420]
Is it that thing of a project to turn a page?

[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.340]
I mean, well, it's way up behind him there.

[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.200]
Yeah.

[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.360]
He didn't write down.

[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:46.520]
Wait a sec.

[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:46.520]

[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:46.520]

[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:46.520]

[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.740]
We didn't write down just last week.

[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:51.900]
Well I had no idea.

[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:52.300]
What?

[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.920]
Well a slacker Wednesday, Wednesday, what.

[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:56.840]
The second?

[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.920]
How do you know that?

[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.840]
Because you were talking about me having to read them.

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.780]
That's how he remembers.

[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.940]
marched you right up the ladder.

[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.880]
Lazy TUB.

[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:11.920]
Allinky.

[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.880]
Easy TUB.

[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.820]
I used to be eating at the time but now I have to some a favor.

[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.840]
and the book comes on the 30th of July of July.

[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.260]
And he's writing that down, just saying that.

[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.040]
They're writing down, Tubby.

[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:25.780]
God.

[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.060]
And then yesterday I find out that he wasn't even

[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:29.680]
there half the show.

[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.500]
We had some more car issues, more excuses, man.

[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.980]
This guy shows up when it feels like.

[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.400]
Oh, I see a repair bill, if you like.

[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.140]
Why?

[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:38.800]
I'll fax you the repair bill, if you like.

[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.200]
I don't care what the repair bill was.

[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.080]
Did you pay it?

[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:41.480]
Yes.

[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.000]
How much was it?

[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:43.640]
70 bucks.

[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.920]
Oh, poor baby.

[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.720]
That's like three weeks pay for you.

[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.700]
About a three half.

[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.880]
What was wrong with your car?

[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.100]
My brake lights were not going on.

[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.560]
How to replace a switch or something.

[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.320]
Well, why don't you care if your brake lights are going on?

[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.180]
That's only if you really care about other people.

[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:02.960]
Well, I do.

[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.880]
Don't you know where you are here in South Florida?

[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.560]
And that's supposed to worry about crap like that.

[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.540]
Oh, well, I do.

[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.000]
brake lights.

[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.

[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.240]
You know, one thing I'm not really sure about.

[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.840]
And I guess I could go online and find out or I could call somebody.

[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.320]
Yeah.

[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.280]
Well, what can I ask the question?

[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:22.960]
Oh, I was waiting.

[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.800]
You had dead air there, man.

[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.820]
Because I'm going to sneeze here.

[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.760]
No, I didn't have dead air.

[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.080]
I was during that was sign filled.

[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.700]
I'm working on it.

[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.080]
Oh, okay.

[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:28.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.000]
See now you know I had dead air.

[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:32.900]
Hey.

[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.060]
Oh, brother.

[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.320]
Hmm.

[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.380]
In Canada, or every car that's made in Canada, the headlights come out.

[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:42.580]
Come on.

[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.240]
When you turn on the ignition, no matter what time of day it is.

[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:45.580]
Okay.

[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:46.940]
Do you understand what I'm saying?

[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.360]
Most newer cars here, the JAP cars, especially do that now.

[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.000]
Really?

[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:52.380]
Yeah.

[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.160]
I don't know about all of them, but it might be.

[00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:00.080]
Now, of course, my Corvette, being made in the US, doesn't do that.

[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.540]
And but when I'm out there driving even the daytime, I turn the headlights on because

[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.120]
I'm assuming I don't know, but I'm assuming it might be the law here.

[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.860]
The JAP have your headlights on at all times when you're driving.

[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:14.360]
Okay.

[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.780]
Otherwise, why would they have done that?

[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.440]
Would you own say?

[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:20.880]
Right.

[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.360]
So, what do you think?

[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.820]
It's possible, but of course, remember, like motorcycles for the longest times, the headlights

[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.060]
would automatically come on as a safety feature.

[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.280]
It wasn't so much the laws as it was paranoid on the part of the manufacturer's part.

[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.300]
So, it could be that.

[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.360]
Well, here's the facts.

[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.420]
Neil, have you heard the excellent news?

[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.060]
As this is excellent news, bubble the love sponge would be going on the morning and

[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.720]
93 rock.

[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.820]
What excellent news?

[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.140]
Finally, those losers, Paul and Ronald, be going down, they suck, and only have ratings

[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.180]
due to lack of competition.

[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:58.080]
Also rumors are that cheap channels, considering flipping 94.9 back to Zeta Rock.

[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.880]
Wow, what excellent news?

[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.680]
Lastly, I was at the hard rock on Sunday for the blackjack opening this anonymous

[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.160]
factor says, of course, it was packed with celebrities and athletes, but the most interesting

[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.820]
thing was WIOD was there for hours broadcasting the opening ceremony's live.

[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.640]
Some depressed sports pump was actually doing the broadcasting, but Red Note 40 was, of

[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.200]
course, their hobnaving and getting drunk off his ass.

[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:24.920]
How do you like that?

[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.420]
Good old footsie.

[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.220]
Well, at least they were there doing some broadcasting, probably making some serious

[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.240]
money off that whole deal.

[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.120]
What were we doing?

[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.140]
Sports.

[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.040]
WQAM, hello.

[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.100]
I'm Sam.

[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:39.900]
QAM, hello.

[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.960]
Imagine saving 50% on your homeowner's insurance.

[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:44.600]
Call that.

[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:44.960]
Yeah, good.

[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:45.580]
Okay, good.

[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.280]
There's another one for you.

[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.880]
Where the hell did he come from?

[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.580]
School's out, remember?

[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.180]
Now, he's been on air three, four weeks now.

[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.420]
School's been out.

[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.720]
Where did he come from?

[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.040]
Hong Konger.

[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:00.720]
Uranus?

[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:01.640]
Not mine.

[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:02.380]
Baby, you know.

[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, we better get these phones going, man.

[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.380]
I'm going to start playing all that ACN stuff.

[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.880]
Double dog, Daria.

[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.780]
Big dog, Daria.

[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.940]
Oh, I don't want to dig into that drawer, you know.

[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.340]
We're going to have all in the drawer.

[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:14.940]
Yeah.

[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.600]
They're all just digging in your drawers.

[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.020]
I don't want to do that.

[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.000]
I don't mind digging to somebody else's drawers, especially that Indian kid at Seminoeth,

[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.060]
whatever it is, would buy.

[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.840]
It's young confused now.

[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.640]
I don't even know where I am.

[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.560]
I'm so under the weather.

[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.360]
That's the other one.

[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.820]
Those expressions that George Carlin would have been screaming about.

[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.820]
Remember, he was always ripping all these idiotic cliches?

[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.180]
That's right.

[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.240]
Under the weather.

[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.600]
Well, what does that mean?

[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.320]
I don't know.

[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.260]
Under the weather.

[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.100]
Let's talk about it.

[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.640]
Over the weather.

[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.600]
How about next to the weather?

[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.760]
How about just like the weather?

[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.800]
How about inside the weather?

[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.260]
Just stupid crap.

[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.200]
People make up.

[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.000]
WDQAM.

[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:53.280]
Hello.

[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.540]
Oh my God.

[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.800]
You're right about these calls though.

[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:57.280]
I'll tell you that.

[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:57.980]
Very weak.

[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.080]
We had that tremendous spurt in the first couple of minutes.

[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:02.840]
Right?

[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.440]
That was it.

[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.700]
And that was the end of that.

[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.700]
And of course, line 9 is the only one ringing out.

[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.800]
And you know who that's going to be.

[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:09.480]
Hello.

[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:12.720]
Hola.

[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:14.500]
Hello.

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:15.740]
Hola.

[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:15.880]

[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:16.460]
Hola.

[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:16.580]
Hello.

[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:17.620]
Hello.

[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.500]
This is Linda Le Penia from Sprint.

[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.500]
Is this Rint?

[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.660]
What is it?

[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.340]
It's what?

[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.440]
This is Linda Le Penia from Sprint, a third of the telephone company.

[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.100]
Okay.

[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.740]
And this is a radio show you're calling.

[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.560]
This isn't some radio show.

[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:34.720]
Oh.

[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.120]
It's a radio show.

[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.100]
It's a radio show.

[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.140]
And you're on the radio right now as a matter of fact.

[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.900]
Are you trying to pedal something?

[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.220]
Oh.

[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.720]
I'm sorry.

[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.020]
I just want to inform you about our special promotion.

[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.560]
Don't ever call this number again.

[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.060]
Okay.

[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.040]
Anyway, we apologize for that.

[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.920]
So, anything you want to say about this number again.

[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.980]
So, if you wish not to receive any special points,

[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.720]
don't ever call, which one are you going to say in English?

[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.260]
Which one don't you get?

[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:08.820]
Yes, I understand.

[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.500]
Sir, if you wish not to receive any special points,

[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.240]
don't call this number again.

[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.560]
They're like automatons, man.

[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.220]
They've been trying to make them wind them up and turn them loose.

[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:19.940]
They don't give a crap.

[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.020]
Jesus, you wish not to receive calls.

[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.320]
You got to do something.

[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.040]
I just told you don't ever call this number.

[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:26.680]
And, bitch.

[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:27.480]
Bitch.

[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.900]
Your buddy asked her to call in the first place.

[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:29.460]
That's right.

[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.440]
QA and Hull.

[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:30.820]
Who are you on this?

[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.300]
Who are you on this?

[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:32.560]
Who are you on this?

[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.040]
Who are you on this?

[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.280]
Who are you on this?

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.460]
Who are you on this?

[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.260]
Who are you on this?

[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:41.360]

[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:41.360]

[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:41.480]

[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.120]
Slime ball.

[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.020]
Scrum bucket.

[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.320]
That's your security there.

[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.400]
You thought I was going to say something bag, you know.

[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.020]
Old bag.

[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.200]
Look, I'll make sure this is who again.

[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.040]
QA and Hull.

[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.060]
Hello.

[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.860]
Yes, Mr. Rogers, please.

[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:58.940]
Yes, sir, speaking.

[00:32:59.400 --> 00:32:59.940]
Good morning, sir.

[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:00.500]
How are you?

[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.580]
And you'll just call in the kiss and the brink.

[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.440]
And he's calling to say thank you to the laughs early in the morning.

[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:06.040]
Appreciate it.

[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.820]
Me and my wife, you cracked us up to tell you.

[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.060]
Miss Phil Henry and sorry to hear about George Carlin.

[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.840]
Good to have you back.

[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:14.980]
Instead of George.

[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.820]
George is to Miami for us.

[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.400]
What was that mean?

[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.820]
You know, all the usual...

[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.580]
No, we don't know.

[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.100]
Tell us.

[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.060]
If I knew I wouldn't have asked a question.

[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.680]
Is that usual, you know, pot smoking?

[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.440]
Is that indigenous to Miami pot smoking?

[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.360]
That's plenty of it going on here.

[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:36.720]
Okay.

[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.320]
Okay, we'll have a nice day of life.

[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.640]
And thanks for ripping George and ass.

[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.780]
That was very kind of you.

[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.280]
A tune in Miami.

[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.940]
Wanted to call and suck my ass and kick yours.

[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:47.560]
Yeah.

[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.300]
You're to Miami, Mr. Rogers.

[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:49.440]
Right.

[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:49.960]
Right now.

[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.700]
You're to Cairo...

[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.160]
The biggest name.

[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.680]
The best tower ever.

[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:55.640]
You know, Rogers.

[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.980]
Fourth in your five, fifty QAM.

[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.800]
The fourth leader.

[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:00.880]
You're a bastard.

[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.700]
California will become the second US state

[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.640]
to legally recognize gay marriage.

[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.680]
It is all new.

[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.640]
This business of marriage licenses for same-sex couples.

[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.120]
Couples and government officials are already getting ready

[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.340]
to first gay wedding.

[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.700]
Mother let me look at you.

[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.540]
Oh, my sex you was prepared.

[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.960]
Go and stand on the street, girl.

[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:25.980]
Lighting up to get there.

[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.720]
No, you don't want to miss this.

[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.520]
Or the sounds they recite.

[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.160]
But the weddings will be called a sin

[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.660]
by the religious fire.

[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.420]
It's a game sitting your way.

[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.340]
And you can whisper well.

[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.720]
You wouldn't think it's fabulous.

[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.940]
It's in a marriage, can they just like it?

[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.540]
But they're taking hand over.

[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.620]
Be married and gay.

[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.260]
Would you think you're getting through a girl?

[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.060]
The accident is waiting day.

[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.640]
Welcome to get it.

[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.320]
It's in California.

[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.640]
Because you're super humanly gay.

[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.340]
We say that you're lovely.

[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.580]
We say people come to stay.

[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.740]
That's a little cakey.

[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:18.780]
I'll sweep that way.

[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.940]
Let's be in the world's come to home.

[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.260]
California.

[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.880]
First of all, I love congratulations on being a lesbian.

[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.400]
I can't be a kind of queer.

[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.020]
Any kind of queer.

[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.680]
Can't get married here.

[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.680]
Women and women and men and men and men and men.

[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.240]
I get so free for all of that.

[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.080]
Are you gay?

[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.180]
It's a matter of fact, you just turned me gay.

[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.240]
You're fairy in the past.

[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.240]
So again, I think that you know when you look at the climate

[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.040]
just from the present,

[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.980]
somebody ought to take a gigantic watermelon

[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.500]
and stuff it in his mouth.

[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.760]
Oh, see, somebody's going to make that into a racist food.

[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:19.300]
I'm going to say bowling ball, but it's not big enough.

[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:19.980]
I see.

[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.600]
Maybe a

[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.580]
I'm not gay.

[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:25.960]
I'm gay.

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.960]

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:25.980]
I'm gay.

[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:25.980]

[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.560]
I'm gay.

[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:26.560]

[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:26.900]
I'm gay.

[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.140]
I'm gay.

[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.500]
I'm gay.

[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.360]
I'm gay.

[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.140]
I'm gay.

[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:31.780]
I'm gay.

[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.260]
I'm gay.

[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.060]
I'm gay.

[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.880]
I'm gay.

[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.000]
I'm gay.

[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.720]
I'm gay.

[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.320]
I'm gay.

[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.360]
I'm gay.

[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.140]
I'm gay.

[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.300]
I'm gay.

[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.000]
I'm gay.

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.000]

[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:15.140]
I'm gay.

[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.140]

[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.140]

[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.140]

[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.140]

[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:15.200]
I'm gay.

[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:15.200]

[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:15.880]
I'm gay.

[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.800]
I'm gay.

[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.260]
I'm black.

[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.980]
I'm gay.

[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:19.980]

[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.280]
I'm gay.

[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:20.280]

[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:27.320]
Well, you know CNN is just there having a nervous crap over the Simon story.

[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.840]
Composed if it was just goes on, all morning long they've been just beating it like a

[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.700]
tantom.

[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.200]
Other complaints include that the ed was unsuitable to be seen by children and that it raised

[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.420]
the difficult problem of parents having to discuss the issue of same-sex relationships

[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.640]
with younger viewers.

[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.160]
I wonder if those same children are concerned about why Prince Charlie has been buggering

[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:49.980]
the bubbler.

[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.520]
Or is it the other way around?

[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.420]
In the car policy, the listen to consumers, we recognize that some consumers raise concerns

[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:04.580]
over the continuity and this prompted our decision with throughout said, Nigel Dickie, director

[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.340]
of corporate affairs for the UK.

[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.200]
Dickie added that the campaign for the new Hines Deli Mayo product which was due to run

[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.800]
for five weeks was meant to be humorous and that's a kind of humorous.

[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.720]
Well, it's the car, yeah, well, and the company apologized to anyone who felt offended.

[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:24.620]
The TV ad is the first behind this new ad agency, AMV BBD, you know, since it won a $10 million

[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.660]
of a $10 million pound a year UK business last year, $20 million bucks.

[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.500]
AMV BBD also the concept behind the campaign is that the product tastes so good, it's as

[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.440]
if you have your own New York Deli man in your kitchen.

[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.000]
And of course you'd want to give him a kiss.

[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.980]
Hines has ad opens with a family on a normal morning routine with a young boy and girl

[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.640]
getting ready for school and their father preparing for the orifice.

[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.420]
The young boy and girl go into the kitchen to get their sandwiches which are being prepared

[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.120]
by a man with a New York accent dressed in a Deli serving outfit, who they refer to

[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:54.680]
as Mum.

[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.720]
When their father goes to get a sandwich, he says to Mum in the kitchen, see you tonight

[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.000]
love.

[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.540]
However Mum barks back, hey, ain't you forgetting something?

[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.280]
At which point the two men sure kiss.

[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.960]
Mum sends the father off with the words, love you, straight home from workswit cheeks.

[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.840]
Well, I wonder what cheeks he's talking about.

[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.580]
Correct their own, no, those brits.

[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:20.120]
The Hines TV ad carried an ex-kids restriction meaning it cannot be shown in or around children's

[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.520]
programming because Hines Deli Mayo falls foul of off-com TVs ad restrictions related to

[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.620]
products that are high in fat, salt and sugar.

[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.540]
Not because of the kiss but because the

[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.180]
email is loaded with crap.

[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.340]
Hines said it made the decision to stop airing the ad on Friday.

[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.100]
All those queens over there, all those silly queens with their rotten teeth.

[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.740]
A 597 votes, I think we'll get 600 that I'm going back to bed.

[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.480]
I'm going to take a decongestant, a big, big swig.

[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.400]
WQAN, hello.

[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:02.400]
56670560, pound 560, undyferized in singular, wireless line.

[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.460]
Not a call on the board, you're right.

[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.240]
It's the 24th of June, it's the middle of the dog days, I'm bigger part.

[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.000]
It was brutal.

[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:11.320]
What?

[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.700]
Other Mondays, you know.

[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.540]
Oh, stop telling me Monday.

[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.080]
In other words, Monday.

[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.920]
Monday and Thursday should be fine, but Monday when Monday is the worst.

[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.840]
Monday nobody's showing up for work, even else, like an orthopedic.

[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:23.620]
Yeah.

[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.220]
Sounds like an excuse to me.

[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.340]
What's my excuse now?

[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.400]
There's not a call on the board.

[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.340]
Me, I drove the audience away being to Miami.

[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.120]
To Miami.

[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.300]
What do you think, Chris?

[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.160]
You think he's to Miami?

[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.920]
I think he's to far, a lot of them.

[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.000]
I think he's to OGIS.

[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.440]
Now that he's got his nuts sliced off.

[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.400]
How many QAN, hello?

[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.900]
When will George come out of the clock?

[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.240]
WQAN, hello.

[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.440]
Hey, good morning, now.

[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:02.180]
Hey, I kind of like the summer schedule myself.

[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.300]
You're sweating up the week.

[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.600]
Fine, I know you like it.

[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.260]
But one question.

[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.580]
On your appearance at Gulfstream, I saw Jolly Jollard.

[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.780]
Does he really laugh like that?

[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.240]
Or you just mix one of them like that?

[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:16.960]
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:17.560]
Do you?

[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.560]
Does he really laugh like that?

[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.980]
Call him up and ask him.

[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:21.880]
All right, give me the email.

[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.400]
56670560.

[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.300]
Pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.460]
The chicken's really pee or not?

[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:36.480]
This guy wants to know this Jolly Jollard really laugh like that.

[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.360]
How many QAN, hello?

[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.080]
Yeah, he knows.

[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.700]
It's sad that you were talking about that.

[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.160]
It is sad.

[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.380]
I didn't make down if you were a fan of his or not.

[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.300]
It was the shame to see him pass away.

[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.440]
He was one of the few guys that's actually worth anything.

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.040]
Anyway, I wanted to ask what you think about this.

[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.980]
When you watch the news, they keep talking about the shortage of oil.

[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:02.140]
That's why our gas prices keep going up.

[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.340]
But the men's stream news, they don't talk about the fact about speculation and all that

[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:07.880]
sort of thing.

[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.120]
I don't know if there's anything that drilling anywhere else to put out your rabies.

[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.820]
They're going to give it some more oil, but yet the price keeps going up.

[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.280]
And they ignored it in the news.

[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.380]
I mean, it's...

[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:22.200]
I just got through reading and putting an article on our website for tomorrow.

[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.140]
But if Congress would act and stop all this crazy speculation, oh, gas would be two bucks

[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:27.760]
a gallon, though.

[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.300]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.160]
So they won't do it.

[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.140]
They're not going to do it.

[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.260]
It's ridiculous.

[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.860]
You know, we keep funding this war and everything else to just keep the price higher.

[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.640]
So we're paying to pay more for gas.

[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.260]
Anyway, that's the one to complain about.

[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.300]
Well, we're lucky to see our gist of memory in the immortal words of Ned Beatty.

[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.480]
Mr. Bio.

[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.580]
That's it.

[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.700]
It's like a toll we got today.

[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.420]
World is a business.

[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.620]
It's all about money.

[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.840]
And even a religion part of it.

[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.580]
That's just another tax exempt business in this country.

[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.720]
We got all the schmata heads killing each other.

[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.140]
And you think anybody really cares which hand Mohammed White disastrous would you think anybody

[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:13.220]
knows if I know or how to pronounce God's name or really holds that mound.

[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:14.960]
Mounds.

[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.420]
How about the almond joy either one Peter Paul Peter Paul Mary into bounds.

[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.840]
Maybe Mary hits some jug into keeping mounds.

[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:24.460]
I don't think so.

[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.500]
Mary traverse.

[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.040]
Is she dead?

[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:26.420]
I don't know.

[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.540]
I don't think picking on Peter Paul and Mary for crying out whatever.

[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.340]
I'll be playing a few games.

[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:32.660]
Hello.

[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.000]
Mia.

[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:34.760]
Yes.

[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:41.640]
I would just like to say that we're doing a collection to get rid of the stupid, super intended

[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.340]
of the county public schools.

[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.840]
You're doing a collection.

[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:51.860]
We're doing one because the contract says in order to be fired we have to pay him $700,000.

[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:52.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.140]
So we're just at $1 per person.

[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.300]
I figure we have a-

[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:56.300]

[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.400]
I'll go out on the street, Cornwell.

[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.180]
We're going to go to Tim Cuff.

[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:58.540]
Okay.

[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.580]
Say, Spiritson change Mr. How's it going, eh?

[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.080]
Hey, and see how you do.

[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.280]
Call us back in a couple months.

[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.020]
Let us know how you do.

[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.080]
That would be QAM.

[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:08.300]
Hello.

[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.020]
261.

[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:10.680]
Google it.

[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:13.220]
What?

[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:14.220]
Don't.

[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:15.660]
What is it?

[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.440]
Don't repeat it.

[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.820]
Somebody plugging himself on the air himself.

[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.780]
He wants you to Google something.

[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.160]
I'm not going to do it.

[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:23.380]
Right.

[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.120]
So don't.

[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.960]
Of course, I know who it is.

[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:28.780]
No more on it.

[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.100]
More on it.

[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:29.580]
That's no more.

[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.160]
That's right.

[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:30.960]
Of course it is.

[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.500]
Line 9 is always-

[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.240]
Maybe it'll be that sprint lady again.

[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.200]
Maybe it'll be that-

[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:37.600]
Somebody come away and hello.

[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:38.520]
Hi.

[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:39.720]
Hi.

[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.440]
I called into Michael Buffer's funny name.

[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.020]
He was asking for you at the Hard Rock.

[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:44.300]
Who?

[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.440]
Michael Buffer.

[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.460]
Let's get ready to demo!

[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.900]
That Michael Buffer.

[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:51.480]
Oh.

[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.240]
Well, so when you come to the Hard Rock to play some Blackjack.

[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:54.800]
I'm not.

[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.820]
I don't play Blackjack.

[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:56.620]
I'm interested.

[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.100]
I put a game on the show you can do it.

[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.700]
I have played it.

[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.380]
I'm not interested.

[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:00.980]
It's boring.

[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.300]
Like backer ads better?

[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:02.960]
Boring.

[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:03.940]
Backer ad.

[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:04.700]
Say it right.

[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:05.740]
Backer ad.

[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.620]
Not backer ad.

[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.580]
Backer ad.

[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.200]
You play what you want to play and I'll play with who I want to play.

[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:10.440]
Okay.

[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.420]
I love those people.

[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.840]
It's like it's like Drunks and Drug addicts.

[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.460]
It's the same thing.

[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.320]
They insist that you participate.

[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.140]
In other words, even if you don't care that they're drunk or you know who I am drugs.

[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.120]
Even if you mind your own business and don't give a crap.

[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.040]
That's not good enough.

[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.580]
You also have to participate.

[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.000]
Right.

[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.680]
And I love these pseudo intellectual gamblers.

[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.020]
Oh, Blackjack, you know, you play those slots and suck.

[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:34.780]
You can't win on that.

[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.940]
I just want another two grand this weekend at Woodbite.

[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:37.220]
Okay.

[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.620]
Yeah, I got lucky also.

[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.540]
I use a little bit of common sense and I play that quick hit.

[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.260]
I do good on that.

[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:46.480]
Yeah.

[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:47.700]
And I like it.

[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.420]
You know what I mean?

[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.660]
I enjoy it.

[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.380]
I don't play Blackjack.

[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.820]
I'm not going to play Blackjack just because of a bunch of pseudo intellectuals.

[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.800]
I was like, oh, you can really beat Blackjack now.

[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:56.480]
Well, you know something?

[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:00.200]
Every time I've ever been winning at Blackjack, they change the dealer.

[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:04.300]
And all of a sudden, the dealer kept getting Blackjack over it, over and over again.

[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:05.460]
Why don't you be interested?

[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.020]
What?

[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:06.720]
How's it going?

[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.300]
Why are you a Blackjack guy?

[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.700]
No, I said there's a lot of things you can beat.

[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.460]
Yeah, besides Blackjack.

[00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:14.660]
Like your head against the wall.

[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.040]
Sure.

[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:16.820]
That's what we do with here.

[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.560]
That's what I do with my head.

[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.280]
I do it with my head.

[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.260]
I do it with my head.

[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:20.620]
I do it with my head.

[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.080]
I do it with my head.

[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.000]
I do it with my head.

[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.040]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.740]
What's all this just to do with your brain?

[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.180]
What's all this just to do with your brain?

[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:29.980]
What's all this just to do with your brain?

[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:30.680]
Any questions?

[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.580]
Some stations give you cars.

[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.300]
Some stations give you cash.

[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.860]
But this station is going to give you incredible discounts for the rest of your life.

[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.000]
Because this station is going to make you a midget.

[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.760]
Make you a bunch, kid.

[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.420]
You'll be able to scam your way of the kids' discounts.

[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.820]
Getting the movies for a half-price fly free.

[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.800]
When a company buy a person of average height,

[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.480]
it's a look of women's dresses.

[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.460]
If you're a guy.

[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.300]
And all because you'll be a midget.

[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.860]
Down and sinking.

[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.100]
Just be the tense color when you hear the sound.

[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.620]
And we'll surgically remove your shins.

[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.200]
Be attached to your feet and crush every third and third of your brain.

[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.180]
And you'll be a midget.

[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:13.500]
This station accepts no responsibility for any emotional damage due to being barred from amusement park rides

[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.960]
where you have to be this tall or being made just when the mckitty pool with the warm spots.

[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.240]
Employees of this station and dwarves are not eligible to become midgets.

[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.960]
What are you going to make of midget?

[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.240]
He first hangs a win.

[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.760]
Okay, I love it out too, if you want.

[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.100]
Guess what I just dug out of the, um, my drawers.

[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:29.980]
I don't know, panties.

[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:30.840]
Them panties?

[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:31.380]
Yeah.

[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:32.100]
Pink.

[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:33.000]
Ooh.

[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:33.840]
Waste?

[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.920]
No, uh, ACN Gold Library.

[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:36.760]
Laceon?

[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:43.600]
Now, I'm trying to find out where the hell's the one I was just going to play.

[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.960]
I don't know what one was it.

[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:46.940]
It was the astuages.

[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.680]
Oh, here it is.

[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.100]
It's right here.

[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.360]
Cross training with the three astuages.

[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:52.700]
Hello.

[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:53.440]
Hello.

[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.120]

[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.660]
Moe knows orthopedic surgeons with disabilities.

[00:47:58.860 --> 00:47:59.580]
Case of dry runs.

[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:00.900]
Cut off that left.

[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.140]
Moe knows financial planning.

[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.060]
We'll be leaving money later on in chance for.

[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.340]
What did you put us in the bank?

[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.020]
Moe even knows biblical theology.

[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.440]
Yeah, and I pronounce.

[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.060]
Yeah, but Moe.

[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.520]
Quiet, numbs go, I'm broadcasting.

[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.580]
You don't know it, did we?

[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.220]
Why you turn my silver?

[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.240]
Oh, yeah, it's you.

[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.280]
You knock ahead.

[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.940]
What do you think?

[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:32.660]
I never did like that one.

[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:34.400]
Why?

[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:37.600]
Dated.

[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:39.520]
Dated.

[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.600]
Yeah, it was, you know, when all those commercials were going on, it was a mildly music back then.

[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:47.600]
Simba.

[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.080]
Master of the romantic smile, this one.

[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.200]
And rock my junior late, Sessler.

[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.060]
What about balance?

[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.320]
It's timeless.

[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.520]
Together for the first time.

[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.980]
So you're two Miami, that's the problem.

[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.720]
I know.

[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.380]
You know, we only bid on a little bit more than an hour today.

[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.780]
We've already learned something very valuable to our audience.

[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.260]
George is two.

[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:16.060]
All these years, I've been trying to figure out what it is, why they hate you like that.

[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.100]
I think I lived less than a year, maybe in 1969, but hey, what's that, I've never done that.

[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:21.880]
That's a year too much.

[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:22.220]
I know.

[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.380]
I lived in Kendall for a long time.

[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:25.900]
I didn't wait too much.

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.620]
I lived in Miami Beach for a short time.

[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.240]
I lived in Homestead.

[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.480]
I lived in Hollywood for a year.

[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.740]
I lived in Hollywood and I was very rude.

[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.080]
I guess that's pretty Miami over here.

[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.480]
It just sounds like we all right now.

[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.340]
Like a block.

[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.240]
Did you have burglar bars?

[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:35.940]
No.

[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.060]
Nobody can cutway in.

[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:38.420]
Hello.

[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:43.440]
Yeah, Neil, I was wondering what you thought about our governor's flip.

[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:43.760]
I don't know.

[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.700]
Bopping over to match McCain's policy.

[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:48.940]
Offshore drilling.

[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:49.880]
Offshore drilling, man.

[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.680]
The only drilling your governor's interested in has to do with that.

[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.020]
Right, don't.

[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.160]
That's the drilling he cares about.

[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.060]
Trust me while I tell you.

[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.300]
And you don't hear anything about it on the news.

[00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.280]
You hear no leverage.

[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.300]
No one's pissed off.

[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.520]
Everyone's just getting in line, man.

[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.720]
And you want to know why?

[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.960]
Because like they said last night on the news.

[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.160]
Well, he's wildly popular in Florida.

[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.360]
Every governor that we have now is wildly popular.

[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:15.260]
His predecessor, Fat Asjib, who was a disaster in a liar, he was wildly popular.

[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.280]
And that's because there's somebody dumb people in Florida.

[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.620]
And it's clean that we got in there right now.

[00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:22.300]
I mean, you have to be an idiot.

[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.240]
You have to be deaf dumb and blind not to see what a screamer of the scum in there is you've got.

[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.020]
And how he's dating so and so, yeah.

[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.300]
In fact, that was the line they used last night.

[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:37.860]
He might be more eligible to be McCain's running me because now he's actually maybe going to get engaged or some crap like that.

[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.400]
He found a beard.

[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.700]
Who the hell is he kidding?

[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.560]
Mark Foley, he was kidding some people.

[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:46.920]
I kept telling you about that for years.

[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.500]
Oh no, do you think everybody is gay?

[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.200]
Yeah, that's what George always used to say.

[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:52.700]
I did.

[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:54.840]
I don't know.

[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.560]
I just made it up to 2 damn Miami.

[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.020]
I know.

[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.820]
I mean, is there any doubt about Charlie Christ with Olympus?

[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.840]
Is there any doubt?

[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:04.820]
A Charlie?

[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.520]
You're fair.

[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.940]
I think it would be great if he would be McCain's running mate.

[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:15.040]
And then like about a week before the election, all his former boyfriends came into the media and started to spill into beans.

[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.460]
Wouldn't that be great?

[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.320]
Yep, yep.

[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.040]
It would be.

[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.220]
Oh, speaking of Florida voting.

[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:27.400]
In a sign that Barack Obama will be competitive in the country's largest swing state, Florida.

[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.860]
He's beating John McCain comfortably in South Florida as a slight edge among Hispanics even, according to Newpol in the Herald.

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:41.980]
Obama's ahead 46 to 30% over McCain, and Dave Howard and Palm Beach counties in the survey of 87 people conducted by Zogby International.

[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:48.000]
Obama's 16 point lead in South Florida could springboard him to make it a competitive race statewide said,

[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.480]
poster John Zogby, I really think Florida is in play.

[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:51.500]
It's in play.

[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:58.620]
About 24% of South Florida is favor another candidate, where I have made up their minds, a large group that could tip their race in the coming months.

[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.940]
Another candidate like who Ron Paul, what other candidate?

[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.000]
I don't know.

[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.600]
Who's the libertarian candidate?

[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.060]
Oh, don't ask me.

[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.220]
Come on.

[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:11.800]
Sorry.

[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.320]
Bob Barr.

[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.420]
It is?

[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.100]
Bob Barr with a little Hitler mustache.

[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:17.220]
Well, let me say it is.

[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.200]
I'm not keeping it that way.

[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.360]
Too damn my anime.

[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:20.400]
I know, sorry.

[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:25.720]
Obama was perceived as being behind in Florida because he didn't campaign the state for nine months.

[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:31.020]
Lost the Democratic primary to swallery, but two statewide polls released last week showed him with the narrow edge over McCain.

[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.920]
The Zogby poll was conducted June 18 to 20.

[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.960]
This is Obama's first TV ads in South Florida when on the air.

[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:42.780]
South Florida traditionally votes Democratic, but Obama's lead and date is wider than the narrow margin of it,

[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.380]
reposted by John Kerry in 2004.

[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:50.760]
Among Hispanics in the three counties, Obama leads McCain 40 to 35%.

[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.980]
The debt that shows the debt the banker that Hispanics are feeding toward the Republican parties are.

[00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:02.220]
We said if Democrats walk away with 65% of their Hispanic vote in Florida, that will be almost insurmountable for the Republicans.

[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:11.960]
And Obama's lead in the polls suggests he's winning over supporters of swallery who want handling in South Florida and the Hispanic community in the January 29th presidential primary.

[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.520]
But it will be, but it will, but it will.

[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.160]
So there you go.

[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:24.520]
If Obama wins Florida and Virginia and Ohio and Pennsylvania and about 45 other states, I think he's got a good shot.

[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.240]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:32.140]
A. N. L. A. Don, I just want to say all of you feel better with your cold.

[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.440]
And what's in that Puerto Rican background music?

[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.940]
What is that? What are you talking about?

[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.900]
We got Spanish music on your radio while I'm with you talk.

[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.220]
Yeah, no extra charge.

[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.200]
What makes you say it's Puerto Rican?

[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.120]
I don't know what that is.

[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:53.900]
You better get your Latino straightened out, Mr. Let me tell you.

[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:54.720]
Do some work on it.

[00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.220]
Puerto Rican music, my ass.

[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.960]
Do we have Guatemala music in the background? How about Nicolas Guam?

[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.220]
Maybe. Maybe a Panamanian.

[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:06.980]
It could be Portuguese.

[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.560]
Portuguese? Who knows?

[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.840]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.460]
But I tell you, you're right about these phones, man.

[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.960]
Look at that. There's not a column at board.

[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.080]
It's only 11 to 8.

[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:20.920]
But CNN.

[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:21.880]
Can be a issue.

[00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.840]
So for East Vagani, I'm a thing again.

[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:24.680]
You know something.

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:25.860]
They belong in prison.

[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:32.000]
Whoever, whoever is sitting at the editor's desk or whatever they call it, at CNN today, they belong in death row.

[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:38.980]
Because the way they're making such a big stimulus about this, the people that he's working for now, I'm a...

[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.800]
They said it's not a big deal. They're not going to do anything more about it.

[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.160]
Look at that. It's no fun.

[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:51.000]
But CNN is going to do everything in their power to dig out all Al Sharpton, all the other rabble-rouses, all the other professional troublemakers.

[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.800]
We want to make everything into a big racist stimulus.

[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.460]
And they're going to do their best.

[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.520]
Leave the poor old bastard alone already.

[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:57.860]
Are you with you?

[00:54:58.200 --> 00:54:58.660]
Or not?

[00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.900]
Or not.

[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.260]
Whatever. There must be something going on over here.

[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.080]
Besides, I'ma said there's some crap I guess.

[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.360]
But you're not boring us with it.

[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.300]
Yeah, right.

[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:08.540]
Let me beat them up.

[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:09.040]
Burn them up.

[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:09.980]
Who they got on the air now?

[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.960]
They got these two life complexes in their car.

[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.160]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:12.180]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:12.300]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:12.420]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:12.460]
I'm sorry.

[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:15.140]
As you know, when I'ma talk, everyone listens.

[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:16.520]
But it wasn't an apology.

[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:16.960]
They do?

[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:17.680]
We heard from...

[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.820]
No. Nobody listens.

[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:19.880]
That's what you got on home.

[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:20.380]
Never used to.

[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:20.740]
Yeah.

[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.700]
Talk him crap.

[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.500]

[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.080]
Hey, Neil.

Yes, sir.

[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.540]
He's got a message, uh, Hank on it.

[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.460]
No, no, okay.

[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.480]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.740]
Hi, what about...

[00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.540]
Q-A-M, hello.

[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.060]
Yes.

[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.160]

[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:47.960]

[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.220]
Yeah, he's around.

[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:51.120]

[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:52.420]

I'm at the Wendy's in camera.

[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.940]
He's won more Grammy Awards than RCA, Columbia, and Bowtown Records combined.

[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.540]
Everybody's got a hungry order.

[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.380]
He's burged and the largest selling recording star of all time.

[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:10.100]
And now for the first time ever, burged and assed in sales, Bruce Springsteen.

[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.340]
You'll hear a looking boar a lover who will come on in and cover me.

[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:20.540]
Yes, you've never experienced music by the boss until you've heard it sung by burged and assed in.

[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.680]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'm on fire.

[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.040]
Jazz like us baby, we were born to run.

[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.920]
And who can forget glory today?

[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.980]
Yes, he's burged and assed in country music legend.

[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:38.140]
Even if we're just dates and in the dark, this special seven record set comes complete with burged and assed in bedsheets and pillowcases order your copies today.

[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.540]
Bedsheets and pillowcases limited to stock on hand.

[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:41.980]
So what do you think?

[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.580]
Oh, I like to burd that one.

[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.180]
Oh, are you like this one?

[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:45.600]
Uh-huh.

[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:46.700]
Wait, that's not it.

[00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:47.740]
Here it is.

[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.800]
Invented country music, you put your right foot in.

[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.540]
Bloodmorkets are strings and foster farms has chicken.

[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.340]
You pull your right foot out.

[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.700]
Eastward Ted Hatchton.

[00:58:58.860 --> 00:58:59.620]
You gonna hooky poke him.

[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.300]
Everyone Wayne was doing a hooky poke at the bar.

[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:01.560]
Sure.

[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.060]
Boy, how could we forget that?

[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.660]
A website called circumlocutor.logspot.com says,

[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:15.480]
sworn testimony supports Charlie Christ gay affair with Felon's story.

[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.140]
Like many fans of rough trade,

[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:24.100]
Charlie Christ wants to keep secret as gay love affair with a convicted felon.

[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:28.500]
Yet despite the miles by the vehemently anti-gay Christ that he's a homosexual,

[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.860]
more evidence continues to merge to the contrary.

[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.400]
Christ, the Florida group in editorial allow you, of course, this was before he was the elected.

[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.900]
An anti-gay champion allegedly had an affair with a 21-year-old GOP staffer

[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.520]
and with Bruce Carlton Jordan,

[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:46.420]
the convicted felon who was Catherine Harris' personal travel aide.

[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.980]
Yeah, I know that's all new, says the obligor.

[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:55.340]
What's new is that there's sworn video testimony verifying Christ's sex affair with the gay felon.

[00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.560]
And Christ opponent the GOP primary, Tom Gallagher apparently knew about it all before the primary vote.

[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.460]
A video tape swarm statement from the Broward Palm Beach New Times.

[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.800]
A video tape sworn statement has surfaced that bolsters the contention

[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.620]
that Florida Attorney General and Republican Governor Tural candidate Charlie Christ

[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.600]
had a recent romantic relationship with a convicted felon and former travel aide,

[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.580]
the U.S. representative Catherine Harris.

[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:24.420]
Last week I reported that 21-year-old GOP staffer Jason Weatherington

[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:28.100]
had claimed incredible sources that he had a sexual relationship with a 50-year-old Christ

[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.500]
and had identified the far-waters long-term partner as Bruce Carlton Jordan

[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:36.220]
who remains on state probation after serving a 30-day jail sentence for conviction

[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.240]
on Grand Theft and Forgery charges.

[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.700]
Christ has repeatedly denied that he's gay and with the election moving next week,

[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.220]
you can see when this was written, has recently become more vocal in the stance against adoption by gay couples

[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:50.280]
and in support of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution of Band-Game Marriage.

[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:55.980]
Evidence, however, is piling up that he and Jordan, whom the GOP candidate claims

[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.680]
not to remember even having met, had a relationship,

[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.480]
and as Republican opponent Tom Gallagher knew about it prior to the September 5 primary vote.

[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:08.460]
Much of the information surrounding the relationship came unwittingly and somewhat ironically

[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:13.480]
from the Harris-U.S. Senate campaign where Jordan worked as the Congresswoman's personal travel aide

[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.520]
not long after his release from jail in February.

[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.020]
I bet a lot, I bet he wishes her plane would have gone down.

[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.520]
Number Captain Harris's plane?

[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:21.900]
Yep.

[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:22.460]
Oops.

[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.400]
It was while he was employed in that capacity that another traveler on the Harris campaign

[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.420]
D.D. Hall befriended him.

[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.060]
In a videotape statement that I obtained over the weekend,

[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:37.540]
Hall's words that Jordan confided to her that he had an ongoing romantic relationship with Christ

[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:42.640]
on the tape Hall sits in a sharply-colored blue blouse and talks about the 4th of July

[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.440]
outing with Harris on a wealthy island enclave of John's island near Viral Beach.

[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.160]
How do you like that?

[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.940]
You're gay governor.

[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.440]
But he said to know, you know, like everybody else, he said to know, he didn't do no guys.

[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.120]
And he's got this girlfriend now, she's got a beard.

[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.440]
She's not a very very, she only has a beard, yeah.

[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.100]
Probably got Harry armpits too, Harry pits.

[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.120]
Not that it would make a difference more than I thought that number one is a frequent number two

[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.520]
a liar and number three that being on the Republican ticket might just be kind of a drag if I can use that term.

[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.260]
A drag?

[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.100]
Yeah, I'm a John McCain.

[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.480]
But nevertheless, I think it would be sweet, sweet.

[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:28.740]
No two?

[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.020]
Yeah.

[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:37.000]
I think everybody out there oughta said to let her the McCain campaign urging them to choose Charlie Christ as his running mate.

[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.000]
Maybe his bedmate?

[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.320]
Oh, I think he probably can do better than old John McCain, would you think?

[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:45.160]
Uh-huh.

[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.320]
Even I can do better than that.

[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.040]
660 votes on the pool.

[01:02:53.660 --> 01:03:00.400]
I'm now starting to dry out a little bit I think, you know, and the dry out phase, not not from booze but from mucus, flim,

[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.860]
PHLEGM, is that high spell flim?

[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.020]
That is.

[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:07.020]
Wow.

[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:10.540]
Oh, there's some more of it.

[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.140]
Puse.

[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.540]
Most of the world's serious problems are caused by that's our poll today.

[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:19.720]
660 votes.

[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.780]
Oh, there's that fat-faced Lou Dobbs, your hero.

[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.260]
Talking about it in Haiti, Mexico.

[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.480]
Religious fanaticism, 398.

[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.380]
Money, 75.

[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:30.760]
See, I'll have a problem.

[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.640]
See, you guys oughta be happy you don't have any physicals, it causes lots of problems.

[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.200]
Oh, yeah.

[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:34.860]
Yeah.

[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.120]
Money, 75.

[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.640]
Politics, 63.

[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.640]
Greed, 57.

[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.240]
Overpopulation, 54.

[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:44.300]
Just keep making a bunch of babies you can't feed.

[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.220]
And stupid sports shows, 13.

[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.360]
Stupid idiotic sports shows.

[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.460]
Oh, WDQAM, hello.

[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.220]
Hey, Neil, how you doing today?

[01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:58.880]
Okay.

[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:06.040]
I was watching WPTV news last night about the blockchats at the hardware.

[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:10.500]
And they were saying that the Indians were going to send the state $50 million.

[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:11.820]
Yeah.

[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.800]
And then six months later, send up another $50 million and they were the only ones that were going to get the blackjack.

[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.520]
What's that about?

[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.380]
Is that like a payoff?

[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:19.080]
Yeah.

[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.920]
Now, really, I'm serious.

[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.540]
How is that legal?

[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:24.820]
Well, what do you mean, how is it legal?

[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.120]
That, ask your governor, he's the one that cooked up the deal.

[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:33.000]
That sort of doesn't sound fair to Gulf Stream and pump about it.

[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.920]
You know, you know, something you don't tend to understand.

[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.120]
Something, can I answer your question, or just want to talk?

[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.440]
No, I want to do your answer.

[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.200]
Blackjack is not legal in the state of Florida.

[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.400]
So technically, the Indians shouldn't have it because nobody else can have it.

[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.400]
It's not permitted in the state of Florida.

[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.200]
But they got it now.

[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.200]
They got it now because the governor cooked up a deal with him. That's right.

[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.000]
Well.

[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.820]
And nobody else can have it.

[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:00.760]
All right.

[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.360]
Now, I just wanted to hear your opinion on it.

[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.400]
It's not an opinion.

[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.040]
It's a fact.

[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.060]
Yeah, it's a fact.

[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:05.800]
All right.

[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:05.940]
I know.

[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:06.620]
Good luck to you.

[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:06.900]
Okay.

[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.640]
I think your governor is too Florida, just like George is too mighty.

[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.600]
And maybe a little bit too, too that, left too.

[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.080]
The governor, not George.

[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:17.080]
George is gay, George.

[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:17.840]
Yeah, he wishes.

[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:18.540]
Yeah.

[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.540]
Well, you know, the thing about those people is that they, every single day, they call and say the same thing.

[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:30.620]
And it's like a, a short pause, yeah, and, and, and, and well, what did you just accomplish?

[01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:31.340]
What's the point?

[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:34.220]
They didn't start until I started hanging up on them when I used to answer the phones.

[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.080]
They're just like Gilbert.

[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.460]
They blame me for the fact that you, now you're starting to get defensive.

[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.040]
It's not me.

[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.400]
Yeah, you are.

[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:39.960]
I'm not.

[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.440]
Next, they're going to be telling, I'll talk about you and Charlie Chris.

[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.540]
But you would just talk to them and then kick them what they want and interact with them.

[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.520]
I don't want to talk to them.

[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.020]
And then they wouldn't hate you.

[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:48.720]
I think they do it.

[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:48.840]
I think they do it.

[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.980]
You're a Chris or anybody else.

[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.460]
They don't pick on Chris.

[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.160]
Yeah, they do.

[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.460]
What do they say about him?

[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:53.880]
He's fat.

[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.360]
He's gay.

[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.160]
Oh, he's gay, too, huh?

[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:56.380]
Yes.

[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.300]
Well, the whole world is gay.

[01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.220]
WDQIM.

[01:05:59.420 --> 01:05:59.580]
Hello.

[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.000]
Uncle Dale.

[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:01.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.140]
Now you're doing today.

[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:03.760]
Okay.

[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.660]
You found under the weather or something weird with the seeds coming from you guys?

[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:08.220]
Yeah.

[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:08.980]
I'm under the weather.

[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:09.720]
Yeah, I've had a cold.

[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.440]
Oh, that's what I was wondering.

[01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:15.720]
Hey, the last car called and you kind of, I don't think you really touched on it enough.

[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.340]
But I mean, if the Indian thought it was long enough, they would, they could shove it down your throat.

[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.540]
Because they could have got Blackjack anyway, given us any money.

[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.080]
Because you didn't have that weight.

[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:25.880]
White have gone.

[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.280]
They want?

[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.240]
They could have got Blackjack.

[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.660]
Well, I mean, don't they have it in Connecticut and like four other states where the

[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.300]
family is not legal, don't the tribes up there have like full of casinos?

[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.060]
There's a tribe in Florida can only do what's allowed in the state of the Constitution.

[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.080]
They can only do that.

[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:49.080]
I'm just trying not to be eye-catching here, but I know that Connecticut has a big casino up there.

[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.020]
Sir, we're not talking about Connecticut.

[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.560]
We're talking about Florida.

[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:53.660]

[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:56.040]
That's what the tribes obviously don't pay taxes either.

[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:02.220]
But I mean, they get away with, you know, they don't have to pay any taxes because of sovereignty or whatever that'll all be using.

[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:10.080]
So somehow they would have figured their way around the system and I think that's what why Chris made the deal was because they were...

[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.400]
You know what that sounds like a great rationalization or a great excuse.

[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:16.200]
I mean, hey, I'm glad we're getting a hundred million out of Martin, aren't you?

[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.200]
It's more than you were getting before, that's right.

[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.840]
I mean, trust me, that's a drop in the bucket for what they're making over there at a hundred million.

[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.260]
No, that is correct, that's right.

[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.260]
Anyway, Neil, listen to you a lot.

[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.020]
Do you remember one thing? They won't at all. Don't forget that.

[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.320]
They're going to get it all and we should be getting our money out of them.

[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.520]
Do they anyway think we could ever re-fin the poll? They don't pay taxes thing?

[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:38.300]
No.

[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:39.680]
All right.

[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:44.120]
That would be like asking, are we going to re-send the churches, don't pay taxes? No.

[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:44.280]
All right.

[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.400]
Are we going to leave and give them their land back?

[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:46.980]
No, no, no.

[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.160]
I have a number of votes on the poll.

[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.460]
Six, six, six.

[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.600]
Ooh, you know what I saw? I'll ask the priest though.

[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.320]
You knew that.

[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.380]
What the heck is your name?

[01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.460]
The best house.

[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.880]
You know what I'm asking?

[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.200]
Forty-five, fifty-two, I am.

[01:07:59.380 --> 01:07:59.760]
You think?

[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:00.340]
Forty-four.

[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:00.980]
Clear.

[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:01.820]
You're gay.

[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.560]
No, no, no, no, that's not the pronounce.

[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.700]
Peace, true.

[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:09.820]
Yeah, I'm East German.

[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.480]
Oh, you know what this is?

[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:14.480]
Interactive.

[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.140]
Interactive.

[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:16.560]

[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.080]
I thought it was going to be cute.

[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.820]
It's called Center for Inpatient People.

[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:20.460]
Mm.

[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.740]
I guess, oh, I guess we were saying it was funny.

[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.380]
Maybe this one's good.

[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.400]
Oh, yeah.

[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:28.080]
Another one.

[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:28.600]
Another one.

[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:28.620]
Another one.

[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:28.800]

[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.560]
Why don't they say that on there?

[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.660]
I don't know.

[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.300]
What do you mean you don't know?

[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:34.780]
I don't know.

[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:35.800]
I don't know what they want to say that on there.

[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.660]
Can't speak for those people.

[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.580]
Because they're slackest.

[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:40.660]
Because they're not the other one.

[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:41.620]
I think so.

[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:44.240]
Yeah.

[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.880]
Hello, all the office.

[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.360]
Hang on, Sagwady.

[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.780]
Yeah, that's better.

[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.320]
I'll just pray in some of that air freshener.

[01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.080]
And he was in here just running around, working up the sweat.

[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:01.440]
Wow.

[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:01.700]

[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.500]
There he is.

[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:03.980]
Well, of course.

[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.700]
That's supposed to be like too much, but we love compared to this one.

[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:09.300]
Mm-hmm.

[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.780]
I mean, he was just fabulous compared to this bozo.

[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:17.640]
You know, if you Google Charlie Christ gay, you'll find 44 million articles.

[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.340]
Did you know that?

[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:20.720]
No, I did not.

[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:21.800]
I'll keep your word for it, though.

[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:23.180]
You learned two things today.

[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.340]
Number one that you're too Miami.

[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:24.880]
Uh-huh.

[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.660]
Number two, I should have stayed in bed.

[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:27.300]
Number three.

[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.340]
Charlie Christ is gay.

[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:30.760]
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.

[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.240]
Hey, how you doing, Neil?

[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:32.720]
Okay.

[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.620]
Hope you feel better.

[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.280]
But listen, I was one of those first people on Sunday night that was at the Hard Rock.

[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.760]
How was it?

[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:41.980]
Uh-huh.

[01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:44.180]
Well, you had some real living people in there.

[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:44.920]
Number one.

[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:52.140]
And, uh, there was actually a person in position in front of every table that played Black Jack.

[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.880]
And there was a hoop lock, because there was $25 minimum.

[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.320]
And yesterday they allowed it to go down to 10.

[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:01.380]
But, there were so many people with lots of hundreds.

[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.820]
I don't know how much of it's legal and illegal, but that's another whole day in a story.

[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:09.580]
But this is going to cause three things, because it happened in the Atlantic City when I lived up in New Jersey.

[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:10.100]
Yeah.

[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:17.180]
You're going to see small businesses go wonder, because people's going to probably invest their money or steal money.

[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.860]
And the force will go up.

[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:23.780]
And, uh, and I would say, put up their video, or we'll also go down for people.

[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:24.480]
Oh, yeah.

[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.520]
But, no, honestly, the world is we know what is going to come to an end, because they have Black Jack at Hard Rock.

[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.120]
I'm sure that.

[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.200]
Yeah, but you don't think the Bahamas and the cruise ship industry is going to hurt?

[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.240]
So who cares?

[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.020]
Actually, and you're the greatest.

[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:39.740]
Okay.

[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.820]
I say, a hubb'm in dryer, the Bahamas and the cruise ship industry, especially the cruise line,

[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:52.340]
who also have great expertise in not paying taxes, whether off-shore, you know.

[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.960]
Registry, um, Martinique, Registry, uh, Yamama, you know, Registry somewhere.

[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.440]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.980]
Yep, I do.

[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.640]
They just keep slipping everybody to Mickey.

[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:04.200]
Sure.

[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.700]
Maybe we can all take nine billion dollars and head to Israel and see if we can avoid paying taxes on it.

[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.640]
If it wasn't, uh, you know, for Jews only, maybe that'd be an idea.

[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.620]
What do you mean by that? For Jews only?

[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.160]
What kind of a kind of a...

[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.680]
Isn't that like, you know, there, there, uh, race a system over there, like all Jews invited everybody,

[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.200]
all to hubb'm in dryer's deck.

[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.960]
There's no Goi-M in Israel, is that what you're saying?

[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.940]
You better study your Goi-M in Israel, because you can't have it in the body.

[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:32.400]
In positions of power and in terms of the way it heads to, being the government,

[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.960]
you can be a non-Jew and being the governor over there.

[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:35.820]
Yeah, that's correct. Yes, you can.

[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.140]
You can. There's an Arab one, the a-knec side.

[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:38.960]
Yeah, it's news to me.

[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:43.120]
His name is a mama, my, uh, Akbar, uh, Kretsch.

[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.040]
Well then I'm gonna go over there and start stealing land from people.

[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.740]
There you go. My God, don't get on here.

[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.000]
Yeah.

[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.080]
And kill a few Palestinians while you're around, as many as I can.

[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.540]
Everybody Q-A-M, hello.

[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.720]
Now what happened there? Did you see that?

[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.140]
I saw it.

[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:57.700]
Q-A-M, hello.

[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.900]
Yes, you know I've never called a talk.

[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.080]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:01.840]
Hello.

[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:02.580]
Yes.

[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.560]
Yeah, I want to make a comment.

[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.320]
You don't want there no live eight Blackjack, and not only flood machines.

[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.960]
Yeah, you're going to talk into them.

[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:14.860]
Oh, Neil.

[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:20.760]
Governor Bush back in November 2006,

[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.340]
was going through talks with the Seminoles for two years.

[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:28.580]
The time ran out as of November.

[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:32.260]
And so a week before Charlie Kriss got elected,

[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.600]
the Seminoles would automatically get slots without giving a nickel to the state.

[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.180]
So Charlie Kriss, I imagine, ran to the Seminoles and said,

[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.260]
look, I take office in two months, January 1st.

[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.840]
If you give us money for slot machines, I'll throw your phone.

[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.660]
I'll give you something else.

[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:50.460]
They said, okay.

[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:54.020]
And so that's where they sat down and threw that in.

[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:56.480]
Plus they have on screen when they want you.

[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:56.920]
He did it.

[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.040]
He did it without the legislature.

[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.740]
He did it in violation of the law.

[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.940]
He did it on his own.

[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.940]
Well, the National Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 says,

[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.000]
if it's legal in your state, you must sit down with a tribe.

[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.620]
But any time along the way, any governor, like the other gentleman said,

[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:16.460]
the Piquat tribe had people games because of Las Vegas,

[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.500]
and I can get it.

[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.800]
They did a compact first slot.

[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.800]
There were no, I mean, for, yeah, for slots.

[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.940]
There were none legal in Connecticut.

[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.160]
And in Minnesota, the tribes got full casinos.

[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.400]
There's nothing legal there.

[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.320]
Any, now, you can throw some money.

[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.040]
You can't give a tax, but you give what they call a fee.

[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:38.240]
The Seminoles are giving no less than $100 million.

[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.920]
And then on a percentage fee, when all seven are opened up,

[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.640]
all seven of their reservations.

[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.180]
It's going to be $200, $250 million.

[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.980]
It's going to be a percentage of what they take in.

[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:48.580]
Great.

[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.460]
And in the meantime, the, the per mutual facilities,

[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.060]
which they went through all of this grief to get this passed,

[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.400]
they're going to get screwed again.

[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:57.860]
Well, I spoke with that.

[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.600]
I left voicemails for band-acons, and for the havennets, I spoke to.

[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:05.560]
Every time they got something, whether it was kids at the track,

[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.580]
Sunday racing, or poker, it was because...

[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.100]
This isn't casinos, Stan, is it?

[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.660]
Yes, it is.

[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.220]
Oh!

[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.380]
Oh!

[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.340]
Oh, I want to kill myself.

[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:15.280]
I want to hold my head.

[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:15.820]
You're going to have to jump.

[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.560]
But, but I pull.

[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:18.060]

[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.860]
You only get something when you zone,

[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.160]
when you're stuck in your good.

[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.180]
When the, when the cruisional war came out in 1991.

[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.500]
Why are you defending this?

[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.900]
Why are you defending the indefensible?

[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:33.120]
Have you forgotten about those incendiary ads that the Indians ran against the sloths?

[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.340]
I told them there's enough for both of you.

[01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:37.520]
Well, but you told them.

[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.000]
Who the hell are you, Mr. Christmas?

[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:39.860]
You told them.

[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.060]
I'm just, you know, I...

[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:43.600]
Oh, my God.

[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:46.080]
You talk about an alleged legend in his own mind.

[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:47.440]
I'm just, I'm just, I'm...

[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.520]
You, you totally gone off the deep end, Stan.

[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.640]
You have lost it.

[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.580]
But I told them both of them would have all the market, with the Bahamas and the cruisional

[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:58.000]
where, you know, not getting any of it.

[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:00.280]
And, and I believe they'll all have it.

[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:05.620]
They'll have full casinos, both paramutuals and the seminals and the mika-suki.

[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:08.140]
That's strange that the mika-suki has been in there.

[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.240]
And, and who's going to change the law to make that happen?

[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.180]
Who's going to change the state constitution to make that happen?

[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.160]
Well, they can either do a petition drive.

[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:21.400]
By the way, the compact says, if any track in Dave Rower or the whole state gets anything

[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:24.520]
that the tribe has now, then the compact is off.

[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.100]
So the tracks would have to show that they could produce as much money.

[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:29.220]
And instead of...

[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:32.520]
How the hell are they going to do that with their hands tied behind their back like they've done with the slots?

[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.600]
Is that what they're going to do with?

[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.480]
They'll get the third of the state is making damn sure that they fail.

[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.420]
That's what they tried to do.

[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.260]
That was the purpose.

[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.640]
That's what they're doing, succeeding at very well.

[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.600]
But they'll get the 35% this session because, again,

[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:49.420]
you desperately, you know, the Baker Act, you know what that is?

[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.120]
I'm going to have to go to Baker Act, you before the day of the high.

[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:53.880]
I hope so.

[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880]
I hope so.

[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.940]
Get him to put away, please.

[01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.100]
They just got 24-hour poker today.

[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.440]
I mean, Morning Grot did.

[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:01.240]
Yeah.

[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:01.740]
Two permits.

[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.080]
So, what is that?

[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.320]
Well, you know, that was another hint.

[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:08.780]
I'm not old enough to go and play a nickel poker with a bunch of gold cockers.

[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:09.700]
Okay, I'm not good old yet.

[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:10.900]
Well, that's another hint.

[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.640]
Call me back when I get to be 90, okay?

[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.900]
I told them.

[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:17.240]
That's right.

[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:18.480]
He said it was gambling.

[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.340]
That was the worst call in the history of talk radio.

[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.340]
Not just this show, any show.

[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.200]
He's the Grand Poo-Bah of gambling.

[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:28.320]
The Grand Poo-Bah?

[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:29.940]
Yeah.

[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.880]
You got the poop part right.

[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.960]
This is a lunatic, a maniac.

[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.080]
I told them.

[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.560]
Talk about an Ozyam provocateur who's been hawkeness for,

[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.760]
I have bought about 500 years.

[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.200]
And I bet he ain't got two nickels to rub together.

[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.580]
I bet she can't even afford to go there.

[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.420]
We've seen him.

[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.040]
With that wrinkled skin.

[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.720]
He's got wrinkles on top of wrinkle.

[01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:58.580]
It's insane.

[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.260]
He's got wrinkles in places where it's illegal inflow.

[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.060]
A brown bag for somebody to walk it down.

[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:03.760]
I'm the best.

[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:04.560]
Look at him.

[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:05.560]
He's got a white bag.

[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.880]
He's got 50QAM.

[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.620]
He's the fourth leader.

[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.600]
That was my reaction to the last call.

[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.480]
Oh, my friend.

[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.000]
The C.O. stands.

[01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:24.420]
Yeah.

[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.180]
Time is through with Mimi.

[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.440]
Look at what she's losing.

[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.540]
She divorced her top gun.

[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.820]
Now time can go I cruise in.

[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.860]
Ooh, Tommy.

[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:42.920]
Tommy.

[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:44.720]
Mimi.

[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:46.660]
Mimi.

[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.740]
What's he got that I don't?

[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.200]
What's his great appeal?

[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.220]
He's got looks and talent.

[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.960]
What's the great appeal?

[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.820]
Ooh, cocktail.

[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.580]
Rainman.

[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:08.800]
Tommy.

[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.820]
You fell Tommy.

[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:12.800]
Tommy.

[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:14.640]
Tommy.

[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:16.060]

[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:22.820]
Tommy.

[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.560]
Don't leave me.

[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:34.560]
Don't leave me.

[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:35.980]

[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:39.140]
Tommy.

[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.840]
Don't leave me.

[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.940]
I wonder if she's the screaming me.

[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:49.560]
10-1146-560WQAM.

[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.860]
I got the jerk show coming up at two.

[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:52.820]
I don't know.

[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:53.640]
I got a bad cold.

[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:54.800]
Although it's on the way out.

[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:55.960]
I think I am too.

[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:57.140]
I think.

[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.520]
I'm dying out of here.

[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.740]
I got it.

[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:00.920]
Yeah, I don't think so either.

[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.760]
Now this is from the Huffington Post May 28th of this year.

[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.880]
How interested is Florida Governor Charlie Christen being John McCain's vice presidential running mate?

[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:10.820]
So much so.

[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:23.440]
The veteran GOP Dirty Trickster Roger Stone who coordinated a few dirty stunts in support of Christ during the 2006 gubernatorial campaign is quietly peddling a so-called Charlie Christ sex tape.

[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.660]
That's what's so-called it during a telephone conversation.

[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:29.200]
I know it's not a tape of Christ having sex with a guy.

[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.180]
In fact, it isn't even exerated.

[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.300]
The video was seemingly staged to kill the rumors of Christ's gay.

[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:38.560]
Stone claims the tape which he discussed recently with politics won but didn't show to us.

[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.260]
Show Charlie fooling around in the hotel elevated with his girlfriend.

[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:43.320]
They're making out.

[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.200]
Add Stone was captured on the security camera in the elevator last month.

[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.720]
And Stone just conveniently happens to have a copy of the hotel's elevator surveillance tape.

[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:57.140]
Just one Christ name was in play for the GOP vice presidential spot.

[01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:57.540]
Hmm.

[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:04.240]
As for a Christ purported girlfriend, presuming it's the same one that he took as his date to the White House,

[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.100]
Christ on its dinner or DC a few weeks ago, she's still married and not to him.

[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.620]
This claim will always be skeptical of anything from Stone.

[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.500]
Not going to make say a difference you understand.

[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.100]
Other than he's a hypocrite in the phony and the wire.

[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:25.420]
And other than the mechanically Republican party, they wouldn't win one state.

[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:32.060]
If he put Christ on the ticket and came to find out that all my God, all this stuff came to the surface.

[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:39.680]
Like fat, chicken fat, I'm sick and super in the refrigerator.

[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.340]
It's also a call to scum.

[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.760]
Ah, you can't say that.

[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.740]
No, no, no.

[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.140]
Bag.

[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.320]
704 on the pool.

[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:50.620]
Christ is a pretty, he's probably dancing in his pants.

[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:51.460]
I'm so happy.

[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.840]
We don't have any phones on the eye.

[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.340]
I think these people should all be calling up right now to scream and yell and carry on about the evils of gambling

[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:04.740]
and how the fact that we got hard rock with blackjack now is going to cause all the small business people to go out of business.

[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.360]
And what was that guy screaming about?

[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.020]
He was almost as crazy as a casino stand.

[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.460]
When he said, I told them.

[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.500]
It was rich.

[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:22.380]
That would be like discussing the energy crisis and having pro-Jack Ron call in and say,

[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:23.740]
I told him, you're my friend.

[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:24.840]
You're my friend.

[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.960]
Am I in my life?

[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.080]
I see you.

[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.660]
He's the maher, don't you know?

[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:33.860]
And so what's the deal?

[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:35.440]
What's the event of gambling?

[01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:39.060]
What is it to him beside the fact that he has no life and this is his life?

[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.080]
I'm like, that's it.

[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.140]
Everybody's got to have something, you know, some hobby.

[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:50.960]
You got your highlight, you got your dog track, you got your thoroughbred racing, you got harness racing, you've got the lotto, you've got slots, you've got blackjack now.

[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.520]
How much more epic gambling do we need for Christ sake?

[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:55.380]
All of it, obviously.

[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.080]
Good, God.

[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:59.640]
A slot machine on every corner right there at the 711.

[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.600]
You see it in the bathroom.

[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:01.640]
I saw the door.

[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:03.220]
I told them.

[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:08.060]
I could just see him standing in the head of the table and meeting of the five families.

[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:10.580]
I told them.

[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:15.580]
It's, it's curious what it is.

[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.460]
But then again, it's South Florida.

[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.540]
56670560, let's get this phone cranking man.

[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.840]
I don't see much action going on here.

[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:26.440]
Let's hear from all the big shots that were at the Hard Rock Sunday night.

[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:33.340]
As far as the guy talking about all the living and breathing people, they're of course because it's the Hard Rock.

[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.800]
Remember the first time I went there?

[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.200]
No.

[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.960]
Yeah, I told you about it.

[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.980]
All the living and breathing, young people, they're all the college kids and everything.

[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.000]
It's because it's the Hard Rock.

[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:45.760]
You go to the pool.

[01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.400]
It's those are the people in the pool.

[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.260]
Not a bunch of old cockers like me.

[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.840]
There are a few old cockers like me running around looking, you know, gawking like, oh my God, like that.

[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.300]
You know what I mean?

[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.620]
Mm-hmm, like that.

[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:02.040]
WDQ way in, hello.

[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.680]
As listeners, we're trying to bring three.

[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:05.620]
That's it.

[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:06.540]
That's our call.

[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:07.520]
Yep.

[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.460]
I'm gonna wait.

[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:15.680]
Remember sunny?

[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:16.380]
I'll wait.

[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:16.920]
Yeah.

[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:18.360]
Hey sunny.

[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.340]
They sure were pretty slow although he was, he was wild, you know.

[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:26.120]
He was driving real fast on the causeway.

[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:27.120]
Mm-hmm.

[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.040]
Remember how long it took, how many seconds it took before they finally pulled up and they saw his

[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.400]
bullet-rattle body laying there on the causeway?

[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:34.080]
Not many.

[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.980]
Not too many.

[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:40.140]
Well, I mean, too many to do it any good, but that's my point.

[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:43.740]
567.

[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:44.720]
0560.

[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:46.620]
Pound 560.

[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:51.780]
I wonder from all the people out there whose lives have been dramatically changed by gambling in Florida.

[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:58.680]
By the fact that we now have those evil one-on-bandits and pretty soon we'll have crafts.

[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.980]
And to a lot of old countries in South Florida, man, that would be a welcome relief.

[01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:06.420]
I know my mother would have been delighted.

[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.320]
Mm-hmm.

[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.040]
If that rich was big into crafts.

[01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:12.560]
He was as a matter of fact.

[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.120]
I know he was.

[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.860]
He tried to explain it to me in a couple of times.

[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:15.960]
I still won't get it.

[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:16.380]
Me either.

[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.960]
See, I'm anti-social to a degree.

[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:25.760]
I don't mind being in a crowded casino, but at least with the slots you're playing your own machine-mon.

[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:31.620]
You don't have to socially interact like you do with crafts and like all these other dice games on other garbage.

[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.040]
Too many dice games.

[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.480]
Fubbtq-y-m, hello.

[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.540]
Now, Georgia, turn the cruise.

[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:39.980]
Fubbtq-y-m, hello.

[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.000]
Daniel.

[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:41.920]
Yes, sir.

[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.420]
How's that to a hard rock on Sunday?

[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.240]
I walked away with $1,500 bucks.

[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.280]
Wow, nice going.

[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:49.620]
Yeah, I know.

[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:51.280]
I took my old paycheck there.

[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.120]
I thought I was just going to blow it.

[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.120]
But right in the end of doing pretty well.

[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.240]
I had a dealer that she could obviously tell if she was new as a whole thing.

[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.860]
And she just kept dealing either right cards.

[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.300]
So, that was pretty nice.

[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.500]
The carbon electrode there.

[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:08.860]
I got to see those kids.

[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:09.920]
That was a good one.

[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:10.420]
That was a problem.

[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:11.700]
Okay, great.

[01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:15.180]
I got to see Carmen Electric's boobies on who was the real big.

[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:15.820]
Yeah.

[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:23.860]
But he won't let you know, I'm glad he put the $55 bucks for his steady one before he

[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.520]
told us about Carmen Electric's boobies.

[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:33.800]
I don't think even if I wore that persuasion, I would be going there to see her out.

[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.520]
That would be like going to see what's her name.

[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.080]
That no talent bitch from Miami.

[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.580]
Since you're so Miami.

[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.420]
What is your name?

[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.560]
I keep forgetting her name.

[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.680]
No talent bitch from Miami.

[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.040]
Could you be more into such a singer?

[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.600]
Gloria Estefan.

[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:51.600]
Gloria Estefan.

[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:51.980]
There you go.

[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:52.240]
See?

[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.200]
How easy that was.

[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.020]
No talent bitch from Miami.

[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.000]
Gloria Estefan.

[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.280]
Only say it right.

[01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:58.460]
Sorry.

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:25:59.860]
WDQA.

[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:00.460]
You know what?

[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.420]
I have a lot of apparently.

[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.540]
You know the only one.

[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:02.900]
Yes.

[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.740]
I'm trying to do something for your business.

[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.760]
You know, I've saved some money.

[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.480]
I'm trying to do something for the world.

[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:10.820]
Okay?

[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:11.960]
Quit columnists.

[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:13.180]
Sir, you're creating a...

[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.100]
Quit columnists.

[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:15.260]
Shut up.

[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:15.620]
Shut up.

[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:16.000]
Hey, sir.

[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:17.680]
Lower out your ass, sir.

[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:21.700]
5670560.

[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:22.100]
column 5660.

[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.260]
He just wants to be another one.

[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:24.720]
That's all.

[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:25.220]
He is.

[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:25.600]
Of course.

[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.200]
He is.

[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.700]
He just wants to be another one of the electronics.

[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.520]
The growing...

[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.040]
The poor spanning list of lifeless idiots who...

[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:33.640]
I have no life.

[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:33.960]
Right.

[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.640]
Somebody could make a lot of money while these people don't have any money.

[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:37.260]
Those people.

[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.400]
If they started a club, a place for them to roost.

[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.080]
Right.

[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.740]
Like the...

[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:43.660]
Rotary.

[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.320]
Sure.

[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.880]
Like one of those places.

[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:46.600]
Something like that.

[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:47.080]
Like the...

[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.540]
All the old turds hang out.

[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:48.920]
Yeah.

[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.520]
Like the Elks.

[01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.140]
I'm like your Archie Bunker is still hanging out the Elks.

[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:54.920]
What a shame.

[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.240]
You know, there's a guy when he died.

[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.020]
I know.

[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:57.940]
Maybe it's just me.

[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.720]
But it seemed to me that Keralo Conor meant more to television and entertainment than Tim Ruster.

[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:05.580]
Well, that's right.

[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.760]
Because you're just an old buddy, Daddy.

[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:07.640]
I see.

[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.040]
Yeah.

[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.000]
You just know he had...

[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.520]
When he died, it was like...

[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.700]
Nobody even knew about it, probably.

[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:12.280]

[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:17.020]
I mean, Keralo Conor, Archie Bunker, classic.

[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.860]
I mean, what kind of people watch Meet the Press, you said about you?

[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.120]
They're even older than me, you watch Meet the Press.

[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.120]
90 plus.

[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.040]
The demographics are older than death.

[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:29.860]
Am I right?

[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:30.260]
Yes.

[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:31.360]
Absolutely.

[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.300]
How about you Q.A.M. Hello?

[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.960]
How about you Q.A.M. Hello?

[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.020]
How about you Q.A.M. Hello?

[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:40.060]
How about you Q.A.M. Hello?

[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:42.820]
He's Scott Buster.

[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:44.220]
What?

[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:45.760]
34 C.R.D.

[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.300]
It's Scott F.

[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:49.740]
Yeah.

[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.200]
I'm bringing 34 C.R.D. down.

[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:52.560]
What's up?

[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:52.720]
Yeah.

[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:53.400]
Uh-huh.

[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:55.480]
Hey, kids, what I've seen is the ball game.

[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:57.380]
I have no idea.

[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.220]
It's a good buddy, Reverend Duhon.

[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:00.260]
I have no idea.

[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.640]
Another bad voice.

[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.300]
Q.A.M.

[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.000]
Not there.

[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.820]
How about you Q.A.M. Hello?

[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:05.360]
Hello?

[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.040]
Daniel, you don't want to know what I do with my $5500?

[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:10.440]
No.

[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.420]
We don't care.

[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:12.640]
You win $55.00.

[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.280]
This guy.

[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.640]
Oh, he just wants to be another one now.

[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:18.240]
They're all auditioning.

[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.820]
I didn't realize the auditions were on yet.

[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:20.880]
This is some auditions.

[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.360]
Apparently, 716 votes on our World Fan of Flaming Polo.

[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:25.900]
Too bad.

[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:28.340]
Get the best tower.

[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:29.580]
You don't need a rocket.

[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.220]
You're $5.50.

[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.120]
Q.A.M.

[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:32.500]
B.

[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:33.820]
Fourth leader.

[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:38.460]
Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q.A.M.

[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.660]
Three men in a tub.

[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:43.480]
Has male bonding gone too far?

[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.460]
Page 42.

[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.500]
Rock-of-eye babies.

[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.300]
Tomorrow's latchkey kids.

[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.560]
Page 73.

[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.440]
Sheep in the middle.

[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:52.420]
And cows in the corn.

[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.920]
Coping with barnyard disarray.

[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.040]
Page 61.

[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:59.340]
Answers to questions unanswered since childhood.

[01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.220]
From dead bird pies to bone-beared cupboards.

[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.600]
And mother-hubberds.

[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:05.440]
Rhymonetics.

[01:29:05.940 --> 01:29:06.580]
Read it.

[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.280]
Or just look at the pictures.

[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.280]
Okay, it's a 12-minute 560 WQ.

[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.060]
And guess what I got out of the microwave just now?

[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.160]
The rest of my wantons soup.

[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.780]
Okay, I was going to say we need to see.

[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.940]
Now, when you got those sorts of roll like this,

[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.240]
you don't write, you don't write,

[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.000]
you put out a we need to see.

[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:21.700]
No.

[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.160]
Hmm.

[01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.540]
Boys, that's scallowing hot.

[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.320]
That's good for you.

[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.600]
Notice how much better I sound already?

[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.100]
Mm-hmm.

[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:29.980]
Wow.

[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:33.000]
That was special.

[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:35.660]
718 votes on the poll.

[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.300]
I might actually read what it is eventually.

[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:37.760]
I don't know.

[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.620]
I don't know about you, but I'm tired of those stupid polls.

[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:43.200]
Really?

[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:44.700]
Yeah.

[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.000]
Oh, this wantons soup, man.

[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.740]
This Jewish chicken soup.

[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:49.860]
I mean, the Chinese.

[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:53.240]
And the creplach are the best part.

[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:54.680]
The wantons, the wantons.

[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:56.980]
Hmm.

[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.760]
See, this actually has some taste.

[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.620]
It's a great place.

[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:05.340]
As opposed to the wantons soup or chicken soup,

[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.320]
it tastes like dish water.

[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.020]
You ever had that?

[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:07.640]
Mm-hmm.

[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.360]
Delicious, but no too late.

[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.240]
It's a week from...

[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:11.860]
WQAM.

[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:12.180]
Hello.

[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:13.140]
Not there.

[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:13.940]
That was the only call.

[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.060]
So I'll eat my soup.

[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.520]
I do decide if you're going to call it or not.

[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.080]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:21.360]
We're talking about blackjack,

[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.400]
and is the world going to come to an end as we knew it.

[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:25.980]
Remember those horrible,

[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:27.260]
horrible articles,

[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:29.940]
those editorials in the herd in the Sun sentle years ago.

[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:34.900]
Every time they talk about casinos or slot machines,

[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.120]
oh, there's going to be the end of our way of life,

[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.580]
and it's going to destroy South Florida,

[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.660]
all the other crap.

[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.680]
I mean, when I was there, of course, we were at Gulf Stream.

[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:49.700]
And, um, Pompano.

[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:52.140]
I went to Hard Rock.

[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.960]
I didn't see anybody looking all at them.

[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.460]
I was just a little bit down-trotting.

[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.860]
I mean, I'm not saying that there aren't people

[01:30:57.860 --> 01:30:58.720]
who have gambling problems,

[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:00.860]
but anybody that's got a gambling problem in Florida

[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:02.780]
can find plenty of place to lose their money already.

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:10.700]
So all this hysteria that was being fanned by the power brokers in town

[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.140]
who were afraid of losing the power.

[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.240]
That's what it's all about.

[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.100]
Oh my God.

[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.160]
Not to put this in order.

[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:22.600]
I think I had a bad wanton in my nose.

[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:24.260]
Yeah.

[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.260]
Anyway, I'll turn out to be a bunch of crap.

[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.980]
Have you noticed a big difference in the way of life in town

[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.360]
because of the slots?

[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:34.360]
Because of the slots? No.

[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:37.300]
Or the black children ever since Tim Russo died, yeah.

[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.020]
It's like it's completely different now.

[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.880]
That's true. I never thought everybody's in the rose.

[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.160]
Everybody's wearing a black all-in-body.

[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:42.880]
Everybody has an hasty face.

[01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:43.420]
Nobody used to use it.

[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:45.020]
I should have all lost the will to live.

[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:46.540]
Now, if only Casino Stan would die.

[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:48.420]
Somebody Q-A-M. Hello.

[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.580]
Q-A-M. Hello.

[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:55.200]
Hey, did you ever try F-Furricle Bud hot and sour soup?

[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.300]
Hot and sour is good.

[01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:58.640]
Yeah, it's real good.

[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:00.100]
That's just as good as the one-pump.

[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:01.500]
Yeah.

[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.820]
Okay. Thanks for your illuminating suggestion.

[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.080]
Schmuck.

[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.380]
Nothing like some good chicken soup, man.

[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.280]
And I don't know why.

[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:15.480]
It's like Asperin.

[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.240]
Have they ever figured out scientifically why Asperin does anything?

[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:21.900]
Right.

[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:24.100]
No, not scientifically.

[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.700]
I don't think they probably have, but I don't know.

[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:26.460]
It's a blood and blood.

[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:27.180]
About chicken soup.

[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:27.920]
Nums soup.

[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:30.800]
Oh, it's got natural anti-inflammatories in it.

[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.320]
What second to do with flamin' mucus?

[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:37.260]
Well, just any kind of hot liquid up in your head is going to clear that out.

[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:37.960]
Up in your head?

[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:38.460]
That's right.

[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.060]
Well, maybe I should put my head back.

[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:42.380]
That's right.

[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.380]
Stick a straw in there.

[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.140]
Yeah.

[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:45.360]
And snort it.

[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.080]
Ooh.

[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:49.460]
WQAM, hello.

[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:50.540]
Hey, Neil.

[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:51.180]
How you doing today?

[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:51.780]
Okay.

[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:54.380]
Did you catch what happened when I missed?

[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.520]
Did you discuss that yet?

[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:56.080]
Yes.

[01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:58.260]
I'm sorry, I missed that on that.

[01:32:58.260 --> 01:32:59.220]
I want to do about nothing.

[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:00.720]
I can't do anything alone already.

[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:02.260]
I don't understand the whole thing.

[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.540]
I mean, I missed his dead anyway, just like you are.

[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:05.240]
Yeah.

[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.020]
Oh, great. Thanks.

[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.940]
5.670560.

[01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:10.800]
But he's listening though.

[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.760]
See, that's the important thing.

[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.200]
You're not listening.

[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:13.720]
I miss now, but you're listening to this show.

[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:14.560]
But I'm dead.

[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.120]
Their days believe you me when I wish I was.

[01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:21.860]
5.670560.

[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:22.820]
Pound 560.

[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:25.140]
I'm even rising to singular wireless line.

[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.680]
WQAM, hello.

[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:29.600]
This is WQAM, one of the box-hop 7-0 Indian type.

[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:34.000]
News day away from Indian place at North Drake at Fio Rada.

[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.820]
WQAM, hello.

[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.820]
Is Don I'm a so-out shop, then, please?

[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.040]
Go back to New York.

[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:42.580]
Loser.

[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:44.640]
Loser.

[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.360]
Go take a hike on the George Washington Bridge.

[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.420]
Put your leg over the railing.

[01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:57.840]
Then put your other leg over the railing.

[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.300]
And do humanity a favor.

[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.140]
What, that's good stuff.

[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.940]
And I can already hear my own voice, the difference in me.

[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:10.600]
We've been doing that good this morning before the show,

[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:11.600]
and I had a little bit of this.

[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.820]
It said I didn't make it hot enough.

[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:13.660]
That's right.

[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:14.600]
You got to make it scalded.

[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.380]
Sure, so it's no foil.

[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.700]
Is that what it is?

[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:17.980]
Yeah.

[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:20.440]
It's making, it's melting the mucus.

[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:21.840]
Yep.

[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.500]
WQAM, all flim radio.

[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:24.800]
Hello.

[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:26.920]
You get sick every time you go on a trip.

[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:28.460]
You know, you don't go anywhere.

[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:28.880]
I didn't go anywhere.

[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.620]
I didn't go anywhere.

[01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:30.240]
I didn't go anywhere.

[01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:30.800]
It's a vacation.

[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.900]
Yeah, didn't go anywhere.

[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:33.600]
Stay home.

[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:34.380]
Okay.

[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.020]
All right.

[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:35.880]
Feel better.

[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:36.460]
Yeah.

[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:37.420]
Oh, yeah, thanks.

[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:39.260]
Whisperer.

[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.880]
What trip did I go on?

[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:41.820]
I go any trip recently?

[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:42.100]
No.

[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.680]
But there's another one.

[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.000]
No life.

[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.420]
He wants to live vicariously through mine.

[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.280]
I'm going to be taking a trip there on a couple of weeks.

[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.480]
I haven't decided where I have.

[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.120]
Maybe I'll come down there and settle all business.

[01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:58.060]
You know what I mean?

[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.120]
Yeah.

[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:01.440]
Hey, forward.

[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:02.740]
I'll drive the car.

[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:03.860]
Not that you would.

[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.400]
WQAM, hello.

[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.440]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.020]
Okay.

[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:10.900]
Hey, George, calling it a get the same sand off that big.

[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:11.720]
No, of course not.

[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:12.640]
Of course not.

[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.960]
I mean, who was funnier than him in the last 40 years?

[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:16.880]
I can't think of anybody.

[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:17.260]
Can you see him?

[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:17.860]
Supee sales.

[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.900]
And Sunny Fox maybe.

[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:20.400]
Right.

[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:21.820]
But not easy.

[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.520]
Ron, who's that?

[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:24.120]
It was great.

[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:24.900]
I know, yes.

[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:25.320]
Too bad.

[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.440]
We lost the legend there.

[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:27.180]
And now he's dead.

[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:27.620]
That's right.

[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.580]
And nobody is going to.

[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.020]
No, they get king last night.

[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.020]
He got the sign felt on there.

[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.440]
We didn't have a damn thing to say in that book.

[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:33.900]
Oh, that one.

[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.420]
I need to settle.

[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:36.560]
I'm going to trouble him.

[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:37.400]
All right.

[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.140]
I'm going to have to get that buddy.

[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:38.520]
You too.

[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:40.360]
Yeah, George Collins dead.

[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.620]
Tim Russell got 5,000 hours on TV.

[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.680]
And on NBC News last night, the last 40 seconds of newscast, they did George Carla.

[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.160]
I think Brian Williams is the antichrist.

[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.020]
Do you think that's possible?

[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:56.240]
It's possible.

[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.960]
I used to actually, I do watch that.

[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.240]
I'll admit that because of the three.

[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:03.900]
If I'm going to watch the news, I'm sure it's not going to watch Old Charlotte Gibson.

[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.900]
And they're right wing news in ABC.

[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:08.080]
I'm definitely not going to watch Katie Kurik.

[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:08.940]
I mean, that's a given.

[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.020]
So that's what I got left.

[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.520]
And then to find out he's a Rush Limbaugh, listening, loving, and calling in the right wing

[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.660]
lunatic, Brian Williams.

[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.020]
He should have died.

[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.660]
Now, I got to ask your technical thing.

[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:26.980]
Maybe even Chris, who's I noticed, has been sleeping all day.

[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:27.460]
What's up?

[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:32.000]
You know, I have this screen saber thing, the aquarium.

[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:40.680]
And lately, I get toolbar dot something.

[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:44.720]
And the middle part of it stays on a screen once in a while.

[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.440]
I have to click on that and then eliminate it.

[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:47.880]
Right.

[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.060]
Well, why is that?

[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.240]
The first thing to do is uninstall whatever toolbar that is.

[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:54.720]
What do you mean by that?

[01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:57.320]
I see there are Yahoo or Alexa or Microsoft.

[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.200]
One of these toolbars, it's like an extra.

[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.580]
I already clicked it out of there.

[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:00.900]
All right.

[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.860]
Well, in any event, it's not Alexa.

[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.140]
I don't have Alexa anymore.

[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.220]
Whatever it is, you install the bunch of saber from Alexa.

[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.140]
But going to ad remove programs, it's probably in there somewhere and get rid of it.

[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:12.980]
Really?

[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:13.360]
Yeah.

[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.400]
Very disconcerting.

[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.840]
You don't have to tell a mundo to go on your Canadian channel?

[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:18.400]
No.

[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.200]
Why is there naked people in there?

[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:22.320]
There's a whole bunch of shirtless muscle in there.

[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.300]
Young guys walking out in the sun.

[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:26.760]
Sounds really gay to me.

[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:27.120]
Yeah.

[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:31.420]
Maybe Steven Streets on there.

[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.380]
Maybe he is swimming through the streets of Miami.

[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:38.100]
Maybe.

[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.020]
WCWAM, hello.

[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.080]
Hello.

[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:41.820]
Yes.

[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:43.360]
Neil of Elvis.

[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.660]
What is it?

[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:45.380]
Neil.

[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.180]
Yeah.

[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:49.980]
Neil.

[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:49.980]

[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.220]
Is it Neil?

[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.500]
Want to say it again?

[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:52.980]
Yes.

[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:54.020]
Why do you?

[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:54.660]

[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:55.980]
How you doing, Bob?

[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:57.240]
Okay, what do you want?

[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.960]
Hey, you sound like you're a little bit under the weather there.

[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:01.020]
Yeah, under the weather.

[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:01.760]
Yeah?

[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:03.480]
You know what I think, though?

[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:06.600]
I'm listening.

[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.880]
I think you're okay, so I think think might be an exaggeration, but go ahead.

[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:16.880]
No, I think because you have walk-dragons and you know your engines in the rear, you might be suffering from menopause.

[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:17.860]
Yeah, okay.

[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:19.160]
WCWAM, hello.

[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.800]
Speaking of Larry King, did you notice his wife and drug rehab?

[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:23.400]
Uh-huh.

[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:23.800]
Really?

[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:24.600]
Yeah.

[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.220]
Who the hell could blame him?

[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:26.920]
Hey, who could blame him?

[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:27.260]
Hey, who could blame him?

[01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:29.700]
Larry must be on that biagra.

[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:30.520]
Uh-huh.

[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.160]
Can you imagine what do you want?

[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:33.740]
What am I on?

[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.920]
My cheer, the radio.

[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.400]
What do you want?

[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.880]
That's the same with the eye, Miss Guy.

[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:42.800]
Same guy.

[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:43.360]

[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:45.580]
The word King's boyfriend.

[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:51.720]
It sounds like I'm eating on here too bad because I am.

[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:52.860]
And I sound better now.

[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:56.080]
And I feel a little bit better from this wanting suit.

[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:01.440]
And what I should do is go in the other room and call to your Chinese place and get the hot and the sour.

[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:02.240]
That's right.

[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:03.880]
And I remember that call before.

[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.860]
Although most of the colors haven't been so hot, many have been very sour.

[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:07.300]
Mm-hmm.

[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.200]
737 on a pool.

[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.460]
We're going to go for 800 a day.

[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:12.520]
What do you say, Chris?

[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:13.840]
Sounds good to me.

[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.340]
Are you involved with us today or do you like Carolina?

[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.160]
Uh-huh.

[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.600]
Because you seem a little bit, I don't know.

[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:20.440]
Detached.

[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.560]
Well, it hasn't been much sweeter.

[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:22.660]
Try to put it on here, you know.

[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.060]
What do you mean by that?

[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.020]
Well, I've been...

[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:25.380]
What do you mean by that?

[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:25.440]

[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:25.940]
What do you mean by that?

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:25.940]

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:25.940]

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:25.940]

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:25.940]

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:25.940]

[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:25.940]

[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:26.280]

[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:26.520]

[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:26.820]
What do you mean by that?

[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.720]
Hey, I'm just enjoying what I'm having to talk to them first.

[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:32.500]
In other words, you screen the calls with Georgia's on.

[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:32.980]
See?

[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:33.540]
Damn, skip.

[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:33.980]
I hate that.

[01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:36.420]
I don't...

[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.200]
Hate it.

[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:38.120]
It does a great job.

[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:41.520]
Sorry.

[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.600]
I do a bad job.

[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:44.820]
Well, in that case, I let all the freaks in.

[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:45.820]
That's right.

[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:47.360]
He puts them on ahead of everybody else.

[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.620]
Somebody gets on first, like 5-10.

[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.720]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:52.620]
Daniel, calling because of gas prices,

[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:55.680]
if there was a shortage of gas, wouldn't they just ration it?

[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:57.580]
Yeah, there's no shortage of gas.

[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:58.080]
I did.

[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:59.520]
They got gas up the ass.

[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.440]
Yeah, because rationing would be the first thing that you do if you're sure.

[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:03.640]
Sure.

[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:04.420]
Mm-hmm.

[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:05.900]
Well, have a good day.

[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:06.860]
Okay, and you too.

[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:10.320]
Just a question to how much should they can squeeze out of us, that's all.

[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:16.220]
That's what happens when you put Van Der Bush in the White House.

[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:19.240]
The Saudis will put on the big-rolls squeeze.

[01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:24.400]
And those Dan Terbens van, you talk about wearing your Terbens too tight, good-god.

[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:29.100]
They are some of these smarmyist people.

[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.360]
I don't want to generalize, you know.

[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:34.600]
But the Saudis, that's where we should have just bond them into oblivion.

[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:37.200]
Am I right?

[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:38.480]
Newtron bombs would have been good.

[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:38.800]
You're right.

[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:38.840]
You're right.

[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.800]
People that leave all the buildings in the oil fields will leave it all the way.

[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:41.940]
That's right.

[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:42.380]
That's right.

[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.060]
Newtron bombs, man.

[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.300]
Nuked the Saudis.

[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:50.620]
That, anybody, any candidate who promises to nuke the Saudis gets my vote now.

[01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:53.940]
What the heck is the best out of us here?

[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.600]
If you like it, it's worth the $5.50 quam.

[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.100]
Maybe, fourth, leader.

[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.700]
I'll see more on mine.

[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:02.400]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.000]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.600]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.140]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.540]
Shailis has laid off the fence, made it.

[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.920]
He's got his education to win it.

[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.860]
They were getting too close to the towel, headed by the Saudis.

[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:27.860]
Textes for a father too again.

[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.100]
We're tortured, ma'am.

[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.100]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.740]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.440]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.820]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:46.120]
It takes all the stationers for free time.

[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.520]
Three thousand miles will never be a bench.

[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.160]
Push your brainwash, monkey.

[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.100]
Push your back too big.

[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.600]
You put them back in over the fence again.

[01:41:56.740 --> 01:41:57.440]
What the fuck?

[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:59.680]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.360]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:07.100]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.620]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:11.300]

[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.980]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:14.640]

[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:17.460]
Pushes the Saudi border.

[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.680]
What is your story, my boy?

[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.980]
What is your story, my boy?

[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.500]
It's about 16 to 5, 60 WQAM.

[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:32.580]
It's Head Cold Tuesday here at QAM.

[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.260]
I wonder if I have the only one who's going around.

[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.120]
I was at some allergy business that's a hit in me.

[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:38.500]
That's what this is.

[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:39.260]
Maybe this is allergies.

[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.500]
Although it did take my allegra.

[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.220]
I don't think so.

[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:44.220]
What allergies have to do with flim?

[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:45.540]
It depends.

[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.040]
I'm not wearing any.

[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:48.420]
All right.

[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:54.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, and even rising and singing the wireless line.

[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.200]
I said these calls today have been interesting.

[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.040]
You don't agree?

[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:01.260]
Interesting?

[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:01.640]
Sure.

[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.400]
I'm not arguing with that.

[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:03.860]
An interesting bunch.

[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:05.300]
WQAM.

[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:05.600]
Hello.

[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:07.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.480]
I have a request for you today.

[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:10.340]
Yeah.

[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:15.220]
There's an old bit used to play with a friend call with a lady.

[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:19.020]
She was trying to, they called her and she, her husband was cheating on her.

[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:22.460]
And she turned around and said that she was cheating on the husband.

[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:24.340]
Yeah.

[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.000]
Can you throw that for me?

[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:26.940]
Spouse or a rouse?

[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:28.180]
Yeah.

[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.040]
How much does it mean to you?

[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:33.900]
Million bucks.

[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:36.020]
Hello.

[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:36.840]
Miss Peterson.

[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:37.440]
Yes.

[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.580]
Hi, this is Bob Williams.

[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:39.700]
Down at Sirius Bob's boss.

[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:40.360]
Oh, hi.

[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:40.840]
How are you?

[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:41.500]
How are you today?

[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:42.000]
Fine.

[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:43.820]
Are you sitting down?

[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:44.560]
Yes.

[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:47.140]
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:48.340]
What do you mean bad news?

[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.820]
I understand that Bob's been with us for almost 20 years now.

[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:53.940]
Bob's okay, isn't he?

[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.260]
Oh, Bob's fine.

[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.180]
A little upset but fine.

[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:59.000]
He's been a good worker for us.

[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.500]
He's made all his quotas, his bonuses of all he's been in line.

[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.220]
But we're going to have to let him go.

[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:05.440]
What do you mean?

[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:07.180]
We're going to have to fire him.

[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.920]
And unfortunately being the boss sometimes you have to do things that you're not very pleased doing.

[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.460]
That's not very fair.

[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.180]
He's been very loyal to you.

[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:16.760]
Yes, he has.

[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:18.100]
That's like a slap in the face.

[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.240]
I can imagine you failing that way.

[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:22.180]
Absolutely, but.

[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:23.140]
Feeling that way.

[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:23.880]
You don't understand.

[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:24.800]
We just had a baby.

[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.260]
Yes, I do understand.

[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:27.480]
We have moved up the Union.

[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:28.720]
I understood.

[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.240]
This is a very hard time to do this kind of a thing.

[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.420]
I fully agree with you but there's something that's happened down here at the office that we can't do.

[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:36.300]
We can't overlook it.

[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.980]
It's an image problem and a problem that you might want to address yourself.

[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.020]
I don't know quite how to tell you though.

[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.580]
Why are you firing him?

[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:48.140]
Well, let's picture things like reason.

[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:48.880]
What could he do?

[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:50.240]
It's a little delicate.

[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:53.620]
Unfortunately, we found him on top of his desk making love to his secretary.

[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:55.260]
Oh, that's sort of a bit.

[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:58.420]
Well, I can understand you being upset at this point but.

[01:44:58.620 --> 01:44:59.840]
That is not the word.

[01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.700]
That stupid rotten sort of a bit.

[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:02.680]
I can't believe this.

[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.300]
Well, he's going to need your support through this.

[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.280]
My ****!

[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:08.840]
Right now, he's on his way home to you and he eats with me.

[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:09.940]
On his way home to me.

[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.940]
He's got another thing coming when he gets home.

[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.140]
I'm going to change the locks on the door.

[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.500]
I'm throwing his **** outside on the front lawn.

[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:17.720]
He can just have it all off.

[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:20.060]
I'm not even going to be here when he gets back.

[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:20.920]
That's sort of a bit.

[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:24.840]
And now, now, I don't feel so bad about **** his brother.

[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:27.500]
Right, George Collin would tell you the words but he's not here anymore.

[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.720]
All those bleeps that we had in that bit.

[01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:31.200]
We're still okay.

[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.260]
Then I just played that last week, I think.

[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:34.880]
I think he did. That's why they were positive.

[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:38.840]
So, on my team at 560 WQM, it's fresh in his mind.

[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.840]
And pound 560 and the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.

[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.080]
A lot of open lines under here.

[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.800]
Right, man. It's really slim and grim.

[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:49.660]
I mean, you come pound the fact that it's this time of the year

[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:51.580]
and then also wait out on that defect that, you know,

[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.720]
a 90% of the audience is going on this station.

[01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:57.440]
And those two things don't contribute to a healthy phone call environment.

[01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:59.140]
How about you QYM? Hello?

[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:00.960]
Peter Bolio.

[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.320]
You see what I mean?

[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.320]
Oh, that was it. That was our call.

[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:07.580]
Here I'm under the weather.

[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:09.440]
They keep saying that under the weather. I hate that.

[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:11.560]
Got a little head cool.

[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.040]
Okay, with some flim. That's it.

[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.200]
Not going to die yet.

[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.360]
You don't have to have like 700 hours like for Tim Rossert

[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.700]
or four minutes like for George Collin.

[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:24.140]
I still say Archie Bunkard, Carol O'Connor,

[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.500]
was more significant than either one of them

[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:28.080]
in terms of American culture.

[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.380]
Man, I'm putting down George Collin. He was great.

[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:31.800]
But not even close.

[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:34.940]
Yeah, but how was he as an interviewer?

[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.280]
Anyway, he was pasty-faced. I'll say that.

[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:40.960]
And he was Irish.

[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:44.320]
How come he didn't get all those of Kudos from Chris Matthews?

[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:48.220]
All that Irish cat like spew them that they were spewing.

[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:50.980]
WQAM, hello?

[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.840]
When you read the newspaper?

[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.700]
WQAM, hello?

[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:55.420]
I knew.

[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.140]
Yes.

[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:57.860]
Did I hear you, David?

[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.700]
You'll be called under the...

[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:00.740]
Oh, what?

[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:07.240]
pound, 5, 60, and they've rising and singing to wireless line.

[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.780]
These must be your leftovers from yesterday.

[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.080]
The ones that you wouldn't let us out.

[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.660]
Yeah, Christian put them for 30 seconds.

[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.720]
Ah, Christian put them through to you.

[01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:15.900]
They could only have helped.

[01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:18.360]
WQAM, hello?

[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.180]
Hey, Neil.

[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:21.600]
But you're feeling better.

[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:22.640]
Yeah, me too.

[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:25.000]
Stay away from the dairy products.

[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:26.540]
More plant production.

[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:27.740]
How is that what it is?

[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:28.400]
Yep.

[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:30.080]
Okay, I'll go with my screen.

[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:31.300]
No cheese, no milk.

[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:32.120]
Mm-hmm.

[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:34.300]
Lot of water and some red...

[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:36.660]
Red phone call.

[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:37.740]
No, yeah.

[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:38.680]
Okay, like this one.

[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:39.900]
WQAM, hello?

[01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:42.580]
QAM?

[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:43.500]
Neil.

[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.220]
Yes.

[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:45.640]
Thank you for taking my call.

[01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:47.260]
Well, thank you for making your call.

[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:48.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:51.940]
I have some friends over here that would like to hear that chromarty bit

[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:52.460]
where he called.

[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.660]
Well, I don't want to hear it.

[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.780]
Well, that crap about I got some friends over here that want to hear.

[01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:58.220]
They aren't here.

[01:47:58.260 --> 01:47:58.600]
Come on.

[01:47:58.700 --> 01:47:59.240]
Cut the crap.

[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:00.740]
Cut the garbage.

[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:06.000]
Call and say something when, when in God's name,

[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.380]
is it going to ever sink into the South Florida audience?

[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:10.140]
Not just on this show, but just in general.

[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.360]
It almost makes me long for the old W's News days.

[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.420]
Hello, Neil.

[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:17.660]
I got such a headache, Neil.

[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:19.980]
Those days.

[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.280]
Back to dawn.

[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.260]
I have blue lips.

[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.180]
Back to dawn.

[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.460]
At least, at least they called and they said something.

[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:30.240]
Not just, you know, try to be a major shoulder ass to the world.

[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:31.320]
You know what I mean?

[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:31.880]
Mm-hmm.

[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:35.160]
And often they would show their ass to the world without even trying.

[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:42.740]
Hound 5, 60.

[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:43.640]
They've arisen in wireless.

[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:44.940]
What is it?

[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:45.900]
Sink it or wireless line.

[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.020]
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:47.800]
I'm so incoherent.

[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:50.880]
Although I only did take a, what were those I told you I took?

[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:53.000]
Ben, Ben, what is it?

[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:53.660]
Ben a dreaded wall?

[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:55.720]
Ben Wacoate, yeah.

[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:56.100]
Okay.

[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860]
How many QAM?

[01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.100]
Hello.

[01:48:58.900 --> 01:48:59.520]
Hi, Neil.

[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:00.280]
Yes.

[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:01.940]
Two questions, two things.

[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.260]
You remember this guy Bob Grant, he was on radio.

[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:05.600]
Yeah.

[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:06.180]
Uh-huh.

[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:08.540]
And he was a city of two pay.

[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.620]
But he was a pretty nasty guy, the bright guy.

[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.280]
But one Friday, the last Friday of every month for a while,

[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:17.640]
he let people call him and dump on him.

[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.920]
Or, uh, unmercelessly.

[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:21.960]
He got nasty for about a year.

[01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:25.680]
It was really fun on the last Friday of every month he could call

[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.700]
and he just dumped away on the guy.

[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:30.300]
I think he maybe you want to try that.

[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:31.060]
No.

[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.040]
And the other thing is the last caller or one of them

[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:38.340]
that had that, he played that recording of the woman,

[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:43.500]
you mean she was screwing the husband's brother?

[01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:48.140]
And she made a big scene about him supposedly screwing.

[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:49.900]
Oh, God.

[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:51.100]
Too old.

[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:52.880]
Now, why did you put him on here, Chris?

[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.460]
I'm sorry, I won't do it.

[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.620]
He's older than Matino's great grandpa, okay?

[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:57.160]
Okay.

[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:58.800]
Remember Bob Grant?

[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:00.620]
What about the long John Neville?

[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.440]
Remember him or a vase mayor?

[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:08.180]
That's one thing about talking to the top-floor audience makes me feel.

[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:09.640]
You make me feel so young.

[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:12.060]
I do, I feel like I'm a teenager again, almost.

[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.520]
Older than dirt than sawdust.

[01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:19.300]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:20.300]
Hey, Neil.

[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:23.640]
You see, I think it's a good idea that George has his cold screen.

[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:25.600]
I don't really care what he does.

[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.700]
It's his call.

[01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:27.300]
What do I do?

[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.580]
No, it affects your show because it's hard to show.

[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.220]
No, it doesn't affect my show at all.

[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.080]
I tune out when George is on and then I forget the fact that he's on the show.

[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.640]
Well, they said, so what difference does it make?

[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:36.520]
You're not listening anyway.

[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:37.900]
What do you care what he does with the calls?

[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:40.900]
I care because I care a lot about you, Joe.

[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:42.740]
Why is that?

[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.460]
Well, you're a legend.

[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:47.040]
You know, where is there not many things in Florida?

[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:49.200]
I think what you, let me try to interpret what you're saying.

[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:49.900]
I have no idea.

[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:50.680]
That's it.

[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:52.100]
Isn't that it?

[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:52.720]
Yeah.

[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:53.520]
There we go.

[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.060]
I got him.

[01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:57.660]
What tell the wife here what George does?

[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:03.340]
If I ever, ever, once in all these years told you to do this, do that, and don't talk about it.

[01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:03.740]
No, never.

[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:04.480]
No, never.

[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:06.280]
When you're on there, I'm just glad you're doing it.

[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:09.180]
That song, we have the continuity of the show going and you're doing it.

[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:09.620]
Thank you.

[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:12.260]
Okay, took care of you.

[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.180]
What do I care?

[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.920]
Whatever works for you more power to you.

[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:22.880]
And I don't play me for a screen in the call.

[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:25.340]
Hey, just those four of you talking homosexual stalkers.

[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.560]
If I had any brains, I would do the same thing.

[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:32.020]
But then again, poor fat Chris, he, oh, geez, he's going to make me screen him too now.

[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:33.000]
I think it might make him lose weight.

[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.640]
Fat people don't want to lose weight.

[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.280]
Fat people want to be lazy and they want to be fat.

[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:42.680]
He seeks the best of us.

[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:46.300]
He's a Roger, a Sportler, a 5.62 AM.

[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.040]
The fourth leader.

[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:51.460]
Years of drug abuse and controversial rehabilitation.

[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:56.700]
Each boy, Brian Wilson, is ready to release a collection of his latest compositions.

[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.720]
Thanks for granting us this interview, Brian.

[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:03.620]
Brian, do you have any idea how retarded you sound?

[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:06.560]
Let's do it now.

[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:07.480]
Show you what I mean.

[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:11.820]
Here's how you sounded back in 62 from this early Beach Boy recording session.

[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:15.280]
Hey man, did you like it?

[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:18.080]
Did you hear it?

[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:18.960]
No, I didn't.

[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:20.320]
I hear it.

[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:21.800]
Man, okay.

[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:24.180]
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, listen.

[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:29.760]
Do you like it?

[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:31.400]
Oh, that's very nice, Brian.

[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:37.220]
Do you like it?

[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.960]
It's a little hard to dance too.

[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:44.340]
Do you like it?

[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:46.180]
Yeah, very nice, Brian.

[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:50.440]
The Brian Wilson collection of burned out compositions.

[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.640]
Do you like it?

[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:52.820]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:53.820]
That's great.

[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.920]
Mastered coffee available now on eBay.

[01:52:58.200 --> 01:52:58.980]
Do you like it?

[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.560]
Well, I've got to be going there.

[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:06.160]
Do you like it?

[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.640]
1230 or 560 WQM, you want to get really depressed?

[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:10.980]
I just found an article on here.

[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.280]
I'm sorry that my voice keeps quiet.

[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:13.040]
That's right, it's so bad.

[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:14.320]
Is it really?

[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:14.860]
Yeah.

[01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:19.740]
Most Americans believe that angels and demons are active in the world.

[01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:22.760]
And nearly 80% think miracles occur.

[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:25.160]
That's like what Futsi said.

[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.920]
If anybody listens to the show, it's a miracle.

[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:30.000]
How do you like that?

[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.380]
80% believe in miracles.

[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:38.020]
Like this kid in the...

[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.080]
Where was it in the Everglades?

[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:42.080]
Where ever the hell he had his alligator chewed his arm off?

[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:43.880]
Do you see that?

[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:44.280]
Yep.

[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:47.700]
And he thanked God for saving him.

[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.180]
Well, should the elevator thank God for the meal also?

[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:54.520]
The elevator?

[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:55.740]
The alligator.

[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:56.600]
You said elevator.

[01:53:56.860 --> 01:53:57.280]
Maybe I did.

[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:58.480]
You heard what he said?

[01:53:58.560 --> 01:53:59.380]
Chris, he said elevator.

[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.400]
Too much bad drugs.

[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.400]
Yeah, well, he never did.

[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:02.280]
There was a good drug, really.

[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:03.220]
I think that the...

[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:04.180]
I think that the...

[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:06.880]
Nuck Doctor chopped off more than just your nuts.

[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:08.080]
Don't cut!

[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.980]
5607, so how was it?

[01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:10.900]
It was painless, you said.

[01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:12.100]
It was...it was painless.

[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:14.120]
George said it was less painful than doing the show.

[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:14.860]
That's right.

[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:16.500]
Which isn't so much.

[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:18.020]
And WQM.

[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:18.400]

[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:19.460]
QAM, huh?

[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:20.500]
Yeah, let me know.

[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:20.860]
How you doing?

[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:21.440]
Okay.

[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.440]
I'm trying to get my girlfriend listen to Radio Station.

[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:28.460]
She doesn't understand what she's talking about.

[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:29.480]
Can you explain, please?

[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.380]
No, I'm...

[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:30.840]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:31.920]
Yeah, I'm sorry.

[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:32.480]
You're a real douche.

[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:33.580]
Uh-huh. Great.

[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:36.240]
5607, I hope that your girlfriend's very impressed.

[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:38.380]
5607, 0560.

[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.940]
And 0560 by...

[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:42.700]
If a wife isn't, she'll get a wireless line.

[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:46.060]
That was just out of spite that I hit the jump right there.

[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:46.960]
Yep.

[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:48.240]
So, it was girlfriend.

[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:52.220]
I'm sure she's already unimpressed when she sees those minuscule goods

[01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:53.440]
that he's brandishing.

[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:55.340]
Very unimpressive.

[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.020]
WQM, hello.

[01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:58.380]
Deal.

[01:54:58.860 --> 01:54:59.100]
Yes.

[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:00.000]
How are you?

[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:03.220]
I got an email about some facts about Congress.

[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:05.240]
Do I think about 30 seconds if you'd allow me?

[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:07.280]
Well, if I'd allow you what to read it?

[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:07.680]
Yeah.

[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.020]
It's just some facts.

[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:11.920]
It says 36 had been accused of spousal abuse.

[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:12.740]
Yeah.

[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:14.060]
They haven't been arrested at all.

[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:14.700]
Yeah, they all suck.

[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:15.140]
We know it.

[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:15.720]
Okay, it's boring.

[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.540]
God, almighty, some of you people get a life.

[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:20.320]
I have no life.

[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:22.980]
See, there's something that I really think I need to explain

[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:24.300]
to a lot of you folks out there.

[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:25.980]
And that is life is short.

[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.140]
Make out of it what you will.

[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:31.760]
In other words, if you want to get all whipped up about things that you're not going to change,

[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:34.600]
that you can do nothing about, if you think you're going to save the war,

[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:37.720]
like I used to when I started doing these stupid shows, go right ahead.

[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.720]
Keep banging your head against the wall until it bleeds.

[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:43.700]
Or have a great time and enjoy every minute of every day.

[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:46.080]
Isn't that the alternative?

[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:46.840]
Yep.

[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.320]
Those are the choices.

[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.340]
Continue banging your head against the wall.

[01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:55.720]
And people like that who want to turn the show into a, you know, turn the clock back.

[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:56.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:57.720]
Let's save the world, Neil.

[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:58.100]
Come on.

[01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:58.840]
You can do it.

[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:03.260]
The world is a crooked, corrupt place.

[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:06.200]
Full of crooks, run by crooks.

[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.180]
And the rest of us mostly schnooks.

[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.440]
And remember one thing.

[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:13.820]
Most things ain't what they look like.

[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:15.720]
WQA M, hello.

[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:19.580]
Neil, please say the card of that guy ripping the bird.

[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:21.980]
Please what?

[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:25.540]
I had a card of that guy ripping the bird from like 20 years ago.

[01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:26.040]
No.

[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:29.700]
Let me ask you a question.

[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:30.680]
No, I'm too late. He's gone.

[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:31.820]
Ran away.

[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:32.900]
Like a coward.

[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:33.580]
Ran away.

[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:34.260]
Spineless.

[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:36.300]
Spineless, overgrown child.

[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:39.860]
I was going to ask him, does he have anything to say about anything?

[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:42.040]
No.

[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:43.460]
We're not doing requests all summer long.

[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:44.940]
This isn't going to be a request time.

[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:48.260]
These people have the opportunity.

[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:50.840]
Like I just had only moments ago to change the world.

[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.240]
Don't they?

[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:54.740]
Yep.

[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:55.700]
Do that.

[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:56.920]
Do it all for them.

[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.100]
Exactly what they want to do.

[01:56:58.240 --> 01:56:59.280]
Each individual person.

[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:00.640]
Do it custom-shot just for them.

[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:03.480]
You could change the world, sir.

[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:09.000]
But instead, you call here and make some stupid request.

[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:14.720]
For a bit that we've played 60 trillion times already.

[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:18.180]
You quizzling, you moron.

[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:18.700]
You fairy.

[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:20.020]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:22.200]
QAM, hello.

[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:23.560]
I'm a fairy.

[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.360]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:57:27.260 --> 01:57:28.280]
I love you Jackson.

[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:28.840]
I love you.

[01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:31.120]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.580]
I love you.

[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:34.740]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:35.340]
I love you.

[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:37.660]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:38.800]
That's it.

[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:40.580]
Now that was interesting.

[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:44.220]
And I'm the usual one.

[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:47.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, see.

[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.760]
I put the challenges to them to actually say something and they can't do it.

[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:50.400]
About anything.

[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:51.500]
Anything.

[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.580]
Make a cogent statement.

[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.480]
That's the challenge.

[01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.900]
Secure EM deal Roger Show challenge.

[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:01.860]
Can they do it?

[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:02.100]
No.

[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.000]
Will they ever do it?

[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:03.200]
No.

[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:05.260]
Have they ever done it?

[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:05.480]
No.

[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:06.040]
No.

[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:07.680]
You think what do you think?

[01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:08.500]
I don't think.

[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.580]
Do you have any cogent callers yesterday?

[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:12.400]
Maybe, but I can't remember.

[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:12.980]
Because you know.

[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:13.960]
What do you think Chris?

[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:15.820]
I think one.

[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:17.800]
Well, they're gonna count.

[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:19.560]
I mean, if you want me to count, that sounds like work.

[01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:20.720]
You believe me?

[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:21.520]
It won't be a high number.

[01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:23.420]
No, it's easy work.

[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:25.080]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:26.480]
Jamba?

[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:28.080]
QAM, hello.

[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:30.680]
Mata-dem-pam-pam-pam-pam-pam.

[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:31.960]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:34.920]
I was a top 5 bit for sure.

[01:58:36.460 --> 01:58:37.260]
WDQAM, hello.

[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.100]
I love Diana today.

[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.000]
QAM, hello.

[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:43.500]
Yes.

[01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:44.660]
Yes.

[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.480]
Russia wins the European soccer championship.

[01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:49.600]
They will win the World Championship in hockey.

[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:51.320]
And the locker is the same time.

[01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.100]
Who cares?

[01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.480]
Thank you.

[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:54.540]
You're welcome.

[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:59.300]
I guess he thought that that was a cogent comment.

[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:01.640]
That was very perspicacious with that.

[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:02.720]
Nobody cares about soccer.

[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:03.660]
Don't you understand that, sir?

[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:05.320]
Oh, there are a lot of people who care about it,

[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:06.280]
but not in North America.

[01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:09.320]
We got a soccer team here at Toronto.

[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:10.480]
I forget what they're called.

[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:13.180]
Do I share about them?

[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:13.480]
No.

[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:15.880]
In fact, as you drive on a gardener,

[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.320]
right past a Rico Colosseum,

[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:18.580]
whatever that stupid stadium is,

[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:20.060]
when you got that soccer game going,

[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:22.060]
it is Pac-Man Jam-Pact.

[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:26.260]
And you probably wonder why, don't you?

[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:27.160]
Why?

[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:29.900]
That's because we got all these foreigners here, man.

[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:31.160]
You know, like from all these other countries.

[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:31.820]
I don't know.

[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:33.060]
And that's true.

[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:36.000]
From Italy and from China.

[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.780]
Is China big in the soccer?

[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:38.700]
I don't know.

[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:39.220]
Oh, no idea.

[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:40.760]
Well, why not?

[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:41.640]
Because I don't know.

[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:44.040]
You're supposed to be our connection to the sports universe.

[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:45.620]
You're talking about soccer.

[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:46.540]
Oh.

[01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:48.320]
I'll ask my friend when he comes back.

[01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:49.760]
But I think they're just into eating dog.

[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:53.140]
The sports bank, the UAM tree.

[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:54.540]
UAM, hello.

[01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:57.860]
Neil, I've got something intelligent to say.

[01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.000]
Okay, I'm listening.

[01:59:59.160 --> 01:59:59.400]
I'm waiting.

[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:00.060]
I doubt it, though.

[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:02.580]
When that guy ripped the bird 20 years ago,

[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:05.360]
that was the greatest moment in radio history.

[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:06.340]
No, it was not.

[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:08.300]
Your show, please, did that part?

[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:09.280]
Oh, it wasn't even close.

[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.080]
And if you played it again, you'd be doing a service

[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:12.840]
all of America.

[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.620]
There are two chances of it.

[02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:17.420]
None and much like you can call 6000 times between

[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:19.340]
now and soccer's as so that it can happen.

[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:21.920]
Okay, can't you set an army for triumph?

[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:22.620]
Yeah.

[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:25.020]
FubbtqYM, hello.

[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:25.940]
Hey, Neil.

[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:26.720]
Yes.

[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:28.020]
I'm looking for your challenge,

[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.440]
but I have a question on the comment.

[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:32.000]
I want to know what you and Neil, I mean,

[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:34.660]
you and George think of the whole washboard drilling thing.

[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:36.020]
Because I'm kind of on a fence.

[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:36.980]
I really don't know what to think.

[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:39.860]
As long as the boats real stable, it's great.

[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:40.760]
Yeah.

[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:41.260]
You think?

[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:42.020]
Yeah.

[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:43.660]
Yeah, because I don't think it's going to be a...

[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:44.840]
Otherwise, you might crawl out.

[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:45.980]
And that's, you know, that's a problem.

[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:46.600]
Yeah.

[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:47.260]
I think you can get out.

[02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:48.920]
I say, keep the dentist at home as well.

[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:49.260]
I say.

[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:52.420]
FubbtqYM, hello.

[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:53.900]
Hey, Neil.

[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.000]
Josh, he's towards.

[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:57.700]
FubbtqYM, hello.

[02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.220]
You'll be the challenge.

[02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:01.060]
I doubt it.

[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:02.660]
I'll probably I'll live your ass punk.

[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:03.560]
FubbtqYM, hello.

[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:04.760]
Yes, Neil.

[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:08.340]
I have something that is a bit cogent, yes, and relevant.

[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:13.480]
It relates back to, yeah, I remember one time he did a remote out at the...

[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:17.320]
the Aventora Mall, the Ben and Jerry's there, I think, when it's open.

[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:17.920]
Yeah.

[02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:22.040]
And the guy, the manager, who set it up, his name was Andy Rothman.

[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:24.360]
Oh, yeah, Andy Rothman, that's cogent, yeah.

[02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:30.720]
How many years is this A-hold been calling with the same crap, you know?

[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:36.100]
With David Sugarman's mother and Andy Rothman and the same and Steve Stone and all those other

[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:37.860]
marginal faggots.

[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:40.280]
790 votes on the pool.

[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:43.900]
Most of the world's serious problems caused by religious fanaticism.

[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:44.340]
What?

[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:45.780]
466.

[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:46.320]
Uh-oh.

[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.040]
What's going on here?

[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:51.160]
All sorts of things popping up on my screen now.

[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:53.540]
Religious fanaticism.

[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:54.440]
466.

[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:54.820]
Money.

[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:55.480]
88.

[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:57.200]
Powered, 76.

[02:01:57.980 --> 02:01:59.040]
Greed 77.

[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:03.240]
Overpopulation 65 and stupid sports show 16.

[02:02:03.940 --> 02:02:04.620]
Of a 790.

[02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:05.580]
790.

[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.360]
Can't get more stupid than that.

[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.340]
What's the biggest name?

[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:12.420]
The best talent you've ever seen in the last year's sport.

[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:14.120]
The 5.60 QAM.

[02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:15.860]
The sport lead.

[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:20.700]
Oh no, once again, it's time to play.

[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:23.040]
Onshore in Jeopardy!

[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:32.620]
You have to be kidding me.

[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:33.300]
Money Alex?

[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:34.040]
Wow.

[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:38.980]
Oh Alex.

[02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:40.060]
Can you believe that?

[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:41.320]
I had never been to Jeopardy.

[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:43.500]
And now I know what I'm doing.

[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.580]
Oh this is a good experiment.

[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:49.740]
How about this one?

[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:50.680]
I'm not sure.

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:50.680]

[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.660]
Same thing.

[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:54.360]
No, no, that's the Kasma.

[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:55.520]
I'm Romanian.

[02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:56.680]
And I...

[02:02:57.720 --> 02:02:58.320]
Alright.

[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:04.460]
I think what I should do is take out all 6,000 discs and just go from 8Z and play them all.

[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.880]
What is that?

[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:19.020]
What?

[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:25.340]
Oh, that's me.

[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:27.040]
Alright.

[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:27.340]
Wow.

[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:28.560]
These are good.

[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:31.680]
I'm sure you're getting glad I came up with this idea.

[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:37.880]
The comedy police.

[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:39.840]
I'll try just a couple of them.

[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:41.340]
I think the whole disc will be...

[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.780]
What is that?

[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:49.740]
Dead air?

[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.880]
Hold it right there.

[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.680]
There's been a crime.

[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:01.960]
That's right.

[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:03.860]
I'm Lieutenant Frank Nuck.

[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:05.640]
And I'm Sergeant Joe.

[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:06.500]
Who's there?

[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:08.940]
Oh man.

[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.620]
Now I know why we never played any of those.

[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.160]
Well, I have to add all the good stuff from there.

[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.780]
Remember when we used to get the tapes every week?

[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:15.700]
Oh yeah.

[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.500]
I'm never good enough anymore.

[02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:19.680]
I beg your pardon?

[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.320]
But this is the ancient stuff.

[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:26.680]
Seven ideas and Chris's poll be they had no time at all.

[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:27.720]
I think we're in a time warp.

[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:31.780]
I think something just happened when I played that first interactive one there

[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:34.360]
and it just threw us back over the edge.

[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:36.200]
Like the edge of the toilet bowl.

[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:37.500]
Remember I was talking about that last week?

[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:40.260]
And you just prayed to yourself.

[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:41.760]
Oh please, get over that lip.

[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:42.680]
Get over the lip.

[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:45.360]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:47.620]
Get out of here, man.

[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:48.920]
QAM, hello.

[02:04:49.980 --> 02:04:51.800]
Who's the new coach for Tampa Bay in hockey?

[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:53.920]
What's the two of you?

[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:55.860]
I got a pet on it.

[02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:57.360]
Yeah, Barry Melrose.

[02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:00.300]
Wonderful, wonderful selection.

[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:01.640]
No, it's not.

[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:03.340]
You don't think so?

[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.260]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:06.940]
Hello, Gary Liu.

[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:07.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:09.880]
Hello.

[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:10.720]
Hello.

[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:11.840]
Yeah, get out with Neil.

[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:12.960]
Let me say it again.

[02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:13.520]
Yes, sir.

[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:14.100]
This is Neil.

[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:15.860]
Hey, I think you have food poisoning.

[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.940]
You must have hold a bad winny.

[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.560]
Ha, ha, wow.

[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:23.820]
56705, 60, 0.560.

[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:25.900]
And what, the challenge I laid down there they failed.

[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:27.280]
You failed.

[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:30.340]
So far, F minus.

[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:33.480]
That's the South Florida audience.

[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:34.080]
F minus.

[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:36.680]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:37.380]
Hi, Neil.

[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:38.120]
Yes.

[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:40.960]
Yeah, you know, you're totally right about how they stay.

[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:45.080]
We're not covering George Carlin's death, but what they'll give people's news.

[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:47.340]
Give like Tim Rothscher and Tim Pum.

[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:47.920]
Remember, Ann?

[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:48.420]
We'll solve it.

[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:49.060]
Remember that, ordeal?

[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:50.600]
4,000 hours.

[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:54.920]
Yeah, and like, you know, I'm driving around and I'm putting around on the stations.

[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:56.600]
All that nobody's talking about.

[02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:58.880]
And, oh, God, what's the guy doing?

[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:00.980]
All right, all right.

[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:09.480]
Just as well.

[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:11.400]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:12.120]
Liste, he worked.

[02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:13.720]
Neil, how you doing?

[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:14.340]
Okay.

[02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:18.180]
I just called to find out if you jumped on that cubby bandwagon.

[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:19.120]
No, I have not.

[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:20.600]
And you can call it every day from now.

[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:22.820]
It'll be just as boring as the first time you call it.

[02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:23.720]
And ask the stupid question.

[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:24.620]
Don't know.

[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:25.280]
Don't care.

[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:26.580]
Okay, sir.

[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:27.460]
Get a life.

[02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:31.980]
Isn't that sad?

[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:33.200]
No, that's his material.

[02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:35.380]
That's his idea of something cogent and material.

[02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:38.980]
That's a medley of all he's God.

[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:41.440]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:44.280]
Thanks, God, it'll be landing around.

[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:47.040]
Thanks, QAM, hello.

[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:47.840]
Yes, thanks, God.

[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:49.560]
Hello.

[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:50.280]
Yes.

[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:52.500]
What happened to your voice?

[02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:53.580]
Did you have a sex change?

[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:54.940]
Yeah, I had a sex change.

[02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.320]
I'm wearing an uneven gown.

[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:56.960]
Yeah, a pink one.

[02:06:57.220 --> 02:06:57.440]
That's right.

[02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:58.340]
Hang up real fast.

[02:06:58.500 --> 02:06:59.340]
That always works real good.

[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:01.320]
Run away like a child, even though it's on the phone.

[02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:02.880]
That's the good part.

[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:04.900]
Hang it up real quick.

[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.380]
That makes it much more effective, isn't it?

[02:07:07.380 --> 02:07:07.480]
Yep.

[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:13.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the upper rise in the singular wireless line.

[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:16.020]
I think that sounds pretty good considering how crappy I feel.

[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:17.420]
Sounds fine.

[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:19.900]
And even the other yodeling, I think that's extra funny.

[02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:24.700]
The yodeling is no extra charge, but although jolly joe fat ass jolly joe will have to...

[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:25.700]
I'll put that on my...

[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:28.300]
I'll put the old Eddie Arnold songs on there and you can yodel along.

[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:29.060]
Oh boy.

[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:31.360]
WBQAM, hello.

[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.540]
Charlie Krins, I am.

[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:34.200]
Hello.

[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:35.480]
QAM, hello.

[02:07:36.920 --> 02:07:37.900]
We're back.

[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:39.860]
WBQAM, hello.

[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:44.020]
Yeah, let me have you here when jolly joe belgium has put you around the line up.

[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:45.700]
That's actually horrendous.

[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:47.620]
Call him up and ask him.

[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:48.700]
All right.

[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:49.220]
Thanks.

[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:50.400]
Let us know.

[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:52.580]
WBQAM, hello.

[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:55.220]
I hate the hell you doing.

[02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:55.900]
Okay.

[02:07:56.860 --> 02:08:00.580]
I'm a problem with the work gloves and my rectum and this working on removing...

[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:01.600]
Well good.

[02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:02.860]
Okay, stick it away in there.

[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:03.120]
Deep.

[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:04.980]
Okay, in fact, somebody's full would be good.

[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:05.300]
Rectum.

[02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:06.180]
It all went up to your neck.

[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:09.420]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound.

[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:10.960]
That's the in my rectum guy.

[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:12.360]
Everybody's got a name.

[02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:14.880]
And now we got the I hate the bird guy.

[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:15.600]
We got him too.

[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:18.620]
You know what I hate the bird?

[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.400]
I hate the bird guy.

[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:22.560]
Oh, you know what we didn't hear from today is the dime show.

[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:23.160]
That's the block guy.

[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:25.660]
WBQAM, hello.

[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:26.680]
Yeah.

[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:29.440]
Well, I've been through George Cunningham.

[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:30.340]
Dead.

[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:31.280]
Why?

[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:32.940]
I'm going to say it again.

[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:33.540]
More to.

[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:34.400]
Way.

[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:37.900]
WBQAM, hello.

[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:39.880]
Well, no.

[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:40.600]
Yes.

[02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:43.520]
Hey, I just came back from Amsterdam.

[02:08:44.260 --> 02:08:44.480]
Yeah.

[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:45.860]
What a great place.

[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:48.540]
I have to tell you, after years of listening to you,

[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:49.640]
I've been listening to you.

[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:52.280]
I've been listening to you.

[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:52.540]
I've been listening to you.

[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:52.540]

[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:52.540]

[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:54.940]
I was through free society should live.

[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:55.640]
Incredible.

[02:08:56.120 --> 02:08:56.260]
Yeah.

[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.660]
Well, they're starting to clamp down.

[02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.700]
They don't want to be too free or too, you know.

[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.720]
You guys seem pretty open to me and things.

[02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:04.700]
Everyone seemed rather happy to me there.

[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.980]
I just wanted to thank you for passing on that little pit.

[02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:08.520]
Thank you.

[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:09.680]
I'm glad you had a great time.

[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:10.420]
Hey.

[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:10.960]
Okay.

[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:13.300]
Doing.

[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:16.160]
56670560.

[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:16.400]

[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:18.240]
It seems to me I'm giving these numbers an awful lot today.

[02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:22.520]
And also it seems to me that this crawler space screen size

[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:22.620]
is a little bit more stable.

[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:24.400]
And it's not a control.

[02:09:24.580 --> 02:09:26.660]
Do you think maybe it needs to be reset or something?

[02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:27.640]
Reject.

[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:27.920]
Yeah.

[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:28.820]
Oh, yeah.

[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:28.940]
Oh, yeah.

[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:30.580]
And how do you do that?

[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:34.020]
Before the show, I'll walk you through several things

[02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:37.220]
that you can do because it could be any number of things messing with you right now.

[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:39.580]
What do you mean by that?

[02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.340]
The first of all, I think you have a toolbar installed on there

[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.360]
that you don't want to have on there.

[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:43.300]
Oh, no.

[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:44.900]
And so on.

[02:09:44.980 --> 02:09:45.740]
You don't have to pull it.

[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:46.020]
Pull it out.

[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:46.840]
By the way, Chris, nice going.

[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:47.280]
What?

[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:48.120]
Why thank you.

[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:50.080]
I'm installing that would be the first thing that you need to do.

[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:51.580]
I'm installing the toolbar.

[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.400]
The toolbar, whatever it is, we'll figure out what it is.

[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:54.460]
The crawler is the toolbar.

[02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:55.340]
I think that's what it is.

[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:55.540]
Whatever it is.

[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.520]
Give it all that stuff.

[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:57.580]
That's how creepy.

[02:09:57.820 --> 02:09:59.700]
Like putting playing cards on your bicycle spokes.

[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:01.200]
It doesn't do anything but make a lot of noise.

[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:01.900]
It's slow.

[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:02.600]
7QAM.

[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:02.900]
Hello.

[02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:05.000]
If you have a map of the way, do a shape.

[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:05.660]
I'm yet here.

[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:06.240]
2AM.

[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:06.540]
Hello.

[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:08.840]
What did I ever?

[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:10.620]
WDQAM.

[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:10.900]
Hello.

[02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:13.840]
Come on.

[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:14.540]
You can do it.

[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:16.260]
Meal.

[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:16.920]
Yeah.

[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:18.580]
Listen.

[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:19.520]
I want so many goods.

[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:21.020]
I really get to play that card.

[02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:22.080]
I'm all about to come and get out.

[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:22.980]
I'm just sticking.

[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:29.360]
Can I ask you a question?

[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:30.740]
I mean, it's a stupid question.

[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:31.960]
For I'll give you a stupid answer.

[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:33.340]
Why did they make the effort?

[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:35.160]
They know it's not going to get on.

[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:36.420]
Because they're beyond stupid.

[02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:36.820]

[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:39.040]
The stupidity can only explain so much.

[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:40.520]
And then you have to start taking insanity.

[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.240]
Or maybe I have no life.

[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.080]
That could be true.

[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:46.080]

[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:46.780]
To an insane level.

[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:48.320]
WDQAM.

[02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:48.620]
Hello.

[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:49.500]
I'm here.

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:49.500]

[02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:52.260]
QAM.

[02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:52.540]
Hello.

[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:55.760]
QAM.

[02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:59.380]
There's no signs of the Republican Party.

[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:01.480]
WDQAM.

[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:01.780]
Hello.

[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:02.800]
Hi, Neil.

[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:03.280]
How are you?

[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:03.980]
OK.

[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:04.760]
Good.

[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.080]
I was just...

[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:06.820]
I was...

[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:08.320]
You think you guys are on a break?

[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:09.280]
OK.

[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:12.960]
I went on to the George Rodriguez show on 790.

[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:15.360]
And then you called George Rodriguez.

[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:16.780]
There's no George Rodriguez.

[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:17.520]
Hold it.

[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:18.240]
Right.

[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:19.280]
The George Rodriguez.

[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:20.740]
The George Rodriguez show is not on 790.

[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:21.200]
I'm sorry.

[02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:22.200]
I'm sorry.

[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:23.520]
I know George is with you guys.

[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:24.720]
I meant I'm sorry.

[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:26.460]
I don't know his last name on 590.

[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:28.160]
The George Sedano show.

[02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:28.500]
Right.

[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:28.960]
I'm sorry.

[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:30.180]
I made a mistake.

[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:30.760]
Sorry.

[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:32.600]
But I listen to you all the time.

[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:33.760]
But...

[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:36.420]
And all they've been calling up and talking about is I'm...

[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:38.960]
Nobody's been talking about...

[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:41.340]
You know...

[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.200]
Sorry.

[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.840]
The guy that died yesterday.

[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:47.540]
What's his name?

[02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:50.320]
The guy...

[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:50.860]
The comedian.

[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:54.040]
And if you ever have a...

[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:57.000]
If you ever have a burial or anything or somebody died,

[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:58.900]
say, miss, just tune into Larry King.

[02:11:59.140 --> 02:11:59.520]
That's true.

[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:02.480]
So there's every show about everybody dying.

[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:03.740]
Yeah, I can't wait for him.

[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:04.300]
Yeah.

[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:06.680]
But it was a nice...

[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.020]
You guys have a great show.

[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:10.440]
You even know what they say.

[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:12.480]
OK, in spite of what they say, right?

[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:13.160]
OK, thanks.

[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:13.740]
You're welcome.

[02:12:13.940 --> 02:12:14.760]
Say hi to I'mus.

[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:18.200]
What else do I have to do with sports?

[02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:20.200]
They're talking about Don I'mus on 790.

[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:21.040]
What are they talking about?

[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:21.360]
Why?

[02:12:22.540 --> 02:12:24.740]
Because CNN is making a big stimulus about it.

[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:27.060]
And now Sharpen's opening up a big stupid mouth again.

[02:12:30.180 --> 02:12:30.540]
Yeah.

[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:32.220]
Is that why?

[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:33.160]
That's why.

[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:35.300]
And what does that have to do with Tim Russell?

[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:41.180]
And the guy that died yesterday, that comedian.

[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:42.440]
The guy that died, you know?

[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:48.520]
It's just like I said before, what I told you before is absolutely correct.

[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:49.140]
That is it.

[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.180]
It took me all these years to put my little finger on it.

[02:12:56.140 --> 02:12:57.880]
You have your choices in life.

[02:12:58.140 --> 02:12:59.820]
Make your choices and make smart ones.

[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:02.180]
OK, don't waste your time with Hazarai.

[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:05.480]
Got it?

[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:06.120]
Got it.

[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:08.900]
1255, a QAM.

[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:11.760]
It's the one to do our...

[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:15.320]
I'm telling you Moses was the wisest man.

[02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:16.940]
How are you, my sugarna?

[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:18.700]
Abraham was the wisest.

[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:20.140]
I'm telling you Moses.

[02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:21.600]
I say Abraham.

[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:26.400]
The whole men are joking and let us worse.

[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:28.320]
Amen to the earth.

[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:32.280]
After a hard day arguing religious law,

[02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:36.020]
these thirsty scholars aim for their favorite refreshments.

[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:38.820]
Israel Lightbeard.

[02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:40.320]
It's a bitch.

[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:42.060]
Israel Light.

[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:44.640]
Smooth as locks and green tea.

[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.080]
And it tastes great.

[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:47.480]
But last a feeling.

[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:49.600]
Last a feeling.

[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:53.820]
Israel Lightbeard.

[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:56.000]
The beer chosen by the chosen people.

[02:13:56.860 --> 02:13:59.260]
It's one o'clock at 560 W.K.M.

[02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:03.100]
George Collins, a greatest contribution to the one race was saying that religion is crap.

[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:03.820]
Right?

[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:05.500]
And he was...

[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:06.100]
I have no life.

[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:07.840]
And so will the correction.

[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:08.220]
Right.

[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:11.020]
Religion is crap.

[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:13.440]
And the American public, of course,

[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:15.800]
are keeping these surveys that I know the one on last night about.

[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:19.980]
The scary, the frightening number of Americans are wearing all these...

[02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:21.240]
...all these bull crap.

[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:25.600]
You know what any like supposedly civilized country like in Western Europe

[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:27.260]
and the percentage is teeny and tiny.

[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:29.480]
But in America, it's the God's squad, baby.

[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:30.840]
Yep.

[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:34.920]
And there's one word that comes to mind.

[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.420]
The sum of it all up.

[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:38.680]
If this thing will scroll.

[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:40.420]
But it's doing this thing again.

[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:42.660]
The thing I did the other day didn't work.

[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:44.980]
And you know what that word is?

[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:45.340]
What?

[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:45.900]
That's it.

[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:46.800]
He just heard it.

[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:47.580]
Stupid.

[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:54.240]
I mean, how stupid you have to be to believe all these bubble-mices written by...

[02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:58.500]
...bigoted, idiotic, uneducated, old, farts, men.

[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:00.560]
Thousands of years ago.

[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:01.540]
Very, very stupid.

[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:04.940]
You have to be an ignorantness as stupid as a working-class Republican.

[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:09.600]
56670560.560 and a Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:10.900]
This is the hour you've been waiting for.

[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:13.500]
This is the hour we solve all the problems of the human race.

[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:15.600]
Mike Siegel tried. He couldn't do it.

[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.320]
We're going to solve the problems of the medical profession, the legal profession, political, I am.

[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.700]
Talk about an 80's who took himself way too seriously.

[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:25.780]
Mike Siegel.

[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:27.640]
WQAM. Hello.

[02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:29.180]
Emil.

[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:30.120]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:35.920]
And Red, where there's a possibility that a pebble may run with Obama?

[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:37.080]
Yes.

[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:40.020]
I know that ever happened where a Republican and a Democrat have a...

[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:40.600]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:41.440]
I don't think so.

[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:46.520]
I think that all we need is for Lieberman to run the McCain and then he'll win for sure.

[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:47.660]
Bobo.

[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:48.080]
Hey.

[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:48.580]
Yeah.

[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:51.200]
He's the man.

[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.540]
Maybe he and the McCain can get married.

[02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:58.920]
Went over the gay marriage crowd between our election time.

[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:00.120]
They're joined its hip already.

[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:01.360]
I bet you they are doing something.

[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:02.220]
You think?

[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:03.940]
I'm sure they are.

[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:05.320]
I bet you they're doing it.

[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:11.740]
567-0560 and pound-560 in the Verizon and singular wireless line.

[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:13.040]
WQAM. Hello.

[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:15.560]
I just want to say thank you to George Carlin.

[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:16.560]
He helped warp me.

[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:18.380]
And that's about it, man.

[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:20.280]
I just want to say a rest of the peace wherever you're at, buddy.

[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:21.620]
And rest of the peace, tiny.

[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:22.200]
See you.

[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:32.580]
WQAM. Hello.

[02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:33.700]
Hey, buddy.

[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:34.720]
Yeah, buddy.

[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:35.580]
How are we doing?

[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:36.540]
Okay, buddy.

[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:37.400]
Killing Halley.

[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:38.980]
Hey, I do want to thank you.

[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:45.440]
You do show patients with, you know, taking these calls and eventually one or two good ones popping there, you know?

[02:16:45.980 --> 02:16:46.640]
Yeah, one wins.

[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:47.680]
I'm going to have a happy.

[02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:49.140]
Well, I'm trying to be one of those.

[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:49.940]
But I'm waiting.

[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:50.760]
Okay.

[02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:53.620]
I know I want to say what we're going to talk about.

[02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:54.520]
I'm like this.

[02:16:56.140 --> 02:16:57.840]
Well, what do you mean what can I tell you about him?

[02:16:57.900 --> 02:16:58.240]
He sucks.

[02:16:58.580 --> 02:16:58.880]
He does.

[02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:02.500]
I just heard back in the day you and him were competitive.

[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:08.480]
Even when he got in the car at 3 in the morning and put all his stuff in the car and drove off the Arizona, yeah.

[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:09.860]
I don't know.

[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:10.220]
I don't know.

[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:13.220]
I just want to see if you have some insight on it.

[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:15.100]
He's always going to keep doing a good work.

[02:17:15.620 --> 02:17:15.900]
Okay.

[02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:18.620]
That was going to be the good call.

[02:17:19.140 --> 02:17:20.160]
What's my take on Tom?

[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:20.920]
Don't like us.

[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:22.720]
Oh, well.

[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:23.820]
Oh, well, well.

[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:24.040]
It's right.

[02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:34.660]
I'm always a big fan of guys who, when the book comes out, they do so bad and they're so embarrassed that they toss all of their crap into their car and their old real happy and they hit the highway, you know?

[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:36.860]
That was a little time like this.

[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:37.780]
All the way he's syndicated.

[02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:43.420]
Everybody else who ever did a talk show in America has been syndicated except for.

[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:44.260]
Feel good.

[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.200]
But then again, pop that jenko.

[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:49.880]
Look what I got.

[02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:54.120]
Maybe if I call up that hot shot in Bokeh, you know, what's his name?

[02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:56.060]
Arthur Murray.

[02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:56.980]
Yeah.

[02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.600]
Oscar Levant.

[02:17:59.140 --> 02:17:59.240]
Right.

[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:02.800]
Hans Conn read.

[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:03.920]
That says.

[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:05.660]
Everybody Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:07.140]
Hey, Neil, are you ever happy?

[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:10.560]
Yeah, when I get rid of colors like you, I'm ecstatic.

[02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:13.160]
Everybody Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:15.820]
I'm sure this is Texas.

[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:16.460]
Uh-huh.

[02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:17.360]
Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:18.400]
Nice call.

[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:20.200]
Hello.

[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:21.060]
Hello.

[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:21.320]

[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:21.440]
Yep.

[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:22.200]
Funny voice.

[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:22.580]
Hello.

[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:24.160]
Is it?

[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:25.340]
No, is it real?

[02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:26.120]
Yeah.

[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:26.980]
Funny voice.

[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:32.680]
Every time I see a push, I think of Fredo.

[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:35.740]
Yeah.

[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:37.820]
Am I right wrong?

[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:38.940]
You think of what?

[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:40.120]
Fredo.

[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:40.880]
Fredo?

[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:41.260]
Yeah.

[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:42.800]
You know.

[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:43.860]
Yeah, I know.

[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:45.320]
Do you know?

[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:46.780]
Do you know?

[02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:47.780]
The way to San Jose?

[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:49.140]
Get on the road and go there.

[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:51.780]
Don't ever call us again, Schmuck, with a funny voice.

[02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:54.820]
In fact, maybe that was his real voice.

[02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:56.320]
Or there's the I'm a story American.

[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:57.840]
Unbelievable.

[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:01.700]
Talk about beating a dead horse, my God.

[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:02.400]
It's just unreal.

[02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:05.240]
And what are these?

[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:07.920]
One of these militants, farches like Al Sharpe,

[02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:09.220]
are we going to give it a rest already?

[02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:11.320]
Just nitpicking.

[02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:13.220]
Just looking desperately to find something

[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:14.500]
that's going to get all bad out of a shape of a bot.

[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:17.260]
All the real stuff there is to get all whipped up about,

[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:18.260]
that's one thing, you know.

[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:21.220]
But it requires some effort to change that.

[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:27.740]
And CNN is obsessed with a story again.

[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.300]
Obsessed.

[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:30.760]
You think they were, the fact that nobody even knows

[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:32.640]
where to find his show much less listened to him anymore.

[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.740]
You think that they would surprise.

[02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:34.800]
That's not good enough.

[02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:37.800]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:39.600]
Can you play Wayne Stomp?

[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:40.320]
No.

[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:41.280]
No chance.

[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:42.700]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:44.500]
You know, he won't quit.

[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:45.380]
I'm not a quitter.

[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:46.100]
Well, good.

[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:46.780]
You should.

[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:48.400]
That would be a good idea.

[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:51.200]
Don't quit just end the pain for everybody

[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:52.140]
for the whole human race.

[02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:53.900]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:54.940]
Hello, Neil.

[02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:55.820]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.280]
Just call it, you say there.

[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:59.680]
There's still some halfway normal people out in Miami.

[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:01.400]
Well, listen to you and George.

[02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:03.940]
And I hope you feel much better, sir.

[02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:04.840]
You have a great day.

[02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:06.060]
Okay, thanks.

[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.400]
Have a cold, you know.

[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:11.800]
I mean, I appreciate your sentiments.

[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:14.100]
If I have a head cold, not dying.

[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:15.320]
I'll have some terminal disease.

[02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:17.640]
I don't have like a big tumor in my ass or something like that.

[02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:18.700]
I just got a head cold.

[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:19.420]
Room, you kiss.

[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:20.460]
Little scratchy throat.

[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:22.580]
These things will pass.

[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:24.120]
Like a gallstone, you know.

[02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:25.000]
These things will pass.

[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.120]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:20:28.940 --> 02:20:29.400]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:30.900]
W-D-Q-A-M, damn, they're killed them.

[02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:34.620]
How do you like that?

[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:36.120]
Wow.

[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:38.600]
That's in my exactly my sentiment.

[02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:40.740]
We both reacted precisely the same way.

[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:42.680]
Wow, wow, wow.

[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:44.960]
We only had to wait a little over three hours for it.

[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:45.680]
That's correct.

[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:49.300]
Well, these are the calls that we were always looking for, you know.

[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:50.740]
People with something of substance.

[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:53.560]
Something concrete, something to say.

[02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:56.140]
About anything.

[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.240]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:57.820]
How are you doing?

[02:20:58.160 --> 02:20:58.420]
Okay.

[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:00.700]
How could you say it is so gone?

[02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:01.560]
When?

[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.300]
Who made the earth and who made all the people in it?

[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:08.060]
Yeah, who made all the objects?

[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:09.520]
Yeah, dummy.

[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:10.500]
Dummy.

[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:11.440]
Dummy.

[02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:12.740]
That's me, old dummy.

[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:14.220]
Who made it?

[02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:17.320]
Who made Uranus?

[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:19.320]
N-Venus.

[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:20.460]
N-Rs.

[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:20.760]
Your mom?

[02:21:21.620 --> 02:21:22.580]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:25.180]
I didn't even punch it up yet.

[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:28.860]
I think I'm starting to have a reflex.

[02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:30.620]
You know what I mean?

[02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:31.940]
Now the reason my hand isn't...

[02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:32.600]
Oh, I want to.

[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:33.840]
Or sometimes you just double tap.

[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:35.160]
A twitch, you, I am, hello.

[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:38.400]
I wish George Collin was still alive and you were dead.

[02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:39.500]
Oh, great.

[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:40.260]
Thank you.

[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:41.260]
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:43.420]
My, I'm Go.

[02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:45.020]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:46.700]
Yeah, hey, Neil.

[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:47.960]
This is Rosemary from Pompano.

[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:49.680]
This will be your call of substance.

[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:52.940]
I want you to use the word first vocation today.

[02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:55.880]
And it's the other day I read it to paper.

[02:21:56.060 --> 02:21:57.360]
It was the first time I ever heard that word.

[02:21:57.500 --> 02:22:01.380]
It was an article about baby Alex about how this...

[02:22:01.380 --> 02:22:04.380]
Malve told people not to vote for John McCann because he said he's going to be...

[02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:06.940]
And I racked for the next 100 years.

[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:08.480]
That was a woman with a newborn baby.

[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.700]
She said this baby...

[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:10.720]
I've seen this guy.

[02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:10.900]

[02:22:11.380 --> 02:22:12.520]
And you're not getting him.

[02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:13.720]
You know, he's not going to go.

[02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:16.680]
So then it went on to say how wrong she was, you know,

[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:21.300]
about baby Alex will never have freedom in this country unless we say in my rat.

[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:26.640]
So was any use the word that she was percured and I looked at up the dictionary

[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:28.340]
and have the occasion understanding.

[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:30.760]
It seems like a little contrary to me.

[02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.600]
So I forget what contact he used in.

[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:36.100]
Oh, my phone's ran. Talk to the lady, George.

[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:38.040]
Oh, hey, lady, how you doing over here?

[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:40.340]
He just does this all the time.

[02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:41.700]
What's the name?

[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:43.100]
Rosemary.

[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:44.720]
Hey, hi, I wrote how you doing Rosemary.

[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:48.160]
He doesn't care about the show anymore.

[02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:50.840]
Are you the same Rosemary that we met at one when we were doing an appearance over there?

[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:55.360]
When we were doing an appearance, are you the same lady?

[02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:57.160]
He came by the table and said, hi.

[02:22:57.160 --> 02:23:00.940]
No, no, no, I haven't worked here since 2005, but when he used to go in there.

[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:02.800]
Or get him and just sit tight and he'll be right back.

[02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:04.640]
I'm sure he wants to finish the conversation.

[02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:06.060]
I'm sure he's going to finish the conversation.

[02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:09.860]
Yeah, I'm trying to get to the end of the word first vacation.

[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:10.580]
Yeah.

[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:13.960]
I was telling me all that the article on the paper and it said the woman with first vacation.

[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:18.880]
But it seemed a little contrary to me because they were trying to say that she had no understanding

[02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:20.760]
of why we should be.

[02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:22.140]
All right, I'll listen. Have a great day.

[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:30.980]
9 minutes after 1 at 5.60 now, this thing with the screen saver is starting to give me.

[02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:33.140]
And look at that. It left that little thing in the middle again.

[02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:39.860]
Yeah, C tool bar, EXC tool bar, that's crawler tool bar.

[02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:43.120]
I don't want it.

[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:44.660]
I'll get rid of it.

[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:49.380]
My first order of business at 2 o'clock this afternoon, you're rid of the crawler tool bar.

[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:50.100]
All right.

[02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:53.800]
Now what was she battling about purspacations?

[02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:54.120]
Yes.

[02:23:55.640 --> 02:23:57.680]
I think that was my friend from Pompo no Park.

[02:23:57.680 --> 02:23:59.880]
You know, she had called a few days ago, remember that?

[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:00.440]
Mm-hmm.

[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:01.100]
That was enough.

[02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:05.380]
10 past 1 a.k.a. and we got the jerk show coming up at 2 o'clock.

[02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:07.060]
Meal.

[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:07.900]
Yeah.

[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:10.840]
TV Nicks.

[02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:13.360]
The distinctive voice of Fleetwood Mac.

[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:15.640]
Her style is unforgettable.

[02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:18.640]
Her lyrics are intelligible.

[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:24.480]
I'll live now, I'll land the land, if I'll fail.

[02:24:26.140 --> 02:24:29.100]
I'll land the land.

[02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:34.200]
Cheeving's back with all your favorite hits on one big album.

[02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:35.660]
It's Cheeving X.

[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:37.700]
What the hell is she saying?

[02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:39.580]
It's Cheeving X.

[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:40.580]
It's Cheeving X.

[02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:52.720]
It's all her classics are here.

[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:57.260]
You'll get me, you'll get me, and the incomparable girl.

[02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:02.320]
Yeah, I'll live, and I'll land the land, if I'll fail.

[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:06.540]
I'll land the land, if I'll fail.

[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:14.600]
Kichitliy re-mumbled or stereo in audibility.

[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:16.500]
This is Cheeving X.

[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:18.360]
Her most marvelous.

[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:20.600]
Cheeving X.

[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:22.080]
What the hell is she saying?

[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:23.220]
Available now.

[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.580]
What incoherent representates.

[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:29.760]
What 15th-Snow I Hate the Bird, I'll say that.

[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:32.720]
Yeah.

[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:34.820]
Let me say it again.

[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:35.900]
That's no I hate the bird.

[02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:38.000]
No, it's no I hate the bird, I just said, yeah.

[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:42.220]
Oh, and his really police officer fatally shot himself in the head today.

[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:46.420]
During the airport departure ceremony for French President Nicolas Sarcosi.

[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:51.420]
Cheeving in assassination in 10 bodyguards quickly wished Sarcosi and his radio prime minister

[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:53.140]
it would all merge from the scene.

[02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:57.280]
Sarcosi's wife Carla Bruni Sarcosi rushed up the stairs.

[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.180]
A head of her husband who was quickly outshadowed aboard the plane by men in dark suits.

[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:07.460]
All-murred and Israeli President Chimone Perez were escorted to their cars.

[02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:09.140]
The incident was over within minutes.

[02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:16.160]
Police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld says there was no assassination attempt on the French leader

[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:20.400]
and other police officials of the shooting was a suicide and a third said it may have been accidental.

[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:27.620]
Police spokesman Shloy Misaigee said a policeman guarding the airport committed suicide while the band was playing.

[02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:29.540]
Justice Sarcosi was about to board his plane.

[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:35.600]
Officials said he shot himself in the head and the area police commander Niston Moore said the incident was being investigated.

[02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:38.220]
Hey, like that.

[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:40.740]
Maybe he just couldn't stand the way the band was playing.

[02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:42.460]
Maybe he doesn't like Sarcosi.

[02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:45.500]
Or maybe he just was getting nervous about all of them dead Palestinians.

[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:46.920]
Stuff like that. Who knows.

[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:48.180]
This face?

[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:50.060]
I don't know.

[02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:54.020]
828 on a full. You'll never make 900. I'll tell you that right now.

[02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:54.900]
Hey, you never know.

[02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:58.720]
850 though, it'd be pretty nice target there to shoot for.

[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:01.040]
It's 1.7 for 900. We can do it.

[02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:01.720]
I beg your pardon?

[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:03.520]
1.7 for 900. We can do it.

[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:04.540]
No chance. None.

[02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:05.820]
Half faith.

[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:11.080]
It's the middle of the summertime. It's the 24th of June. It's the dog days. Okay?

[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:13.780]
We're even going to finally sniff it.

[02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:14.220]
Never.

[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:17.120]
It's not what clearance told me.

[02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:19.000]
My name's Lathapiste.

[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:22.420]
He said if it's the last thing he does, he's going to get you to sniff it.

[02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:22.760]
Nope.

[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:27.640]
5.6705.60 and 0.560 and they've arrived in Singular wireless line.

[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:29.400]
Zillions are open lines on his.

[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:31.260]
Zillions. Yeah.

[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:35.080]
Maybe I'll have to bring in a helium.

[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:36.000]
Remember those days?

[02:27:36.100 --> 02:27:41.060]
Oh yeah. That was always good. That's bad for you.

[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:42.060]
Suck into material.

[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:43.960]
Or just suck into lunch.

[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:45.560]
Suck into lunch or kill you.

[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:46.320]
Q.A.M. Hello.

[02:27:47.260 --> 02:27:49.100]
Go to again, I'm new.

[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:49.780]
Yeah.

[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:51.100]
How bad voice again.

[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:53.420]
WQ.A.M. Hello.

[02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:54.640]
Hello.

[02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:55.380]
Yes.

[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:58.660]
Yeah, Neil George Cullen was great excitedly.

[02:27:58.660 --> 02:27:59.980]
Missy ripped religion. He ripped.

[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:01.920]
He was macho. Goons who watched sports.

[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:06.360]
He ripped Americans and consumerism and Republicans and basically

[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.560]
evening that deserves to be ripped and...

[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.700]
That's why we're not hearing too much about him now that he died.

[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:11.640]
Right.

[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:16.560]
What?

[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:18.300]
I don't know.

[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:20.460]
Do we have a failure to communicate there?

[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:22.120]
I think so. I didn't hear it.

[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:23.820]
I think he understood what I was trying to say.

[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:26.520]
He was anti-establishment.

[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:28.660]
But he was anti-allocrab.

[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:31.580]
And that's why they're not making a big stimulus about his death.

[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:35.900]
Tim Russell on the other hand was an establishment shield.

[02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:39.000]
And therefore he was a brilliant journalist and never still afraid to end.

[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:44.340]
And we do mourn and cry and just nash our teeth and have a nervous crap.

[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:48.740]
Look at that.

[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:52.580]
Nick Robertson says the airport in Kandahar is on fire almost an hour after.

[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:57.820]
There is an up surge in fighting at the moment that Taliban generally increased their level of...

[02:28:57.820 --> 02:28:59.640]
The Taliban. I thought we had the Taliban be.

[02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:01.600]
Don't ask, Ray. We wasted all that money in Iraq instead.

[02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:02.760]
I'm sorry. I forgot about that.

[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:04.760]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:06.000]
Neil.

[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:06.720]
Yes.

[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:09.480]
I went to stick my butt in the N-Round look.

[02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:10.980]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:17.640]
My uncle, Eagle Womit, told me to drink lots of alcohol and...

[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:18.640]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:20.260]
Hey, good morning. Hi. And you're here.

[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:21.140]
Good afternoon.

[02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:22.680]
Good afternoon. I'm here, right?

[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:29.360]
Did you have a seat in the New Yorker this week because I've got a 10-page article about Keith Overnman about how he got started?

[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:29.940]
What was different?

[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:35.060]
What he had is political leaning to very, very well-written order. He should definitely check it out.

[02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:36.100]
Okay.

[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:37.920]
Okay? And feel better, Neil.

[02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:38.820]
See you. Thanks.

[02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:42.180]
I got a cold.

[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.020]
I got a cold.

[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:47.140]
You know what I mean?

[02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:50.120]
It's not like some major issue.

[02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:54.220]
And I sound just fine if you ask me. I sound just like me. A little, a little horsey, you know?

[02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:55.160]
Mm-hmm.

[02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:56.040]
Like Big Brown.

[02:29:56.600 --> 02:29:58.440]
Like Big Brown going down.

[02:29:58.580 --> 02:30:00.980]
Whenever you know it isn't interesting. We never heard another word about that.

[02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:01.980]
Nope.

[02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:07.100]
Actually, scoured online to find some post-mortem for all of that business. And we never heard any more.

[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:07.520]
Nope.

[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:12.400]
So really makes you continue wondering exactly what the hell really went on there.

[02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:14.220]
The story behind the story.

[02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:16.420]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:19.360]
The game is right there, Neil. From Georgia.

[02:30:20.220 --> 02:30:21.000]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:24.620]
Group 3, you know. Group 3. Come on, actor.

[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:26.640]
Shaq.

[02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:37.720]
567, 0560, pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line. We're still waiting for the first person from South Florida today with something actually to say.

[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:42.180]
A statement, a comment, an observation, a something.

[02:30:43.620 --> 02:30:47.000]
Am I correct? Did I miss one? Was it one that actually... No, I don't think so.

[02:30:47.720 --> 02:30:51.000]
I mean, we're still a couple that were like on a borderline. You know, like the guy about I miss that.

[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:52.920]
I were about George Carlin.

[02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:55.860]
But I mean, that goes without saying.

[02:30:57.860 --> 02:31:00.720]
You know, the guy who died, whatever his name was, the guy who died.

[02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:01.060]
Is it a brother?

[02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:03.260]
No, not that one, the other comedian.

[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:05.060]
Buddy Hackett.

[02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:06.300]
Yeah, that one.

[02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:10.060]
That's the way you're pretty compo. Good afternoon.

[02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:14.380]
When the... Call it that, and it's due to the themselves. Are they called, Halley Wackers?

[02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:16.920]
Oh my God. It's a Woody.

[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:18.320]
Hey, but I got a Woody.

[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:19.560]
Uh-huh. A Woody.

[02:31:20.260 --> 02:31:21.180]
I have no life.

[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:22.600]
Very, very sad.

[02:31:22.980 --> 02:31:25.460]
And of course, that's an area where I'm sure he has much expertise.

[02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:27.420]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:31:28.040 --> 02:31:28.340]
Am you?

[02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:29.080]
Yes.

[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:35.060]
I mean, you should mention Big Brown. I'm my way out this morning. They did have something on ESPN that they had photos that...

[02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:41.220]
200 yards just went to his right into the race. They have a photo that shows that his right front...

[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:43.300]
The shoe had been dislodged.

[02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:43.820]
Uh-huh.

[02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:47.040]
And they were thinking that either they were obviously a cackin' to help him.

[02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:50.320]
But either one of the loose nails was sticking into his...

[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:53.500]
Or just the fact that he's flopping around with a loose shoe.

[02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:54.140]
Yeah.

[02:31:54.440 --> 02:31:57.440]
It was a big thing going across on the call. It was the first thing I saw this morning.

[02:31:57.560 --> 02:32:00.200]
Because I was thinking the same thing. I said it had to be something on out of your...

[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:01.300]
Or it shouldn't have been his last.

[02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:03.840]
But he's supposed to be the second coming in secretariat.

[02:32:03.840 --> 02:32:04.740]
That is correct.

[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:08.060]
But apparently that's what they are spending these days now. It's the...

[02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:09.140]
Uh-huh. That's what they're claiming.

[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:09.760]
That's what I was thinking.

[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:10.620]
That should have been the first time I did.

[02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:12.180]
I think yeah.

[02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:13.600]
It's the first time they're spending it.

[02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:14.340]
There you go.

[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:15.800]
And that's that.

[02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:18.040]
I got some tribute short and hopefully speak.

[02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:19.280]
Thank you so much.

[02:32:19.300 --> 02:32:19.580]
You're welcome.

[02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:22.720]
See, there's a guy actually responded to something I asked.

[02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:24.080]
A first round.

[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:29.820]
32 and half years in this market. That's the first time anybody's ever responded.

[02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:31.760]
Did they think I've ever asked about it?

[02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.680]
833 on a pull. I think we can make 875.

[02:32:35.160 --> 02:32:35.320]
Ooh.

[02:32:36.060 --> 02:32:36.420]
Ooh.

[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:41.160]
Won't that be exciting? Christadus squeezes kneecaps so they could find them.

[02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:41.740]
We'll do 900.

[02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:45.880]
You know something. You are so full of it. It's just...it's annoying.

[02:32:46.720 --> 02:32:47.300]
What do you talk about?

[02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:48.160]
You.

[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:49.160]
Annoying.

[02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:50.000]
Annoying.

[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:51.300]
Because you say crap.

[02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:52.000]
900.

[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:53.660]
None. No change.

[02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:54.080]

[02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:58.620]
Listen. If we need to hear your weight again, we'll let you know.

[02:32:58.620 --> 02:32:59.200]
Okay.

[02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:00.700]
WQAN. Hello.

[02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:02.680]
Yeah.

[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:04.140]
What do you say?

[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:04.760]
Get all of this.

[02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:05.400]
What do you say?

[02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:08.160]
Can't understand the thing you're saying and blow it out your ass.

[02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:09.940]
WQAN. Hello.

[02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:12.800]
I'll be issuing your statement out to the show.

[02:33:13.080 --> 02:33:13.520]
But here's...

[02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:18.240]
Excellent.

[02:33:19.880 --> 02:33:21.980]
It'll be issuing a statement after the show.

[02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:23.420]
You're going to have it.

[02:33:23.740 --> 02:33:24.940]
Make several copies of it.

[02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:27.360]
Be sure to fax it to me in the morning.

[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:28.920]
WQAN.

[02:33:28.920 --> 02:33:29.300]
WQAN. Hello.

[02:33:30.460 --> 02:33:31.020]
Yeah.

[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:32.360]
KLAAN.

[02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:34.480]
Hello?

[02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:35.220]
Yes.

[02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:36.820]
Can I speak with Neil?

[02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:37.480]
Speaking.

[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:41.380]
Let me try it again.

[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:42.020]
Speaking.

[02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:43.680]
Hey, Neil.

[02:33:44.020 --> 02:33:47.400]
Um, that guy stole my thunder about the big brown.

[02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:48.140]
Yeah.

[02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:53.660]
But actually in the hair of yesterday, that is, um, he's like his hoe for something came out.

[02:33:53.660 --> 02:34:01.200]
And then the other panel went back into his corpse and nodded the right spot if you know what I mean.

[02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:01.640]
Uh-huh.

[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:03.040]
Play like Neil.

[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:04.000]
Oh, how good would you?

[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:04.760]
And you too.

[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:05.720]
Have one.

[02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:07.340]
Even a bad one.

[02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:13.560]
But if I let that sounds like the safety pin in the spectacular bit,

[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:15.860]
certainly not very familiar like that, the only story.

[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:17.720]
Oh, he had a safety pin in his foot.

[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:22.040]
The fact that Ronnie Franklin thought they were going about, you know, five four longs that day,

[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:23.500]
that had nothing to do with it.

[02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:25.660]
They all lie a lot.

[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:26.400]
They lie.

[02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:28.900]
Here comes the bunny and there goes your money.

[02:34:29.620 --> 02:34:30.320]
30 QAM.

[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:30.620]
Hello?

[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.320]
Oh, yes.

[02:34:34.580 --> 02:34:34.980]
Neil?

[02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:35.760]
Yes.

[02:34:36.140 --> 02:34:37.420]
I'm calling about there.

[02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:39.080]
The last call of that big brown.

[02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:39.920]
Yeah.

[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:40.440]
Yeah.

[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:42.420]
We think of two of them, but it is correct.

[02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:43.580]
They show the picture.

[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:45.380]
Everything's going into the town, but he's well-fanging.

[02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:49.140]
And he's scheduled to run in the eyes when at Mama, going to third of all.

[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:50.800]
I'm the third of what?

[02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:51.580]
Okay.

[02:34:51.860 --> 02:34:52.640]
Okay, thanks.

[02:34:52.760 --> 02:34:53.300]
You know what?

[02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:54.220]
There you go.

[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:56.100]
Steve, we're starting to get some good horse racing talking.

[02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:57.140]
You can thank you for that.

[02:34:57.620 --> 02:34:57.620]

[02:34:57.780 --> 02:34:58.300]
That's right.

[02:34:58.740 --> 02:35:00.860]
George, who's a big chantel southerly fan now.

[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:01.260]
You know it.

[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:06.360]
Almost as big of a chantel southerly fan as I'm a Justin Stein fan.

[02:35:07.980 --> 02:35:12.380]
But nevertheless, I miss those shows, those Gulf Stream shows years.

[02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:14.780]
Yeah.

[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:15.780]
You don't miss it?

[02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:16.580]
Of course I do.

[02:35:16.860 --> 02:35:19.020]
Well, when we're going to be doing, I don't know.

[02:35:19.020 --> 02:35:20.680]
I'll talk to Steve's store about that.

[02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:22.380]
Yes, smack him in the head a little bit.

[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:26.680]
Smack him up the side of the head and tell him that Jolly Jo Bell wants you to go out there and make some extra cash.

[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:28.440]
What's your big name?

[02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:30.920]
The best talent you've ever been in the project.

[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:33.280]
Sporting the 5.60 QAM.

[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.100]
The sports leader.

[02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:36.000]
Hey, B.

[02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:40.080]
Harry Callahan is back.

[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:43.500]
And now he's passing out flowers and airports.

[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:44.380]
Hey, Bell.

[02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:47.020]
You want to buy a carnation for your lady, friend?

[02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:48.800]
No, thanks.

[02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:49.620]
Come on, pal.

[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:51.240]
Take my day.

[02:35:51.500 --> 02:35:52.440]
Ah, okay.

[02:35:53.980 --> 02:35:57.020]
What he's toward is dirty, hairy Krishna.

[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:02.980]
You know, in all this excitement, I don't know if I saw just six flowers or only five.

[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:10.380]
But seeing as how Krishna is the most powerful being in the whole universe, and he blew all my hair clean off.

[02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:12.920]
You can ask yourself, one question.

[02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:13.920]
What's that?

[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:15.820]
Do you like my orange smack?

[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:17.900]
We do yes, but...

[02:36:18.640 --> 02:36:19.560]
Ladies, what?

[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:24.100]
It's just me, smith and whistled, and it's Dalai Lama.

[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:26.620]
He is dirty, hairy Krishna.

[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:30.420]
No chanting at an airport near you.

[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:33.900]
On 30, Gifx, month on right, okay?

[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:39.480]
Get it on the leftward tilt or on the rightward tilt, whichever way you want it to tilt.

[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:41.500]
842 on a pull, Chris.

[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:42.660]
900.

[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:55.240]
So, do you say Josh Corris is working on Thursday?

[02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.120]
Yeah, well, if we can, you know, we don't pay him.

[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:02.460]
I thought I just got through, saying, I'm a big fat cheque.

[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:04.340]
Are you doing them sure that's why he does that?

[02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:05.780]
I mean, the company, that's what I meant by that.

[02:37:07.020 --> 02:37:07.840]
What do you mean by that?

[02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:11.420]
You know, they don't give him anything extra or anything extra to work on this show.

[02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:14.480]
It's what's so very difficult to get somebody to fill in when one of us is sick

[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:16.340]
or having their car fixed or something.

[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:21.060]
Are you beliakin' about money again?

[02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:21.740]
Me?

[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:28.660]
US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama offered new steps on Sunday to crack down on speculation in the oil markets,

[02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:31.680]
saying his plan would help rain in runaway fuel costs.

[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:35.640]
A jumping gasoline prices about $4 a gallon, this bird consumer anger,

[02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:38.400]
and is the top theme in a race between Obama and McCain.

[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:41.500]
I think everybody believes there's too much speculation in the oil markets

[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:46.600]
that New Jersey Governor John Corzine and Obama ally who announced the proposals in a conference call with reporters.

[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:50.860]
Around the late price of oil, I think people put at the doorstep of speculators,

[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:53.060]
bidding up and holding supplies off the market.

[02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:57.140]
Corzine said Obama's plan aims to close the so-called in-ron loophole,

[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.860]
which exempts some energy speculators who trade electronically from US regulation,

[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:04.360]
it takes its name from the now-collect energy firm that benefited from the law.

[02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:08.720]
Obama would require US energy futures to trade on regulated exchanges,

[02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:13.180]
the campaign also said he backed legislation that would direct the community futures trading commission,

[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:15.220]
the top US futures market regulator,

[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:18.640]
to investigate proposals such as increasing margin requirements in the market.

[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:21.460]
In addition, the Illinois Senator wants to see more transparency

[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:24.340]
and oversight of institutional investors in commodities markets.

[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:28.600]
They're raping the public, and everybody just bend over when put a big smile on your push.

[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:35.480]
842 on here, like I said, 875 will be a real nice number we can be proud of,

[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:37.600]
and go home with a big smile on our push.

[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:46.280]
567-0560-0.560, and the Verizon's thinking of wireless line waiting for some really heavy duty calls this last half hour.

[02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:48.560]
You'll see. They saved the best for last.

[02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:50.500]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:51.660]
Can you remember?

[02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:52.980]
See, there's one.

[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:54.640]
QAM.

[02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:56.840]
Hello.

[02:38:57.160 --> 02:38:57.600]
Yes.

[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:00.140]
It puts the quarter in the slot.

[02:39:00.820 --> 02:39:01.320]
Mm-hmm.

[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:08.860]
Now, there was some excitement, man.

[02:39:09.180 --> 02:39:13.320]
He was everything I remember about South Florida from the last 30 years.

[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:14.000]
That was him.

[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:16.100]
Dole.

[02:39:16.620 --> 02:39:18.840]
Dole and lifeless as in...

[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:19.440]
I have no life.

[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:19.940]
Like that.

[02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:25.900]
567-0560, we got 27 minutes to kill him.

[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:26.980]
Now, it's like that's it.

[02:39:27.080 --> 02:39:27.720]
That's the end of the world.

[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:30.640]
Like they shot their bull.

[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:34.000]
Pound 560 on the Verizon's singular wireless line.

[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:35.980]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:38.400]
Hey, Neil, you work better alone.

[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:41.020]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:43.480]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:44.700]
QAM, hello.

[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:47.920]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:51.500]
Yeah, good.

[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:52.500]
I believe it.

[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:54.140]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:58.440]
When John McCain fixed Charlie Chan man to beat his VP,

[02:39:58.980 --> 02:40:01.300]
will the power of Christ come tell you?

[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:04.560]
I told you.

[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:06.080]
That was good.

[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:07.620]
Didn't like that?

[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:09.040]
I like to find him.

[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:09.800]
I'm off and on the inside.

[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:12.620]
I thought it was cute.

[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:13.740]
Well, what is wrong with you, man?

[02:40:13.740 --> 02:40:14.400]
You're such a...

[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:17.020]
I think since they chopped your nuts off, yeah, that's it.

[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:19.000]
You just ain't the same all bit about that.

[02:40:19.060 --> 02:40:19.900]
No, not the sour.

[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:20.840]
Hardly.

[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.300]
At least you're not going to be making any more unwanted babies.

[02:40:23.500 --> 02:40:23.820]
That's right.

[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:24.800]
Thank God.

[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:27.380]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:40:27.860 --> 02:40:28.860]
Hey, it's your turn, man.

[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:29.580]
It's your turn.

[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:32.800]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:40:33.500 --> 02:40:34.340]
How many more are you doing?

[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:35.880]
QAM, hello.

[02:40:38.620 --> 02:40:39.020]
QAM.

[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:40.220]
Hello.

[02:40:40.740 --> 02:40:40.900]
Neil.

[02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:41.560]
Yes.

[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:46.560]
You got part of the story on the big brown with transpired

[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:48.540]
when those horses came out of the gate.

[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:50.320]
She got bumped.

[02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:54.120]
He got bumped with another horse there in his rear hind leg,

[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:56.260]
caught the front leg of another horse,

[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.020]
and sprung the shoe off of his whole foot.

[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:00.840]
I'll be damned.

[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:03.980]
And so they call it a sprung shoe.

[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:10.920]
And so it was run around the end of the track with the irregular gate.

[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:13.800]
And then they were going around with a shoe hanging off.

[02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:16.540]
That's about what it was just at a photograph of it.

[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:22.680]
And the shoe was half attached and it was separated by two or three inches away from his horse.

[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:23.280]
Wow.

[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:24.220]
Okay, thanks, Pally.

[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:24.900]
You're welcome.

[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:28.460]
And so there you go, CIS, to solve the mystery and there it is.

[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:31.420]
We found out I knew there had to be something really ostentially, something bad,

[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:33.580]
something really stunk.

[02:41:35.580 --> 02:41:37.000]
And I didn't better die on it.

[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:37.760]
Now you didn't either.

[02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:38.860]
Nope.

[02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:42.740]
Because we weren't doing one of those shows that day, we were on a Saturday, of course.

[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:45.420]
How disappointing, man.

[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:47.540]
A little annulment nail, little shoe,

[02:41:48.140 --> 02:41:51.060]
and the progress of all that excitement and enthusiasm.

[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:54.740]
They could have spent days and months and years on it.

[02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:57.100]
Couldn't they?

[02:41:57.680 --> 02:41:58.320]
They could have.

[02:41:58.860 --> 02:42:00.340]
But we didn't have a chance.

[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:02.380]
30 QIM, hello.

[02:42:02.940 --> 02:42:03.360]
Hey, Neil.

[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:04.220]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:07.980]
I guarantee you, in three weeks, you won't be taking calls anymore.

[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:08.980]
Why is that?

[02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:11.420]
Because he's going to keep calling.

[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:13.160]
I can't share with us.

[02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:14.720]
32 A.M.

[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:14.960]
Hello.

[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:17.240]
32 A.M.

[02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:17.480]
Hello.

[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:19.720]
32 A.M.

[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:19.760]
Hello.

[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:19.800]
Hello.

[02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:19.800]

[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:25.460]
32 A.M.

[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:25.640]
Hello.

[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:28.100]
Yeah.

[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:28.760]
32 A.M.

[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:29.120]

[02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:29.120]

[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:29.820]
Okay.

[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:30.260]
Okay.

[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:31.540]
32 A.M.

[02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:31.740]
Hello.

[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:32.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:33.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:35.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:35.800]
Hello.

[02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:36.820]
Hello.

[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:37.160]
Hello.

[02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:46.240]
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

[02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:47.640]
32 A.M.

[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:47.900]
Hello.

[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:50.480]
A winged horse of marble white.

[02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:52.140]
Take me on a magic flight.

[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:53.200]
Hello.

[02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:53.780]
No.

[02:42:56.540 --> 02:42:57.660]
32 A.M.

[02:42:57.780 --> 02:42:57.920]
Hello.

[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:05.940]
I just wanted to remind everyone that something in London is a member of the Saudi-Irigan royal family.

[02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:06.560]
Mm-hmm.

[02:43:06.820 --> 02:43:12.240]
And he could conceivably, it wouldn't, it wouldn't happen, but he could conceivably become the ruler of that country.

[02:43:12.620 --> 02:43:13.160]
Oh, yeah.

[02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:18.440]
And so this was a guy, you know, that, uh, to the worst of fact, on America since the Pearl Harbor.

[02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:19.240]
Mm-hmm.

[02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:22.140]
And, uh, I just got to remind everybody that.

[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:22.820]
I make a statement.

[02:43:24.020 --> 02:43:24.380]
Okay.

[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:25.320]
That's it.

[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:26.680]
Your statement is noted.

[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:27.740]
All right. I'm out.

[02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:28.500]
Thank you.

[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:29.700]
Yeah, you're out, all right.

[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:31.100]
He's out.

[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:37.080]
I'm not too happy about this crawler, this creepy crawler thing on here starting to really piss me off.

[02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:39.340]
856, though.

[02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:39.860]
What did I tell you?

[02:43:40.180 --> 02:43:40.540]
875.

[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:43.120]
And Chris is still saying, oh, 900.

[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:44.620]
We're going to get 900 votes.

[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:44.840]
Yeah.

[02:43:44.940 --> 02:43:45.500]
And then what?

[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:46.460]
And what if we do?

[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:47.500]
Then we've got what?

[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:49.460]
We go home.

[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:50.320]
Seriously, seriously.

[02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:51.020]
And then what?

[02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:52.760]
What's going to happen then if you get 900 votes?

[02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:54.660]
Is that going to make you a macher?

[02:43:55.480 --> 02:43:55.740]
Oh, what?

[02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:59.820]
Are you going to be like to radio what the casino stand is to gambling?

[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:00.340]
No.

[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:03.080]
I told them.

[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:11.060]
No, and even George, who's hard to impress, I'm sure that even he was astonished and shot with the enraged line.

[02:44:11.060 --> 02:44:12.140]
It was one for the ages.

[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:15.800]
And see, I don't think that you're appreciating the power that is casino stand.

[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:17.700]
He's a mover and a shaker.

[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:21.420]
And if you've ever seen how you know what I'm talking about, maybe he hides the power in between the wrinkles.

[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:22.440]
That could be.

[02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:24.280]
If you want a power, you can use them.

[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:26.300]
Next talent, this is your brother.

[02:44:26.740 --> 02:44:28.660]
Portland, you look 5.16 QAM.

[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:29.160]
I think.

[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:30.420]
Fourth leader.

[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:32.060]
Who's going to get Ricky a blow?

[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:35.640]
Craft Hill records for this for the first time anywhere.

[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:39.480]
A fabulous two record collection of pop music, credit center is like Poppins for their overdraw.

[02:44:41.540 --> 02:44:43.220]
The incomparable David Boy.

[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:47.660]
The greatest name is Poppins, Xamarin and Startering.

[02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:49.840]
Their way to the top is one of the record offers the whole.

[02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:53.700]
Those actions.

[02:44:55.680 --> 02:44:56.140]
Friends.

[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:00.140]
Three generations of great stars and servers.

[02:45:03.500 --> 02:45:07.680]
And if you like now, Craft Hill will grow in a fabulous collection of rock and roll and put James Brown.

[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:10.420]
Teddy Rocker, Pat Benzar, Custody Moore.

[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:14.900]
If you try to buy me, Trevor, they probably put your way.

[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:16.700]
You can only get him from Craft Hill, Gross and Brown.

[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:17.860]
Let's start his servers.

[02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:20.060]
From Craft Hill, where are we safe?

[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:22.400]
If you'll buy this, you'll buy anything.

[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:29.860]
143-560WQ, and we got the jerk show speaking of you all by anything coming up with two.

[02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:32.180]
871 on a pool.

[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:33.340]
I totally make 875.

[02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:34.060]
Easy.

[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:36.560]
Chris.

[02:45:37.380 --> 02:45:37.860]
You'll see.

[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:38.880]
I'll see.

[02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:39.800]
Oh, huh.

[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:40.400]
You'll see.

[02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:42.640]
Have you ever heard of the word, Lunk?

[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:45.540]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:50.580]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:51.640]
Yeah, I know.

[02:45:51.800 --> 02:45:53.940]
I just wanted to say it was great meeting you at Gulf Stream.

[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:57.940]
And I was wondering, Ed Woodbine, when you play the quick hit machines?

[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:01.280]
Did they have the platinum progressive jackpot on that?

[02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:01.940]
No.

[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:04.120]
Well, we'll be letting them platinum.

[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:08.960]
It's these three symbols appear, and then the last two wheels look like they're spinning.

[02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:11.960]
And if you get all five, you get a progressive jackpot.

[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:12.420]
No.

[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:15.940]
And it's $17,000 now at the...

[02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:21.400]
Well, if you have an owner, he'll get nine quick hits at Woodbine's $25,000, up to $32,000.

[02:46:21.420 --> 02:46:26.040]
Yeah, I got eight ones, but I was only getting like 60 cents at a time.

[02:46:26.540 --> 02:46:27.580]
Oh, my God.

[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:29.760]
It's like 400, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:30.640]
But I was happy.

[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:34.780]
All right, listen, I hope you feel better, and love your entertainment.

[02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:35.660]
Enjoy your fun.

[02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:36.220]
Okay, thanks.

[02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:37.200]
Thank you so much.

[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:43.700]
5.670560 and £560 on Negro Ryzen, and singular wireless line.

[02:46:45.420 --> 02:46:46.520]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:48.040]
Dr. Ketchow.

[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:49.420]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:46:50.260 --> 02:46:51.580]
I love you.

[02:46:51.700 --> 02:46:52.660]
I almost moneyed you having the bank.

[02:46:53.940 --> 02:46:54.960]
Are you waiting for a book?

[02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:56.560]
Did I have somebody to?

[02:46:56.780 --> 02:46:57.080]
No.

[02:46:57.520 --> 02:46:57.880]
Okay.

[02:46:58.420 --> 02:46:58.780]
No.

[02:46:58.920 --> 02:46:59.440]
Bye-bye.

[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:05.300]
5.670560.560 on Negro Ryzen, how much money do I have in the bank?

[02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:07.600]
That's interesting, that's new.

[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:09.060]
Yeah, I guess so.

[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:11.620]
Well, guys, you're that all the time.

[02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:13.580]
You know Q-A-M, hello.

[02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:14.200]
Yeah.

[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:14.940]
Yes.

[02:47:15.340 --> 02:47:17.120]
I heard you say something about flying them.

[02:47:17.380 --> 02:47:19.520]
Speaking of flying them, a mom will be to American Express.

[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:20.260]
Thank you.

[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:22.180]
Oh, well, I hope you find it.

[02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:24.260]
And the American Express, too.

[02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:26.620]
He's still looking.

[02:47:26.740 --> 02:47:29.800]
That's the American, I'm under my way to American Express guy in case you'd forgotten him.

[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:31.640]
Right, you've forgotten him?

[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:32.540]
Already.

[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:35.040]
Not to be confused with the nickel-slot guy.

[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:37.260]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:38.480]
Neil, how you doing?

[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:39.080]
Okay.

[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:49.060]
I caught you a little earlier talking about Big Brown, but maybe since then you saw, did you hear about that photograph of the shoe coming off Big Brown?

[02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:49.860]
Did you hear about that?

[02:47:49.980 --> 02:47:51.080]
Yeah, I told Matt, I didn't see it.

[02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:52.520]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:55.880]
I don't know if that's anything.

[02:47:56.100 --> 02:48:00.320]
It's not a good time, but I don't know if they didn't find anything wrong with that darn horse.

[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:02.420]
Neil, it's just the strangest thing, don't you think?

[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:06.580]
Well, I thought you just got you a tell me that the shoe came off.

[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:08.220]
Yeah, but look out.

[02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:13.940]
I mean, the horse was, I mean, unless the shoe was coming off at the start, they said.

[02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:14.600]
Yeah.

[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:16.240]
The horse went three quarters of the race.

[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:17.800]
And then it crapped out.

[02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:18.460]
I mean, I'm sorry.

[02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:22.200]
Well, maybe it was, you know, a start when you wouldn't, let me try to ask you this.

[02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:28.840]
If you wanted to run from wherever you are right now across the street and your shoe started coming off, how far do you think you could run before you'd stop?

[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:30.680]
Right, right.

[02:48:31.180 --> 02:48:31.300]
Right.

[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:33.200]
That wasn't, listen, but you understand.

[02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:37.440]
I know you paid attention a little bit afterwards that nobody mentioned anything like that.

[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:39.240]
What they've won, they have won.

[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:40.700]
And where did the picture comes from today?

[02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:41.780]
Did they fabricated it?

[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:43.360]
Is it like landing on a moon?

[02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:46.460]
Yeah, it's a life friend, but I don't need to look at that guy.

[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:50.240]
Soak and wedge stand in there, you know, running away from the camera.

[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:55.320]
And that gave me, you know, if they found a shoe off the horse, come on, my friend, you know how much money?

[02:48:55.960 --> 02:48:58.580]
Legally with exchange done on that race?

[02:48:58.800 --> 02:48:59.220]
$5 million.

[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:00.860]
$5 million.

[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:02.960]
No, no, worldwide, you know.

[02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:04.000]
How much?

[02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:05.220]
$60 billion.

[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:06.780]
Get out of here.

[02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:07.960]
$60 billion in my ass.

[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:09.280]
That legal legal.

[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:09.480]
Yeah.

[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:10.820]
And.

[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:13.040]
And so who got it?

[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:14.900]
Well, you got to have Hank on the show.

[02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:16.020]
We'll talk about it.

[02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:16.500]
No, not the show.

[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:18.940]
I'm not going to talk horse racing with Hank.

[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:19.200]
Sorry.

[02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:22.980]
Yeah, we don't have Hank on the show.

[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:27.020]
So this guy can call in and talk about the $60 billion that was waged you on the Belmont.

[02:49:29.740 --> 02:49:32.380]
I don't want to say he's a little bit over the top.

[02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:33.940]
You know, I mean, anything is possible.

[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:36.200]
It's like so many other things we never know the truth.

[02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:37.820]
Am I right about the anterwa?

[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:38.180]
You.

[02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:38.960]
You.

[02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:41.480]
May never tell us nothing.

[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:42.040]
Nope.

[02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:44.060]
WDQAM.

[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:44.360]
Hello.

[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:48.140]
Oh, not our last call.

[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:48.620]
QAM.

[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:48.940]
Hello.

[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:49.940]
Penny.

[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:51.100]
Flocked out here and just.

[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:51.700]
Oh, Penny.

[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:52.240]
Flocked out.

[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:52.520]
Great.

[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:53.740]
Well, you know where to stick to Penny?

[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:54.320]
Right, go.

[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:54.660]
Yeah.

[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:55.500]
Penny's from heaven.

[02:49:57.840 --> 02:49:59.220]
872 on a pole looks like to me.

[02:50:01.780 --> 02:50:02.140]
We're going to.

[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:03.220]
Chris is still going for 900.

[02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:03.640]
Yep.

[02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:05.340]
Idiot.

[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:06.040]
Uh-huh.

[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:08.760]
You got 12 minutes and you're going to get 28 votes in 12 minutes.

[02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:09.460]
Never know.

[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:10.480]
Based on what?

[02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:11.460]
Hope.

[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:14.200]
Hope speaks eternal.

[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:17.060]
In a big fat human breast is what I've heard.

[02:50:18.220 --> 02:50:22.780]
567 05 60 and pound 566 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:24.980]
Still got about five minutes here to kill.

[02:50:25.820 --> 02:50:29.600]
Let's get the really good calls in here before time runs out before the jerk show.

[02:50:30.860 --> 02:50:31.340]
Starts.

[02:50:31.420 --> 02:50:32.000]
Coming at you.

[02:50:33.260 --> 02:50:33.740]
WDQAM.

[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:34.060]
Hello.

[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:35.620]
Codding.

[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:36.300]
Yeah.

[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:38.320]
I'd walk the talk to Neil.

[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:39.300]
Speaking.

[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:40.700]
Neil.

[02:50:41.180 --> 02:50:41.680]
You're the best.

[02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:45.080]
I listen to you all the time.

[02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:45.700]
It's harder.

[02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:48.760]
You should be on the serious radio.

[02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:49.440]
But I'm not.

[02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:50.420]
And I help.

[02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:51.300]
But I don't pay any more.

[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:52.940]
They're not paying anybody any money.

[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:55.780]
That's unfortunate because you're the best.

[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:56.560]
You're the best.

[02:50:56.560 --> 02:50:56.980]
You're the best.

[02:50:57.160 --> 02:50:57.480]
Yeah.

[02:50:57.620 --> 02:50:58.060]
Okay.

[02:50:58.240 --> 02:50:58.380]
Great.

[02:50:59.060 --> 02:50:59.920]
And I love you.

[02:51:00.260 --> 02:51:00.640]
Great.

[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:02.680]
And take care of your mom.

[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:03.800]
And I hope you feel better.

[02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:04.520]
Okay.

[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:05.640]
I have no life.

[02:51:06.060 --> 02:51:06.380]
Wow.

[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:09.060]
Man.

[02:51:09.060 --> 02:51:09.740]
Oh, man.

[02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:10.700]
I have no life.

[02:51:10.700 --> 02:51:10.940]
No.

[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:12.460]
Lies to none.

[02:51:12.660 --> 02:51:13.460]
He owes a life.

[02:51:15.340 --> 02:51:16.700]
You should be on serious.

[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:18.140]
You should be on there with staring.

[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:21.620]
Staring now with the other jerk.

[02:51:23.220 --> 02:51:27.960]
Like I said, considering the fact that they have no restrictions at all, they can say

[02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:29.200]
whatever words they want.

[02:51:29.300 --> 02:51:34.820]
If that's the best idea of programming, of entertaining the public, then God help us

[02:51:34.820 --> 02:51:34.940]
all.

[02:51:35.020 --> 02:51:35.740]
That's all I can tell you.

[02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:36.740]
I heard it.

[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:38.740]
I was nauseated by it.

[02:51:38.740 --> 02:51:41.300]
I was just astonished at how lame.

[02:51:41.960 --> 02:51:42.360]
Lame.

[02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:43.140]
You might be by that.

[02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:44.020]
Lame.

[02:51:44.980 --> 02:51:45.320]
Lame.

[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:47.040]
Anything else, Robin?

[02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:48.140]
Anything else, Robin?

[02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:54.140]
It's just, but like I said, the whole world is about hype.

[02:51:54.460 --> 02:51:55.240]
That's what it's all about.

[02:51:55.380 --> 02:51:55.520]
hype.

[02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:58.140]

[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:01.860]
Okay.

[02:52:02.540 --> 02:52:04.420]
I had a great time over there.

[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:06.060]
You still on the action?

[02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:07.660]
Yeah.

[02:52:07.660 --> 02:52:08.020]
Uh-huh.

[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:08.300]
Sure.

[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:09.300]
Five years later, right?

[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:10.580]
What's up?

[02:52:11.420 --> 02:52:13.540]
Why don't you just continue to be scared?

[02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:15.760]
Kevin Q-A-M, hello.

[02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:17.780]
Neil.

[02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:18.460]
Yeah.

[02:52:19.160 --> 02:52:20.800]
Compare that to your causes.

[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:22.640]
I'm starting over here.

[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:26.520]

[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:27.420]

[02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:31.820]
Hey.

[02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:32.380]
What's up?

[02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:33.440]
What's up?

[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:34.380]
Listen.

[02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:37.340]
Why don't we meet color in the blood?

[02:52:37.500 --> 02:52:37.640]
Yeah.

[02:52:40.540 --> 02:52:40.980]
Yeah.

How about blue jack?
