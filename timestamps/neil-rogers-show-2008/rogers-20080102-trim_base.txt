[00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.460]
And by the way, Brainstorm, don't worry about synility, man. It hits us all too and we're later.

[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.020]
I am not gay, I never have been gay.

[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.220]
Boba Boba Boba Brands, Boba Boba Brands, 6000 thoughts, you fairy.

[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.720]
Uncontrollable, oily discharge.

[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.020]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.160]
Well, the hardest part of my job is to connect a rack to the wall on terrains.

[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.720]
Love me and agree with me.

[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.980]
You need me for the home.

[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.160]
You fairy.

[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.280]
Hey, she is a handsome woman.

[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.440]
The boy.

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.020]
The boy.

[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.160]
The boy.

[00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.760]
The boy.

[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.320]
The boy.

[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.780]
The boy.

[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.400]
The boy.

[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.600]
The boy.

[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.900]
This were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.660]
It's just as long as I'm the dictator.

[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.900]
You're a bitch.

[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.400]
You're a bitch.

[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.080]
I'm not gay, I never have been gay.

[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.080]
Gain, gain, gain, gain, not gay, not gay.

[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.720]
K, K, K, K, K, K, K.

[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.860]
Hey, that's a good looking guy.

[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.640]
Get, get, get, get.

[00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.580]
I hear the voices, voices, voices, voices, voices, voices, voices.

[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.480]
I'm a commander, guy.

[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.400]
We are the Moon and Earths, and our culture is advanced beyond all that you can possibly comprehend with 100% of your brain.

[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.540]
That's how we define common-audible brain.

[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.820]
What did your racket do with what?

[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.860]
A long, long trace of it.

[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.560]
Tell me.

[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.540]
Oh, God, what did anybody tell you?

[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.100]
Oh, my God, my insides are on fire!

[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.980]
No, please, no more, no more.

[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.840]
Get the phone. Call my mother.

[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.840]
Okay, okay.

[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.320]
I think it's all God.

[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.540]
I think it's all God.

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.260]
I don't want it.

[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.020]
I don't want it.

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.760]
Peter, I need you to hold my ear.

[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.840]
Peter, I need you to hold my ear.

[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.900]
Oh, God.

[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.740]
Look, yes, what?

[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.960]
I don't want it.

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.180]
Tell 4-560 WDQ.

[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.120]
I'm happy New Year.

[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.100]
First show of the New Year, Wednesday, January the 2.

[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280]
Aren't you excited about that?

[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.520]
No.

[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.160]
No.

[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.800]
Let's just take another few days off yesterday.

[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.320]
Oh, I look good.

[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.240]
It's pretty boring yesterday.

[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.680]
God.

[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.900]
I'm so glad this time of the year is over with.

[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.400]
Oh, I know you're a party pooper.

[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520]
You just die with that.

[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.900]
That's right.

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.780]
I'm a party pooper.

[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.000]
Or just a pooper.

[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.480]
WDQA.

[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.160]
I'm happy New Year.

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.500]
Nobody on there.

[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.760]
See?

[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.640]
There were a whole bunch of them running there for a second.

[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.020]
I thought, that must be a mistake.

[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.440]
They must be talking about the bull games yesterday.

[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.060]
I haven't watched any of those bull games.

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.940]
I watched that make believe hockey game in Buffalo.

[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.040]
What a concept.

[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.620]
Snow in Buffalo in the winter time.

[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.400]
How unusual.

[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.740]
Idiots.

[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.980]
It's smack to desperation the whole thing.

[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.000]
Oh, but there were 73,000 people there.

[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.160]
Yeah.

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.660]
And if they brought a pair of binoculars, they could actually see a little

[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.000]
what was going on on the ice.

[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.460]
And I used the term ice loosely because there was like snow all over during the

[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.660]
winter.

[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.400]
Oh, brother.

[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.860]
Just the pathetic Gary Bedman, tragic.

[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.580]
And the fact that it counted for three points in the standings, it was a regulation tie.

[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.200]
So Buffalo and Pittsburgh each got a point.

[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.580]
And then Pittsburgh got the extra point for when we were shoot out.

[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.780]
Playing in snow.

[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.880]
But never do I say just go to show how desperate they are.

[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.820]
Got a lot of things to say, but I probably better not say.

[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.420]
And Clarence was in the season this morning and some sales holes too.

[00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.100]
How do you like that?

[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.600]
Clarence's best line was, well, what was the exact line?

[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.700]
I don't want to misquote him.

[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.660]
I don't know.

[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.320]
There was some other chance that you're staying.

[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.140]
Sure.

[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.980]
In case you stay.

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.180]
Yeah, there's a chance you're going to get smart too, Clarence, but I wouldn't count on that either.

[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.580]
Come to QAM.

[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.800]
Hello.

[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.740]
QAM, is there anybody alive out there?

[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.020]
Hello.

[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.080]
Yeah, this is Frank from Miami.

[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.840]
And I wanted to say this morning I have to go here for a small.

[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.620]
Well, back to you, Frank.

[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.760]
Yeah, and just to think how fast is here might be going because we're already in January.

[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.820]
But I wanted to make a comment.

[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.180]
Yeah, this is your flight by.

[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.220]
Yeah.

[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.760]
I wanted to make a comment about Cam camera and I suppose we're doing it.

[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.020]
Oh, I'll do it on a sports show.

[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.840]
Okay, this is one of them.

[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.200]
Idiot.

[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.640]
Schmuck, I take back the happy new year, by the way.

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.620]
How do you like that?

[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.400]
Yeah.

[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.940]
You know something I'm going to get out of my system too.

[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.920]
In fact, you know, we make these new years resolutions.

[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.320]
This whole sports illness.

[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.320]
It's a, it's a, it's like a mental.

[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.320]
It's like a disease.

[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.980]
Like a disease.

[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.300]
And like I told you a long time ago and I've been saying it over and over again.

[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.580]
I said it before to show this morning.

[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.120]
We've been on the wrong station for a long time.

[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.600]
Okay.

[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.320]
Yeah.

[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.920]
Now, see, you don't have any credibility in this because you know they sports spectator family.

[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.520]
Like I am having for many, many years.

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.060]
Right.

[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.920]
You know, so you know, so it could have been anything.

[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.100]
Any other one topic will fill in the blank.

[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.280]
I would have had just as much of a problem.

[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.760]
This isn't a sports station.

[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.320]
This is an insane station.

[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.520]
These are crazy people.

[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.220]
That's a cult.

[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.440]
That's all they know.

[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.340]
There's nothing else in the world that's going on that they are capable to talking about.

[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.060]
That's all they know.

[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.640]
Oh, did you see the fight?

[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.940]
Did you see the game?

[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.260]
Did you see the, yeah, right.

[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.640]
What, whichever one happens to be?

[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.640]
Just mind blowing.

[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.900]
We don't care about scam Cameron or about bill Parcells or any of that crap on this show.

[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.500]
These are four hours a day.

[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.160]
They had a kid.

[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.560]
Yeah, I got to tell you something.

[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.460]
I didn't tell anybody.

[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.500]
Norma Kent, who's a real pansy.

[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.480]
Norma Kent in one of his phone calls, I don't know, a week ago whenever the hell was.

[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:53.220]
He says to me, and of course this is actually a spoken Joyce, which we don't, you know, we can't reveal the nuts and bolts of that conversation.

[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.660]
Although, if the two of them were talking about nuts, well, they weren't any.

[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:05.900]
But anyway, so Norma calls and says, well, you know, you've been privileged and blessed for several years to be, you know, making this kind of a...

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.060]
I've been privileged and blessed.

[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.000]
I do like that.

[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:14.040]
See the way I look at it is this radio station has been privileged and blessed to have this show under station for 10 years.

[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.600]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.320]
Yep.

[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.660]
That's the way I look at it.

[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.700]
They've been privileged and blessed.

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.440]
I haven't been privileged or blessed.

[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.600]
I've been cursed.

[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.200]
And for him, my agent lawyer slash Faggot to be calling me up and making a song and an answer about, well, you know, you've been...

[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:36.780]
That's just a cop out is what it is, Norma, just an excuse for you're being a weakling, for being a 199-pound weakling, a 220-pound tub of weakness.

[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.120]
That's what that is, Norma.

[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.460]
Happy New Year, by the way.

[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.420]
God.

[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.360]
Privileged and blessed.

[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.300]
Remember that song by Precious and Few?

[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.480]
Privileged and blessed?

[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.280]
Dada, that's not my word.

[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.460]
Remember that?

[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.480]
Yes.

[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.540]
Precious and Few was nothing real so I'm flying back to you.

[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.320]
Who did I say it was by?

[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:53.880]
I don't know.

[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]
My Precious and Few.

[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.820]
Well, whatever.

[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.480]
There it is.

[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.780]
Precious and Few are the people that I would have IQ larger than their thumbnail and sports nerd radio.

[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.040]
Depend on this.

[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.820]
See, I can barely even hear it.

[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.600]
It's so low in the back and I'll clock it up in the next one or the other.

[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.560]
Cranked all the way up.

[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.960]
You know, crank is the word.

[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.160]
Quite a climax.

[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.000]
QA and Hello.

[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.660]
This is a Scablet bike lineback.

[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.520]
Yeah.

[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.380]
White House hopeful Dennis Kocinich.

[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.680]
This is an important news.

[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.100]
Who's not likely to survive a first round of abouting in Thursday's Democratic Iowa caucus.

[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:30.760]
That's tomorrow.

[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.520]
Today told the supporters to back Senator Barack Obama's their second choice.

[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.740]
A little bit of a little Dennis.

[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.220]
Well, Kocinich was barely pulling any back, any backing quarter of the polls.

[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.520]
He was like a statistical, like kind of like a Joel Feinberg.

[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.140]
A statistical asterisk.

[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.020]
Thereby making it likely he would make the 15% threshold vote needed to be delegates, his

[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.500]
vote is going for a ban on a second round.

[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.460]
Could be critical for a ban coming out of Iowa ahead of swallowing and jotted words.

[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.680]
Who said it spoke to an anti-Junovitz said the deal was finalized today.

[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.620]
Obama called him about 2 p.m. central time to thank him for his support, meaning yesterday.

[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.840]
And making the second choice deal with a ban with Kocinich decided not to do a replay of 2004,

[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.520]
where his followers were asked to support Edwards' their second choice, helping to provide

[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.380]
Edwards with his margin for coming in second.

[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.960]
In a statement, Obama said, I have a lot of respect for Congressman Kocinich.

[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.560]
And I'm honored he's done this because we both believe deeply in the need for fundamental change.

[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.120]
That's right.

[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.020]
And when he was asked if he wanted to say anything else about Kocinich, you know what he said?

[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.000]
Oh, he's a little jai, kind of funny look.

[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.280]
Right.

[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.700]
But other than that, I think Obama's going to win.

[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.020]
That's what the new polls are shown in Iowa tomorrow on the caucus.

[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:40.540]
Good.

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.920]
That's what he's going to take it right up the old...

[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.300]
Back them.

[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:43.780]
Shoot.

[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.100]
Okay, let's see how the polls are doing here, okay?

[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.080]
Everybody's got polls.

[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.820]
We got our polls.

[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.920]
We got the new Iowa poll.

[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.140]
We got polls up the old earlobe.

[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.940]
Once you have won New Year's Resolution this year was our poll over the couple of days, New Year's and yesterday.

[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.560]
We had a thousand thirty nine votes, by the way.

[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.360]
Lose weight three hundred and thirty seven.

[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.240]
Don't have any resolutions three sixteen.

[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:06.840]
That's right.

[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.400]
Why make it because we break them anyway?

[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:08.780]
Right.

[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.480]
Although I haven't been to Woodbine yet for the New Year, I didn't say I was never going again, by the way.

[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.000]
Did I say that?

[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:14.280]
No.

[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.940]
I said I'm cutting way back.

[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.020]
Half more sex hundred and twenty seven.

[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.320]
Well, I haven't started on that one yet either, but I'm thinking about it.

[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.500]
Of course, I'm always thinking about it.

[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.140]
Who isn't?

[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:23.800]
Right.

[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.460]
Get a new job ninety three.

[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.080]
Find a mate fifty three.

[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.240]
Stop drinking your drugs forty three.

[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.280]
Do more drugs forty one.

[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.420]
I was sure I asked them sure he's off for a good start.

[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:33.720]
Yep.

[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.040]
And get into Horace twenty nine.

[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.680]
Well, when you do more drugs, generally, or at least it was smelly nasty divorce.

[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.080]
No, here keeps you together.

[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.340]
Why?

[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.720]
I said, how's it going, eh?

[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.760]
Don't start the New Year on a negative note.

[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.880]
Be positive like me.

[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.600]
I'm positive.

[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:51.740]

[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:51.820]
I'm positive.

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:51.820]

[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:51.860]
I'm positive.

[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.180]

[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.520]
I'm positive.

[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:52.780]
I'm positive.

[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:52.920]
I'm positive.

[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:52.980]

[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.240]
I'm positive.

[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:55.840]
I'm positive.

[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.420]
Joe Bell, we took a poll before the show today.

[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.460]
We decided he's the biggest lung kid in the history of this business.

[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.520]
I worked for several lung kids in my time, Stanley Cohen, uh, Kim Williams.

[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.340]
Oh, I worked for some of the biggest, uh, Lou Kron.

[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.960]
Oh, I'm sorry, his kid works at power.

[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:11.840]
And Lou Kron.

[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.740]
He's a good guy though.

[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.960]
Well, his son.

[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:14.460]
Yes.

[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.000]
Well, so don't the blame him for his daddy being lunged.

[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.540]
I have a good.

[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.700]
But Joe Bell's got him all beat sideways to a hell.

[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.080]
The biggest lung kid, the biggest zero,

[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.760]
whoever came down to Pike.

[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.840]
Today's poll, and we've done this before, but I'm digging out the oldies for the New Year.

[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.140]
It's the first time we did it this year.

[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.400]
Speaking of sex.

[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.840]
628 votes.

[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.080]
Do you consider yourself exclusively heterosexual for the 80s?

[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.280]
Bisexual 56.

[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.060]
Now it's interesting how bad the first time we did this bisexual, he had 23.

[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.680]
A lot of buys out there now.

[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.820]
I'll be sure of 39.

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.940]
Exclusively homosexual only 34 or 5.4%.

[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.080]
And first time we did this 7.3%.

[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.880]
We're losing the homos.

[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.360]
By the way.

[00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.760]
And asexual 19.

[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.600]
By the way, why those those nut shores?

[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:02.720]
Yeah.

[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:03.740]
Bisexual.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.240]
No.

[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:05.980]
Yeah.

[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:06.940]
Okay.

[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.280]
Just like those bisexuals.

[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:09.300]

[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.620]
Yeah, come to terms with it.

[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.360]
Right.

[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:11.900]
There you go.

[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.940]
Even anonymously even on a poll like this, which nobody knows.

[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.300]
Sure.

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:16.940]
Even anonymously.

[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.940]
That's called really in the cloud.

[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.140]

[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.080]
Deepen.

[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.440]
The very back of your thumb in the Roger.

[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.720]
Behind the house, Nick Graham.

[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.680]
The fourth leader.

[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.540]
Greg H.

[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:17.480]
For all the dead, the dead beat aradise.

[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:26.820]
Only good for a quick visit or to die.

[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.320]
Routing man, grilled swatts in hell.

[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.500]
You want and pass out from just one wave.

[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:44.820]
All that frankly jolt, angry Cubans who welcome you with the shady things.

[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.460]
Yeah.

[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.320]
Yeah.

[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.700]
Yeah.

[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.700]
Yeah.

[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:53.700]

[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:54.820]
Yeah.

[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.020]

[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:55.980]
Yeah.

[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:56.300]

[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:57.200]

[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:57.400]

[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:57.980]

[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:57.980]

[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.700]
So hard you stink and smell.

[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.180]
I'm off to the great white north to luck.

[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.900]
And as I watch you die.

[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.700]
I'm on the way to the edge.

[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.640]
Then the soda is dry.

[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.020]
Oi.

[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.300]
Okay, 1018.

[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.980]
I just nuke my bacon.

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.140]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.440]
Where's George?

[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.100]
Still joisin?

[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.520]
Oh my god.

[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.140]
Are you kidding me?

[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.480]
No.

[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.820]
I'm just gonna get up and go get it because the little beaker went off, you know?

[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:41.660]
Which means it is ready?

[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.320]
George is back rejoicing.

[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:50.380]
Um, yeah, I guess, uh, you know, he tried to go earlier and it must have been full because he had to come back at the end.

[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.480]
So I guess he finally found an opening and uh, an opening?

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:54.920]
Yeah.

[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:55.800]
Back to him.

[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.760]
Well, I guess we all, they're like, no, it's his man. Everybody's got one.

[00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.520]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.400]
Like opinions.

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.700]
Okay, let's preview that great new schedule on QAM, shall we?

[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:04.860]
Sure.

[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.600]
We had the big dog all by himself this morning. What an improvement that is.

[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.720]
Jesus, I didn't hear any of it.

[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.320]
Well, I listen.

[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:18.080]
I don't want to rip Allison to bed because it's not her fault, but nevertheless, what was she giving you a song to dance about how Hank apologized at the end for cutting me short?

[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:18.860]
He didn't do that.

[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.860]
We listened to the end of the show.

[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.280]
Not that he was me and the apology.

[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.220]
I think she was trying to say that he apologized like he felt bad when they went into the break after.

[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.020]
He didn't say anything about that.

[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:28.760]
Not on the air.

[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.400]
No, but no.

[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.300]
So what those are made?

[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.240]
I don't know.

[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:31.980]
Allison.

[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.040]
Allison.

[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.040]
I felt bad.

[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.040]
I felt bad because I felt like, I mean, not that I need the airtime.

[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.780]
I got home four hours every day, but I was asked to call him and they did, you know, I'm Monday after the organization's standhank in the back like they're doing to me.

[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.100]
And it was his last show on QAM.

[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.740]
And so they had a bunch of people calling to say, hey, all the best, Hank, you're great.

[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.160]
We love you.

[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.600]
Buh-buh-buh.

[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.160]
And good luck.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.820]
Well, yeah, it's a nice thing to do.

[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.000]
And certainly management wasn't behind it.

[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.620]
Because management wishes it's all the worst luck.

[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.320]
They wish it's so a wicked death.

[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.360]
Just like I wish Joe Bell, while screaming bloody diarrhea every day the rest of his life.

[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.700]
Maybe he's the one that was in there tapping his toe in the Georgia stall.

[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.680]
Blowing out gallons of oozing bloody diarrhea.

[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.100]
But at any rate, so I called it Hank about five o'clock on Monday to say, best of luck.

[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.420]
And we've worked together for 100 years and you're a great guy.

[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:24.980]
You'll be fine, but Buh-buh-buh.

[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.020]
You'll be okay.

[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.960]
Just a joke around a little bit.

[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.660]
Just like what he called in here on Monday morning.

[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.640]
Remember that? Yes you do.

[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.320]
Mm-hmm.

[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.180]
And I was on for, I don't know.

[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.440]
And then they say two minutes.

[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.580]
So it had to be the fastest two minutes of my life.

[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.660]
It seemed like seconds.

[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.920]
Well, I haven't really listened to that.

[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.740]
There wasn't no two minutes.

[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.980]
I think it was probably what's about two minutes.

[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.480]
We can try and find out what time it should make.

[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.960]
What differences it make.

[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.720]
The bottom line is I had barely had time to say hello and goodbye.

[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.800]
Oh, we got Don Shula here.

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.500]
Buy me a meal.

[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.060]
Hey, Coach.

[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.320]
Oh, you know.

[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.380]
Shula.

[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.500]
I just love Shula's lack of a response when he said all that was Neil Rogers.

[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.080]
See, and I didn't hear that, of course, because I was going to go up there.

[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:01.880]
Right.

[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.660]
I mean, I could have come rushing back in here and caught up with the delay.

[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.820]
But I'm not the, you know, I don't need to hear the sound of my own voice.

[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.060]
Yeah, well, you say goodbye and you pull down a...

[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:10.940]
Oh!

[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.240]
He frees up Don Shula and he's like, he's like, so that guy that was, that call that was dressed on.

[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.300]
He thinks it's okay to cheat.

[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.540]
And he's like, oh, well, that's Neil Rogers.

[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.240]
And there was like silence for about two seconds.

[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.860]
And they're like, oh, it's low-hank how you're doing, you know, it's the same.

[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.000]
Like, just, there was no one to know why.

[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.280]
I just wasn't conscious.

[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:30.640]
Yeah.

[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.420]
As usual, he was in the brainstem.

[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.140]
Needs help.

[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:34.960]
We need some help.

[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.240]
Oh, my God.

[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.680]
So sad.

[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.860]
But, yeah, it's Don Shula.

[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.840]
I mean, can I compete with Don Shula?

[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.580]
No way.

[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.680]
And he was on.

[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.460]
For an eternity, I'm sure.

[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.300]
I didn't hear him.

[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.500]
No, I think all the calls were about the length of your...

[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.380]
Get out of here.

[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.060]
He must have been on for like 10 minutes.

[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.280]
I should have come running in here.

[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:53.940]
Listen to it.

[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:54.960]
You should have.

[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:55.580]
Not.

[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.120]
We get by the well-wanted doing that.

[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.260]
For nine and a half minutes.

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.180]
You can buy the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, hang-cloth day.

[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.040]
On CD.

[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.820]
What are you talking about?

[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.100]
I'm sure they're gonna sell it.

[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.080]
Yeah.

[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.300]
Oh, yeah, they're gonna sell it.

[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.240]
Yeah, of course.

[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.340]
Don Shula, I got news for you, man.

[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.620]
The 72 dolphins couldn't lick the patriots' ass.

[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.020]
Okay.

[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.180]
Not even close.

[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.300]
And you couldn't lick Bill Belichex.

[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.700]
I asked either brainstem.

[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:30.400]
See, I think, I think he reasoned he pretends he doesn't remember who I am because of the fact that I was one of the few people who had the balls to go on here and say,

[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.840]
Hey, they fired Shula when he tried to act like, you know, like he retired.

[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.500]
They fired your ass, okay?

[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.780]
Cranky old coot.

[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.540]
I gotta go with my bacon, okay?

[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.200]
You got something in your bag?

[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.440]
No, George, still in the back of it.

[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.640]
Hold on, it's like, holy cow.

[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.000]
He must be really joy, he must be rejoicing from the holidays.

[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.800]
Go grab your bacon.

[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.520]
Why don't you go get something to feel?

[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.000]
I'll be right back.

[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.660]
So how many people out there wanna hear the...

[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.140]
The O'Rike is calling for a painful worship?

[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:35.480]

[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.120]
there'll be pages about Hank Goldberg and the Aronjers, there won't even be like an

[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.420]
asterisk about Jolly Jobelle. I could be wrong about that but I don't think so.

[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.020]
Lunkhead, been a lot of Lunkheads in this business just another fat ass Lunkhead come down

[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.000]

these overpaid Jews, we're gonna get them all off there, well, whatever.

[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.460]
Whatever makes you happy baby, because somewhere a year from now at this time we're gonna

[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.380]
be on some of the radio station kicking your ass.

[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.240]
That's just the most biggest name.

[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.840]
You ever tell me that?

[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:31.680]
No, no.

[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.060]
4.560 QAM.

[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.860]
The Force Leader.

[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.380]
The Lord even loves Neorodgers.

[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:27.340]
The Lord even loves Neorodgers.

[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.840]
You're fair.

[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.820]
He's gonna take a long time.

[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.580]
He did eyes it though, he's into Nile, that Rondrie said he never took it in the

[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:08.400]
NEEDLE LETTERS. 1031 at 560 WQAM. Happy a Wednesday, happy January 2nd, happy new year from

[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.760]
all your good friends. I started to give the schedule and I did Georgia or something.

[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.020]
Yeah I'm back.

[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.000]
Celebrating.

[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.120]
What was going on there?

[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:18.320]
I could make something funny up for you know, just for what you will.

[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.860]
Well I couldn't get in there see somebody was marathoning in there before the show.

[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.940]
Oh, it was him and Jolly Jo and that poor guy.

[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.680]
I kept going and they were wearing ugly tennis shoes and he's got his own private

[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.720]
John anyway, but I kept trying to go and somebody was in that stall and you know how I can't

[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.280]
use the handicrapper because it's too tall.

[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:34.940]
Too tall?

[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.840]
Yeah, my feet days long.

[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.320]
I can't do any holds on there though.

[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.240]
Did the handlebars?

[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.560]
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I need a nice low throne.

[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.380]
Thank you very much.

[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.740]
And I'm done.

[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.220]
Everything's you know, it just took a while to get in there for the moment.

[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.480]
You should be having this experience because my stomach is grumbling too right?

[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.700]
Maybe it's this nukeable bacon.

[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.500]
Did I pick that?

[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.540]
Did you find my Schneider's by the way, Chris?

[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:57.500]
He's not here.

[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.700]
I think it's his turn.

[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.100]
He didn't tell me where he was going.

[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.520]
He just you know, I walked past him as I was coming back.

[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.120]
Yeah, he made a mad day.

[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.680]
I don't know where he's going.

[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.100]
Maybe he went downstairs to smoke a joint.

[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.820]
I have no idea.

[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.000]
Go on here today.

[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.200]
How many zero-over guys?

[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.740]
That's what you think.

[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.840]
Nothing worse than two in your own horn.

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.520]
That's where Ron Jeremy told me.

[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.320]
You know who else told me that?

[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:25.840]
Who?

[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.600]
I'm here.

[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:27.560]
Another Ron.

[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:28.580]
Oh boy.

[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.300]
More Ron.

[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:29.980]
Oh yeah.

[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:30.900]
QIAM, hello.

[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.660]
Hey buddy, how are you?

[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.840]
Okay, how are you doing?

[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.720]
Not too bad.

[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.240]
I was just wondering.

[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.860]
Sounds like she meant again.

[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.580]
No.

[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.480]
No.

[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.060]
No.

[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.200]
You ever called while you were dumping by the way George?

[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:43.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.580]
Sorry I missed it.

[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:44.780]
Yeah.

[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:46.680]
And?

[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.280]
Oh and that guy just vanished.

[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.300]
Yeah, he was legit but he just disappeared.

[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:50.680]
Sure.

[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:51.940]
QIAM, hello.

[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.580]
Neil God.

[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:54.320]
Yes.

[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.480]
Happy New Year, Dave.

[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.240]
Same to you.

[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.280]
I missed you.

[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.220]
Crossover with Hank and I always enjoyed it.

[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.000]
Chris mentioned that you might have that on tape.

[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.560]
So if you could play that up here.

[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:04.820]
Crossover.

[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.320]
Did you call in there on Friday?

[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:07.980]
Yeah, I called in.

[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.340]
I was on for about, you know, a minute and a half and then Shula called in and they blew me

[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:11.640]
off.

[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.580]
Oh, that's too bad.

[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.380]
That's not anyway.

[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.260]
Born to Hank so happy New Year, too buddy.

[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.260]
And same to you.

[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:17.680]

[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:22.500]
Hank will be missed badly and see Mad Dog as much as I love him and as great as he is and he

[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.560]
really is excellent.

[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.100]
The fact of the matter is that last time they tried that four to seven when he was following

[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.560]
two hours of dead air with that and before that it was dead.

[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:32.280]
So that's all right.

[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.340]
That didn't do all that great.

[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.300]
See when he follows me with a big lead and he's manages to hang onto a big party.

[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:37.920]
Part of that audience.

[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.860]
But when we invite the audience to tune out for a couple of hours, a lot of times they

[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.920]
forget to come back, especially when the tremendous promotional job that they've stationed at

[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.320]
the hotel.

[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.560]
So here's the new lineup today.

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.620]
We have a big dog all by himself, seven to ten tomorrow.

[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.220]
He was on all by himself this morning.

[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.080]
But I'm still here at 10 to two.

[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.520]
The Jack Show, Jason Jackson 2 to 4, Jack's Dirk's whatever his name is, he's on 2 to 4.

[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.560]
Then Mad Dog like I said, 4 to 7.

[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.440]
The office all access is still on because Wayne's got the place last dude.

[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.880]
With John Linder, seven to only half hour tonight.

[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.300]
Oh, that's right.

[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.620]
We got Kane's basketball.

[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.360]
Maybe that's why clearance came in.

[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.760]
It tells we got Kane's basketball.

[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.440]
That's always got a big audience.

[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:21.520]
Starts with a, oh, Kane's warm up at 7 30.

[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.840]
Kane's in Penn at 8 o'clock.

[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.740]
There must be a home game.

[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:26.760]
You know how I deduce that?

[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:27.540]
How?

[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.420]
Because clearance is there.

[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.960]
Hey, you're very good.

[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.880]
Oh, Chris is back.

[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:33.400]
Where'd you go?

[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.020]
I was doing some Josh Cordis work.

[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.280]
You know, I just wrote Brandon and said that when I was out getting the bacon,

[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.240]
that you were promoting that you were going to play my call to Hank.

[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:48.220]
Uh-huh.

[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.980]
And I wrote it back in a message.

[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.100]
I said, you're trying to be the next Josh Cordis.

[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.980]
No, I asked people if they would like to hear the Hank call.

[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.680]
And what Cordis work were you doing?

[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.120]
Um, doing with the stream online where like, you know, when we go into commercial break,

[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.180]
we have other commercials that are allowed to be heard online.

[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.040]
Taxes in California, by the way, we both got a big, oh, everything's fine.

[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:10.980]
We're a stream in it.

[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.280]
No dropouts.

[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:13.580]
Yeah.

[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.500]
Well, we had a bunch of them that, um, expired on the new year.

[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:19.980]
And I guess he's not here.

[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:20.860]
He's not coming or something.

[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.740]
So he asked if I could pull them out of the stream and then we see him.

[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.980]
I'll say you're wanting that Cordis, man.

[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.400]
He was in New York last week.

[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.900]
That was the excuse when George was on vacation.

[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.000]
He couldn't help us out.

[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:29.940]
And now here it is.

[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.080]
It's already the middle of the week, the new year's starting.

[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.080]
And he's also a, a wall.

[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.100]
Everybody's a wall.

[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.220]
So the new year, baby, it's January the 2th.

[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.620]
The freaking holidays are over.

[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.260]
Thank God.

[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.600]
Man, I hate that time of the year.

[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.580]
I despise it.

[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.400]
Yesterday was so boring and just terminal, just unbelievable.

[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.760]
Although at least New Year's Day isn't as bad as Christmas Day.

[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.280]
If anybody out there doubts that the Glam rule the world, Christmas Day, just about everything is closed.

[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.120]
New Year's Day, at least a lot of places stay open.

[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.320]
Am I right?

[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.380]
Yeah.

[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:01.980]
So.

[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.380]
Thank God you're safe.

[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.000]
I wouldn't know.

[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.580]
24 hour market close to where I live.

[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.040]
That's open.

[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.580]
Just like the shoppers drug markets, also always open holidays.

[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.680]
24 a 7.

[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:12.760]
Forever.

[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.160]
If the world's coming to an end, they're still selling crap.

[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.820]
And that good, that was open on Christmas Day.

[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.760]
Thank God for that.

[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.180]
And they have the Hakanaz Rocky Road.

[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.520]
A point.

[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.980]
That was Christmas Day.

[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.680]
I'm still alive.

[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:28.360]
Good.

[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.340]
Our survey, and it's not full of this survey.

[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.500]
Six eighty five.

[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.720]
Well, no, we should be able to do a thousand on that.

[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.360]
It's just a survey.

[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.920]
It's not even a poll doesn't require an opinion.

[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.560]
We're just asking you about your personal sexual, the hanky panties, your dalliances.

[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.280]
Not sure.

[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.300]
Oh, yeah, I'm not sure.

[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.780]
I'm still thinking about it.

[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.720]
Like you said, it's gay.

[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:53.440]

[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.200]
A wheelie hand.

[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.680]
Not there.

[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.700]
Not sure.

[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.200]
Not there.

[00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:58.640]
Not sure.

[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:58.640]

[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.180]
QAM, hello.

[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:00.780]
One down.

[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.060]
One, two, to go.

[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.320]
Each of you make and you bigger, little girl.

[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.100]
QAM, hello.

[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.140]
How good are you, man?

[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.300]
I'm just a human again.

[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.160]
You're stuck.

[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:15.980]
Over it.

[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:16.620]
Over it.

[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.280]
Over it.

[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.400]

[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.920]
Over it.

[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.480]
Over it.

[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:18.660]

[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.040]
Just intact for the new year.

[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.560]
Robus and more Coke, okay?

[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.320]
Go, go, uh, solve your Craig problem.

[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.400]
QAM, not lying.

[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.440]
I don't know how to do that.

[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:28.860]
Okay.

[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.820]
One more.

[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:31.540]
QAM, hello.

[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.360]
Hey, no, I can do your hair.

[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.520]
We're still waiting for our first real call of the new year.

[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:35.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.060]
You got it right here.

[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.180]
It's the first call of the way right here.

[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.540]
Okay.

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.200]
I got real bad news for you though.

[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:41.920]
Right here.

[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:42.880]
I'm listening.

[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.820]
That course, that guy's back in town.

[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.660]
Yeah, and two.

[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.220]
You're an idiot.

[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:46.940]
You're still more.

[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:47.680]
Uh-huh.

[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.080]
Or as a boyfriend, one of them.

[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.580]
It doesn't matter.

[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.360]
Now.

[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.420]
If it's him or his boyfriend.

[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:52.400]
No, that's right.

[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.280]
Same, the same aroma, same smell.

[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.360]
Might as well be the same aroma.

[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.060]
What?

[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.820]
They might as well be the same person with the same material for lack of a better quality.

[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.260]
So did you find my shnappers or not?

[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.440]
I keep asking that question.

[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.660]
Sorry, uh, it looks like you can, you can't buy online.

[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:07.620]
I'm sorry.

[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:08.640]
Why not?

[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.080]
Because nobody's selling online.

[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.180]
What do you mean by that?

[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.080]
Well, I'm searching the internet.

[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.520]
I found your website for you.

[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.760]
So you find shnappers, uh, yes, meats.

[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.280]
Yeah.

[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:21.960]
Shniders.ca.

[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.040]
Yeah, okay.

[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:23.960]
It's a big crap here.

[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.260]
Yeah.

[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.340]
But, um, it says like, you know, in your community and some of that, you know, maybe, but no,

[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:29.940]
it doesn't tell you anything.

[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.900]
So you're S.O.L. brother.

[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.000]
Well, thanks for trying.

[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:35.740]
I did try.

[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.120]
I'm sorry.

[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.760]
We would order to do a case of it, but, you know, and that means I'm stuck with it.

[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.400]
You wouldn't order me nothing, okay?

[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.560]
Yeah, we would order to and then, uh, on my credit card.

[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.560]
No, it's meant to.

[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.460]
Ah.

[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.960]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.560]
no comment.

[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.380]
So I guess Don Shula is more important than I am, okay?

[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.180]
Hey, guess what?

[00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.200]
I'm still working, Shula.

[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.020]
Maybe not that much longer, but I'm still working.

[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.560]
How about you?

[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:02.860]
You old cout.

[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.360]
You see now, old fart.

[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.960]
See, there's nothing worse than sour grapes.

[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.180]
Ah, the bakery is cheap.

[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:09.640]
Yeah.

[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.960]
You know, you know, you have a childish that sound.

[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:16.240]
I'm sure for an adult, for somebody who's supposed to be an adult, childish.

[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.200]
Give credit where credit is due, okay?

[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.780]
Bill Bollochek is 400 times the coach that you ever wore ever would be, okay?

[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.360]
And he didn't get canned either.

[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.760]
Yeah, he did.

[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.160]
Not in New England.

[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.120]
Oh, New England though.

[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.300]
And Robert Kraft, well, I don't want to go into that.

[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.480]
We don't want to talk about baldy.

[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.900]
And that ridiculous celebration in the press box after they finally won a game after 14

[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.080]
straight losses and they finally won a game.

[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.840]
Wasn't it after 14 or was it after 13?

[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.140]
Um, let's see, it was after 13.

[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.460]
I like how I say it.

[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:51.820]
I think.

[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.360]
See, Robert Kraft is like a real, you know, like he really gives a crap.

[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.180]
Even if he doesn't, he puts on an act.

[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.360]
He doesn't come out and public and say, oh, I'm not in it for the fans.

[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.280]
I'm in it for the money.

[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.300]
I mean, what kind of a statement is that, baldy?

[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:05.600]
Huh?

[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:07.020]
I'm not in it for the fans.

[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.900]
I'm in it for the money.

[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.040]
Sounds like, it sounds like an honest statement.

[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:11.680]
Grotesque.

[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.320]
Yeah, that's true.

[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.500]
Seven out one on our survey.

[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.140]
Now we're going there.

[00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.760]
Exclusively a homo only 45.

[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.560]
Five points, seven percent.

[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.660]
Where have all the homos gone?

[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:21.400]
That's a good song.

[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.480]
Peter Paul Mary or the Kingston trio, which one you like better?

[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.340]
Oh, Kingston.

[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.560]
Let's play, um, MTA.

[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:34.640]
Last week.

[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:35.500]
Huh?

[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.060]
You got it.

[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.640]
A lot.

[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.840]
I think you have it in your...

[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.560]
thing there.

[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.280]
I think you had it.

[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.560]
You had it.

[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.060]
You had it for one day.

[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:43.340]
You do?

[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.780]
The MTA by the Kingston trio.

[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.400]
On Capitol Records, no less.

[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]
Those are the days, babies.

[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.300]
Early 60s folk music.

[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.780]
That's F-O-L-K, by the way.

[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.280]
Mm-hmm.

[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.320]
Hello.

[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.640]
These are the times that try men's souls.

[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.580]
In the course of our nation's history, the people of Boston

[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.200]
are rally bravely whenever they're right,

[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.480]
some men are in the reprimand.

[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.180]
Today, in New Zealand, the Metropolitan Council

[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.240]
is making better honesty and give you a time to look at

[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.960]
burdensome attacks on the population in the form of a subway fair in a priest.

[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.320]
Citizens hear me out.

[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.800]
This could happen to you.

[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.700]
Just don't let me know what you're telling me.

[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.480]
Yeah, I'll say.

[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.060]
Man, the man named Charlie O'Neal and tragic and faithful,

[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:34.600]
named.

[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.020]
He would tend to this in his pocket.

[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.160]
This is why I've been found only when you ride on the MTA.

[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.200]
Well, they'd never return, no, they'd never return.

[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.960]
Land is dead, it's dead, love is a bird.

[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.960]
He may rise forever, meet the speedy, sub-boss, meet the man.

[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.940]
Man, every turn, okay, that's enough.

[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:55.900]
That's more than enough.

[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.520]
MTA, the key to the trio, huh?

[00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.520]
I said I'll say.

[00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.780]
It's good crap.

[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.660]
The biggest name.

[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.200]
The best town in New Car than El Rajek.

[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.420]
4K, 560 QAM.

[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.280]

Give a patriotic nod of approval

[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.900]
to Mr. Iowa Caucus Goer,

[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.140]
A Real American Hero.

[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.440]
Iowa Caucus Goer.

[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.780]
Why can't you guys just not vote

[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:41.880]
like the rest of us?

[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.560]
Yeah, there you go.

[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.600]
1048 at 560 WQM.

[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.400]
We got Jason Jerk's coming up at 2.

[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.420]
That should really be something.

[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:48.940]
You know what I mean?

[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.440]
Kant!

[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.520]
Speaking of Iowa Democratic president

[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.780]
who'll candidate Barack Obama has widened his lead

[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.300]
and Iowa over swillery and jointed

[00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:00.080]
were sitting in the tomorrow's nominating caucuses according to the Des Moines Register's

[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.060]
final Iowa poll.

[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.120]
Obama's rise is the result in part of a dramatic influx of first-time caucus doors, including

[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.740]
a sizable block of political independence.

[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.420]
Both groups prefer Obama, what's been a very competitive campaign, says the Des Moines

[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.380]
Register.com.

[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:19.720]
Obama was the choice of 32 percent up from 28 percent of the last poll in late November,

[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.660]
while Sworey has got 25, he's got 32, she's got 25, and in words 24.

[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.900]
Did you follow those numbers?

[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:26.220]
No.

[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:31.640]
The poll reflux continuing fluidity in the race, even as the end of the year-long campaign

[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:31.960]
years.

[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.160]
I mean, a whole idea.

[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:38.820]
And New Hampshire's a primary in Iowa's caucus, it's a crap.

[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.880]
What word did you say?

[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.360]
You heard what I said.

[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.460]
There should be a national primary day period, get it over with, and stop all this fall

[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:47.720]
to fall.

[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.100]
Okay?

[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.940]
National primary one day.

[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:50.820]
Do it.

[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:52.620]
Stupid.

[00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:53.740]
Iowa, New Hampshire.

[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.620]
Who gives a crap about either one of those states?

[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.260]
Anybody out there care about Iowa?

[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:57.440]
No.

[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:57.940]
Do Hampshire?

[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.400]
No.

[00:47:58.780 --> 00:47:58.780]

[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.400]
And Mike Hockabee, oh brother, he just, you talk about some of you, you look at him and

[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.080]
you see evil.

[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.920]
I'm not sure who looks more evil than me, him or Romney.

[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:08.740]
They both look evil.

[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:10.820]
Romney looks like a TV newscaster.

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:11.980]
He looks like gumboo.

[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.580]
Mike Hockabee, a former Baptist minister writing away the support from Fundamentalist

[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:22.120]
Goyam, talks Mitt Romney for first place in a new Des Moines Register poll of Iowa, is

[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.360]
planning to attend tomorrow's Republican caucuses in a battle of former governors, Hockabee

[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.040]
leads Romney 32 to 26.

[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.000]
32 to 26.

[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.700]
Let's see who else has got numbers on here.

[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.800]
McCain's got 13.

[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.980]
Fred Thompson, 9.

[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:45.540]
Julianne only 5% and Ron Paul, 9.

[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.320]
Got it?

[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:47.940]
Got those numbers?

[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:48.520]
Got it.

[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.220]
Good.

[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:50.220]
Get it.

[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.860]
So that's the latest, you know, from Iowa and I understand a lot of people are saying,

[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.740]
well, who cares about Iowa?

[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.240]
Nobody cares about Iowa.

[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.380]
Even a lot of people who live there, they're probably stuck there like a lot of you in Florida,

[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:00.900]
they're stuck.

[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.580]
They can't get out.

[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.260]
WQAM, hello.

[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.960]
You know, we're a lot alike.

[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:08.740]
Yeah.

[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.300]
WQAM, hello.

[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:10.780]
Hello.

[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:12.460]
Yes, he must be gay too.

[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:13.340]
Hello.

[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.060]
Yes.

[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:19.260]
Yes, is there any way that we can just keep here in the 8th second delay loop over and

[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.640]
over and over and over?

[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.560]
They can't get out.

[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:26.240]
WQAM, hello.

[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.880]
They know we're a lot alike.

[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:28.720]
Yeah.

[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:30.760]
WQAM, hello.

[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.400]
Yeah, keep it all gated.

[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:33.340]
Hello.

[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:34.060]
Yes.

[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.400]
Now what happened to him?

[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:39.460]
I don't know.

[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.920]
We were going to hear the 8th and we got all over it.

[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.060]
We were going to hear it all over it.

[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.700]
All of a sudden something happened.

[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.040]

[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.040]

[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.040]

[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.040]

[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.900]
Probably an active Joe Bell QAM, hello.

[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.700]
Hey, what's up, you know, yes, sir?

[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.560]
Hey, I hear you talk a lot about the machines.

[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.860]
I just wondered if in Canada, when you hit like a jackpot or you know, something for two

[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.020]
three, four thousand is the taxation of the famous here?

[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.120]
There is no tax.

[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:05.380]
Sir, wow.

[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.080]
Are you kidding me?

[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:06.420]
Let me say it again.

[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.040]
Let me say it again.

[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:07.980]
There are no tax on.

[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.700]
Oh, I'm so glad you mentioned that because I got to buy my lotto tickets for tonight.

[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.860]
It's 36 million.

[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:13.480]
Okay.

[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.900]
So in other words, if you hit the lotto, you can just grab all of it and a lot of it.

[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.120]
They give you a check.

[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.680]
They give you a check for the full amount.

[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.320]
There's no tax on gambling winnings.

[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:21.480]
None.

[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.660]
Have a great year, and you have a thing.

[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:23.280]
You too.

[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.380]
Yes, sir, that's a ripoff.

[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.700]
And of course the people, you know, oh, we don't want them.

[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.260]
We don't want those machines here.

[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:30.760]
Those evil ones are bad.

[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:32.940]
Yeah, that's a ripoff, all right.

[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.440]
But let me tell you, the Florida Lottery is the biggest ripoff of all.

[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.380]
Well, we'll give you an annuity.

[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.500]
And like if you're 85 years old, we're going to give you a 20-year annuity.

[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.100]
You should lose so long you're going to collect the money.

[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.220]
Just give me the money now.

[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:47.500]
And if you decide to just take the money now, they can like lap off about 90%.

[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.120]
Oh, we're going to give you 50 bucks.

[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:49.660]
How's that?

[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:52.700]
Big ripoff.

[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.700]
And you know, the public, what are they going to do about it?

[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.400]
They're going to like revolt?

[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.060]
Somebody's call us are.

[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.560]
People aren't they be voting?

[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.680]
WQA and hello.

[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.200]
And you weigh my line one, yes.

[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.780]
Hey, Neil, happy New Year to you and the crew and George.

[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:08.900]
Thanks, you, sir.

[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:14.460]
A quick thing I went to the dolphin game the other day.

[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:20.420]
And besides the performance that was I've seen little league football better than that.

[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.440]
The ambiance in the stadium.

[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.420]
There was no personal.

[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.240]
There was nobody there.

[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.360]
There was enough people there.

[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.900]
And the biggest thing was I'm looking around and we've got ripped off 25 bucks a part.

[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.760]
We've got a couple of beers.

[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.440]
There was $17.

[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.080]
You know, we're spending a lot of the tickets for $80 for the fourth level.

[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:47.300]
And my new year's resolution is I'm giving them at least two years that there's no chance I'm going to go pay that much cash and see.

[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.960]
That's total abomination.

[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.240]
And I mean, the clear lemon couldn't throw a path.

[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.180]
Okay, we'll talk all the sports shows and talk about clear is the lemon.

[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.040]
Okay, I'm not interested.

[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.820]
I don't care.

[00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.600]
Okay, they suck.

[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.500]
That's the bottom line.

[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.020]
They stink.

[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:01.480]
They suck.

[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.420]
They were one in 15.

[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.100]
They were disgrace to the elite.

[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.160]
Okay, they were disgrace to the human race is what they are.

[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.960]
But we got billed par cells.

[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.120]
We got the big tour.

[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.360]
We got the big tour.

[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.800]
And yesterday came and went.

[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:14.840]
I didn't see nothing about what's in them getting fired.

[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.040]
Scan Cameron, did you Chris?

[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.160]
That was a fire yet.

[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:18.300]
Well, why not?

[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.580]
Now the thing they're going to wait for the new GM to come in.

[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:22.880]
Get out of here.

[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.960]
Wait for the new GM and he's going to say, oh, yeah, I want that with silly old man.

[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.380]
It went one in 15 and every decision he made was always wrong and blew up in his face.

[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:30.720]
Yeah, I want to keep him around.

[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.960]
What a joke there is.

[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.480]
I thought the big tour was going to be decisive, man.

[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.440]
I thought he was going to come and kick ass the big tuna.

[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:41.960]
WQA and hello.

[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:43.960]
Hello, Neil.

[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:44.640]
How are you?

[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.460]
Okay, sir.

[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:46.700]
All right.

[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:47.320]
That's good.

[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:51.180]
I just wanted to let you know that I'm sitting in the parking lot waiting for my friend.

[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:51.800]
Yeah, we're my fish.

[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.500]
They're your rectum.

[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:52.880]
I know.

[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.080]
WQA and hello.

[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.200]
Smiling soul.

[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.500]
Let's get...

[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.400]
WQA and hello.

[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:00.880]
Hello.

[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:00.960]

[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:01.440]
No.

[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.140]
Yes.

[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.100]
I just want to let you know.

[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.460]
You know, it's hard for me to spew on this crap that I got a spew.

[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.200]
I'm waiting on the phone this long.

[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.140]
It's completely...

[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.480]
You've got to tighten up.

[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.420]
You've got to tighten up.

[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.400]
Well, I'm pretty...

[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.920]
Yeah, go to Tom off RT building the drills.

[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:20.180]
Okay, go do the tighten up.

[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:20.580]
Smuck.

[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:21.940]
Tighten up your ass.

[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.000]
731 on our survey.

[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.020]
Anybody care?

[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:26.400]
No.

[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.480]
Well, Chris does.

[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.760]
He wants to get to that thousand of the day.

[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.920]
I think he'll do it.

[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:30.460]
It's a survey.

[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.180]
It's not a poll.

[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:35.360]
You can see the self-exclusively hit aosexual 557.

[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.440]
76.1%.

[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.260]
First time we did this.

[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.480]
It was 81.4%.

[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.140]
Bisexual 65.

[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:43.400]
8.8%.

[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.260]
First time we did...

[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.360]
Well, I'm not going to say first time.

[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.420]
Last time we do it.

[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.560]
So that's doubled.

[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.800]
Now, how do you...

[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.580]
Does that mean there are more people in the closet now?

[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.320]
I think that's what that means.

[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.980]
Not sure 42 exclusively homosexual.

[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.580]
45.4% down from...

[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.420]
We lost 2% of our homos, man.

[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.400]
And a sexual 27.

[00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.540]
How about doing it, A?

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:05.860]
Not.

[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.860]
Now, that's a Canadian way.

[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:08.720]
Let's do it, A.

[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.060]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:14.200]
Sounds like I'm listening, doesn't it?

[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.440]
WDQA and Hello.

[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.120]
Yeah, I kneel.

[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:17.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.960]
You got to put on your poll only bang a horse.

[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:21.780]
That's the next choice.

[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.320]
Nah, ah!

[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.200]
Q.A. and Hello.

[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.640]
Q.A. and you can do it.

[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:30.600]
Hello.

[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:31.460]
Yes?

[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.140]
Happy New Year, Neil.

[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.660]
Yes, happy New Year to you, sir, with a phony voice.

[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.080]
How do you do it?

[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.480]
Okay, how are you doing?

[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:39.620]
I'm okay.

[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:40.880]
What do you got, sir?

[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.060]
What do you got? Say something.

[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.960]
I ain't getting up to you.

[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.020]
Yeah, that's obvious.

[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:45.840]
Q.A. and Hello.

[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.000]
Let me tell you something.

[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.780]
The epitomeo...

[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.360]
I have no luck.

[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.660]
The epitomeo of that is the call or radio talk show

[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.260]
and when you have nothing to say.

[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.460]
Yeah.

[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.100]
Not even a crank.

[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.280]
I mean, just have nothing.

[00:54:59.060 --> 00:54:59.820]
That's the stout.

[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.440]
Oh my God.

[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:02.420]
What do you got?

[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.400]
Oh, I have nothing.

[00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:03.960]
I have no luck.

[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.760]
This is a vacuum.

[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.240]
They don't even have anything bad.

[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.100]
They just have nothing.

[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.340]
I just got plenty of nothing.

[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.320]
I have nothing.

[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:15.180]
So anyway, we got Jason Jackson or two.

[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:16.000]
Jason Jerks.

[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.060]
I can't, I don't know.

[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.000]
I feel uncomfortable about call and conversation.

[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.880]
Jerks every year when I promoted sure every day.

[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.200]
But I will promote it two to four.

[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.280]
That's our new lineup today.

[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.380]
And then Mad Dog moves back to four to seven.

[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.400]
And then we invite everybody to tune it out at seven

[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.200]
with that dolphins crap.

[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:29.700]
Dolphins all asses.

[00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.660]
That's part of the price we pay to get the dolphins back on the station

[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.000]
before they went one in fifteen.

[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:35.380]
Nice going, Johnny Jones.

[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.000]
The best talent.

[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.260]
You know his new project.

[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.980]
And the wife's going on a mic on my foot.

[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:40.760]
Q.A.M.

[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:41.860]
B.S. Force.

[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:42.440]
Leader.

[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.400]

John is having a nightmare that he chose the wrong place to watch the football game.

[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.380]
Here you go, doll. There's something in my beard.

[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:24.760]
That's a cigarette-ass. It won't burn you.

[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.320]
John should have chosen hooters. Then his nightmare would be a fantasy.

[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.100]
Can I get you some really good old famous chicken wings with your beard?

[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.560]
Yes you can.

[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:37.640]

But the world famous Hooters girls put a little fantasy in your football.

[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.320]
Hey Ron, how's business?

[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.600]
That's so good. I have new merchandise. I can't get out on display.

[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.540]
And the warehouse is totally out of control.

[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.060]
What are you doing about it?

[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:56.680]
I've got several companies, but no one shows up. They ask me what I want done,

[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:58.120]
but I can't explain it over the phone.

[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:05.740]
Good bye, Dan.

[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:06.800]
Vocal birth.

[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:10.160]
Words crap by ever heard.

[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:15.740]
And you're not going to be missed in the grocery store anymore.

[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:37.760]
I'm going to be a little bit more.

[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:37.760]

[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:37.760]

[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:37.760]

[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:37.760]

[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:37.760]

[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:37.820]
I'm going to be a little bit more.

[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:38.560]
I'm going to be a little bit more.

[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.400]
I'm going to be a little bit more.

[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.440]
I'm going to be a little bit more.

[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:45.700]
I'm going to be a little bit more.

[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:46.460]
Okay.

[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.400]
Good job down!

[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.460]
Well, what good timing, man! I'm QAM. Jeong Dom.

Maury Doz column, Dan or Rain.

[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.740]
How many of Hotsika, how many Talies on our survey?

[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:28.080]
813.

[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.680]
813, like I said, wow, you're gonna make 1,000 today,

[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.960]
and then that'll make us all proud.

[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.440]
What a good way to start the new year, right?

[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:35.580]
Uh-huh.

[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.680]
Maury Doz says, Edith Wessel, Edith, excuse me, Edith.

[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:45.040]
Edith Wessel, the 80-year-old white-haired retired nurse,

[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.240]
moved slowly up the aisle with her walker actor,

[01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.420]
listening to me, who'll remain her pitch.

[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.740]
She told one of the Hillary volunteers

[01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:52.420]
she had great admiration for the senator,

[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:54.600]
but also great doubts about whether her strong negatives

[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.100]
would sink her in the general election.

[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:59.020]
I can't understand why people dislike her so much,

[01:31:59.140 --> 01:31:59.940]
Mrs. Wessel said.

[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.600]
The volunteer assured the waiver in Cockerscore

[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.400]
that the Republicans will slime anyone who gets the nomination,

[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:08.020]
and that Hillary has more experience wrestling than her rivals.

[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:10.080]
Mrs. Wessel is torn.

[01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:12.340]
She likes Obama, but worries about his experience.

[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.420]
She likes Hillary, but worries about her baggage.

[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:18.440]
The presidential anguers here are dancing on the head of a pin.

[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.940]
The Democratic race, three lawyers, married to lawyers who talk too much,

[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.620]
is very tight and very volatile.

[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:26.060]
Even the jittery pack of seasoned political operatives

[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.200]
gazing into their blackberries,

[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:30.100]
doesn't seem to have a clue which way the Iowa snow grips are blowing.

[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.700]
A cross-town Nancy Hibbs, a 50-70-year-old nurse,

[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.280]
came to listen to John Edwards give his son of a mill worker

[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.560]
ran against corporate greed,

[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.180]
complete with a sneer-ended Obama,

[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.260]
that anyone who thinks you can be just nice.

[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.400]
You can just nicely carnivorous Republican fat cats

[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.440]
into submission is in never-neverland.

[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.660]
Mrs. Hibbs has decided after seeing Barack Obama

[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:51.820]
your door had decided that she would vote for him.

[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.240]
She saw him again Monday night in Ames,

[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.160]
and fell even more certain than he was the one.

[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.960]
After listening to Edwards for 40 minutes on Tuesday,

[01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.140]
she often changed her mind, deciding to vote for him.

[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.540]
Bitch, you can tell in his voice he's not playing the game

[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:04.980]
he can hear his moral commitments, you said,

[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.080]
we need a big turnaround.

[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.200]
And what about Hillary? I don't want the same old and French politics

[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:11.400]
she replied adding emphatically,

[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.240]
and I don't want Bill in the White House again.

[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.300]
But Bill very much wants to be in the White House again.

[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.720]
He's going around the state relentless

[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.880]
of giving a speech as tightly choreographed with Hillary's

[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.200]
as the dancing with the stars' routines.

[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.560]
Miss Bill, Vogue Hill reads one button being sold outside the events.

[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.460]
By the time Bill and Hillary are finished with it,

[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.060]
you could be forgiven for thinking that

[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.440]
she had personally forged the peace accord in Northern Ireland

[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.040]
while sucking away the $127 billion Clinton budget surplus

[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:39.140]
and dodging bullets on route 2, ending at the cleansing in Bosnia.

[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.180]
The big dog pushed the experience card hard.

[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:44.820]
Whatever is fiction to happen, whether it's something like 9-11,

[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:47.760]
Katrina or Pakistan, he said, Hillary is better equipped to face it.

[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:48.420]
The big dog.

[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:51.760]
As to the healthcare debacle, he said every president will fail

[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.760]
at something or another, it's how they dust themselves off the counts.

[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.360]
And whether she's learned from her mistakes, the courses at the heart of the matter,

[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.100]
and something that voters can never really know,

[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:01.960]
or even if they study up as much as iron ones.

[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.840]
As Hillary truly changed and grown from her mistakes,

[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.540]
as she learned to be less stubborn and impervious and secretive and vindictive and entitled,

[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.040]
or she merely learned to master off-putting and self-sabotaging qualities better.

[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:17.340]
If elected with the old Hillary pop-up, dragging as factored as dysfunctional Clinton Kingdom,

[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.540]
she is speaking in a soft, measured voice in these final days,

[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.200]
so that with as with Daisy Buchanan, you would have to lean into listen.

[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.560]
But she's really different than she was in the years when she was so careless

[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:33.320]
about the people around her getting hurt by Clinton legal whirlwind that she was dubbed the Daisy Buchanan of a boomer set.

[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.100]
The underlying rationale for her campaign is that she is old.

[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.700]
Old from moving to Arkansas, giving up the name Rotem,

[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.080]
old from pretending to care about place settings and menus,

[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.500]
when she held the unappetizing title of First Lady,

[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:47.600]
old for enduring one humiliation after another at the hands of her husband.

[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:52.000]
Oddly, Barack and Michelle Obama also radiated a sense that they are old,

[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.340]
not for a lifetime of sublimation and humiliation,

[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:58.280]
but for this unresc campaign, for offering themselves up to save an uplift the nation,

[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:00.020]
even though it disrupted their comfortable lives.

[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.700]
Michelle told Vanity Fair that Americans would have only one chance to annoy her husband,

[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:08.580]
allowing it is now or never, and explain there's an inconvenience factor there,

[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:11.920]
and a really, really hard pressure and stress on the family that can only be justified

[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.460]
if her husband can win the presidency and change the world.

[01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:19.820]
She told a group gathered at nursing home in Grinnell on Monday that Barack is one of the smartest people

[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.960]
you'll ever encounter who will dain't wonder this messy thing called politics.

[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:29.420]
So what comes down to this, will Queen Hillary reign, will Prince Barack dain, and who is old more?

[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:34.580]
Who did Mo, that's the question I wonder if Mo would say that, who did Mo?

[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:35.560]
He might.

[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.380]
He probably would, but he's not around anymore.

[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.160]
No, he's not.

[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.040]
What?

[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:40.940]
She'll miss him.

[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:43.040]
Yeah, we do miss the moment.

[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:47.180]
We thought that those days were bad and evil and hateful and stuff like that,

[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:48.960]
but you know what, there was a certain amount of, yeah,

[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.240]
a lot of six twisted fun involved, there was a cavity.

[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.400]
That's right.

[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.520]
As opposed to now, we're doing nothing funny going on in this joint.

[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.480]
Oh, no, no.

[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:57.860]
Sad.

[01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.180]
Nothing funny.

[01:35:59.300 --> 01:35:59.740]
Ragec.

[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:01.280]
Oh my God.

[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:04.500]
A15 on a survey, our sex survey.

[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:08.400]
Maybe there's some of the people out there busy trying to figure it out right now.

[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.600]
Speaking of that, a retired pastor from Canada was sentenced to three years in prison

[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.600]
last week after telling him, a Henry County judge who was sexually harassed by the four-year-old

[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:22.840]
by the four-year-old Lacon Hill's girl he pleaded guilty to molesting.

[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:25.900]
He was sexually harassed by a four-year-old girl.

[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.660]
Kenneth Cook, 73, appeared to have reasonable chance at a probation sentence given his age health,

[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:33.760]
problems in electrocriminal history, heading into a sentencing hearing.

[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.140]
Well, somebody sent this into us, but the problem with that is that this is a story from last week.

[01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:38.900]
Oh.

[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.460]
Because it says the sentencing hearing the Saturday noon.

[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:43.160]
There must be a follow-up to it somewhere, eh?

[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.140]
But the Calgary man who once headed his own ministry, likely blew his chance of avoiding prison when he took a witness stand

[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:52.320]
and painted his preschool age victim as a sexual aggressor.

[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.100]
On a couple of occasions I felt I was sexually harassed Cook said,

[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.160]
I think there is psychological evidence that children even in their younger years can become interested in sex.

[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.560]
He later said he did nothing inappropriate to the girl but pleaded guilty two months ago to avoid putting his family through a trial.

[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:08.200]
Right.

[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:14.720]
Judge Joseph Condon responded harshly telling Cook and Stamen show he has no remorse and he's a threat to young children.

[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:21.580]
It just boggles my mind, Condon said, it's my opinion you have a significant problem and the other four-year-olds have a significant problem around you.

[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.200]
What I'm about to do is necessary for the protection of the public.

[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:28.140]
And of course what he was about to do, we don't know yet because they haven't.

[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.760]
I'm sure somebody will Google it and find the rest of the story.

[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:32.200]
Right. The person who sent that is, what?

[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:32.400]
Right.

[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:33.260]
QAM, hello.

[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:34.260]
I'm Neil Ted.

[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.060]
Ted, stay calm. How you doing?

[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:37.020]
OK, Ted.

[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:40.860]
You know, you had an invention show on last week.

[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.240]
Talking about invention?

[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:44.760]
I beg your pardon?

[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:46.380]
You were talking about invention flash.

[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.700]
Sounds like Reverend Jones to me.

[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.620]
You know, I invented the fake potato of the phone.

[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:51.380]
Yeah.

[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.160]
I think that was a brand new crazy.

[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.340]
Yeah, no, it was not. That was Reverend Jones.

[01:37:59.440 --> 01:37:59.600]
Right.

[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.120]
Doing a voice. He's doing it for the new year.

[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:03.320]
He's starting out on New Leaf.

[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.700]
You know, New Leaf Goat.

[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.440]
That Chris was that him or not.

[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:09.420]
I'm not sure.

[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:10.580]
We're not sure.

[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:11.640]
Well, compare it.

[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.800]
Maybe because you'll call back with some other new invention.

[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.740]
You know, like the phone up is asked.

[01:38:15.860 --> 01:38:16.280]
That would be good.

[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.500]
818 on our survey.

[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:21.580]
You can see to yourself blank exclusively.

[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.560]
Hitler was sexual 629, 76.8%.

[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.060]
So let me compare these percentages now with when we did this the last time.

[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.880]
The last time was 81 and a half.

[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.480]
Bisexual 71, 8.6%, that's almost double what we had before.

[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.100]
Not sure 47.

[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:38.040]
And we had, what is that?

[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.580]
5.7% was 6.7% last time.

[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.620]
Well, that means 1% have finally figured it out.

[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.480]
Exclusively, homosexual 44 only 5.3%.

[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:48.540]
That's down 2%.

[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:50.620]
Where have all the fairies gone?

[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:51.400]
Come on now.

[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.600]
And a sexual 28, which we didn't put on in the first time.

[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:55.540]
I had to bet on.

[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.820]
As in no sex, a...

[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:00.760]
But, as you work the biggest name to the best talent.

[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.020]
You're losing a budget.

[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:03.820]

[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:52.300]
film writers Letterman was lied behind letter when the rating since 1995 has a

[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:56.060]
chance to regain the upper hand as he ventures back with his writing team and

[02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:58.640]
the blessing of the writers go to America and a special deal between the

[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:02.180]

[02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:05.340]
Letterman to return with a full complement of monologue jokes and comedy bits

[02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:08.160]

[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:25.100]

[02:10:35.980 --> 02:10:36.640]
better

[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.400]
this is so great isn't it

[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.620]
oh oh yeah yeah it's your ease

[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:52.540]
I can just picture everybody driving in their cars listening to this

[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:54.180]
turning up for radio now

[02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:58.200]
let's turn it up people

[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:16.000]
you um you actually think uh people listening to this of course it's very exciting to me

[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:19.500]
are you questioning my ability to program directly

[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:20.860]
well not at all

[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:24.360]
I'm just gonna give us another some kind

[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:29.200]
well why should I care anyway I'm earning my thick figures

[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.820]
well earned I would say my lifter now

[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:36.740]
oh yeah I think we uh we got a strong break here

[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:41.760]
stronger stuff I like that but we uh we don't have any spots

[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:46.120]
um okay uh I guess uh just like the audio alone

[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:52.380]
so glad Neil fun now we're just like EFP and me

[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:53.100]
sport

[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:56.120]

[02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:57.240]
the best talent

[02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.540]
you know his nail projects

[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:08.380]

[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:14.780]

What was that noise? Let me take a look at the security moderner Anything to do with sports? Well just a lot of buildings burrowing and carnage, from myόσ generation though

[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:05.280]
proержal

[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:14.740]
Rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rべk, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rookie, rני, r Mister Recky rates are almost burning like we've

[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:27.780]
Very good place to transform into nations that hadn't been completed yet.

[02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:29.580]
This now has been done by only lives and המing.

[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:33.380]
Chances for this fact are that on course New Year'sз always means one thing regarding

[02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:35.020]
the landings we have in all voices like Loyal clutch.

[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:39.960]
Get back to God for this idea of bringing hope to all of these places like that and down

[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:39.960]

[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:42.640]
Yeah, apparently that's the thing that they do.

[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:43.860]
They do that.

[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:46.000]
That's why to celebrate, baby, alright.

[02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:50.700]
And 11-year-old boy playing hide and seek was killed minutes before the new year began,

[02:13:51.020 --> 02:13:54.740]
when the neighbor fired a semi-automatic weapon into an abandoned couch the boy was hiding behind,

[02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:57.820]
outside an Opalach apartment complex they had police said yesterday.

[02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:03.800]
The boy Joshua Aerolego was shot several times, including once in the head and was pronounced dead at the scene.

[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:08.520]
The suspect, Zian Fernandez 49, fled from the apartment complex parking lot,

[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.600]
but later turned himself in to North Miami police and was charged with a kind of manslaughter.

[02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:17.720]
Neighbors said they knew Fernandez had a gun, but it's not clear why he started shooting after sofa.

[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.080]
They knew it's awful, they're dangerous.

[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:25.680]
Joshua's neighbors and family did say Tuesday night, they didn't think Fernandez knew the boy was hiding behind the couch.

[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:29.780]
It's an accident I think said, at Wardo, you mama, Joshua's uncle.

[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:32.820]
You mama?

[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:34.120]
Yeah.

[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.840]
He never meant for the staff and maybe he was drinking said, you mama.

[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:42.640]
Neighbors said gunfire was common in the area of the apartment complex at 132.40,

[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:44.160]
Port Said Road, Port Said.

[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:45.280]
How do you say that?

[02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:47.900]
Say CID, Port Said?

[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:49.500]
Sure, why not?

[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:53.300]
But at first no one paid any attention to mine, especially on New Year's Eve.

[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:54.780]
Gunfire is common.

[02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:59.280]
Everybody does it, says 17-year-old Alexander Kamacho.

[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:00.260]
We always hear it around here.

[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:00.700]
Oh yeah.

[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:08.360]
Around 11-15 PM Monday, Joshua's 15-year-old brother Marvin took a break from a game the boy's called Man Hunt to get a drink of water.

[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:14.380]
When he came back outside, he saw Fernandez standing near his Ford pickup, shooting what looked like a 9-millimeter pistol into a couch,

[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:17.380]
somebody had thrown out here the trash receptacle about 20 feet away.

[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.580]
I didn't do not and he's an interview Tuesday night, but my mom came running out to see what he was saying, where is Joshua?

[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:29.000]
Family members searched the back of the complex, guess what? Joshua wasn't there, then Marvin and a stepfather searched the front.

[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.280]
I saw my brother, Marvin, say he was lying face down in the parking lot behind the discarded sofa.

[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:37.160]
When Marvin picked him up, he saw wound in his head, then the bullet fell out of his mouth.

[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:42.040]
He wished he hadn't seen that, he said, I don't wish that on anybody.

[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:46.800]
Tuesday afternoon there was a light on at the Fernandez apartment, but nobody answered the door, says the hero.

[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.720]
Downstairs, Joshua's extended family was gathering outside his apartment.

[02:15:51.080 --> 02:15:53.100]
His mother was inside to distract us see anyone.

[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:56.220]
U-Mama, his uncle worried there wouldn't be money to bury the boy.

[02:15:56.660 --> 02:16:01.760]
He'd found a place for the funeral home in Crematory, but cost more than five grand for the funeral viewing and everything.

[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:06.180]
He worried that Joshua's mother, a hotel housekeeper and father of mechanic couldn't afford to pay that.

[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:08.840]
U-Mama was trying to start a collection, but it wasn't going well.

[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:15.540]
Here, let's go out on New Year's Eve and shoot out a few lines there, maybe a year, and a show please.

[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:18.440]
You know, it's dumb trees, stuff like that.

[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:19.900]
Anything it's like here, you know.

[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:20.540]
I got a better idea.

[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.300]
What's that?

[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:22.040]
Stay inside.

[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:22.980]
Stay inside.

[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:23.480]
That's what I do.

[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:24.780]
Or if a helmet on your head.

[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:25.820]
That's what I did.

[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:28.780]
I stayed inside with a helmet saccharisal, an old one.

[02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.440]
Eight, eighty one on a survey.

[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:32.400]
It's not, I don't know.

[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:34.820]
You think I was the first day of the New Year.

[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:38.000]
You know, now the holidays are over, people are trying to get back to like normal.

[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:39.380]
Like this one here, QIM.

[02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:43.180]
Um, what house are you?

[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:47.420]
Rack room.

[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:48.160]
The crack problem.

[02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:49.840]
He's just out of control today, man.

[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:52.200]
What do you think it is?

[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:53.240]
You think it's the holidays or something?

[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:56.380]
Maybe the resolution that he made was to have less of a life this year.

[02:16:56.600 --> 02:16:57.900]
Oh, or maybe a lot more drugs.

[02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:59.620]
If that's possible, but I doubt it.

[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:02.860]
Let's see, people who can afford drugs are too busy doing that, you see.

[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:03.120]
Oh.

[02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:06.180]
Somebody QA in, hello.

[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:07.740]
I'll come in over.

[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:12.280]
Like I said, soft Florida, man.

[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:14.380]
First show of the New Year.

[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:16.100]
You think we'd be inundated.

[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:17.320]
Happy New Year, guys.

[02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:18.940]
I hope it's going to be a great year.

[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:20.560]
Best of luck in the out of that place.

[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:25.500]
And thanks for the memories and up your, you know, up your nose with a piece of hose.

[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:26.840]
Like that.

[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.400]
Then we have one lady called today to say anything.

[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:34.140]
Now, very, very hostile place, very unacceptable.

[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:37.940]
So even though it's eighty five million degrees below zero here today, the sun is shining.

[02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:39.840]
At least it looks really nice sitting inside, looking out.

[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:49.480]
And if people are polite and friendly, a little bit too polite and friendly driving a little too slow, a speed it up a little, put a little, uh, something on the pedal.

[02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:53.420]
Like your ass, something kind of they drive slow here.

[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:54.860]
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

[02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:58.220]
There are three speeds, slow, slower and reverse.

[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:03.160]
Which proves, like I've always said, nothing is perfect, man.

[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:06.280]
If you're looking for paradise, I don't care what certain philosophers have said.

[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.340]
Even that one, there ain't no paradise.

[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:10.820]
WDQIM, hello.

[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:14.180]
Well, the weather outside is QAM, hello.

[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:15.320]
Fucker!

[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:16.860]
QAM, hello.

[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:19.740]
It puts the Iowa caucus.

[02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:21.120]
WDQIM, hello.

[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:23.140]
Happy New Year, guys.

[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:25.360]
Best of luck getting the hell out of that place.

[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:26.900]
Bye.

[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:30.280]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:33.760]
You got to feed in the lines, man.

[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:37.120]
Like Jay Leno and Letterman, you got to feed them the lines, you got no material.

[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:39.760]
Just like, uh, you got to feed him a few lines too.

[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:41.480]
And I'm sure he's taking full advantage right now.

[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:43.560]
Maybe somebody's supporting his hand.

[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:46.200]
I got it.

[02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:47.680]
WDQIM, hello.

[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:49.540]
Hey, how you doing, happy New Year.

[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:50.160]
Okay, sir.

[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:51.220]
Back to you.

[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:54.980]
Yeah, I was reading investor Daley and they had an article when they were saying,

[02:18:55.140 --> 02:19:00.760]
one out of four cars, they, uh, could be repossessed, which could even be a bigger problem

[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:03.300]
than the housing problem right now.

[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:06.840]
And also this freeze tonight is going to kill all the Florida produce.

[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:07.600]
I'm out.

[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:10.300]
Okay, thanks for your uplifting call, sir.

[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:13.660]
WDQIM, hello.

[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:15.780]
I'm looking for a fool.

[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:16.880]
So prick.

[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.160]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:25.300]
See, like I said before, I enjoy it.

[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:26.580]
I've reached that point now.

[02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:27.540]
I'm an over-emasicist.

[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:28.960]
I'm absolutely enjoying it.

[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:29.160]
Yeah.

[02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:33.640]
And you, you're just, you're so, you're so, I don't know, jaded at this point anyway,

[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:34.900]
then it doesn't make any difference to you.

[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:35.160]
No, it doesn't.

[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:37.500]
George don't care, okay?

[02:19:37.660 --> 02:19:37.840]
That's right.

[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:41.220]
You probably call them like, uh, very, uh, say anything you want.

[02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:41.940]
What difference does it make?

[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:42.560]
Right.

[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:43.660]
Like that blogger.

[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:46.240]
It's some fat blogger's writing stuff about us.

[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:47.520]
What bloggers, eh?

[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:47.780]
Remember that?

[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:51.000]
You read that thing and you had the, the only person that he liked on the station was the big O.

[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:53.300]
And you ripped you and you ripped me and you ripped a hank.

[02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:54.120]
You ripped everybody else.

[02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:55.500]
Yeah.

[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:56.300]
Remember that?

[02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:57.220]
It's like that.

[02:19:57.220 --> 02:19:58.840]
It's like, I need a college blogger.

[02:19:59.040 --> 02:19:59.840]
Why do you remember that crap though?

[02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:00.360]
That, that's what you're doing.

[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:01.500]
I'll just bring it up as an example.

[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:05.120]
I mean, just barely, vaguely remember fat lifeless holes.

[02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:08.160]
One thing I've learned to do, man, when it comes to a clock, this is all like, I don't need it.

[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:08.540]
Oh yeah.

[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.420]
It's like you turn a key in the lock.

[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:10.960]
Exactly.

[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:13.800]
And you walk out and you just, it's just there.

[02:20:14.020 --> 02:20:15.880]
John, that's what I should do to the studio.

[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:18.980]
Although I don't let the maid, I let the maid vacuum in here, but I don't let her touch not.

[02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:20.780]
Let her dust with a feather duster.

[02:20:20.940 --> 02:20:24.380]
No, in fact, you know something, maybe that's what I'll do in my spare time since I have so much of it.

[02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:25.360]
And you get a feather duster.

[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:26.740]
Oh, you know what else I need to get?

[02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:28.320]
And we haven't done that pull in a long time.

[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:29.860]
It's almost as good as paper or plastic.

[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:31.360]
The body washers soap.

[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:32.160]
Mm-hmm.

[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:34.740]
The fact that there are still people out there using soap.

[02:20:34.940 --> 02:20:36.900]
There's something really wrong about that.

[02:20:37.140 --> 02:20:39.780]
If you're using soap, that means you want to drop it.

[02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:43.240]
You're rich and have the things squawed right out of your hand and oops, drop the soap again.

[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:43.680]
Squawes.

[02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:45.520]
Squawes right out of your hand.

[02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:46.000]
That's right.

[02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:46.700]
There it goes.

[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:47.180]
That wasn't sound.

[02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:47.580]
That was good.

[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:50.780]
There it goes.

[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:51.840]
I squawed too hard.

[02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:53.320]
It was during the last break by the way.

[02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:55.160]
I did go in and squawes pretty hard.

[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:55.700]
Did you?

[02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:57.000]
Didn't have to squawes too hard.

[02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.420]
I don't like you today.

[02:20:58.580 --> 02:20:59.160]
I don't know what it is.

[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:01.560]
Maybe we're getting the last year out of our system.

[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:02.840]
That must be it.

[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:03.980]
Huh?

[02:21:05.060 --> 02:21:05.840]
Yeah, I'm not done.

[02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:08.480]
You're not done?

[02:21:08.620 --> 02:21:09.420]
I might have to go back.

[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:11.420]
Not another lengthy session.

[02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:12.500]
I just don't have no idea.

[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:14.140]
Everybody clear out of the tea room.

[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.900]
George is going to have a gigantic meal.

[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:18.160]
See, I never know how long it's going to take, unlike some people.

[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:19.880]
They'd have it down to an art.

[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:21.780]
Oh, I've got it down to a science maker.

[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:22.780]
Sure.

[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:23.880]
I envy you.

[02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:26.620]
I'm already wiping before I sit down.

[02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:28.180]
I know how long it takes me to do it.

[02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.400]
Everything else.

[02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:31.300]
Except that.

[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:32.720]
I'll be damned.

[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.120]
Let's get the stopwatch for George's next trip.

[02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:36.200]
I can't, baby.

[02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:41.840]
Oil passes $100 a barrel.

[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:42.280]
I'll ride.

[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:45.880]
Bill's the cause and Monica's the China.

[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:50.560]
She lets out a giggle.

[02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:54.200]
When he makes it a way to go.

[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:59.860]
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.

[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:04.640]
But a sick car and her vagina she don't mind.

[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:10.000]
Well, he don't know where a stoke goes.

[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:15.860]
I can see how there was some confusion between humor and joy.

[02:22:15.860 --> 02:22:17.200]
And you made horror.

[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:18.160]
Absolutely.

[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:25.240]
And then I can saw the term Cedar Box means saw her naked.

[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:30.060]
Stars reportedly to go in line.

[02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:35.600]
Now, Clinton, he was working hard.

[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:39.020]
Late nights in the overrear office.

[02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:42.740]
Working on a practical joke.

[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:49.860]
He took him back a new door, put an explode in.

[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:55.320]
Loading for Monica was glowing, rings a smoke.

[02:22:58.140 --> 02:23:01.800]
Bill's the cause and Monica's the China.

[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:02.860]
All right.

[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:06.620]
She lets out a giggle.

[02:23:07.580 --> 02:23:10.100]
Every time he makes it a way to go.

[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:15.900]
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.

[02:23:15.980 --> 02:23:22.540]
But a sick car and her vagina she don't mind.

[02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:29.700]
Well, people feel that Hillary's been made a fool of by her husband.

[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:33.640]
Feel that Hillary was wrong.

[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:40.560]
Up in the Lincoln bedroom she was morning.

[02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:46.200]
Morning, our door was doing her with Bill's old bomb.

[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:52.780]
Bill's the cause and Monica's the China.

[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:57.580]
She lets out a giggle.

[02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:01.680]
Every friggin' time he makes it a way to go.

[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:06.940]
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind.

[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:11.740]
But a sick car and her vagina she don't mind.

[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:12.780]
You're wrong.

[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:14.880]
You can't do your safe and clean.

[02:24:15.360 --> 02:24:17.480]
Yeah, that's master.

[02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:18.820]
It's master.

[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:20.940]
Oh, yeah.

[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:26.680]
What you gotta do is take a tip of real love.

[02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:35.200]
A sick car and her vagina.

[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:37.220]
You're gonna say one thing.

[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:40.740]
The day the James Taylor dies I'm gonna have a big party if I'm still alive.

[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:42.340]
You know, even if I'm just barely hanging on.

[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:44.400]
I'm gonna have a big party I can't stand James Taylor.

[02:24:44.620 --> 02:24:45.040]
Can you?

[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:45.940]
I like him fine.

[02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:47.040]
No, you don't.

[02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:47.420]
Okay.

[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:48.000]
You do?

[02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:50.060]
I don't, neither fish nor foul.

[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:51.640]
I mean, I don't have any of his records.

[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:53.120]
Well, why not?

[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:54.320]
I feel like I'm just fine.

[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:55.680]
I don't dislike him.

[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.240]
It's just that.

[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:58.100]
I've seen fire and I've seen water.

[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.100]
And I'm saying it's not for me, but he ain't good.

[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:01.400]
You know, before your brains out, Bob.

[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:03.720]
You know, it's not for me, but whatever.

[02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:04.560]
Oh, I told Bob.

[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:10.380]
Oil passes $100 a barrel for the first time ever to the concerns about inventories and Nigerian supplies.

[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:14.160]
And we would be remiss and not saying on this first day of the new year, 2008.

[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:16.500]
Thank you, Mr. President, for those low gas prices.

[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:20.940]
You butcher, you bastard, you lunatic, you liar, you murdering knucklehead.

[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:23.360]
All of these things.

[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:25.240]
And I just said it.

[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:26.140]
Thank you so much.

[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:28.220]
So $100 a barrel, so what does that mean?

[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:30.460]
Because you're like about $200 to fill up your gas tank?

[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:30.720]
Sure.

[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:35.180]
I see some bad, bad things coming in the new year.

[02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:36.860]
Like $4 a gallon of gas.

[02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:37.960]
Or pretty close to it.

[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:42.840]
I know too on your survey, by the way, Mr. Havchot, Fant and Leazy.

[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:44.020]
Uh-huh.

[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:49.040]
So now, what were you saying that Shula mentioned my name several times during that conversation?

[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:51.360]
No, I didn't mention him many others.

[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:56.300]
When you look, when you're that fried as he is, when you're in the brainstem,

[02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:57.980]
you think you remember who the hell I am?

[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:00.860]
George has a sound if you want it.

[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:01.980]
The sound of what?

[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:05.300]
What the hell was that?

[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:06.960]
The sound of silence.

[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:08.620]
Now, what was that?

[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:09.600]
That was a raspberry.

[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:14.520]
Do you want to hear the...

[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:16.060]
George has the sound of what?

[02:26:16.660 --> 02:26:18.880]
When you hung up and Shula came on.

[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:20.060]
Yeah, okay, let's hear it.

[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:23.600]
Me and their waving me off on you.

[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:25.700]
Apparently, there's somebody else wants to get on the air.

[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:27.440]
You're going to blow me off already?

[02:26:27.620 --> 02:26:28.340]
I can't do that.

[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:29.560]
Oh my God.

[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:31.820]
I want to know who it is before I think about it.

[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:32.200]
I don't know.

[02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:34.600]
Oh, it's not Shula.

[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:36.360]
Oh, see that in the way, man.

[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:36.840]
Put it out.

[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.140]
Stop that right there, okay?

[02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:39.520]
I'm going to quit ripping the Patriots.

[02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:40.740]
It sounds like I'm raped.

[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.040]
Got all of my money.

[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:43.700]
Okay, we're listening.

[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:44.720]
Yeah.

[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:47.080]
You see, you're telling me that it was Hank's decision?

[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:51.420]
They're waving me off already because they got somebody much more important on the phone,

[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:53.160]
meaning the brainstem, Shula.

[02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:59.200]
They, as in your close personal friend, Allison, who prodded and pleaded...

[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:01.120]
Don Shula, I have a call.

[02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:02.540]
...for me to call it and hop around the show.

[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:05.220]
You know, he and I, you know, it's said goodbye to my show Monday morning.

[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:05.880]
That wasn't good enough.

[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.640]
No call in the hump or okay, which I was more than my pleasure to do it.

[02:27:10.460 --> 02:27:11.900]
And she waved me off.

[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:13.040]
Okay, well guess what, Allison.

[02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:13.880]
It was her.

[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:15.540]
But yeah, it probably was.

[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:16.340]
Of course it was.

[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:17.660]
She produces his show or did.

[02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:18.980]
Now, who's here to see producer now?

[02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:20.760]
Mad Dogs, I think.

[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:23.400]
Well, who is this producer before?

[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:26.140]
Well, Curtis is his board-opened producer.

[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:26.720]
Yeah.

[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:29.900]
And Allison was working with Curtis on...

[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:31.860]
I think she was working on Curtis.

[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:33.040]
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:35.740]
Yeah.

[02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:38.080]
So I think Shula's now moving with her.

[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:38.180]

[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:39.680]
I think she's now moving to a magazine.

[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:40.300]
Working guests.

[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:45.240]
I thought that Sister Mary Mandish is the one guy that had the balls to say the call.

[02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:46.520]
I don't do guests.

[02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:47.360]
That I believe in guests.

[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:48.220]
And you always say that?

[02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:48.980]
I don't know what he said.

[02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:53.100]
And are they inundating him now with stupid ass guests with more of these dumb jocks?

[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:54.720]
Well, where is her name on the schedule?

[02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:58.220]
It's on the Jack Show.

[02:27:58.460 --> 02:27:59.140]
Okay, then the good word.

[02:27:59.140 --> 02:28:00.140]
Allison and Sumit.

[02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:01.380]
Who the hell is Sumit?

[02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:04.740]
That's a new board-op that Jason is.

[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:11.040]
A new board-op that Jason knows?

[02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:12.480]
Yes, he's a friend of Jason's.

[02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:16.660]
What is that?

[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:22.940]
It's like when Mulbrough and that Israeli kid from New York, remember that?

[02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:23.720]
Shy.

[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:24.620]
Shy?

[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:25.840]
What the hell happened to him?

[02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:26.560]
Did he shy away?

[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:28.200]
Or fly away?

[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:29.560]
I think he was fired.

[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:30.380]
That's right.

[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:31.900]
He was fired for what?

[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:32.580]
He was being judged.

[02:28:32.580 --> 02:28:33.200]
No, for good.

[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:34.340]
No problem with the Marlins or something.

[02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:35.600]
Uh-oh, you know what?

[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:39.420]
Something came up with the Marlins that the Marlins complained about himself.

[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:41.040]
Yeah, that was a good guy.

[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:41.560]
He was worth.

[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:43.440]
He was in his really good right.

[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:45.740]
But he was a really good guy.

[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:46.640]
He was a really good guy.

[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:47.680]
I was probably some good as really.

[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:49.000]
I have a man named him.

[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:49.940]
I met that one.

[02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:50.860]
How do you like that?

[02:28:50.940 --> 02:28:53.340]
He was Jewish and he got candy, QA and motor coincident.

[02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:54.880]
Oh my God.

[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:57.080]
Because the Marlins got been under shape.

[02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:59.580]
When you know the way it goes, we made all that money on the Marlins.

[02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:01.780]
Not lost our ass on the Marlins did.

[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:08.720]
With six days to go until the New Hampshire primary, there are ties and pull results for the top candidates in both parties.

[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:12.300]
You know, I'm thinking to myself during this last Bill Cigar thing I'm playing.

[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:14.260]
This is the best we can do.

[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:17.340]
Every four years, I think that to myself.

[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:19.780]
Three hundred million people.

[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:21.120]
These are the best and the brightest.

[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:22.500]
This is the best we can.

[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:24.360]
I mean, I like Barack Obama, but you're right about that.

[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:27.660]
He's got about as much chance of getting elected as great as Pymard.

[02:29:27.660 --> 02:29:29.300]
He's articulate. He's got charisma.

[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:30.260]
He's got a good idea.

[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:33.640]
Yeah, he's the wrong color ain't nobody can shave for him.

[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:34.060]
He's the bottom man.

[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:38.100]
And you know, you hear the scuttle, but even the black people don't consider him black enough.

[02:29:38.220 --> 02:29:39.340]
So he's not even going to get their vote.

[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:40.100]
He's too black.

[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:41.080]
He's not African American.

[02:29:41.420 --> 02:29:44.800]
He's only half this and the black is the wrong kind of black from the wrong place.

[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:47.200]
If he could be more like a shade like Lester Hoek.

[02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:48.580]
Right, because he's an African.

[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:51.260]
His parents were never, you know, his ancestors were never slaves.

[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:52.440]
Can I continue with this poor?

[02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:53.180]
Yeah, I want to.

[02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:55.520]
You know, in fact, I'd like you to finish the show.

[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:55.960]
No.

[02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:57.980]
With roughly a quarter of those...

[02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:01.620]
I mean, no, thank you.

[02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:02.800]
Oh, you're welcome.

[02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:06.740]
With roughly a quarter of those pulled in both parties saying they won't make up their mind till the election,

[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:10.620]
both the Democratic and Republican presidential nomination raises the rougher grabs into a Hampshire.

[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:14.180]
Oh, let's go to New Hampshire, man, where they're real craggie.

[02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:18.720]
Senator John McKaynevere, a zone whose campaign was languishing six months ago,

[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:21.880]
and former Massachusetts government, Ron Nairn, not a tie for first,

[02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:25.520]
with each grabbing 29% of likely Republican and the primary voters.

[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:29.220]
The CNNWMU are pulled connected by the University of New Hampshire found,

[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:32.340]
formerly, or Mayor Rudy Giuliani, is at only 12%.

[02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:39.400]
And Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, 10% far-bison, Bible-thumping, bigoted lunatic, liar, phony.

[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:41.660]
Well, I got an attack, but I'm not going to run it.

[02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:45.220]
I'll let you guys the media see it, but who the hell's he can?

[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:48.560]
It's McCain come back.

[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:49.880]
His new hand, you want to know why?

[02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:53.180]
Because what I just got through saying, because the field is so lackluster,

[02:30:53.580 --> 02:30:56.680]
that even a crazy man like McCain seems plausible at this point.

[02:30:57.840 --> 02:31:01.560]
His New Hampshire support dropped abruptly over the summer when his campaign nearly ran out of money,

[02:31:01.860 --> 02:31:05.940]
but he's made steady gains since then, senior analyst Bill Schneider was seen in and said,

[02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:09.740]
a king was tied with Giuliani for leading New Hampshire in February and March.

[02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:12.320]
By July, he dropped to fourth place with just 12%,

[02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:17.000]
most of the political world left McCain for dead after cash problems forced him to cut his staff.

[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.600]
McCain shared the voters grow steadily through December, and the polls suggested it's come at the expense of Giuliani.

[02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:26.940]
Like Joe Biden says, every speech by Giuliani, it's a noun of verb and 9-11.

[02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:32.840]
For the first time, GOP primary voters see McCain and not Giuliani as best able to handle terrorism,

[02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:36.640]
and a whopping 53% feel he could do the best job with the war in Iraq.

[02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:40.480]
Romney has a major advantage on the economy and illegal immigration,

[02:31:40.780 --> 02:31:44.980]
but it comes to the personal qualities of the two men, McCain's take it lead on experience and see this more honest.

[02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:50.200]
On the Democratic side, Swellery's got a four-part leader, Borabama, 34% to 30%,

[02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:53.540]
among likely voters, but if you take into account this survey sampling error,

[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:54.780]
it's a statistical dead heat.

[02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:57.200]
John Edward's 17%.

[02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:01.400]
There's only one thing about John Edward, he's got going for me, or what that is.

[02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:03.640]
He's electable because he's a Jewelian Yehu.

[02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:04.060]
There you go.

[02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:06.680]
Here's the white color of the guy he's ever.

[02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:08.240]
The white color of the Gittle Boy.

[02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:10.380]
420-560 QAM.

[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:12.180]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:27.980]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:27.980 --> 02:32:28.000]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:28.000]

[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:28.000]

[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:28.000]

[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.520]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:29.520]

[02:32:29.520 --> 02:32:29.520]

[02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:33.000]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:33.000]

[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:33.000]

[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:38.220]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:38.220 --> 02:32:44.380]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:44.380 --> 02:32:44.660]
The fourth leader.

[02:32:44.660 --> 02:33:14.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:33:14.660 --> 02:33:44.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:33:44.660 --> 02:34:14.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:44.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:34:44.660 --> 02:35:14.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:44.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:35:44.660 --> 02:36:14.640]
The fourth leader.

[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:24.780]
The fourth leader.

[02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780]

[02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780]

[02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780]

[02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780]

[02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:25.760]
Is that thing real?

[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:28.160]
No.

[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:32.380]
The fourth leader.

[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:34.620]
The fourth leader.

[02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:34.980]
The third leader.

[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:36.160]
I turn 13.

[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:40.320]
I'm a last birthday.

[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:46.560]
Daddy bought me a doll.

[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:50.020]
And he told me to play.

[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:57.880]
I wonder what daddy'd say.

[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:02.220]
If he knew I got 69 emails today.

[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:09.460]
But my name, my age, my face, is posted on my face.

[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:14.140]
I got out of prison.

[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:17.320]
Oh, in 1982.

[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:27.100]
I was called at the playground with a kid or two.

[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:34.460]
I used the internet.

[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:36.540]
I emailed him today.

[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.820]
And tomorrow I'm wet.

[02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:45.880]
Because her name, her age, her face is posted on my face.

[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:47.380]
My face.

[02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:50.020]
Hey, baby.

[02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:53.260]
You know, you're really mature for your age.

[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.500]
How about we meet in person.

[02:37:56.820 --> 02:37:57.080]
How about we meet in person.

[02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:58.500]
And our figure doesn't watch.

[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:09.220]
I'm not standing and saying what this baby will will of every onion's health.

[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:11.920]
Yeah, I'm pretty smelly, you know that

[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:14.940]
I'm so, I'm gonna take what I'm doing

[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:17.880]
Let me have some more

[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:21.940]
Only of the video shop

[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.340]
But just don't tell your folks

[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.680]
And this bastard don't tell the cops

[02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:34.000]
Whoa

[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:38.320]
He said I'm wanting a man

[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:39.060]
That's right

[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:41.540]
All ain't sex, it's a prank

[02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:42.900]
And it ain't fair

[02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:46.320]
Money, baby, my age, my age

[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:51.480]
Go stay gone, my age, my age

[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:54.680]
He goes to his county market and only one place

[02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:58.800]
And he's headed now, he didn't know I wore a brazen

[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:06.740]
1247-13-1 at 560 W. Femitz, the debut of the Jason Jackson show

[02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:08.160]
1247-2-4 on QAN

[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:08.800]
Oh my god

[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:10.000]
That's what a lot of people are saying

[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:11.760]
Are you gonna be tuned in today?

[02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:12.980]
What are you talking to?

[02:39:13.340 --> 02:39:14.540]
Oh, you, you of course

[02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:18.080]
I wonder who this could be, WQAN

[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:19.880]
Hey, no, I'll be there

[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.240]
And back to you

[02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:22.960]
Thank you, we are the rest of that collar one

[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:23.940]
The hair show is response

[02:39:24.540 --> 02:39:26.180]
This is response to one

[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:28.560]
Oh yeah, that's right, I chopped your job

[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:33.520]
Okay, and don't let me forget to play a Robi Rance for Anthony the UPS driver Connecticut

[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:36.920]
This is birthday, oh and I should probably give him one of these too

[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:39.080]
No extra charge, Tony, here it is

[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:41.000]
What do you want to hear?

[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:42.300]
Why do you want to hear the rest of the show thing?

[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:43.460]
Can you do it?

[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:44.780]
I'm like Saurid rapes

[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:46.100]
Oh, I'm telling you

[02:39:46.100 --> 02:39:46.920]
Got all of my money

[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:48.020]
Okay, we're listening to you

[02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:48.680]
Hey, all of the best

[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:49.480]
Hey, thanks, Neil

[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:51.400]
Like we said this morning and keep in touch

[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:52.600]
Okay, I certainly will

[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:53.320]
Have a great year, Hank

[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:54.200]
A little best to you

[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:54.580]
Thanks

[02:39:54.580 --> 02:39:55.360]
Neil Rogers

[02:39:56.480 --> 02:39:56.800]
Coach

[02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:58.820]
Hey, hey, how are you doing?

[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:01.660]
I had to drop Neil Rogers, he'll be ripping me tomorrow now

[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:06.460]
Hey, listen, the guy that was just not, thinks it's okay for New England to cheat, huh?

[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:08.620]
That was Neil Rogers done

[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:09.920]
That guy

[02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:11.560]
Anyway, how you doing, coach?

[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:12.720]
You doing great, good, good

[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:14.720]
That guy is a silent, this guy

[02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:17.440]
That was Neil Rogers, that guy

[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:19.780]
The response from the brainstem is silence

[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:21.420]
Silence

[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:23.660]
I don't know who that is, that hell you don't

[02:40:25.980 --> 02:40:28.260]
You remember when we were at IOD and he got all bent out of shape?

[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:30.360]
Who was doing the coach's show after Hank would do it?

[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:32.000]
I don't know, is that he heard

[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:33.900]
Was it sunny?

[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:35.920]
No, it wasn't sunny, was somebody did the coach's show?

[02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:36.940]
Back, was it Renery?

[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:38.060]
Oh, it was Renery

[02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:38.400]
Okay

[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:44.060]
And he didn't like the fact that Renery hadn't seen the game or he didn't like the question he was asking

[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:47.260]
And he had a Yanke him off of that thing and put somebody else's son in remember that?

[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:47.580]
Right

[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:52.040]
You take yourself much too seriously brainstem, let me tell you that right now

[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.240]
Much too seriously, sour puss if you asked me

[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:56.420]
I just wasn't conscious

[02:40:56.920 --> 02:40:59.260]
Done, Sula, I had him

[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.520]
Thanks honey, you're welcome

[02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:05.420]
God, you don't want to think about him?

[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:06.320]
We need some help

[02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:06.520]
Yeah

[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:10.260]
Anyway, let's just forget about the brainstem, okay?

[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:11.220]
About the shoes, myster?

[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:15.000]
Because it's all about Sula and Marino, it's all about living in the past

[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:18.440]
Because the organization, well we got the parcels that are coming up now

[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:19.560]
You know something, Chris?

[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:20.700]
What's that?

[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:26.240]
If the parcel, oh I guess who I saw several times over the holidays doing the live spot, I mean not a live spot

[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:29.860]
I got live spots on the brain, not on the show but on the brain

[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:34.160]
But I do want to spot for some energy bar, you probably see this spot

[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:34.900]
Really?

[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:37.260]
Really, no I haven't seen that

[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:39.600]
He looks pretty good to me and I don't spot Brady Quinn

[02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:45.120]
I don't see John, what's the name, Beck doing any live spots?

[02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:50.160]
Unless they're going to be doing live spots for dropping a football, maybe they'll have one for that

[02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:50.960]
Maybe

[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:55.900]
Well what I started to ask you is if the parcels era turns out to be a big tuna

[02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:58.900]
I turned out to be a dead rotten fish, what's going to happen then?

[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:00.600]
Then they start over again

[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:03.860]
I just know what they're doing now starting over again

[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:04.780]
That's why I said again

[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:07.500]
Come on, let's get rid of that Scam Scammering guy, okay?

[02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:11.460]
As much as I love the Patriots and anything bad happens that often makes me happy

[02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:14.620]
Nevertheless, I mean, come on man, what are you waiting on?

[02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:16.020]
He's waiting for the new GM

[02:42:17.140 --> 02:42:20.020]
You think anybody with a half of brain is going to keep Scam in the camera?

[02:42:20.020 --> 02:42:24.600]
Scam camera is the football with Joe Bell is already losing written all over him

[02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:30.480]
But he's on the phone again, he's talking upstairs, he's talking to the coaches upstairs on his phone

[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:35.180]
They're losing 87 to 3 but Scamster is on the phone

[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:40.080]
God, what are we going to do about these, but did you go in and ask parents about the engineer?

[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.040]
No, but I wrote it down, so what I see him

[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:43.980]
Yeah, tomorrow morning

[02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:46.160]
I won't be in this...

[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:47.820]
I mean, I could try to find out

[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:52.640]
Tomorrow, I'll accomplish his outbreak because he need a certain tool as you know

[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:55.280]
To get these little buttons off here

[02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:56.400]
Should always have the right tool

[02:42:57.240 --> 02:42:58.380]
I ain't got the right tool

[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:01.640]
Oh, and look at that, the light just went on again

[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:04.560]
It keeps flickering, which means the bulb is going, you know?

[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:10.740]
I mean, once upon a time, a couple years ago, the engineer up here came in and he swapped out all the bulbs, maybe like three years ago

[02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:12.840]
And I was fine, and lasted for a long time

[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:14.360]
But now they've got to be replaced again

[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:15.600]
I know, I paid expense

[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:18.580]
The delay pot, the bulbs, what else? I'm making a list

[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:22.680]
That's it, that's all we need right now, and then I can think of it, it's all broken so far

[02:43:23.560 --> 02:43:23.900]
Intercom

[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:26.660]
And the innercom, that's right

[02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:28.140]
Yeah, yeah

[02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:30.880]
The innercom, that not only doesn't work, but it goes on the air

[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:31.920]
Let's try it

[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:35.260]
Okay, how does this sound? Is this on the air?

[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:36.780]
Yeah, that was on the air?

[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:37.780]
Yeah, I guess so

[02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:39.740]
That was my mic close, that was the innercom

[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:45.340]
That's supposed to be for me to talk to Chris back and forth about the innercom

[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.180]
Oh, my God

[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:51.520]
See, this is Norma again, see?

[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:57.200]
Norma, who actually was in the Lake Belief Radio and played radio for a long time on the light bulb, who oughta know about these things

[02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:05.020]
And oughta be holding their feet to the far at least on a minimum of things like this, if I'm going to be here another week, another month, another year, whatever it's going to be in Norma

[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:10.600]
Oh, it's New Year's Eve, it's Christmas Eve, it's a Tissue ball of it, yeah, right

[02:44:11.980 --> 02:44:15.320]
Property taxes didn't drop like a rock during Governor Charlie Christ's get

[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:20.320]
First year in office, but neither is approval rating, how do you like that? They like them, of course they like this predecessor too

[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:22.460]
They loved this a fat ass jet bush

[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:29.300]
The Republican weather, the difficult year well, despite making only modest gains of two of the issues he championed most during his campaign

[02:44:29.300 --> 02:44:31.940]
Lowering property taxes and property insurance rates

[02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:37.460]
His approval rating did drop, it almost had to, having reached 73% in July, wow

[02:44:38.940 --> 02:44:44.340]
73% but even with more than a billion dollars in budget cuts, property insurance rates they were made high and property tax cuts

[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:47.620]
It didn't return much to people's wallets, Christ was given a thumbs up

[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:53.360]
A thumbs up the rectum by 65% of respondents in October pulled by Quinnipiac University

[02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:57.280]
People know their tough problems and don't let themselves to quick easy solutions

[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:00.540]
But he's getting good marks for the fact that he's trying for the fact that he's gay

[02:45:00.540 --> 02:45:04.740]
And he's trying through bringing people together rather than my way the highway said, Bobby Graham

[02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:08.180]
Who served as two-timbers governor before serving three-terms in the Senate

[02:45:08.180 --> 02:45:10.740]
Go old Bobby Graham, at least he's still alive, you know

[02:45:12.300 --> 02:45:20.080]
He changed the tone of Thalahasse Graham said, Christ is a very open person who normally listens to but solicits advice from a lot of different perspectives

[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:22.420]
He's an open person, I don't think he meant that

[02:45:22.420 --> 02:45:24.980]
I wonder if he's got a very wide stance like Larry Craig

[02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:26.600]
I don't know

[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:31.720]
That'd be a good poll question, who's got the wider stance in their pants?

[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:34.840]
Mark Foley, Charlie Christ, or Larry Craig

[02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:39.660]
938 on the survey, by the way, you're going to make a thousand Mr. Hodgschot

[02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:42.440]
Oh, we're out of town, we ought to have like 15 hundred on there easy

[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:45.620]
Back in the day, remember those days when we had an audience?

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:47.940]
No, it's a long time, QAN, hello

[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:49.160]
Hello, Neil

[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:50.040]
Yes sir

[02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:58.020]
I was just wondering if you had the opportunity to eat at a place called Happy Barbeque in Highly A

[02:45:58.020 --> 02:46:01.120]
Never heard of it sir, and I eat with my teeth in, okay? I don't take my teeth out these

[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:08.460]
I see, wow, it's a very good dish and I'd like to recommend it to you and any of you

[02:46:08.460 --> 02:46:10.480]
For happy birthday

[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:15.140]
Yeah, well let me make a suggestion to you, okay sir, don't steal the silverware

[02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:16.300]
But silverware

[02:46:16.860 --> 02:46:22.040]
Don't steal the silverware, the forks, the knives, the spoons, get out of here, you old fart

[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:25.800]
I'll see that, he's so mean to the collar, is that it?

[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:31.360]
Yeah, right, that's your idea of a talk show with some grizzled, 900-year-old fart that's giving me an awesome evidence

[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:35.540]
Probably I got some kid as a dishwasher there in a restaurant, some great, great, great grand kid

[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:38.020]
WDQA, and hello

[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:40.560]
MENCY-AM, MENCY-AM

[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:41.620]
QAN, hello

[02:46:41.620 --> 02:46:44.820]
Or GENCY-GARS

[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:48.700]
QAN, hello

[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:51.700]
I'm a TOSTA-PATER

[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:55.100]
Yeah, you can say that again, that's for damn sure

[02:46:57.100 --> 02:47:02.020]
942 on our sexual survey out there, and boy these people on the phone, you can be damn sure they're in the A-Sexual party

[02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:04.540]
At least that's what they ought to be voting

[02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:07.340]
Do you want me to say it?

[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:08.020]
A lot of

[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:11.820]
In fact, Sarah Loem, I don't think I'd like that thing about doing the board here, not the right

[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:16.360]
And they're the light one out again on a mic, now it's back on because I have to turn it off, put it back on again

[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:17.860]
Oh, why should I be the only one?

[02:47:17.860 --> 02:47:22.700]
Yeah, that's right, why should George be the only one who suffers through stuff that's been broken and they don't want to fix it

[02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:25.620]
Because it might cost him a dime for a new light bulb on it at the pot

[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:26.320]
Right

[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.400]
The bulb on George's pot doesn't light up either

[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:32.480]
Really?

[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:33.980]
We're still talking about the same thing?

[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:34.400]
Uh-huh

[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:36.480]
Yeah, we're talking about having pot problems

[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:41.920]
This is on, this is not a tumor, it's the ones that two hours

[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:47.320]
You people are just damn bad, if not only you have to be watered by that, then it's passion

[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:54.120]
But if I wanted to buy some time on your station, I couldn't, you don't have real people that send, uh, you have to worry

[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:55.900]
You don't have it on your regular number?

[02:47:56.420 --> 02:48:00.500]
I always have to be a guest, I'm one of your talk shows, or an acting at your AM at WIOD

[02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:03.560]
They won't even throw me back to tell me what the name of the show is

[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:09.280]
My work on your station in 1964, I was sort of prominent guy in Miami

[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:12.480]
I buy time, and I influence people by time

[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:19.080]
If you people can't get it together to be a better radio station, then if you work on our ad station or an EBS station

[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:25.540]
I suggest you take your damn frequency, which my grandmother's friend Jesse Jay put on the air in 1926

[02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:28.620]
And you turn the damn thing off and get out of the business

[02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:32.220]
You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves, my name is Robyn Young

[02:48:32.220 --> 02:48:36.540]
And the telephone number is a motel in Miami, room 13

[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:41.320]
You people ought to be ashamed, you shouldn't even be running that facility

[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:45.060]
I used to be the boss of the damn thing in 1926

[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:48.040]
I ran to the damn thing and I was wearing a mask

[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:52.180]
You are terrible, you have no credibility in the radio

[02:48:52.180 --> 02:48:55.420]
Now, I damn it all to death before I get on the phone detention

[02:48:55.420 --> 02:48:58.680]
You get on the phone to me, and you get me to take this gun

[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:01.840]
I'm gonna throw a lot more if the sale goes through

[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:03.740]
But it will be because you're doing anyhow

[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:06.220]
There you go, Robyn goes nuts

[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:11.040]
Okay, I just came up with a little improvisation here, how does that sound?

[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:11.660]
That sounds fine

[02:49:11.660 --> 02:49:12.560]
Does it really?

[02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:15.480]
Sure, we'll see that's the guest mic, which I never use

[02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:18.120]
Well, that pot works as it's never been turned on

[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:19.840]
And yet it's a little different somehow

[02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:22.700]
That's why I was gonna ask, is it better or is it worse?

[02:49:23.300 --> 02:49:24.580]
I don't want something like YOLLY

[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:28.280]
No, no, it's got like, I don't know some of the words

[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:29.200]
Like, we were to it or something?

[02:49:29.540 --> 02:49:30.640]
It's got a little reverb to it?

[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:31.480]
Maybe now

[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:33.360]
Oh wow, yeah, now it's got a lot

[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:37.100]
Alright, so that's what I'm gonna do because this is the one

[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:40.080]
Evidently, we're not gonna get a engineering assistants here in the studio

[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:44.880]
Which of course is just a grotesque and totally unprofessional unacceptable

[02:49:44.880 --> 02:49:47.140]
But Norma's too busy, we're gonna about it so

[02:49:47.140 --> 02:49:49.940]
Well, it's the holidays, you know, it's all cheese, you know

[02:49:49.940 --> 02:49:51.740]
It's the holidays season

[02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:53.320]
Yeah, so hip-hop

[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:54.060]
That's what I got

[02:49:54.060 --> 02:49:55.000]
And whoop-dew

[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.540]
Some people got a real person for an agent, I got a flower

[02:49:58.100 --> 02:49:59.800]
Pants, excuse me now, I gotta go poo

[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:01.940]
WDQ not again, QAM hello

[02:50:01.940 --> 02:50:02.880]
Hello, Neil

[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:03.720]
Yes, sir

[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:04.840]
How are you doing today?

[02:50:04.840 --> 02:50:06.980]
Good, how do I sound on this microphone, sir?

[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:08.780]
You sound excellent, Neil

[02:50:08.780 --> 02:50:09.420]
Yes, I do

[02:50:09.760 --> 02:50:11.420]
You've never sounded better in your life

[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:15.380]
I had a question, I know you eat in a root crisp, I've eaten in a root crisp steak

[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:16.960]
You've eaten there, yeah?

[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:19.740]
Yeah, it's very good, actually that's not as Vegas

[02:50:20.260 --> 02:50:23.140]
Anyways, have you ever been to Ziggy and Matt goes here?

[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:26.460]
Yeah, I don't wanna hear about Vegas, I don't wanna hear about your slot, either, okay, Schmuck?

[02:50:26.820 --> 02:50:27.400]
No kidding

[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:30.140]
WDQ, A.M, hello

[02:50:30.740 --> 02:50:31.360]
Hi, Neil

[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:32.240]
Yes, sir

[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:33.920]
Problem solved, I heard through

[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:35.420]
You're a problem, alright, I get it

[02:50:35.420 --> 02:50:37.520]
Put the period at the end of the first word there, okay?

[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:40.400]
You're a problem, not a solver, just a problem

[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:43.980]
9.52 on a survey, when we get to a thousand, I'm not giving the results

[02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:46.260]
Yeah, this mic seems more vibrant, more alive

[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:48.740]
You know what, doesn't it?

[02:50:48.820 --> 02:50:49.920]
Or is it just my imagination?

[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.020]
It was just my mind

[02:50:51.020 --> 02:50:56.280]
It could be the reverb or the whatever echo coming from the speakers, I'm not sure, but it's a little bit different

[02:50:57.520 --> 02:50:58.660]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:01.500]
I mean, I haven't adjusted the overhead, it's the same where it was before

[02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:05.020]
What would you be talking about, Mr. Howe?

[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:08.020]
And what does that have to do with ball games and jockstraps and coaches?

[02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:09.100]
Hey coach, go!

[02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:12.660]
Nothing, all the way Greg Lowe will be in touch with you, George already spoke to him

[02:51:13.140 --> 02:51:17.520]
Well, thank God for that, he's a real engineer, Greg Lowe, he does a good job here

[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:24.220]
How many weeks and months of gnashing and screaming and begging to this take, huh?

[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:25.900]
To finally maybe get an engineer up here?

[02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:31.100]
Which I don't wanna again give the reasons why he isn't coming here, but there's a lot of rumors about that

[02:51:31.980 --> 02:51:34.620]
WDQ-YM has got nothing to do with me either, Q-YM Hello

[02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:38.380]
I want Mirsch loves to tend to squal me

[02:51:39.640 --> 02:51:41.540]
Yeah, ah, ah!

[02:51:42.320 --> 02:51:43.400]
WDQ-YM Hello

[02:51:44.100 --> 02:51:46.100]
George is very scared, why does he...

[02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:48.600]
WDQ-YM Hello

[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:50.540]
Hello, I'm Antomano

[02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:52.220]
Q-YM Hello

[02:51:52.220 --> 02:51:53.780]
Are we politicians, please be careful

[02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:55.340]
WDQ-YM Hello

[02:51:55.340 --> 02:51:57.480]
Oh, he had no material there for your boyfriend

[02:51:59.740 --> 02:52:00.540]
You know what's that?

[02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:02.100]
No, not new

[02:52:02.100 --> 02:52:03.480]
What? Not new

[02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:08.200]
I think all the new year people are like, you know, trying out some new stuff for the new year

[02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:12.600]
Of course it won't change next week or next month or seven weeks from Sookas, it'll still be the same

[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:14.600]
Like this one, Q-YM

[02:52:15.620 --> 02:52:17.480]
I mean, just the fact that...

[02:52:18.300 --> 02:52:21.180]
US Kudo all futures hit a record, $100 a barrel today

[02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:23.820]
Sir, thank you Mr. President for the low gas prices

[02:52:24.740 --> 02:52:29.840]
Surging more than $4 as violence in OPEC members, Nigerian Algeria combined with a weak dollar

[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:31.620]
And cold snap to boost crude futures

[02:52:32.580 --> 02:52:34.040]
Cold snap my ass

[02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:36.720]
And believe me, you probably could right now

[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:39.360]
Let me see if the temperature is rising, okay, just a little tiny bit

[02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:42.920]
When I got up this morning was minus 14 and it's still minus 13

[02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:45.420]
And the high today is only going to be minus 11

[02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:48.740]
But with a big sun on there and a big sun on for tomorrow and a minus 6

[02:52:48.740 --> 02:52:51.280]
And then Friday a minus 2 and Saturday a plus 2

[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:54.080]
There's your Toronto weather which I know is captivating, simulating radio

[02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:55.400]
And if you don't like it too bad

[02:52:56.280 --> 02:53:00.020]
Better cold snap and Florida near record temperatures, what was it 59 last night?

[02:53:00.820 --> 02:53:03.300]
I think so something like that

[02:53:03.300 --> 02:53:05.020]
Don't tell me George is out again

[02:53:05.020 --> 02:53:07.880]
Right here, I thought maybe you were on the move again

[02:53:07.880 --> 02:53:09.260]
Literally, I could be

[02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:10.420]
On the move again?

[02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:12.940]
Without notice, unless you want me to give you some notice, I'll you know

[02:53:12.940 --> 02:53:17.140]
Fresh buying at the new year was also cited as helping lift the oil futures complex

[02:53:18.020 --> 02:53:23.620]
On the New York mercantile exchange at 1217 less than an hour ago, February crude was up $2.67

[02:53:24.140 --> 02:53:26.020]
Or 9865 a barrel

[02:53:26.720 --> 02:53:34.680]
Trading from 9605 to $100 even a record front month high, eclipsing the previous record, a 9929 set in November 21

[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:40.660]
How do you like that? I bet you the S&P is down now for that jackass that wants us all to gamble away our money

[02:53:40.660 --> 02:53:41.820]
I'd rather go to Woodbuy

[02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:44.460]
At least once upon a time you have a good time

[02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:48.820]
Let's see, let me see if the S&P is, let me get on that channel. What is it 184 my cable?

[02:53:49.980 --> 02:53:51.040]
Oh power lunch

[02:53:53.160 --> 02:53:56.400]
Oil 9885 see it's back down under 100 what are you getting excited about?

[02:53:56.740 --> 02:54:00.660]
Oh 9879 see it's coming up but the S&P is down almost 22 points

[02:54:00.660 --> 02:54:03.840]
It's not for simpitously how do you like that? Oh my god

[02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:04.840]
Jackass

[02:54:05.600 --> 02:54:08.980]
Man you just wait you ain't see nothing yet if this oil thing keeps up like that

[02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:13.920]
How about $200 a barrel? How about $10 a gallon for gas? What do you think?

[02:54:16.520 --> 02:54:21.100]
You think we ought to get a new job somewhere close to where you live? It doesn't matter

[02:54:24.380 --> 02:54:26.260]
You can hitchhike, sure

[02:54:26.260 --> 02:54:30.260]
You can be the hitcher maybe wreck your howrel pick you up it could be in the Nome Alaska

[02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:37.620]
A house resolution when P2S Vice President Dick Cheney Dennis Gussinich's HR 799 bill is gathering more support

[02:54:39.140 --> 02:54:43.280]
Why I do like this other mic much better how come he didn't tell me like five years ago to use this one?

[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:51.320]
Yeah the national impeachment continues to grow and generate increasing interest in being referred to the House Judiciary Committee last month

[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:53.120]
A Christmas spokesperson said

[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:57.400]
As a member of that committee representative Bobby Rexler and two other committee members

[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:02.620]
Luis Gudiera's and Tammy Baldwin have joined together in demanding that the legal action against Cheney moves forward

[02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:09.880]
And there's a picture of Dick right here and in the background there's Conda Lisa. Oh my God. What a nasty bitch

[02:55:10.780 --> 02:55:15.960]
She's got the most sour look on her pusman. You think she was you think her stuff didn't stink man

[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:19.580]
Talk about arrogant condescending sell out bitch

[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:25.440]
Well, Dr. Rice, you remember that with the Fox News? Heather that's right. Oh yeah

[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:29.640]
Congressman Bobby Westler, Florida, great guy

[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:35.660]
I just want to like the official who says the charges are too serious to ignore. There's credible evidence that the Vice President abused the power of his office

[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:40.780]
And not only brought us into an honest on a serious war but violated the civil liberties and privacy of American citizens

[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:44.720]
It is the constitutional duty of Congress to hold impeachment hearings

[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:51.460]
You said they went on to say he went on to say believes the Cheney and the Bush administration have demonstrated a consistent pattern of

[02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:55.560]
Abusing the law and misleading Congress and American people but on this mic I can't read quite so good

[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:01.240]
I make a lot of mistakes but you know what does make any difference because they're not all they want to hear this out of my voice

[02:56:01.240 --> 02:56:06.000]
So they can call and say hi Ron. You know good stuff like that right?

[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:11.560]
We see the consequences of these actions and brought in Iraq and at home through the violations of our civil liberties

[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:16.520]
Wexler said Congress will maintain involvement Wisconsin said in August that published reports identified

[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:20.480]
The Vice President's willful and repeated this regard for the rule of law international treaties

[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:22.340]
Environmental protections in the common good

[02:56:23.980 --> 02:56:29.360]
Wexler involved when joined congressman Luis Guidillas in pending an op-ed that calls for committee hearings on a building of peach chaining

[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:34.060]
On a variety of charges that include allegations of manipulating intelligence that boosts the case for the war with Iraq

[02:56:34.060 --> 02:56:37.900]
A very serious charge very serious

[02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:43.720]
House leaders and leading democratic presidents of candidates high ever don't support impeachment

[02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:49.100]
One thing they point to is the time frame and expense that surrounded the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton

[02:56:49.100 --> 02:56:57.740]
citing how the business of politics in the US ground to a near standstill as the nation's attention was diverted by the effort to expose the president over a sex act with a White House intern

[02:56:58.180 --> 02:57:02.000]
Gudi Err is saying hearings need not to type congress for a year and shut down the nation

[02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:08.720]
A sex act with a world that's what happened with this bunch we got in there with these neo-con neo-Nazi bastards

[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:12.680]
A sex act screwing the entire world that sounds like a sex act to me

[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:18.200]
Not to mention the 4,000 American troops who are dead and the hundreds of thousands if not a million Iraqis

[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:22.000]
Yeah, what's a few dead people man look at those low gas prices

[02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:26.220]
Oh look at that they're all whipped up on CNN there all Iowa caucus countdown

[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:33.240]
There's a Barack Obama with his kids hey a little oblique couldn't hurt Barack make him think you're white

[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:36.140]
Can you imagine if he was white he would he would win in a fight

[02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:36.520]
Oh yeah

[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:43.400]
I mean he just his heads and shoulders above slippery and everywhere I mean Edwards is just uh...

[02:57:43.940 --> 02:57:49.480]
It's he's just a haircut him and Mitt Romney the battle of the haircut but he's got a draw on that can only help

[02:57:49.480 --> 02:57:51.020]
You mean John Edwards yeah

[02:57:51.420 --> 02:57:54.520]
Yeah John Edwards Johnny Boy he's a good old boy and that's what our collection is

[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:58.920]
I'm basically a bunch of red next I remember Jimmy Carter I think it used to be a part of Jimmy Carter

[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:02.320]
He was dumb and he had no uh... wasn't dumb and he had no personality

[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:04.320]
He had a draw but he had a draw

[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:07.320]
He's rather used to drink a lot of Billy beer and pee a lot outdoors

[02:58:07.780 --> 02:58:08.260]
Yeah well

[02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:11.000]
He okay and answered him because they got they got pee places outside

[02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:12.420]
I do one of those two things a lot

[02:58:13.080 --> 02:58:16.840]
But with Billy Carter was just the whole outside that was his pee place

[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.960]
Speaking of that here's the Assurme 962 you got the thousand made I think you got to lick

[02:58:22.960 --> 02:58:23.920]
No we'll get it

[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:26.500]
Oh there's that Dana Bash boy I tell you one thing

[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:30.060]
Where's the baseball bat and look at that look at the donkey key she's got

[02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:31.260]
No look at that nope

Well I'll tell you what's happening on the Republican side

[02:58:32.940 --> 02:58:36.100]
He's got those senior wedges lips you know where he used to be with the hand

[02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:42.340]
And he's got donkey teeth and a little tiny pin head

[02:58:42.340 --> 02:58:44.060]
She looks like one of those Zavoudem dog

[02:58:44.060 --> 02:58:45.100]
What do they call them?

[02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:46.040]
Voodoo dolls

[02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:46.980]
Is that what they are?

[02:58:47.160 --> 02:58:48.240]
No they're like the shrunken head

[02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:49.560]
Yeah

[02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:50.860]
What do they call those?

[02:58:51.140 --> 02:58:51.640]
Shrunken head doll

[02:58:51.640 --> 02:58:54.120]
Oh 962 on the survey

[02:58:54.120 --> 02:58:57.140]
You consider yourself exclusively heterosexual 743

[02:58:57.780 --> 02:58:59.020]
77.2%

[02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:01.200]
Bisexual 80 now let's see

[02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:02.460]
Did we put the uh...

[02:59:02.460 --> 02:59:04.540]
I didn't send her a canoe pole for tomorrow yet

[02:59:04.540 --> 02:59:06.340]
Why better get on that shouldn't I?

[02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:07.580]
I don't have any good pole for that

[02:59:07.580 --> 02:59:09.420]
Oh let me affect you some stuff that I put it up

[02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:12.640]
Would you better get on it because I don't think I've fixed him on that

[02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:14.020]
No but I already don't believe so

[02:59:14.020 --> 02:59:14.880]
Sorry Eric

[02:59:15.620 --> 02:59:16.420]
Bisexual 80

[02:59:17.040 --> 02:59:18.680]
Exclusively a homo sexual 53

[02:59:21.020 --> 02:59:22.380]
Not sure 52

[02:59:22.380 --> 02:59:23.500]
5.4%

[02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:25.000]

There's my cuckabee

[02:59:27.020 --> 02:59:27.880]
Fine because the pole says

[02:59:27.880 --> 02:59:29.940]
Oh my god I don't think he's even got a penis

[02:59:29.940 --> 02:59:30.940]
I really don't

[02:59:30.940 --> 02:59:32.100]
My cuckabee

[02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:32.980]
Phony baloney

[02:59:32.980 --> 02:59:34.720]
And if he does got only knows where it's been

[02:59:34.720 --> 02:59:36.760]
Because he's not one important Christian's man

[02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:37.760]
It's a quest...

[02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:38.860]
It's a battle of the religion

[02:59:38.860 --> 02:59:40.060]
It's a battle of the Getskis

[02:59:40.060 --> 02:59:40.760]
The God Squad

[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:42.320]
Which one's got the real Tony?

[02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:43.460]
Which one's got the real God?

[02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:44.840]
Now what are you gonna send me?

[02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:47.600]
Some poles from Charlie B

[02:59:48.540 --> 02:59:48.940]
No

[02:59:48.940 --> 02:59:50.000]
I'll be nice to him

[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:50.980]
Who else is helping that

[02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:53.880]
That's right who works his feverishly hard to send us to swirly Charlie

[02:59:53.880 --> 02:59:55.120]
But they can't all be good

[02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:56.660]
We like it Charlie

[02:59:56.660 --> 02:59:58.300]
We enjoy his male logic

[03:00:00.360 --> 03:00:01.540]
Banana Republic baby

[03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:20.100]

I am not gay

[03:00:28.540 --> 03:00:30.220]
I never have been gay

Blogg me in agreement with me

[03:00:52.140 --> 03:00:54.100]
He is for the normal

You fairy

[03:00:55.240 --> 03:00:57.380]
Hey she is a handsome woman

[03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:16.500]
This is the dick day

[03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:17.980]
It is a big bitch

[03:01:17.980 --> 03:01:20.240]
His talking time

[03:01:21.980 --> 03:01:23.360]
Hello

[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:24.640]
It looks like a pic

[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:27.360]
He knows you, doesn't even look like siz

[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:27.360]

[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:27.360]

[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:37.540]
I am not gay.

[03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:40.100]
I never have been gay.

[03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:43.440]
Gay, gay, gay, gay, not gay.

[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:48.880]
That's a little guy.

[03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:51.740]
I hear the voices.

[03:01:55.200 --> 03:01:56.560]
I'm a commander, guy.

[03:02:15.540 --> 03:02:17.280]
We are the Moon-Denights.

[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:21.720]
And our culture is advanced beyond all that you can possibly comprehend with the

[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:23.500]
100% of your brain.

[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:34.040]
What did you rack up to do with what?

[03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:36.580]
Nothing.

[03:02:37.900 --> 03:02:40.940]
Oh God, why did anybody tell you?

[03:02:42.900 --> 03:02:45.260]
Oh my God, my insides are on fire!

[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:48.240]
No please, no more.

[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:51.040]
Get the phone.

[03:02:53.100 --> 03:02:54.960]
Okay, okay.

[03:02:55.540 --> 03:02:56.480]
I think it's all gone.

[03:02:59.380 --> 03:03:00.340]
I don't want it.

[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:03.860]
Peter, I need you to hold my ear.

[03:03:06.580 --> 03:03:07.900]
I don't want it.

[03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:08.880]
I don't want it.

[03:03:08.940 --> 03:03:10.080]
Boy, I sure like this other mic.

[03:03:10.200 --> 03:03:11.220]
My guess mic is so much better.

[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:13.160]
It makes me feel like the guest on the show, you know what?

[03:03:13.160 --> 03:03:13.440]
Yeah.

[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:16.460]
And it's a little bit, I don't know, a little twirpy sounding.

[03:03:17.320 --> 03:03:18.340]
Not twirpy sounding.

[03:03:18.700 --> 03:03:20.260]
I don't know, like a little bit of an echo there.

[03:03:20.420 --> 03:03:20.800]
It's not bad.

[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:21.600]
It's not a bad sound.

[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:23.880]
It's not a bad sound?

[03:03:24.220 --> 03:03:24.360]
No.

[03:03:27.300 --> 03:03:28.520]
The other one might sound better.

[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:29.240]
What?

[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:30.500]
The other one might sound better.

[03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:31.280]
It does?

[03:03:31.460 --> 03:03:32.140]
Why don't you use a bullet?

[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:33.360]
It's a taste test.

[03:03:33.780 --> 03:03:36.200]
Okay, here's the, what's the story?

[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:36.780]
Uh-oh.

[03:03:37.980 --> 03:03:38.980]
You got it potted down.

[03:03:39.620 --> 03:03:40.420]
No, I don't.

[03:03:40.420 --> 03:03:41.400]
There it is.

[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:42.880]
Oh, I was just going to...

[03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:44.500]
Talking into the wrong way.

[03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:45.560]
I'm not talking into what.

[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:46.100]
What a jerk.

[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:46.940]
What an idiot.

[03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:47.820]
Yeah, that sounds better.

[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:48.420]
It does?

[03:03:48.660 --> 03:03:48.800]
Yeah.

[03:03:50.060 --> 03:03:51.460]
That guess mic is kind of muffly.

[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:54.040]
I thought it was like kind of tinny sounding.

[03:03:54.300 --> 03:03:54.420]
Yeah.

[03:03:54.540 --> 03:03:55.560]
So I got to go back to this?

[03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:56.420]
Yeah, yeah.

[03:03:56.640 --> 03:03:58.260]
But that's okay because the engineers coming anyway.

[03:03:58.340 --> 03:03:58.760]
One of these did.

[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:00.420]
They say when, what year would them...

[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:02.980]
They said he would be in touch with you.

[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:04.500]
He would touch me?

[03:04:04.580 --> 03:04:05.260]
Oh, I don't think so.

[03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:06.820]
In the morning.

[03:04:08.320 --> 03:04:09.300]
Oh, in the morning?

[03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:09.640]
Yes.

[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:10.020]
Good.

[03:04:10.620 --> 03:04:11.440]
He's a good guy.

[03:04:11.640 --> 03:04:12.780]
Anybody knows his crap.

[03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:17.420]
And I sure hope he's getting compensated.

[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:19.440]
Yeah, well, you can hope.

[03:04:20.420 --> 03:04:21.560]
No comment now.

[03:04:22.580 --> 03:04:23.280]
No comment.

[03:04:23.400 --> 03:04:24.500]
We've got daytime here, man.

[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:25.320]
We have an understanding.

[03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:26.400]
Remembering Godfather 3?

[03:04:26.740 --> 03:04:27.000]
Mm-hmm.

[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:29.180]
And he said we have an understanding.

[03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:30.300]
And then of course they killed him.

[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:32.200]
What is that?

[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:33.520]
Deon Warwick.

[03:04:33.680 --> 03:04:34.680]
I mean, a diet of Ross, sorry.

[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:36.200]
Touch me in the morning.

[03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:37.740]
Oh, do you see me in the morning?

[03:04:38.020 --> 03:04:38.200]
Wow.

[03:04:41.100 --> 03:04:41.820]
Yes, sir.

[03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:42.540]
I rather...

[03:04:42.540 --> 03:04:45.640]
I rather touch Jim Morrison even now that he's dead than the band of Ross.

[03:04:46.840 --> 03:04:47.680]
He was hearing.

[03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:49.520]
You what I'm saying?

[03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:50.760]
Yes, he was.

[03:04:51.100 --> 03:04:51.340]
All right.

[03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:52.040]
He's hearing dead.

[03:04:52.820 --> 03:04:53.900]
Oh, come on now.

[03:04:55.860 --> 03:04:59.080]
From all to all to all not to see me.

[03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:00.160]
Okay, I see him.

[03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:02.220]
He's still alive, by the way, Jim Morrison.

[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:05.280]
He's running around in France with ants in his pants.

[03:05:06.320 --> 03:05:07.220]
So here's a little more.

[03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:08.020]
I'm better than Zerbuto.

[03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:10.140]
She's still dead, by the way, in case anybody's keeping track.

[03:05:10.940 --> 03:05:13.140]
At the time she was assassinated, Pakistan.

[03:05:13.340 --> 03:05:15.600]
Now, let me just ask you this question before I read this story.

[03:05:15.760 --> 03:05:16.020]
Mm-hmm.

[03:05:17.380 --> 03:05:21.820]
If I went to Woodline today at two o'clock, would that be breaking my New Year's resolution

[03:05:21.820 --> 03:05:22.400]
to go less?

[03:05:23.260 --> 03:05:24.540]
I didn't say it was never going to go again.

[03:05:25.020 --> 03:05:25.740]
We ought to ask Chris.

[03:05:26.380 --> 03:05:27.520]
Well, how often do you go again?

[03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:28.180]
I think he said he weren't going to go again.

[03:05:29.280 --> 03:05:30.300]
How often do you normally go?

[03:05:30.560 --> 03:05:31.680]
I never said that.

[03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:32.040]
You sure?

[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:35.000]
Yeah, I'm so sorry I asked you because you're such a tub of lies.

[03:05:35.420 --> 03:05:36.680]
How orphan do you go?

[03:05:36.680 --> 03:05:37.500]
Mm-hmm.

[03:05:37.560 --> 03:05:38.560]
Yeah, let me ask you this.

[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:40.060]
Have you ever seen Joe Bell and Chris together?

[03:05:40.300 --> 03:05:40.720]
Same person.

[03:05:40.840 --> 03:05:41.720]
Yes, just the sportive.

[03:05:42.340 --> 03:05:43.060]
Oh, you were together?

[03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:44.420]
And what did he say to you, Chris?

[03:05:44.780 --> 03:05:45.400]
He was standing to me.

[03:05:45.920 --> 03:05:46.340]
Why not?

[03:05:46.840 --> 03:05:47.840]
Because George, do you see him on potatoes?

[03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:49.340]
Do you see him on potatoes now?

[03:05:49.520 --> 03:05:49.520]

[03:05:49.520 --> 03:05:49.520]

[03:05:49.640 --> 03:05:50.160]
Like, fairly tough potatoes.

[03:05:50.160 --> 03:05:50.960]
No one else is around.

[03:05:51.420 --> 03:05:51.580]
Oh.

[03:05:52.080 --> 03:05:52.840]
I don't blame him.

[03:05:53.860 --> 03:05:54.840]
Why did you make that up?

[03:05:54.960 --> 03:05:56.120]
I didn't say it was never going again.

[03:05:56.460 --> 03:06:00.520]
In addition to which, although I did eat yesterday, man, I didn't eat any ice cream,

[03:06:00.520 --> 03:06:01.000]
I don't think.

[03:06:01.860 --> 03:06:02.600]
Oh, yes, I did.

[03:06:02.740 --> 03:06:03.720]
I had two ice cream sandwiches.

[03:06:05.560 --> 03:06:06.200]
Is that bad?

[03:06:06.720 --> 03:06:07.440]
Yeah, it's bad.

[03:06:08.560 --> 03:06:09.180]
It was good.

[03:06:10.760 --> 03:06:13.860]
I didn't say it wasn't ever going to see if you do this ridiculous one.

[03:06:13.960 --> 03:06:15.800]
I'm not going to have any carbs in the next year.

[03:06:16.040 --> 03:06:17.560]
Well, of course, you know, we've all done that.

[03:06:17.720 --> 03:06:19.300]
It's what's the point of doing it.

[03:06:19.960 --> 03:06:22.160]
It's like saying, I'm never going to take a dump in the new year.

[03:06:22.260 --> 03:06:23.780]
You know, I know what's the point of saying that.

[03:06:24.880 --> 03:06:27.320]
You're going to make a resolution and make one that's possible.

[03:06:27.480 --> 03:06:28.060]
Not likely.

[03:06:28.460 --> 03:06:31.480]
And the good news is that my dream field stuff shows up there, I think.

[03:06:31.880 --> 03:06:33.280]
Still having that no phone call yet, though.

[03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:33.900]
From.

[03:06:35.320 --> 03:06:35.960]
From downstairs.

[03:06:35.960 --> 03:06:37.440]
There's a package here for you.

[03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:39.500]
That's what from.

[03:06:40.100 --> 03:06:41.520]
Isn't today Janie with the tooth?

[03:06:41.840 --> 03:06:42.120]
Yes.

[03:06:42.700 --> 03:06:46.620]
Well, when I get back from my blind winner, there'll be a nice package down there for me.

[03:06:47.080 --> 03:06:48.220]
And everybody likes a nice package.

[03:06:49.320 --> 03:06:52.980]
At the time she was assassinated, packaged standing opposition leader, Benizier Boutot,

[03:06:53.120 --> 03:06:55.000]
was just hours away from meeting with two US lawmakers.

[03:06:55.460 --> 03:07:00.200]
They hand them a dossier, alleging that Pakistan's inner service intelligence agency, the ISI,

[03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:02.860]
was plotting with its elections commission to rig the upcoming elections.

[03:07:04.760 --> 03:07:07.180]
God, I hate the way that button keeps flickering and then it goes out.

[03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:08.320]
And I have to hit the thing again.

[03:07:08.500 --> 03:07:11.700]
I know it would be nice to have your mic light on, you know, so you know when you're on the phone.

[03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:12.880]
Yeah, that would be nice.

[03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:13.480]
Sure.

[03:07:13.780 --> 03:07:14.360]
About eight years now.

[03:07:14.620 --> 03:07:14.880]
Uh-huh.

[03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:21.500]
According to CBS News, which is obtained a copy of the reported alleged widespread plans to stuff ballot boxes.

[03:07:21.640 --> 03:07:22.100]
And he doubts.

[03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:23.860]
Oh, there is I shot Musharif.

[03:07:24.580 --> 03:07:29.400]
To stuff ballot boxes, rig voting list and intimidate even kill opposition voters.

[03:07:29.660 --> 03:07:30.700]
Oh, you don't like Musharif?

[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:31.380]
Guess what?

[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:31.760]
Too bad.

[03:07:33.500 --> 03:07:36.540]
CNN quotes the document more specifically as saying,

[03:07:36.960 --> 03:07:41.300]
when in opposing candidate is strong in an area, they find a creative conflict at the polling station,

[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:45.240]
even killing people if necessary, to stop polls at least for three to four hours.

[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:48.880]
Or even a Bush people weren't that creative.

[03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:55.740]
The report titled another stain on the face of democracy was compiled from Boutot's own services within the police and intelligence services.

[03:07:56.040 --> 03:08:01.320]
It was supposed to be given a Senator Arlen's Spectre and Representative Pat McKinney because Boutot didn't trust the Bush administration.

[03:08:01.320 --> 03:08:05.060]
Which has seen in Pakistan as strongly backing Musharif another crook.

[03:08:05.740 --> 03:08:06.560]
A dictator.

[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:11.860]
The dossier also accuses Musharif's regime with their hurting USAID and the political dirty tricks,

[03:08:12.140 --> 03:08:18.640]
charging that 90% of the equipment that the USA gave the government of Pakistan to fight terrorism is being used to monitor and keep a check on political opponents.

[03:08:19.900 --> 03:08:28.040]
Pactist Annie Senator Latif Kosa told CBS the ISI has set up a mega computer system which has the capacity to hack any of its computers in Pakistan

[03:08:28.040 --> 03:08:32.560]
and is connected with the elections commission of Pakistan's computers and therefore the lower-term results.

[03:08:33.500 --> 03:08:36.520]
Kosa also charged the computers have been used to change the voter roles.

[03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:39.880]
Pakistan's government called the allegations ludicrous.

[03:08:40.500 --> 03:08:42.680]
We all know him, right? He's rapping the baby.

[03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:43.220]
Yo, yo.

[03:08:44.100 --> 03:08:49.560]
Musharif's top spokesman told CNN he never heard of the dossier but that the allegations were just to packalize laughable and ridiculous.

[03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:52.460]
All this stuff is going on. All these innocent people are dying.

[03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:56.680]
Bloodshed. We invaded a sovereign. Can you remember when Sodom invaded Kuwait?

[03:08:57.280 --> 03:09:00.480]
And the Saudis were peeing in their pants because they figured for sure they were going to be dead.

[03:09:00.780 --> 03:09:04.340]
And we got all indignant. We started a war and we were bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

[03:09:04.420 --> 03:09:05.260]
Iraq, remember that?

[03:09:06.340 --> 03:09:07.080]
I sure do.

[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:13.220]
But if we invade Iraq and we decide that we're going to like depose their dictator that we put in there in the first place

[03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:19.360]
and we're like occupying the country and starting a civil war and all these thousands and millions of people are dying, then it's okay.

[03:09:20.220 --> 03:09:25.040]
And what is America concerned about? Britney Spears and Hillary Duff and Lindsey Lohan. That's what they're concerned about.

[03:09:26.060 --> 03:09:31.100]
$100 a barrel for oil. What are we worried about? Freaking anode calls body. And we're going to stick it.

[03:09:32.740 --> 03:09:37.100]
$9.78 on the survey. I think you better start pushing a little bit just to make sure you get over the top.

[03:09:39.260 --> 03:09:45.180]
Oh look at that. The Dow is the... Wow, $2.30, $2.5 a dollar is down. How do you like that? I bet you don't like that, do you?

[03:09:45.640 --> 03:09:47.460]
Here comes the bunny. There goes your money.

[03:09:47.460 --> 03:09:48.860]
Feel Roger.

[03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:24.260]
Absolutely.

[03:10:24.260 --> 03:10:44.000]
One more that never led my gear. It's almost midnight time to get me to release here. What the...

[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.680]
He's all my son.

[03:10:48.420 --> 03:10:53.380]
Well we looked it up for our Monday and we came up with the answers all laying sign. Remember that?

[03:10:53.780 --> 03:10:55.940]
What an educational show man. What?

[03:10:57.100 --> 03:11:06.300]
What? You know what? No it's sign. Sign sign. And I didn't play this. We got that one.

[03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:12.680]
And the preview says it will tell us what those crap circles mean.

[03:11:13.260 --> 03:11:18.700]
Where's the one about the Wayne Insigns? Is that under WH? You know what I'm talking about?

[03:11:20.180 --> 03:11:23.420]
We don't want to be playing nothing about Wayne. No way baby.

[03:11:25.580 --> 03:11:27.940]
I'm going to tell you something right now and you can mark it down.

[03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:34.520]
Wayne I sing now.

[03:11:36.980 --> 03:11:41.220]
Oh there's one I would love to play. That's it.

[03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:52.160]
Yeah. Oh come on now. Where's your fun spirit? There's Christod on CNN. Good guy. Very qualified. No chance.

[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:58.060]
In fact I was just thinking two of the most electable it if they were presented right and if they had any chance.

[03:11:58.060 --> 03:12:03.780]
Joe Biden and Christod. Neither one's got a tournament chance in hell. Neither one of them even makes a blip on a radar scale in the pool.

[03:12:04.860 --> 03:12:12.460]
Like I said this is the best of Republicans could do. Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney too far bison of a different variety.

[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:22.020]
And Rudy I've been married 400 times Giuliani. Don't do what I do but do what I say. Well this Mike is awful loud. Am I like coming into loud here or what?

[03:12:22.460 --> 03:12:25.200]
No. That's not great. I'm asking Chris he's running aboard.

[03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:31.320]
Nice. I do. I mean he does. It's just awful. I got to cranked up there. This Mike is better than the other one. You're right.

[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:38.260]
Why do you think that is? I just know what the light was out again. I hate that. I don't know how you've been able to.

[03:12:38.560 --> 03:12:41.980]
Although last time I was down there trying to do a show that was one of the problems.

[03:12:43.220 --> 03:12:47.360]
Remember that every time I would run here and then the overhead you couldn't get a balance in the engineers be running around.

[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:53.420]
What is wrong? I don't want to go through it. Don't be negative. Don't start out of your first show on the new year be a negative to real.

[03:12:53.660 --> 03:13:06.940]
Don Shula. That was the eruders. That was the eruders. Silence. Who? What? The brains? You've got some nerve. She was myster.

[03:13:07.880 --> 03:13:13.540]
Shine in me like that. What do you do with shoes? You shine them. Right? He's qualified for that.

[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:17.440]
Although he'd probably do your left shoe twice because he forget that he did it already.

[03:13:19.060 --> 03:13:25.900]
You consider yourself exclusively heterosexual, 766, 77.3% of this audience red-blooded heteros.

[03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:30.540]
Everybody says, oh, that's just a fag show. That's just for a bunch of fairies.

[03:13:31.960 --> 03:13:40.120]
Bisexual 82. Exclusively homosexual. 55.5%. What happened to our 7.3% from last time?

[03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:48.520]
We're losing the fairies, man. Not sure 53.8.3.34.990. I think you're going to make your thousand.

[03:13:49.260 --> 03:13:53.340]
Yes, thank you. What? I think so too. Well, good.

[03:13:55.500 --> 03:13:59.520]
I never did get around to this the other day. This was a kill some good time on those holiday shows.

[03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:06.360]
The beast, which is from a website called BuffaloBeast.com. Not to be confused with our beast.

[03:14:06.940 --> 03:14:11.680]
Speaking of that, we've got to schedule for this. Let me take a look and see who's doing 9.00.

[03:14:12.580 --> 03:14:19.200]
We don't have any 9.00 to midnight tonight because we got you on basketball. Oh, boy. Give me the thing that Hank went on about the Joseph Gackie there.

[03:14:19.660 --> 03:14:29.640]
Oh, my God. What is that all about? 9.00 to 10. The beast is on Friday night for 1 hour. That's more than enough. Right after Dolphins All-Aces.

[03:14:29.920 --> 03:14:33.680]
How'd you like to have to follow Dolphins All-Aces? Chris, that would be great.

[03:14:34.160 --> 03:14:37.280]
I bet you when the book comes out two weeks from tomorrow, when we get the hour by hour,

[03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:41.700]
that the first number of Dolphins All-Aces knows two hours from 7.00 to 9.00 starts with a,

[03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:45.560]
Oh! I bet you anything. Thanks a lot Wayne. And nice to deal here, Jolly Joe.

[03:14:45.620 --> 03:14:52.240]
Oh! Sign in a way our lives. Oh, yeah. The thing of all the fine arrived that they put on and lose money on.

[03:14:52.540 --> 03:14:56.400]
But oh, no. We can't afford it. We've got to cut back. And the interesting part, like Hank said,

[03:14:56.620 --> 03:15:01.540]
they don't negotiate whether we're willing to cut back, which I think both of us would have been very amply by the way.

[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:04.780]
But oh, no. We don't want to do that. Here's what we're going to paint if you don't like it goodbye.

[03:15:04.780 --> 03:15:10.080]
You know, crazy. And they come up with some number like, what are you talking about?

[03:15:10.300 --> 03:15:13.720]
You know, even George couldn't squeak by what they wanted to pay Chris.

[03:15:14.740 --> 03:15:20.100]
Oh, they offered me something. The Beast's 50 most loads of people in America for 2007.

[03:15:20.300 --> 03:15:24.620]
This is BuffaloBest.com. Number 50, I'll go from the bottom up and I'm not going to be able to do them all today.

[03:15:25.540 --> 03:15:29.240]
So we'll squeeze this through the rest of the week. Okay. And remind me, the rest of the week,

[03:15:29.380 --> 03:15:34.640]
tomorrow on Friday, to squeeze somewhere out. And based on the way things started this morning for both of us,

[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:40.440]
I think that should be no problem. I'm going back right now. No, you're not during this next break. Are you really? I really am.

[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:47.320]
What did you eat over the holidays? Well, what's the story with you? What didn't I eat? I guess is the most important question.

[03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:51.460]
Oh, I think I know what are the answers to that. Yeah. That might be the only thing.

[03:15:52.020 --> 03:15:55.940]
Number 50, Nicole Richie. No, in fact, now I think the two things. One, I'm positive.

[03:15:57.120 --> 03:16:01.760]
Number 50, Nicole Richie charges not a brick house, not mighty mighty. Vastly easier than the Sunday morning.

[03:16:01.760 --> 03:16:06.700]
Her criminal exploits, attended by hollow contritions, do an estimable alarm to drug legalization efforts,

[03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:12.140]
while inexplicably adding nothing to the forced derolization debate. Quite possibly a reason that terrorists hate us.

[03:16:12.940 --> 03:16:17.440]
Exhibit A, I've just gone through so much in my life that pulling up my top, doesn't seem like that big a deal.

[03:16:17.800 --> 03:16:23.340]
Sentence, sealed neck high in the outhouse foundation of a popular Mexican spring break destination, draws prompt open.

[03:16:24.540 --> 03:16:33.140]
49, Trent Lott. Charges old school discreet segregationist who switched parties along with strong thermon back when Democrats decided to be nicer to black people.

[03:16:33.780 --> 03:16:41.640]
Retired from the Senate early to the larger new law that mandates a two-year wait between retiring from Congress and becoming a lobbyist, that and the dirt that Larry Flint has on him.

[03:16:42.600 --> 03:16:49.920]
Exhibit A was in the singing senators, a closeted acapella group with John Ascroft, Jim Jeffords, and Larry Craig, not that there's anything wrong with that.

[03:16:50.440 --> 03:16:53.280]
Sentence, accidentally lynched by blind neo-Nazis.

[03:16:54.260 --> 03:17:08.280]
48, Carson Daly. Charges, otherwise too banal for a derision, Daly who caught his, let me be careful, I read this, who cut his schmuck teeth warming musical, similar for tweens on MTV, acted as writers built strike breaker by returning there without them.

[03:17:08.960 --> 03:17:13.700]
Exhibit A, we didn't know he showed employed writers, Sentence forced to appear nightly on the Carson Daly show.

[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:16.640]
These are, these are kind of cute aren't they?

[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:19.500]
Okay, if you say something.

[03:17:19.760 --> 03:17:21.140]
In other words, you don't like these?

[03:17:21.780 --> 03:17:21.920]
No.

[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:23.720]
I haven't got it.

[03:17:24.580 --> 03:17:26.160]
Well, there's only 47 more.

[03:17:26.520 --> 03:17:26.980]
All right.

[03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:28.480]
Come on, boys.

[03:17:29.140 --> 03:17:31.060]
How is Chris doing that poll? We got 1000 yet?

[03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:34.000]
It's not a poll. It's a survey. That's the thing that's for me.

[03:17:34.460 --> 03:17:34.460]

[03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:38.660]
I'd be like 45,000 on it. If we had this gigantic audience, we used to have.

[03:17:39.260 --> 03:17:40.900]
And did we have one lady calling today?

[03:17:41.120 --> 03:17:43.960]
Like we have the Johnny Depp lady, which I noticed that's in the poll.

[03:17:44.080 --> 03:17:45.600]
And I was going there, by the way, I'd surely be.

[03:17:46.500 --> 03:17:49.580]
He did a lot of work on it. All the Johnny Depp movies will do that for Friday, I think.

[03:17:50.680 --> 03:17:52.660]
But we also have to add, I hate Johnny Depp.

[03:17:52.700 --> 03:17:55.120]
I can't imagine, you think there's people who don't like Johnny Depp?

[03:17:56.120 --> 03:17:57.020]
There's got to be, right?

[03:17:57.280 --> 03:17:57.600]
Sure.

[03:17:59.020 --> 03:18:00.400]
I hate Johnny Depp.

[03:18:00.960 --> 03:18:03.940]
Not me, but I mean, that's just adding that to the poll.

[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:06.300]
Because we got a lot of negative people out there, it's self-floor to man.

[03:18:07.200 --> 03:18:08.400]
Johnny Depp, we hate you.

[03:18:08.700 --> 03:18:10.020]
BAAA! BAA! BAA! BAA!

[03:18:10.880 --> 03:18:13.380]
Number 47, like Huckabee, to which I say,

[03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:14.000]
OOO!

[03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:18.240]
Charges, once worse, they're calculating politicians pretending to be at about Christian,

[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:20.860]
or a genuine heartland preacher who didn't come from no monkey.

[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:25.520]
Huckabee is both a Southern Baptist who rejects Darwin, wants to give everyone a gun,

[03:18:25.820 --> 03:18:28.580]
and thinks people with age should be quarantined, and a city corrupt politician

[03:18:28.580 --> 03:18:31.180]
who's never seen a payoff so low he wouldn't stoop to pick it up.

[03:18:32.040 --> 03:18:34.460]
Democrats see Huckabee as easily defeated in the general election,

[03:18:34.580 --> 03:18:35.460]
but they shouldn't be so sure.

[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:37.960]
Smooth-talking preachers tend to do well in this country.

[03:18:38.400 --> 03:18:42.440]
Huckabee is well-spoken, kind-faced, and the opposite of worldly, he's Obama for Hicks.

[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:46.460]
Exhibit A, I got into politics because I knew government didn't have the real answers.

[03:18:46.460 --> 03:18:50.480]
That's the real answer, that the real answers lie in accepting Jesus Christ into our lives.

[03:18:50.660 --> 03:18:53.460]
I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Jesus.

[03:18:54.820 --> 03:18:56.620]
Sentence just is about to win a GOP nomination.

[03:18:56.920 --> 03:18:59.580]
A freak gust of wind catches Huckabee's excess skin,

[03:19:00.020 --> 03:19:03.060]
and carries him out over the Atlantic where he drifts for hours before God appears to him,

[03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:05.340]
tells him he's a unitarian, and sends him to hell.

[03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:07.680]
Now that was kind of cute.

[03:19:07.940 --> 03:19:08.480]
You didn't like it.

[03:19:08.700 --> 03:19:08.980]
It was cute.

[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:12.120]
Number 46, Judas Reagan.

[03:19:12.960 --> 03:19:15.400]
Charges is none more to debase the written word than Tom Friedman,

[03:19:15.400 --> 03:19:18.320]
the father-in-appartment attendant at the house overworked 9-11 rescuers,

[03:19:18.580 --> 03:19:21.300]
just so Bernie Kira could plumb her few treason to the shallows.

[03:19:22.420 --> 03:19:25.140]
Contentious working relationship with O.J. Simpson ended with her throat,

[03:19:25.480 --> 03:19:26.520]
disappointingly uncut.

[03:19:27.280 --> 03:19:31.320]
Exhibit A, Reagan books rosters of authors including Rushlin Ball, Robert Borg,

[03:19:31.500 --> 03:19:35.980]
Jenna Jamison, Jose Conceco, Janis Dixon, Dickinson, John Gibson, and John Hannity,

[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:38.300]
apparently Dracula and the Wolfman had prior obligations.

[03:19:39.080 --> 03:19:41.340]
Sentence, death by a thousand paper cuts.

[03:19:42.500 --> 03:19:46.240]
Holy Makinon, this is Joe Bore on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs,

[03:19:46.300 --> 03:19:49.220]
and you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God!

[03:19:53.880 --> 03:19:54.440]
Hello.

[03:19:55.060 --> 03:19:56.140]
I'm calling for Peter Brown.

[03:19:56.500 --> 03:19:56.720]
Speaking.

[03:19:57.260 --> 03:19:57.800]
Peter?

[03:19:58.340 --> 03:19:58.580]
Yes.

[03:19:59.080 --> 03:20:03.540]
I'm Clarence, expert radio program director for Sporthold Radio in Miami.

[03:20:04.020 --> 03:20:04.860]
The only thing that matters.

[03:20:05.240 --> 03:20:09.320]
It's been brought to my attention that you're in the market for a new sporthold gig,

[03:20:09.320 --> 03:20:12.340]
and it won't just so happens that we're working favoritiously

[03:20:12.340 --> 03:20:14.360]
on blowing out our midday talents, so.

[03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:14.720]
Why?

[03:20:15.120 --> 03:20:19.200]
Well, he wants money, but he's just not obedient enough.

[03:20:19.300 --> 03:20:21.640]
Yeah, but wait a minute, what kind of money are we talking about?

[03:20:21.900 --> 03:20:23.220]
Oh, will discuss that later.

[03:20:23.540 --> 03:20:26.220]
Hey, you're just gonna love it down here.

[03:20:26.560 --> 03:20:29.660]
The fun, the sun, the surf, it's paradise!

[03:20:30.600 --> 03:20:31.940]
Give me a number to work with here.

[03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:33.660]
What exactly are you offering me?

[03:20:33.740 --> 03:20:37.520]
Peter, Brown, I want you for my sporthold.

[03:20:39.320 --> 03:20:43.000]
So I can put my hand in your underwear.

[03:20:45.680 --> 03:20:51.860]
You can kiss me when we go on a date.

[03:20:52.460 --> 03:20:57.680]
Then I can bite your aunt and libel on your ear.

[03:20:59.460 --> 03:21:04.980]
Oh, put the foot, pamphlets and the dolphins.

[03:21:05.820 --> 03:21:07.980]
You'll pop your shorts.

[03:21:08.980 --> 03:21:15.560]
With our coverage of ping pong can't get over how I'm earning well over six figures.

[03:21:17.980 --> 03:21:21.340]
Having never known about radio before.

[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:29.720]
I have a stable now of sportholds, sick with ant-holas.

[03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:35.240]
Not a problem since the management here is sharp as a mots of ball.

[03:21:36.340 --> 03:21:36.740]
Absolutely.

[03:21:37.860 --> 03:21:41.600]
Peter, Brown, I want you for my sporthold.

[03:21:44.020 --> 03:21:47.560]
Peter, Brown, I want you for my sporthold.

[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:51.660]
Okay, 146, 14 built two, but we better hurry it up.

[03:21:51.700 --> 03:21:57.060]
I only got 46 more names on this list here of the worst, most-slowed people in American 2007.

[03:21:58.400 --> 03:22:01.500]
Now, what was the guy in plan of the ex-wester's name, Dr. Zayevs?

[03:22:01.680 --> 03:22:02.840]
Dr. Zayevs, that was one of them.

[03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:05.480]
Oh, well, I want to make sure I pronounce it right.

[03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:06.280]
Zayevs.

[03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:09.320]
Sounds like Yiddish.

[03:22:10.140 --> 03:22:11.380]
David, grade 45.

[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:17.160]
Charges the notion of his inside-rest entirely on his trek in resemblance to a shooter-morbable

[03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:18.040]
over Dr. Zayevs.

[03:22:18.480 --> 03:22:20.000]
Start here than a peep with waist-basket.

[03:22:20.620 --> 03:22:24.560]
Grade 3's occasional fake outrage exchanges with various White House press recruiters have

[03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:28.460]
established the reputation as a man, on a parade to confront the big scandals.

[03:22:28.940 --> 03:22:30.100]
Wait a minute, one moment, please.

[03:22:31.340 --> 03:22:31.820]
What?

[03:22:33.720 --> 03:22:34.660]
Probably another message.

[03:22:35.880 --> 03:22:36.400]
Telling you.

[03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:37.680]
Oh, for this?

[03:22:37.860 --> 03:22:38.300]
Forget it.

[03:22:38.500 --> 03:22:38.740]
Okay.

[03:22:39.180 --> 03:22:43.200]
White House recruiters have established his reputation as a man on a parade to confront the big scandals,

[03:22:43.480 --> 03:22:45.280]
once they've been well-mainsfied by better reporters.

[03:22:46.020 --> 03:22:50.140]
Manus just looked by the Valerie Plame scandal completely unnoticed, though every flasher testified

[03:22:50.140 --> 03:22:54.280]
the leaking claims CIA sentenced to regulatory three days before the infamous Novak column ran.

[03:22:54.860 --> 03:22:59.000]
His absurd overcompensatory assurance that he has no problem with being tough now with standing

[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:03.000]
his penile cleft haircut, much like the warning coloration of venomous reptiles,

[03:23:03.240 --> 03:23:04.740]
betrays his true poisonous nature.

[03:23:05.500 --> 03:23:09.380]
Exhibit A, no dignified reporter would be so visibly happy filling in from Adelaura

[03:23:09.380 --> 03:23:11.720]
on the day's show, sentence quoted by Horses.

[03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:14.220]
44, Hugh Hathner.

[03:23:14.940 --> 03:23:18.780]
Charge is not dating three vacuous sluts for the articles, racially attempting to mainstream

[03:23:18.780 --> 03:23:22.820]
necrophilia, and worst-while-eye kind of virility now forced to martial every faculty,

[03:23:23.180 --> 03:23:27.060]
in maneuvering giraffe-like, his quavering prehensal lips for contract smooches with his

[03:23:27.060 --> 03:23:30.600]
surgically altered concubines, sharing in common with them only arrested adolescents,

[03:23:31.020 --> 03:23:32.460]
and probably some pretty sweet coke.

[03:23:33.480 --> 03:23:37.840]
Exhibit A, idols morbidly luck an octogenarian zeleg on the periphery of every girls'

[03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:41.940]
next-door publicity event, opening domestically and trying to suppress the faint horror of his

[03:23:41.940 --> 03:23:46.340]
impending incontinence, sentenced by Agrobanne.

[03:23:46.800 --> 03:23:48.240]
43, Sherry Shepherd.

[03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:53.040]
Charge's perfectly illustrated creationist level of enlequence he declared her disbelief and evolution,

[03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:56.820]
and was immediately stumped about the shape of the earth explaining her ignorance was due to the fact

[03:23:56.820 --> 03:24:01.160]
that she was too busy feeding her children to acquire rudimentary knowledge about anything presumably.

[03:24:01.900 --> 03:24:06.640]
Further compounded or astonishing lack of basic knowledge, when she authoritatively declared that

[03:24:06.640 --> 03:24:11.340]
Jesus Christ came before the ancient Greeks and that he didn't think anyone predated Christchurch.

[03:24:11.580 --> 03:24:15.760]
Charging by these statements shared probably things there are dragons on the other side of her desk.

[03:24:16.700 --> 03:24:19.300]
Exhibit A, accurately reflects the intelligence of her viewing audience,

[03:24:19.300 --> 03:24:22.240]
sentence pushed off the edge of the earth, Sherry Shepherd.

[03:24:23.180 --> 03:24:25.400]
I've never seen her because I don't watch that show of you, see her?

[03:24:25.820 --> 03:24:27.020]
Yeah, she's fat-blood-tick.

[03:24:27.380 --> 03:24:28.180]
No, well how are you?

[03:24:28.180 --> 03:24:30.400]
Replace the other one, you know, they had to have one.

[03:24:30.780 --> 03:24:32.180]
Right, and then the token fat-blood-tick?

[03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:32.580]
Mm-hmm.

[03:24:33.520 --> 03:24:36.080]
10-11 on the pull, by the way, you got your thousand, Mr. Hunchot.

[03:24:36.260 --> 03:24:36.600]
Yes, we did.

[03:24:36.960 --> 03:24:37.400]
Aren't you proud?

[03:24:37.660 --> 03:24:38.400]
Very proud, you're not.

[03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:39.180]
Could cure us.

[03:24:39.900 --> 03:24:41.340]
Bud Sealeg is number 42.

[03:24:42.420 --> 03:24:45.300]
Charges, his version of the island of Dr. Moro, is even worse than John Frankenheimer's.

[03:24:45.300 --> 03:24:50.560]
The baseball commissioners succeeded in making football the indisputable and several national pastimes.

[03:24:51.120 --> 03:24:54.480]
Followed up the fan-aOA meeting cancellation of the 94 season in the World Series,

[03:24:54.860 --> 03:24:58.820]
the first year without since 1904, by studiously ignoring along with the rest of the management

[03:24:58.820 --> 03:25:01.880]
and tens of thousands of San Franciscans, his players mutating proportions.

[03:25:02.580 --> 03:25:06.620]
A true blue-blooded hypocrite, but reaped undeserved praise for a omissive stewardship

[03:25:06.620 --> 03:25:11.000]
and untold profits for his fellow owners on the back of his grotesquely augmented super soldiers,

[03:25:11.340 --> 03:25:12.800]
and now it's to pretend he shocked about it.

[03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:18.860]
Exhibit A, an irretreivable coward, seemed to have skipped Barry von's record breaking home run in Game and San Francisco,

[03:25:19.220 --> 03:25:20.840]
congratulating the slugger by phone.

[03:25:21.380 --> 03:25:26.580]
Ferris Schienweig repitchment Raphael Parmero remains uncharged for lying to Congress about a steroid use.

[03:25:27.020 --> 03:25:32.900]
Sentence designated BP, a hitting team for giants, denied medical attention over 162 games.

[03:25:33.600 --> 03:25:35.140]
You're right, some of these are pretty weak.

[03:25:36.220 --> 03:25:40.760]
Most 41-Chuck Norris, charges only famous for knowing Bruce Lee.

[03:25:41.560 --> 03:25:47.080]
Churning out Pearl Action built for 30 years, skill as a martial artist greatly exaggerated,

[03:25:47.420 --> 03:25:51.920]
teach value wearing thin, total home gym, walker, Texas Ranger,

[03:25:52.060 --> 03:25:55.640]
once let a little girl battle armed gangsters because she had the power of belief in God.

[03:25:56.020 --> 03:25:58.040]
It doesn't understand evolution despite access to mirrors.

[03:25:59.020 --> 03:26:03.080]
Exhibit A, campaigning for my cock-a-bee, the San Francisco Roadhouse kick from Charles Darwin.

[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:04.260]
That's a good line.

[03:26:04.600 --> 03:26:06.280]
And number 40, you're a boy, Lou Dobbs.

[03:26:06.340 --> 03:26:08.680]
I don't think I have time to do this before it's long.

[03:26:08.920 --> 03:26:09.200]
We test.

[03:26:09.740 --> 03:26:12.080]
And I don't want to like, uh, do that.

[03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:17.360]
I'll have you do until tomorrow, your buddy Lou Dobbs, who never met any of Mexican he liked.

[03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:18.980]
And you know what?

[03:26:20.100 --> 03:26:20.460]
What?

[03:26:20.480 --> 03:26:21.140]
You may have had a point.

[03:26:23.740 --> 03:26:25.160]
He may have had a point.

[03:26:26.460 --> 03:26:28.160]
I just haven't met all that many Mexicans.

[03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:30.740]
No, I take that back too many.

[03:26:31.340 --> 03:26:32.680]
I see what.

[03:26:32.940 --> 03:26:34.200]
No, it's just, you know, nothing.

[03:26:34.380 --> 03:26:34.900]
You know how it is.

[03:26:35.440 --> 03:26:37.320]
I've been many and only met what I didn't like.

[03:26:37.320 --> 03:26:38.700]
Well, good for you.

[03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:39.820]
I've met several.

[03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:41.040]
I didn't like all that much.

[03:26:41.380 --> 03:26:43.360]
Okay, we got a thousand and fourteen votes on the pool.

[03:26:43.500 --> 03:26:45.280]
You can see to yourself, it's a sex survey.

[03:26:45.500 --> 03:26:46.340]
Baby, it's not a poll.

[03:26:46.940 --> 03:26:47.580]
I'll maybe look at it.

[03:26:47.640 --> 03:26:48.480]
Maybe it looks like a poll.

[03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:54.180]
You can see to yourself exclusively heterosexual, seven hundred eighty two, seventy seven point one percent.

[03:26:55.040 --> 03:26:57.080]
Bisexual, eighty six, eight point four percent.

[03:26:57.360 --> 03:26:59.040]
Why do you think we have more bi people under now?

[03:26:59.520 --> 03:27:00.920]
Is the bi-population growing?

[03:27:01.540 --> 03:27:04.120]
Maybe some of the gay people have, you know, branched out.

[03:27:05.940 --> 03:27:07.440]
They put their branch out.

[03:27:07.720 --> 03:27:08.480]
That could be.

[03:27:08.940 --> 03:27:10.120]
Not sure fifty six.

[03:27:10.720 --> 03:27:13.200]
Oh, maybe that should be the logo for the station.

[03:27:13.700 --> 03:27:15.400]
You're listening to not sure fifty six.

[03:27:16.320 --> 03:27:17.620]
A worse, you're all right.

[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:19.520]
Jock sniffing luck jobs.

[03:27:19.580 --> 03:27:20.160]
That's what we are.

[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:25.160]
You're sure exclusively homosexual only fifty five, five point four percent.

[03:27:26.160 --> 03:27:27.680]
What's happened to our queens?

[03:27:31.080 --> 03:27:31.940]
You're asking me.

[03:27:32.140 --> 03:27:32.980]
I don't keep asking you.

[03:27:32.980 --> 03:27:34.180]
Where did they all go?

[03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:35.980]
Where did all the fairies go?

[03:27:36.260 --> 03:27:37.300]
Yeah, they probably hear, man.

[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:38.480]
Oh, it was.

[03:27:38.940 --> 03:27:38.940]

[03:27:39.380 --> 03:27:41.360]
Thirty five, only three point four percent.

[03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:43.380]
A sexual out of a thousand fourteen.

[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:48.300]
Not thrilling, but it's an oldie we're good against.

[03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:50.860]
Thanks again to Charlie B for that nice pile.

[03:27:51.980 --> 03:27:53.960]
George says eating his pile came next to that.

[03:27:54.560 --> 03:27:55.520]
Stay high.

[03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:56.980]
Hey, my heavy town.

[03:27:57.800 --> 03:28:00.180]
At five six o'clock.

[03:28:00.720 --> 03:28:01.540]
WQA.

[03:28:11.720 --> 03:28:15.500]
I've been drinking and driving so long.

[03:28:15.980 --> 03:28:19.380]
I can't see why he's wrong.

[03:28:20.660 --> 03:28:26.960]
He totally smashed by the time I get to be nice.

[03:28:28.440 --> 03:28:32.080]
But the cop didn't see my point.

[03:28:33.220 --> 03:28:38.380]
So I need him and the brunt what a tender long.

[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:44.960]
Forget the witches all I meant.

[03:28:45.660 --> 03:28:49.240]
I just need a good fail bond man.

[03:28:50.240 --> 03:28:56.140]
To get me out of here so I can have more hit and run.

[03:28:57.020 --> 03:29:00.040]
Like a real stone cowboy.

[03:29:02.580 --> 03:29:09.280]
Getting liqueurred up and doing about a hundred and three.

[03:29:09.620 --> 03:29:12.740]
Like a real stone cowboy.

[03:29:14.940 --> 03:29:19.740]
Getting into collisions with people I don't even see.

[03:29:21.620 --> 03:29:26.740]
Till they put their handcuffs on me.

[03:29:30.560 --> 03:29:33.760]
Like a real stone cowboy.

[03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:41.740]
Till the booze is the only thing that's gentle on my mind.

[03:29:43.100 --> 03:29:46.360]
Like a real stone cowboy.

[03:29:48.500 --> 03:29:54.340]
Getting hold in your cord for driving while I'm blind.

[03:29:55.760 --> 03:29:59.060]
Like a real stone cowboy.

[03:30:01.120 --> 03:30:07.020]
Getting all liqueurred up and doing about a hundred and three.

[03:30:08.540 --> 03:30:11.660]
Like a real stone cowboy.
