[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180]
Feel God out, WQPL, where the bag is, you fairy.

[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:30.700]
Oh, the dead piece paradise, only good for a quick visit or two died.

[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:39.300]
Wrought in mangrove swamps in hell, you want and pass out from just one with.

[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.040]
O then cranky jewels, angry Cubans who welcome you with the shiny feet.

[00:00:48.040 --> 00:01:01.280]
This is a new land, a new land, a new land.

[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.400]
So hard you stink and smell.

[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.840]
I'm off to the great white north to luck as I watch you die.

[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:28.980]
All right, well, saw you doing out there, George, reading your ass off.

[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.920]
All right, no, we're inside. Thank God.

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.080]
Inside, inside, yeah, pansies inside.

[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.940]
Oh, no, no, no, no, it's like a wind turtle effect out there.

[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620]
No, it's great. We're in this is wankiest poker room.

[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.880]
Yeah, stage played any of the slot machines yet.

[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.800]
No, no, there are no slot machines in here.

[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.200]
Although there's some slots.

[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.640]
I'll explain that later.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.780]
Yeah, but you will.

[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.980]
Oh, wait a minute. What could this be?

[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.220]
It's from amazon.com, say 25%. I don't want to say 25%.

[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.940]
I don't want to say 100%. Just go away.

[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.720]
Get off my blackberry, you jerks.

[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.600]
That ain't me.

[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.080]
So George is out there at the Gulf Stream.

[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.460]
Yeah, the microphone doesn't have any on off.

[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.740]
And it just sounds like you got a bad cold.

[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.920]
I do actually.

[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.480]
Oh, that's why it sounds like you got a wild sounds like a very natural land.

[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.080]
Good. I wish I could turn my microphone off.

[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.140]
That's going to be really interesting when people start playing around.

[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.060]
I hear you rustling around there during that fifth and I think.

[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.820]
Well, I asked five times.

[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.540]
You're serious. There's no way to turn this microphone off.

[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.460]
That's dangerous.

[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.580]
It's dangerous to just bush leagues.

[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.900]
And of course, remember the engineer was going to call me this morning up here.

[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.020]
Yeah, and I was also told we were going to get the 360.

[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.360]
So I could play things like.

[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.100]
No, I should have understood what I was talking to clearance.

[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.100]
What he meant by we.

[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.560]
I should have asked him for his definition of we when he said that we can take that out there for you.

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.000]
By we he meant you.

[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.900]
And I didn't know that's what that meant.

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.500]
Like I was going to have to bring it.

[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.180]
Yeah, I didn't know that or I would have.

[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.140]
So I'll always make sounds with my mouth.

[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.940]
I can play him here.

[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.580]
Yeah.

[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.360]
Good.

[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.980]
I got all of this in here.

[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.960]
Although I got no engineer.

[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120]
Nobody called here and nobody said anything about coming up.

[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.520]
Yeah, I know.

[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.400]
Well, you know, repairing the delay thing or the intercom or anything.

[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.620]
That's what we were doing with the Ford button, which the light is out again.

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.060]
I just noticed there.

[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.040]
But at any rate.

[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.560]
Hey, listen, we don't want to make a big cynicism here.

[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.800]
Let's see.

[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.980]
Yeah.

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.900]
Kind of mail it in just relax.

[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.060]
So what's going on out there?

[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.360]
Anything?

[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.620]
Nothing yet.

[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.460]
We're in the sport of King's poker room.

[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.920]
It's brand new.

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.100]
It's palatial high ceilings.

[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.500]
There's a state.

[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.100]
So in other words, even when the race is start like a 115, you're not going to be able to see the race.

[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.540]
I I won't, but we'll have one of the TVs.

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.660]
There's TVs everywhere.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.640]
I'll be able to see it.

[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.420]
There's two.

[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.020]
I can see it here.

[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.480]
Big screens.

[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.340]
Five golf streams coming out on the 15 on the racing network here.

[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.080]
So I can see it here and pretend that I'm there.

[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.300]
Right.

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.100]
But they got all kinds of stuff going on all day here and all around Mark.

[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.280]
So I told you.

[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.040]
Is there anybody there?

[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.000]
Are there people there?

[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.900]
No, there's people prepping.

[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.660]
You know, just our people and their people, their staff getting all the booze ready.

[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.780]
You know, that works.

[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.500]
Yeah.

[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.500]
I thought you were in one of the casinos though.

[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.360]
Yeah, there's just nobody here yet.

[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.320]
As far as like customers.

[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.120]
There's no customers there?

[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.700]
Not yet.

[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.120]
What do you mean not yet?

[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.160]
It's 10 o'clock in the morning.

[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.220]
I mean, there might be, you know, double on the second floor.

[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.860]
There's probably one.

[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.160]
I would have told you about that.

[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.640]
I was told it yesterday.

[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.360]
By the way, it was a bad mistake.

[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.020]
I told you, don't let me go for a while.

[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.740]
I told you to make me stick for at least a couple weeks with a New Year's resolution.

[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.560]
One o'clock the poker starts here.

[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.980]
And I'm so damn pissed off about the Canada post.

[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.800]
Oh, yesterday I was supposed to get my little carb pasta, the dream field and the air of the

[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.020]
sauce.

[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.960]
And it never showed up.

[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.680]
It's coming today now.

[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.320]
It says on there.

[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.180]
They don't sell it in stores there.

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.600]
No.

[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.700]
Might it be selling stores there?

[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.580]
Oh, yeah, Publix.

[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.760]
Has Dreamfields passed them?

[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.200]
You know it.

[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.300]
I never knew that.

[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.360]
You never told me that.

[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.080]
I thought I did.

[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.100]
Maybe if I looked around, maybe I'd find it somewhere.

[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.880]
Maybe in the minion.

[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.900]
That could be.

[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.720]
Or someplace like that.

[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:58.700]
And you're all these people.

[00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.780]
Waaah, it's so cold.

[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.960]
It's in the 30s.

[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.940]
It feels like in the...

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.420]
The temperature here right now is minus 17 Celsius.

[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.260]
I know you don't have your chart handy right there.

[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.680]
No, I don't.

[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.960]
Sorry.

[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.800]
It's colder in the witches' ass, man.

[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.760]
It's really...

[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.620]
It's sunny though.

[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.680]
It's one of those winter days when from the inside it looks really beautiful.

[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.600]
Like a picture postcard from inside.

[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.160]
And then you go outside.

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.560]
A lot of that doesn't bother me.

[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.460]
It was like about minus 12 last night.

[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.140]
I went out to my little convenience store there.

[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.900]
Didn't even put on my tooke.

[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.780]
Hey, you've got to start getting with it, okay?

[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.560]
I know about that.

[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.040]
Anybody doesn't know what a tooke is.

[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.280]
Is there some kind of a redneck?

[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.340]
I used to own a tooke.

[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.160]
Did you really?

[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.700]
Yeah, and then I traded it for a toke.

[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.340]
So the dolphins released a scan camera.

[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.820]
I like the way it says released.

[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.300]
Fire.

[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.220]
You're fired, Cam.

[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.200]
The scanster.

[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.140]
What did I tell you?

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.320]
And Chris has given me, oh, I think they're going to wait until...

[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.020]
Well, they did name the new GM.

[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.400]
And by the way, you're out, scam.

[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.680]
We'll see so I was right.

[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.200]
Yeah, you're full of crap.

[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.700]
Hey.

[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.200]
The big tuna.

[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.680]
The big tuna.

[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.300]
We don't need the big tuna.

[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.360]
We need the big kahuna.

[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.460]
Robe young.

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.020]
Yeah, let's play that again.

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.700]
Let's play it again.

[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.560]
You're being right.

[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.000]
I'm damn glad.

[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.760]
Yeah, we are.

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.860]
And we're proud of it.

[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.820]
So anyway, there's nothing with any engineers going out out there.

[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.180]
Nothing going on here with it.

[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.260]
Far from the course.

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.400]
The two coaches who've been retained their assistant special teams coach Steve Hoffman and

[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.560]
Linebacker coach George Edwards.

[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.900]
All the other coaches are free to seek other employment, to really say.

[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.020]
And again, the hero doesn't want to...

[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.260]
Or the sun sentle doesn't want to like couch it in terms...

[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.100]
They're fired.

[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.740]
Not free to seek other employment.

[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.940]
That means you don't work here anymore.

[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.580]
You're fired.

[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.280]
You're out.

[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.920]
Scam.

[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.000]
It says, however, when a new head coach is in place, there's a possibility he'll talk to

[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]
some of those assistants, the team said.

[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.360]
This is a difficult decision.

[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.740]
I don't want to thank Ken and the rest of his staff for their work this past season.

[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.440]
Said, often, General Manjou Jeff Ireland.

[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.320]
By making this decision out, gives all the coaches the greatest chance to pursue other

[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.940]
opportunities.

[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.340]
In other words, get your ass out of here.

[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.700]
Clean out your desk and get out of here.

[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.200]
Get lost, Scam.

[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.620]
With your 115.

[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.720]
As if there was any chance that he was coming back.

[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.000]
You'd have to be deaf, dumb, blind and stupid.

[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.740]
You'd have to be like a vegetable on a plate.

[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.240]
Like a piece of broccoli to bring him back.

[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.840]
So what are you going to be doing out there all day besides the...

[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.940]
Well, I'm going to give you a lot of free food.

[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.860]
Yeah, I'm going to see if they're going to give me something to drink.

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.160]
Why do I Chris has here?

[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.840]
He enjoys drama here this morning.

[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.260]
He went to a do a joy son.

[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.280]
That's funny that you should mention that.

[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.700]
Oh, that full room.

[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.540]
Full house.

[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.260]
Yeah, I've had that problem before.

[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.940]
You've been in the hotel.

[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.200]
I have a different problem here.

[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.440]
I didn't know where the joy sir was.

[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.620]
And so I didn't have my regular morning.

[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.840]
And so I'm going to be uncomfortable the whole show.

[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.020]
I just started laying that out there.

[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.300]
Why, where is it?

[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:38.760]
This is far away.

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.120]
I still don't know where it is.

[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.300]
And you know what, this place is so nice.

[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.700]
I'll come on.

[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.600]
But I'm even wanting to read it.

[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.980]
You can't find a turlip.

[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.420]
It's not clearly marked.

[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.720]
Use it now.

[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.640]
Oh, now they tell me.

[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.380]
Now they tell me.

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:48.960]
Too late.

[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.640]
Too late, then.

[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.340]
I'm already on deck.

[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.200]
Now they tell you what.

[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.100]
Now they tell me where it is.

[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.000]
It's probably too nice to use.

[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.380]
You ever go into a bathroom that's so nice?

[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:57.880]
You dare not?

[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.560]
No.

[00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.740]
Now that I was doing joy.

[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.020]
Now when nature is calling, it's never too nice to use.

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.900]
Well, we'll see if I can put this off for fun.

[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.400]
Although I do, it does irritate me that New Year's Eve.

[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.580]
I knew that Christmas Eve.

[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.600]
At Ruth Chris, I went and took a leak and they didn't have ice in the urinal.

[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.040]
Oh, that's criminal.

[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.740]
That's one of the great thrills about coming out.

[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.000]
Well, you know, you saw the great food and the ambiance and the whole thing and the great services.

[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.800]
Going and tinkling on the fresh ice in the urinal.

[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.240]
That's how you know you're in a classy joint.

[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:23.980]
That's right.

[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.200]
But there was no ice.

[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.120]
But it was still a good time.

[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.640]
No, you could take some time and go re-joice or whatever you need.

[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.820]
A little later on or whatever you need to just rest on.

[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.460]
I might, you know, oh yeah, I'll holler.

[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:34.900]
You bet.

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.320]
That's all I can do because I don't have my magic box.

[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.200]
Okay, well, here's some good news because the Iowa caucuses today.

[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.160]
Democrat Barack Obama searched to a four-point lead over General Edwards and I was slowly fading to third.

[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.060]
Just hours before the first presidential nominating contest.

[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.620]
That's the brand new Reuters C-SPAN Zogby Pull released this morning.

[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.780]
Obama and Edwards gained ground over that in the tracking poll.

[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.200]
Clinton fell four points to third.

[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.740]
She's dropping like a rock.

[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.980]
A finish that if held would deal a dramatic setback for the one time.

[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.160]
She was just assumed that she was going to be in because she's Bubba's wife, you know.

[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.080]
Hillary, oh yeah, Hillary.

[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.160]
It was assumed. Well, guess what?

[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.660]
Well, Bama's got 31% Edwards 27 and swore he'd out of 24%

[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.480]
no other Democrat in double digits on the Republican side.

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.260]
My cock could be expanded as lead to six points.

[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.400]
Go ahead. I hope they nominate that far-bison man.

[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.700]
He got two chances of getting elected.

[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.920]
None and much, much less than none.

[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.240]
What was that?

[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.840]
That's Steph laughing in the background.

[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.260]
I called Rolly a Fag in Sign Language and Steph's thought was...

[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.280]
What's Steph laughing about?

[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.660]
I called Rolly. I said Rolly with very gay.

[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.920]
If I think it was sitting there with no 360 and that the engineer never showed up here, that's pretty funny.

[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.640]
No, he ain't laughing about that.

[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.880]
Oh. What's he laughing about?

[00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.400]
I called Rolly very gay in Sign Language and Steph thought it was funny.

[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.420]
Oh, are you doing Sign Language again?

[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.360]
Sure. What?

[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.740]
I'll give clearance from Sign Language for me.

[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.640]
I will. I will.

[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.020]
I know how to say that.

[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.100]
How could be 31 to 25 over Mitt Romney?

[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.360]
Fred Thompson's in turd with 11 points and John McCain's 10%.

[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.080]
Ron Paul's got 10%. He's a phantom.

[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.500]
He's an internet fan of Ron Paul.

[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.260]
Oh, you're afraid of Ron Paul?

[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.900]
No, he's just another dentist, Cassinage.

[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.820]
This is a clear Clinton fade, Paul's to John's obvious set.

[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.940]
None of it's been dramatic but it's been steady.

[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.860]
A clear fade by Swillary.

[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.540]
I had an article here a little later on about how weak she is among men.

[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.320]
She's weak. Although she's not.

[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.620]
It's amazing that all the Democrats are weak among men.

[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.140]
We better start pulling for the Republicans because we're looking for that male audience.

[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.520]
Not. That'll be the day when I start to...

[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.440]
Oh my God. And what a lackluster field of losers, my God.

[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.420]
Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson are really...

[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.940]
I've been married a hundred times to a Giuliani.

[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.500]
Here's the poll from yesterday speaking of that.

[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.700]
Do you consider yourself blank?

[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:53.780]
Yes.

[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.380]
Yeah, me too.

[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.720]
1,098 votes exclusively heterosexual 847-77.1%.

[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.860]
Bisexual 93, not sure 61, exclusively homosexual 60, only 5.4% that's down 2 points,

[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.640]
down 2% in the homos from last time we did the survey.

[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.360]
Damn it. They've flown away and a sexual 37, only 3.3%.

[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.760]
So what is he? You're going to be doing out there all day?

[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.740]
They besides you and your ass are looking for a toilet.

[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.380]
After that I'm hoping that they'll give me some free food, maybe some free booze.

[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.820]
Beer will do. They got a lot on tap over here in the Sportacans Polka room.

[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.580]
And I might do some milling about.

[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.400]
I had that online, mind.

[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.680]
As soon as people start showing up, we got some...

[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.440]
Well, you sure started making a lot of noise.

[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.020]
You sure started making a lot of noise?

[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.860]
No. No. I might mill about anyway though.

[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.880]
And when people show up we got some prizes that we might give them if they do something amusing.

[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.400]
Well they said we'll leave it up to you how you want to give these prizes away.

[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.860]
We're not giving them out. We got some t-shirts, we got some tickets,

[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.580]
something, don't ask me what, they'll write it down for me at some point.

[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.180]
Orange bowl tickets.

[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.080]
Thank you Steve.

[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.880]
Steve Sloan's over here acting like a producer which is great because nobody else is.

[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.220]
Come back more like a sales guy would be a good idea.

[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]
Oh god Neil.

[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.640]
Hello bloggers.

[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.900]
Sony I have posted any new entries lately.

[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.240]
I've been too busy playing C-Tar hero 3.

[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.820]
Anyway, Death to America and Death to Israel.

[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:31.580]
And now check out this video I shot at the Ayatola watching the two girls one cut video.

[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.040]
I swear it almost lost chunks.

[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.120]
Okay, 10, 16, and 5, 60, WQM.

[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.480]
Let's see what we got going on today.

[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.760]
We had the big dog who was out of costume this morning.

[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.100]
And Georgia's there today and I have no idea why.

[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.460]
Well, so I could get paid.

[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.120]
Is the most important reason.

[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.140]
But I make a few extra bucks.

[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.480]
Are you actually getting paid to be sitting around out there and eat that?

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.080]
And hopefully I'll get paid to...

[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.920]
Now who set this up?

[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.060]
The idea ultimately came from Lee who did this thing.

[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.540]
I can really hear George now Chris.

[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:00.540]
I just mentioned that in past.

[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.820]
They did something during the break.

[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.480]
Chris thought I was too loud. It's his fault.

[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.660]
No, you weren't too loud.

[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.660]
Now you're just re-autobi.

[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.860]
So anyway, where?

[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.120]
Chris is playing bush boss now now.

[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.800]
I don't know.

[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:11.760]
And he's out of control.

[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.420]
That's alright.

[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.860]
Yeah, he's playing bush boss.

[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.700]
Okay, I heard him.

[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.300]
It's like if I get some in advance about...

[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.080]
But he's a big shot.

[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.860]
That's alright.

[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.140]
He deserves it.

[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.480]
I guess.

[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.200]
No, he does for some reason.

[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.020]
Okay, then he doesn't.

[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.220]
So anyway, Lee had a radio station that he was out previously.

[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.640]
They had this thing called Liquid Lunch, where Lee and Lee.

[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.080]
And we're one of the people associated with the midday show with Beyond Location.

[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.220]
We're working on the air.

[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:33.700]
That sounds great.

[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.480]
It's a great scam.

[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.100]
A way to make money for one of the people on the air.

[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.440]
And so he decided this thing.

[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.400]
I think it's a real good idea.

[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.740]
The air station doesn't have a license.

[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.400]
It's very good.

[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:42.600]
Right.

[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.480]
It's an excellent idea.

[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.040]
And he taught me about it.

[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.500]
And I said, great.

[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.100]
I would love to have more money to go have free lunch somewhere during the show.

[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.260]
Right.

[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.380]
As long as it was alright with Neil and I asked you if it wasn't.

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.960]
Well, that's a good flee seems to be really a promoting lot of you.

[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.380]
He is.

[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.240]
He's one of the...

[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.400]
You know, wall supplies last.

[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.120]
He looks so much better.

[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:56.740]
No, fire him.

[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.640]
Well, you're not here.

[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.340]
Or you'd be the one on the location.

[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:00.520]
No, I don't want to be on the location.

[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.240]
I'm already on the location.

[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:02.960]
I'm on the town.

[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.120]
And Rolie's uncle is one of the bartenders here.

[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.740]
So I have a pretty good idea that I'm going to get some free beer before I get out of here.

[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.220]
Great.

[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.700]
That's what we're about.

[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.340]
I see we got the jack show at 2 this afternoon again.

[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.780]
It's coming back in a second.

[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.200]
Oh boy.

[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.260]
There are stories already.

[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.840]
They had lunch show about the jack show.

[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.540]
Well, I'm sure you guys, you were here.

[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.240]
He was out in the loop.

[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.440]
He knew as long as I was leaving the studio yesterday.

[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.520]
There were eight people in the control room all trying to figure out what was going on.

[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.680]
And I don't think they have yet.

[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.600]
What do we buy that?

[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.860]
It was chaos.

[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.700]
It was Mayhem.

[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.180]
They're new producer who we're calling tweak.

[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.560]
His hair is all spiky and he dresses all wrong.

[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.840]
Oh, that's jerks his buddy.

[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.520]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.300]
I brought him down here.

[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.680]
Supposed to know what he was doing.

[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.440]
That might be the case wherever he came from.

[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.940]
But he didn't know anything about our control room.

[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.600]
So it was just a train right there at the beginning of the show.

[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.540]
You know, who knows.

[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.500]
I would keep listening today after the switch to just to see what's going on.

[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.540]
So it's going to be a daily surprise.

[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.480]
You're telling me to do that?

[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.020]
Oh no.

[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.040]
I have so much to do now.

[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.180]
And I'll send you a picture.

[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.220]
And I've got somebody sneak a picture of tweak and send it to you

[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.740]
so that you can enjoy the comedy as well.

[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.540]
A picture of tweak?

[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.800]
The producer there.

[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.060]
His hair is all spiky.

[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.980]
What about guys that wear white belt since you took that pole yesterday?

[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.020]
Gay.

[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:16.720]
Okay.

[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:16.960]
Yeah.

[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.560]
We took a pole amongst ourselves and that's not on a sports station.

[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.040]
We had to want some fat on here producing a show on the sport, especially with a macho guy like jerks there.

[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.240]
I mean, he might be a nice guy.

[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.680]
I mean, just because he wears a white belt.

[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.160]
Yeah, I think he's been on for one day.

[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.760]
And you're already ripping this poor kid in ass.

[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.360]
How old is he?

[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.020]
I don't know.

[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.620]
He wears a white belt.

[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.200]
How old is he?

[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.300]
I don't care about his belt.

[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.940]
He wants to get 20 something.

[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.580]
I could use the belt.

[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.280]
Hey, roll his uncle.

[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:40.900]
How about a belt?

[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:41.920]
How about an Irish coffee?

[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.660]
Yeah, give him a belt in the head.

[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.160]
Then we got mad dog four to six because how...

[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.340]
Oh, that's right.

[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:48.740]
It's Thursday.

[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.200]
See, they have to...

[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.020]
The wall of football that we have, they own the hairways.

[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:55.820]
So...

[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.720]
No, I know that.

[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.680]
No, that's a funny term.

[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.800]
So, it mandates his opponent four to seven now.

[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.520]
He's doing four to six with his regular show.

[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.660]
And then six to seven, it's dolphins all asses.

[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.540]
Because we got to squeeze that in there to keep bald.

[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.360]
We all pacified.

[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.700]
Because then you got all your hurry king crap coming after that seven o'clock hurry king hotline.

[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.860]
And then 735, it's the orange bowl.

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.540]
All right.

[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.900]
From ESPN radio.

[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.560]
We certainly...

[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.680]
I guess we don't have the rights to broadcast it ourselves.

[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.420]
You guys get me?

[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:21.700]
Chris?

[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.600]
I'm asking Chris.

[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.300]
I have no idea.

[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.420]
He's laying out.

[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.440]
He's not saying a word now.

[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.560]
Now that he messed up your mic so bad.

[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.140]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.740]
But I do have some good news for you.

[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.340]
You know.

[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.340]
Yeah, what's that?

[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.880]
We got a last-part cutie retails.

[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.420]
I'll be faxing that to you next break.

[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.840]
I play the all right, but I don't have the three six.

[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.360]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.440]
We don't have anywhere to put it.

[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.620]
What time is this spot going to be?

[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.140]
Well, you'll find the way.

[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.600]
They just wrote it into the thing.

[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.680]
So, I'll send you the new...

[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.960]
The rearranged vlog in the business.

[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.440]
The live spot on this show.

[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.180]
Somebody sold a spot on this show?

[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:50.500]
Yes.

[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.200]
Oh my god.

[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.200]
Oh my god.

[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.320]
Oh my god.

[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.480]
Holy moly.

[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.660]
Is this something I know about or something they just sneak into?

[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.180]
Is that it?

[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.200]
No, it's one of your regulars.

[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.500]
I wonder how regular.

[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.100]
Well, that's nice.

[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:03.580]
That's good.

[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.280]
So, I guess that means we're going to be on there for another few days.

[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.740]
That's our clearance asking me yesterday.

[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.940]
Well, what's the chance that you're going to be staying?

[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.640]
Well, what are these people talking about?

[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.160]
Are they insane or what?

[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.700]
The chances of us staying beyond when we absolutely have to stay.

[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.780]
I would say are non-existent.

[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:22.760]
Non-existent.

[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.140]
I mean, he's asking me this a year ahead of the fact.

[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.620]
You know, like, oh jeez.

[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.040]
For a 673 votes on today's poll, I don't know about this poll.

[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.220]
I'm not that crazy about it.

[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.640]
Oh, and Charlie B said a really great thing.

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.660]
Or maybe I'll read it after I do the poll thing.

[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.540]
WQM in Flomin' application.

[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.980]
I just go on Charlie, very creative.

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.380]
Name Social Security Number, and then are you from Raleigh?

[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.220]
And it gets better than there.

[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.860]
Which personal hygiene routine do you have the most trouble?

[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.120]
You sound like you have a bad cold.

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.760]
I do it very stuffy, and I woke up that way.

[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.940]
I don't have a bad cold because I slept too cold.

[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.680]
I didn't have it like that I walked out of the chill.

[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.300]
I cried under the covers because it was like minus one show.

[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.300]
It was like minus 28 or something last night.

[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.660]
Which personal hygiene routine do you have the most trouble?

[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.420]
Sticking two out of regular bases.

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.220]
Flossing, 338.

[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:08.940]
I voted for that.

[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.460]
Yeah.

[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.280]
Every time I go get my teeth cleaned or go to the dentist for any reason,

[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.560]
she always gives me a song.

[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.380]
And they give you a little thing of dental floss.

[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.840]
And be sure in floss every day.

[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.120]
But who the hell does that?

[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.800]
It's a pain in the ass.

[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.660]
The pain in the teeth.

[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.900]
Flossing, unless you got your teeth on somebody's ass.

[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.860]
Flossing 342.

[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.000]
Shaving 64.

[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.240]
I mean, what is that?

[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.020]
Is that difficult?

[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.380]
I don't like to, but it's annoying.

[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.000]
No, I know.

[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:33.820]
It sits still.

[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.080]
It's putting out my belly button in 53.

[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.480]
Oh, geez.

[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.740]
Trimming my nose or ear here in 41.

[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.720]
That's annoying when you get all this stuff cleaning up.

[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.820]
It's thoroughly sprowding up.

[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.460]
Sprouting.

[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.460]
How deep of a cutesy you have to have for that?

[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.400]
Applying coloner for fume 36.

[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.280]
Rushing my teeth 35.

[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.880]
It's your like to be around some of these people.

[00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.460]
Trimming my nails 24.

[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.080]
Don't trim them just chew them, even your toenails.

[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.460]
Cleaning the wax out of my ears 22.

[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.740]
Cleaning out my Toe-cheese 16.

[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.460]
Bathing 15.

[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.020]
Using my-

[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.480]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.740]
Using my watch 10.

[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.940]
Like I said, good to polish, rally.

[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.780]
Cleaning the dirt from under my nails eight.

[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.320]
Using the odorant six.

[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.460]
Wash my hair three and brushing or combing my hair three.

[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.660]
That's 678.

[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.460]
That's okay.

[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.740]
Here's the QM employment application that Charlie V came up with.

[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:26.720]
First question.

[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.960]
Are you from Raleigh, North Carolina?

[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.840]
Then, have you ever lived in Raleigh, North Carolina?

[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.300]
Are you related to anyone from Raleigh, North Carolina?

[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.160]
Do you know anyone from Raleigh, North Carolina?

[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.920]
Have you ever had a neighbor from Raleigh, North Carolina?

[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.180]
Or have you ever driven through Raleigh, North Carolina?

[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:39.860]
I got that.

[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.040]
If you have any of these, stop.

his producer he was playing some some i don't know who his producer is but he was a tweaked

[00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:16.590]
from funny goli noises in the background i don't know if it was a bit or it was just the drop

[00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:21.650]

[00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:27.770]

[00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:51.070]
he's figured that out by now this is not a real radio station uh twerk for whatever your name is

[00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:55.610]
what was named summit that's very easy part of this is that his buddy brought him down the

[00:43:55.610 --> 00:44:00.190]
florida that's the funny part last time that happened it was mohawar david it did with uh what's his name

[00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:06.510]
shmikol shai who was a good guy shai was a good guy and he was fired probably that

[00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:10.870]
that was and of course he was Jewish too and in his really so sure 80 strikes against the mario

[00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:18.490]

[00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:41.850]
you're not gonna be missed in the grocery store anymore

[00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.950]
you

[00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:26.610]
shout

[00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:28.290]
let's go

[00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:44.750]
It's 11.15.60 WQM. Happy New Year. It's still not too late to say happy New Year.

[00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.650]
At what point does it get to be too late? Like next week against tomorrow.

[00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.450]
There's a lot of day for that. Today's last day for happy New Year.

[00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.710]
Oh, just being arbitrary. Based on what? I just pulled that out of my arse.

[00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.190]
Well, screw you. No.

[00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.330]
I'm going to say happy New Year. Does still sound stuffy?

[00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:03.110]
748. It sounds stuffy. Do I still sound stuffy?

[00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.390]
Oh, yeah. Not as bad. Why before you know?

[00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.130]
No, I'm drinking an Irish coffee.

[00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.570]
All right. Sound a little bit better.

[00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:09.930]
I'll only be in the take by noon.

[00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:12.330]
Chris, we'll get your pot back up where it belongs.

[00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.870]
We've never left. A lot of Chris can be some pot.

[00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.570]
I've touched this pot on us and stuff like that.

[00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.230]
We just, we just relax.

[00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:18.710]
Good. Or such a nervous moment.

[00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:19.530]
I hit it well.

[00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.710]
I can't hear this morning in sat down.

[00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.710]
I was like, oh, when you get up in the morning, it was 80 below zero last night.

[00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.190]
And I'm like sniffling a little bit.

[00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.550]
Yeah, it's the wintertime allergies.

[00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.290]
Oh, you sicker, something old, you.

[00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:34.750]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.330]
You've been hanging around Eric too long. That's your problem.

[00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.150]
By the way, thanks to Eric for New Year's Eve,

[00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.190]
bailing out Cortus. Cortus said, thank you very much.

[00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.970]
Because Eric did the bedtime stories because Cortus is exact words to me this morning.

[00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:48.990]
Oh, I wanted to go out and get hammered. So how unusual.

[00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.690]
Give the Cortus the number for AA.

[00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:56.110]
Okay. Give me the number for FAA, FADDIS and ONLINES.

[00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:56.930]
Go ahead. I'm back.

[00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.750]
Now I am. I'm really on the boat.

[00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.470]
And I checked online.

[00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.230]
Yeah. Canada Post Day.

[00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.170]
And my package is on the truck for delivery.

[00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:05.870]
Where the hell is it already with my pasta?

[00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:07.850]
Basta with a pasta already.

[00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.230]
Jesus Christ, that's the only way I'm going to lose any weight.

[00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.130]
The low-car pasta that saw us.

[00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:12.490]
At walk.

[00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:13.750]
Just a walkin'.

[00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:15.730]
You don't understand, New Year.

[00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.330]
This is not the time of the year for walkin'.

[00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.210]
Yeah, it's got you got it.

[00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.070]
It is minus 15 Celsius.

[00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.730]
Yeah, that's hot.

[00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.090]
Put your out of coat.

[00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:24.510]
Steal belted radials on your feet and go for a walk.

[00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:28.190]
Dog Thompson asks, how many more Americans must die?

[00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.510]
There's a question that nobody asks, present,

[00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.050]
so candidates and issues run for the top job in a White House.

[00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:37.970]
It's a question that must be asked, how many more Americans must die

[00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:40.150]
before we end the illegal and immoral war in Iraq?

[00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:41.990]
Forget about time tables.

[00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.350]
Forget about political implications.

[00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.090]
And forget about our so-called mission to bring democracy

[00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:47.230]
to that award-torn country.

[00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.090]
We no longer have democracy in the U.S.

[00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.970]
so honor from being exported to another country.

[00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:53.930]
This is a simple question of life and death.

[00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.230]
How many more dedicated men and women must die

[00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.410]
before we admit we were wrong and bring them home?

[00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.610]
The American death toll will soon top 4000,

[00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:03.670]
I suspected past 4000 long time ago,

[00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:05.990]
because the Pentagon played fast and loose with the numbers,

[00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.290]
and some who died after leaving the country with wounds

[00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.330]
died later from those wounds, but their deaths weren't listed

[00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.990]
as a lack of combat casualties.

[00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:14.790]
But the issue here is morality, not numbers.

[00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.370]
It was wrong for the rest of the invaded country

[00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:18.250]
that posed no immediate threat to our way of life.

[00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.230]
We weren't supposed to do things like that.

[00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.830]
If one American dies to man legal and immoral act

[00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.110]
then it is one American too many.

[00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.210]
The blood of every American killed or wounded

[00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:28.810]
in that war stains the hands of everyone who helped promote the invasion.

[00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.510]
The Bush administration hacks the Occupian Intelligence Data,

[00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:34.030]
the members of Congress have voted to authorize the invasion,

[00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.470]
the media that fell for the flag-waving propaganda,

[00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.430]
and every right-wing nutcase that continues to remote the slaughter

[00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.670]
is some god-given right of America to kill those who disagree with us.

[00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:46.410]
America has become a bigger tyrant than those we seek to overthrow,

[00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:50.130]
where an international bully feared on some front and despised them anymore.

[00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.910]
Respect for this nation vanished on the international stage long ago,

[00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.670]
even the late Pope warned George W. Bush that invading Iraq

[00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.650]
would be a criminal act, even Papa knew that.

[00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:04.090]
The presidential campaign treats the Iraq Wars a taboo subject

[00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.930]
that must be handled with hyperbole and double-talk.

[00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:09.490]
Among the frontrunners on both sides only Democrat Barack Obama

[00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.950]
voted against the invasion of Iraq, but even his comments have tempered of late.

[00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.970]
Hillary Clinton voted for the invasions refused to apologize for that vote.

[00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:20.750]
John Edwards has changed his position more times than couples in the Sex Education video,

[00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.750]
and Republican frontrunners Marching Goose-Step with Bush on the War.

[00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.950]
Republican Ron Paul and Democrat Dennis Kacinichvase

[00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:28.770]
must have their campaigns on opposition to the war,

[00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:30.530]
but barring a major upset in the primary,

[00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.810]
he neither stand much of a chance of winning their party's nomination.

[00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:36.430]
So it's time to ask the question to those who stand the best chance of becoming the candidates,

[00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:38.910]
how many more Americans must die in Iraq,

[00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:42.950]
the only acceptable answer is none, says WET.

[00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.030]
Well, there's my Kuckabee in decades.

[00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:50.650]
You'll tell your kids and grandkids, I helped make political history.

[00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.910]
Right, we put a far-bicinate goi in a way,

[00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.830]
and of course we already got one, and look, that's working out pretty good, isn't it?

[00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.930]
That's just what we need, is this preacher, this Bible thump,

[00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:02.130]
and hate-mongering preacher from Arkansas, another goofball.

[00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:05.650]
And it's really interesting how he's like skyrocketed at the top,

[00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:09.290]
because the Christian right, he embraces all of our bigoted positions

[00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.890]
on every issue you can come down to fight with.

[00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:14.690]
Other anti-science, anti-intellectual, stone age, flat earth crap.

[00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.430]
There's Ned Romney, there's another one with his magic underwear.

[00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:21.170]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:23.310]
Not there, QAM, hello.

[00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.830]
Oh, if I was right in Georgia, I might have go get it.

[00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:27.590]
Oh, okay, go get it.

[00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:28.530]
Hey Chris, play that music.

[00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.490]
Play UBL this time, would you?

[00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:31.890]
It's under UBL.

[00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.930]
UBL in order.

[00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:34.350]
Yeah, you're J.

[00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.850]
Come on now.

[00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:37.570]
Quick of that.

[00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:58.990]

[00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:08.270]
Which remember that song?

[00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:11.130]
Yeah, whistle while you eat something like that?

[00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:11.910]
Whistle your a jerk.

[00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:13.430]
You've done that before though.

[00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.130]
I mean, you've got your blood sugar all through the ceiling during the show.

[00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.770]
Yeah, remember the lady that brought by the...

[00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:18.270]
Oh, I know.

[00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:18.930]
The Ruggola.

[00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:20.250]
Yeah.

[00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:20.870]
Ruggola.

[00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:22.770]
A Ruggola.

[00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:25.630]
During the show, I did your diet on the ear.

[00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:26.470]
Thanks a lot, bitch.

[00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:27.590]
At a wheel you out.

[00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.850]
It's like that woman are keeping her in the smarties to the hockey games and I kept begging

[00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:31.810]
her, don't bring these.

[00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:32.630]
I'm addicted to them.

[00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:33.110]
I'm diabetic.

[00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:34.010]
They're going to kill me.

[00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.630]
That's right.

[00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:38.270]
Or it's sick during the game and my head would be pounding and the game would be sucking

[00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.070]
and...

[00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:40.110]
Oh my God.

[00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:41.350]
Stop doing that.

[00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:43.890]
People killing you with kindness.

[00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:45.050]
I don't want no candy.

[00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.870]
Okay, if I want smarties I can go right across the street by all I want.

[00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:50.130]
I can buy a bushel barrel full of smarties.

[00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.970]
Jackass bitch.

[00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:54.070]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:55.230]
I thought Jesus.

[00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:57.430]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:02.310]
Okay, the Puerto Rican is near Psychic Anivia.

[00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:03.310]
Lee's sucks.

[00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:04.610]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:04.610]

[00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:04.610]

[00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:04.610]

[00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:06.510]
Yes, he is.

[00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:08.530]
There's no office at Kipzle stop.

[00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:09.730]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:11.070]
How are you doing, Neil?

[00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.870]
Okay.

[00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:12.850]
No more happy than you.

[00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:15.210]
I hope the best for you is coming here, Neil.

[00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.470]
Okay?

[00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:16.530]
All the best.

[00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.250]
All right, now, how about this?

[00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.310]
I love you.

[00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:22.250]
I love you, I love you, I love you.

[00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:23.210]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:25.530]
Patients are making some chuban.

[00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:27.590]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.270]

[00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:30.410]
Yeah.

[00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.070]
Well, I don't want to see George.

[00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.710]
Hi, George.

[00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:54.690]
Hello.

[00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:55.570]
Hello.

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:55.690]

[00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.790]

[00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.790]

[00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:55.830]

[00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:55.830]

[00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:55.830]

[00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:55.830]

[00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.870]
Hello.

[00:52:57.790 --> 00:52:58.090]
Hello.

[00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:59.210]
Hello.

[00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.670]
Hey, listen.

[00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.750]
I voted just on the poll, Ricky Strayboro.

[00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:05.270]
Ricky Strayboro, who you?

[00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.830]
And I think, because it's cute, you know, just then, then, Brady.

[00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:09.570]
Okay, bye.

[00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.390]
Yeah.

[00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.090]
How many Q-A-M, hello?

[00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:15.850]
Hey, good afternoon, I was nearly happy to be here.

[00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:16.410]
Yes, sir, good evening.

[00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:17.250]
Happy New Year, George.

[00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:18.030]
Yo, yo.

[00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:19.050]
Hey, man.

[00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:21.890]
Just one quick thing for us for a delicious thing.

[00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:25.610]
People are freaking have their dogs and sweaters down here right now.

[00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:26.470]
I can't believe it.

[00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:27.430]
Yeah, oh, yeah.

[00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.030]
Poor babies.

[00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:29.230]
Oh, it's in the 30s.

[00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:30.070]
What are we going to do?

[00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.190]
Hey, Neil, can you do me a favor?

[00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:33.950]
I've always wanted you to do this.

[00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.550]
Can you put all these crazies on the phone at the same time as you?

[00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:37.790]
No.

[00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:38.690]
No.

[00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.870]
Yeah, put them all on the phone and now just walk out.

[00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.030]
If we could put them all in one room at the same time.

[00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:45.190]
Yeah, that would be good.

[00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.570]
Would be something.

[00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:46.970]
With you, right there in the nose.

[00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:47.770]
Oh, yeah, come on.

[00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:48.510]
I brought a good one.

[00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.250]
7.62 on the poll and we're going to have, I think, over 800 by 11.

[00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.230]
I think, yeah, we should be set for 1,000 today.

[00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:55.070]
This should be pretty easy.

[00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:57.250]
And it's a fabulous poll.

[00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:00.130]
Gross, disgusting choices on there.

[00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:02.050]
They're all picking their navel, lint, and each others.

[00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:04.350]
That's probably what they're doing at the Rones house now.

[00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:05.170]
They're picking each others navel.

[00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:06.310]
Oh, geez.

[00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:08.630]
Oh, yeah, yeah, toe cheese.

[00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:10.670]
You had to go there.

[00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:11.190]
You had to go there.

[00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:12.750]
And they're probably picking each others.

[00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:13.450]
Right, come, boo.

[00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:14.170]
All right.

[00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.550]
WDQI.

[00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:17.170]
Hello.

[00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:19.130]
I got on.

[00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:20.810]
WDQI am hello.

[00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.410]
Did you feel this?

[00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:24.470]
I used the Georgia taking as the...

[00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:25.050]
WDQI am.

[00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:25.370]
Hello.

[00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.070]
Neil, good morning, sir.

[00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.450]
How are you?

[00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:28.590]
I'm fine.

[00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:28.590]

[00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:30.650]
I'm related, happy new year to you, sir.

[00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:31.850]
Man, the same to you.

[00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.390]
You know, it's not the same on this radio station and we'll

[00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:35.250]
what the hammer's on.

[00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:36.310]
Yeah.

[00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:37.410]
And you know what?

[00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.290]
He gave the infamous finger on the way out the other night on

[00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:40.670]
this farewell.

[00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:41.710]
You know that, don't you?

[00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:42.330]
And?

[00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:45.370]
But I'm just saying, it's not going to be the same if you

[00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:45.910]
leave either.

[00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:47.990]
What are we going to do down here with?

[00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:50.530]
Probably find out what station I'm on and listen to me there.

[00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:51.590]
That's probably the way it works.

[00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.890]
WDQI am hello.

[00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:57.250]
Neil, in the real world, the Patriots rule here in South Florida,

[00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.910]
everybody's eating two of his sandwiches while he's firing

[00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:00.430]
there, buddy.

[00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:02.250]
WDQI am hello.

[00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.770]
Neil, what exactly is that feature for Marcus or a friend you

[00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:05.970]
with?

[00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.810]
How are you?

[00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.270]
WDQI am hello.

[00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:11.290]
Hey, I have a new year, Neil.

[00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:12.170]
Back to you.

[00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:16.010]
Hey, just keep us posted on where you're going, sir.

[00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:17.790]
I hope you have a good year.

[00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:18.710]
You make a lot of money.

[00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:21.470]
Just me and you will make a lot of money as well.

[00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:22.850]
Yeah, just me or you.

[00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.650]
Yeah, just me.

[00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:25.030]
Not you.

[00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.670]
Just me.

[00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:27.550]
I don't share.

[00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:30.190]
I share with people I want to share with not some stranger on the

[00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:31.630]
phone and wants to suck up my money.

[00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:34.470]
I want to siphon all these klingons, man.

[00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:36.690]
Just me and you, baby, 50-50, yeah.

[00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:38.630]
I've heard that before.

[00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:42.550]
How we doing on the survey, 7-62, queer Christians just

[00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:44.790]
taught to try to get to a thousand, especially with Georgia

[00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:46.770]
and through a Gulf Stream, kind of in limbo.

[00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.530]
Now we're going to be doing this every Thursday, is that the idea?

[00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:50.410]
No, no, no.

[00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:52.450]
I don't mean a Gulf Stream, but I mean somewhere.

[00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.650]
Hopefully once a month somewhere.

[00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:56.750]
I want some money in different places.

[00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:58.350]
That's the scan that Flea's got going for.

[00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:59.130]
That's a great scan.

[00:55:59.290 --> 00:55:59.750]
I love that, man.

[00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.490]
Good.

[00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:01.210]
Well, there's white blood.

[00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:02.190]
It's the money, believe me.

[00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:03.250]
You see this white lately?

[00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:06.250]
Have I seen who's wife?

[00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:06.910]
Lease.

[00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:08.310]
I don't know.

[00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:09.190]
Didn't know he had a wife.

[00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:10.270]
Is he sure that with you, too?

[00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:10.910]
Not yet.

[00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.150]
Well, keep working on it.

[00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:25.870]
Jenny, Jenny, you were a hot team.

[00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:32.490]
Now they're saying, saying you're jumping.

[00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:40.530]
I saw the pictures of your kind, it's cheeseburgs.

[00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:47.250]
Yeah, I sent to myself, okay, well, so what?

[00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:11.150]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.150]

[00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.330]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:11.430]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.430]

[00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.430]

[00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.430]

[00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.430]

[00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.550]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.750]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:13.110]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.950]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:15.390]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:17.230]
I'm not sure.

[00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:18.570]
Still here there.

[00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:23.130]
36, 24, 49, when it cameras around.

[00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.090]
You might not to cover your faces.

[00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:28.110]
24, 49.

[00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:28.610]
moist.

[00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.450]
36, 24, 49.

[00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:33.690]
I remember what it is, man.

[00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:35.490]
Last couple days I think I'll make your call.

[00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:37.350]
It's times to read your voice.

[00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:38.030]
Yeah, I don't know what that's for a second.

[00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:40.150]
By the way, I found the restaurant finally, and I got a little

[00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:42.250]
bit lost in there, it's kind of huge.

[00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:43.550]
You have lost in the team.

[00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:45.050]
The restaurant, it's amazing.

[00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:47.210]
And if anybody in there tapes some of them up right.

[00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:49.910]
their toe? No, it was all empty. Except for me.

[00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:50.850]
I see.

[00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.330]
Maybe the guy who chews the horses was in there.

[00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:55.050]
Maybe.

[00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:59.750]
Anyway, Iowa pastors who support Republican Micahkabi for

[00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:03.410]
President have received letters warning them that getting involved in politics

[00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:05.950]
could endanger the taxes against status of their churches.

[00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:12.010]
Several pastors who are publicly backed up have been a Southern Baptist

[00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:15.710]
minister who support from many evangelicals, said they have received the letters

[00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:18.870]
which have no return address surprising. We sure they've arrived in the weeks

[00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:22.250]
leading up to today's precinct caucuses. Two letters were sent to the Reverend

[00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:25.070]
Brandt Sherman of Solid Rock Christian Church.

[00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:25.870]
Rock Solid.

[00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:29.210]
In Coralville, the first arrived a couple weeks ago and more than he could be

[00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.910]
prosecuted for a supportive Huckabee. I just laughed. Nobody lands in jail for

[00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:36.390]
this, he said. Someone's tried to intimidate Christians from getting involved.

[00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:37.970]
Good. Good.

[00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:44.370]
I say all religious nuts, regardless of which brand we're talking about, all

[00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:46.290]
religious nuts should be prevented from voting.

[00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:48.990]
Wouldn't that be a good idea? Sure.

[00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:53.190]
A second letter came yesterday alleging that the internal revenue service is

[00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:56.570]
looking for churches that back candidates in violation of tax rules and

[00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:59.590]
mentioned Iowa Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican.

[00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:00.330]
Now what just happened?

[00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.690]
I hit my microphone there.

[00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:03.350]
Oh, I got it.

[00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:06.210]
Oh, it was an Esquito. It was attacking me.

[00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:09.630]
A Republican who sent information about spending my high profile ministries.

[00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:12.930]
Well, maybe the Esquitos looking for a role placed in the line myself while they found it.

[00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:16.470]
The Reverend Kevin Hollinger, a first Baptist church in Algona, has received three

[00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:19.270]
similar letters. Although Hollinger's endorsement of the Huckabee hasn't heard

[00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:22.710]
his congregation's for a particular candidate, I just encourage people to get out and

[00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:25.710]
vote and use their biblical principles. Hollinger said, I don't tell people who

[00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:29.490]
would vote for it. Hollinger said he doubled the doubt that the letters would

[00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:33.510]
intimidate anybody. The Reverend Rex Decker has received nine letters, including three

[00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.830]
yesterday.

[00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:39.790]
Decker, a cavalry of apostolic church in Des Moines, said he wanted to vote above

[00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:42.310]
the letter writers and assumed they must think pastors are ignorant of the rules

[00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:45.530]
regarding church involvement and politics. Regardless, he said the letters won't

[00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:47.950]
change his intention of conquering for a Huckabee.

[00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:52.570]
I'm very impressed with him as a person. I think he's a tremendous individual, Decker,

[00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:57.010]
who said he's far-bistened enough for me. Jim Harris, a Huckabee, spoke to him in

[00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:59.990]
Little Rock, Arkansas, said the campaign was where it letters, but didn't know how

[00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:02.370]
many pastors received them, or they were just being sent in Iowa.

[01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:07.530]
Now, do you like that? Don't be supporting no far-bistened glory like that, because he's

[01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:10.970]
the wrong flavor. He is not the flavor to do your.

[01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:17.690]
Seven, seventy-seven on the pole, seventy-seven. How come you're not playing any droppings?

[01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:22.230]
Hey! I wish I could. I can make some of this with my mouth.

[01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:24.210]
What do you want to hear? Don't be making sounds with your mouth.

[01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:25.990]
How about the food?

[01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.350]
How about the food?

[01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.450]

[01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:26.850]
How about the food?

[01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:26.930]
How about the food?

[01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.970]
How about the food?

[01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:26.990]

[01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:28.010]
How about the food?

[01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.910]
How about the food?

[01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:32.650]
How about the food?

[01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.030]
How about the food?

[01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.510]
How about the food?

[01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:39.930]
In vision of the scene that goes on there, can you just...

[01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:40.890]
I really don't want to.

[01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:41.870]
Not before lunch.

[01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.230]
I'm not drunk enough yet.

[01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:49.810]
And this is an everyday, Monday through Friday, this goes on every single day in that place.

[01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:50.750]
That's all they've got.

[01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:55.290]
In that pit, wherever these three lunatics are, in that pit, every single day.

[01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:56.090]
Hi, Ron!

[01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:57.490]
Hi, Ron!

[01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.670]
Hi, Ron!

[01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.710]

[01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.890]
Education!

[01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.370]
Present!

[01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:02.950]
I got news for you, boy.

[01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.450]
You won't hear this in another show in the free world.

[01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:06.570]
That's right.

[01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:07.930]
That's not a selling point.

[01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:08.570]
No.

[01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.670]
WDQYM, hello.

[01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.690]
That's a sticking point.

[01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:14.350]
Well, I'm really excited that my box is downstairs.

[01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:16.370]
WDQYM, hello.

[01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:17.290]
Hi, Ron!

[01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:18.190]
I'm over here!

[01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:19.330]
WDQYM, hello.

[01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:20.490]
Hey, Neil.

[01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:21.290]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:25.250]
You've been told George you've been a wife and you've been fired for being drunk on the job.

[01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.930]
Yeah.

[01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:26.410]
Go ahead.

[01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:27.090]
Fire me.

[01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.150]

[01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:29.090]
Take control.

[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:30.530]
I've been trying out.

[01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:32.550]
WDQYM, hello.

[01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:36.550]
Yes, my question is, why would you send George to...

[01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:39.750]
I didn't send anybody anywhere, okay, sir.

[01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:40.890]
I wouldn't know if Donald...

[01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:41.490]
It's okay, I'm gonna...

[01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:41.670]
Yeah.

[01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:44.410]
No, that wasn't, Mr. G.

[01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.990]
It was...

[01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.510]
It was?

[01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:45.910]
Yeah.

[01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:46.530]
No.

[01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:47.070]
Trust me.

[01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:49.610]
WDQYM, hello.

[01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.650]
I think you're up there.

[01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:54.590]
And QYM, hello.

[01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:56.350]
Oh, no, I'm a kid.

[01:01:59.330 --> 01:01:59.690]
Wow!

[01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:01.670]
They're kind of muffles today, too.

[01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:03.850]
Maybe they were in mufflers because it's so damn cold.

[01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.550]
That could be...

[01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:04.950]
That's it?

[01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:06.710]
They're really kind of...

[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:07.890]
Oh, like that.

[01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:11.110]
What are you thinking on the Polter?

[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.650]
Chris, you got 778.

[01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:13.350]
That's not so great.

[01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:15.130]
You'll be over 800 by the new hour.

[01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:16.870]
That's generally the...

[01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.970]
Yeah.

[01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.390]
That's what we need to get to your thousand.

[01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:20.910]
We'll hit a grant.

[01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:27.690]
So it's the big Iowa caucus and you notice all the heavy political conversation going on here on QM.

[01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:28.590]
Because what does it have to do?

[01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.750]
And how come we're not carrying the scan camera camera press conference getting fired?

[01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.470]
We'll have to.

[01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:34.910]
I think Clarence is slipping.

[01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:39.230]
If you ask me, all the engineers are out of the Gulf Stream.

[01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:40.010]
What?

[01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:41.870]
All the engineers are out of the Gulf Stream.

[01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:43.190]
Yeah, all of them.

[01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:44.250]
There was even if we wanted to.

[01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:44.750]
We couldn't.

[01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:46.730]
I just went over to a sports center there on TSN.

[01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:47.470]
They don't have it.

[01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:53.130]
See, I guess most places don't want to carry press conference with something that everybody already knows what the outcome is.

[01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.830]
Because everybody knows that scan camera and all the coaches except who got canned this morning.

[01:02:57.310 --> 01:02:58.070]
They got canned.

[01:02:58.210 --> 01:02:59.970]
They weren't told that they're free to go out of the...

[01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:01.550]
They got fired is what they got.

[01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:02.990]
Don't we do that to Sonsan?

[01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:03.930]
Don't we do that all the time anyway?

[01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:04.790]
Carry press conference?

[01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:06.610]
When we know what they're going to say or they want to say it?

[01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:06.650]

[01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:07.350]
That's my point.

[01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:08.010]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.650]
What's the point?

[01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:10.750]
It kills time and...

[01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:11.190]
Yeah, there we go.

[01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:12.510]
You can go downstairs, get your box.

[01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:13.510]
That would be right.

[01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.010]
I could put some on the... on the stove.

[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:16.870]
QYM, hello.

[01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:19.550]
Like a juke steroid baseball going...

[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.190]
WQYM, hello.

[01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.570]
I hate pyronelons.

[01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:25.350]
WQYM, hello.

[01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:26.250]
Hale.

[01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:27.110]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.230]
What's just about you leaving the radio station?

[01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:33.230]
What does that mean?

[01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:34.230]
What does that question mean?

[01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:37.530]
What station should I listen to when you're going?

[01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:38.390]
I'll let you know, sir.

[01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:40.050]
If I have a deal somewhere, I'll let you know.

[01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:40.550]

[01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.950]
It's unclear.

[01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.490]
What's this about you leaving?

[01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:46.230]
What's this?

[01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:49.110]
What's this?

[01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.310]
What's this?

[01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:49.970]
I'm going to get a beer.

[01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.630]
What's this?

[01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:53.250]
God.

[01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:55.990]
I'm going to tell you something.

[01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:57.330]
Seriously, if you had any...

[01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:58.610]
Well, I think you do have some idea.

[01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.290]
How thrilled I am to be here and not to be there.

[01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:04.010]
It could be 100 below zero right now.

[01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.650]
I would still be...

[01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:05.770]
I have an ecstasy.

[01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:07.310]
Every impact I'm on here.

[01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.990]
Oh my goodness.

[01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:10.390]
WQYM, hello.

[01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:14.030]
WQYM, hello.

[01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:15.930]
Hey, Neil, I'm Mexican.

[01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:16.790]
I need some money.

[01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:17.330]
Get it?

[01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:18.170]
No, okay.

[01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:19.690]
How unusual.

[01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.950]
Standard light.

[01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:21.570]
Yeah.

[01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:23.650]
Too late, pal.

[01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.250]
Somebody beat you to it already.

[01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:26.190]
All of Mexico.

[01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.870]
Yeah.

[01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:30.710]
Handbrake Rich Lepper.

[01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:31.530]
That's what they eat.

[01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.450]
Really?

[01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:34.870]
25 past 11 and 5.

[01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:35.130]
60.

[01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:37.490]
Don't forget the second edition of the Jason Jerk Show today

[01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.350]
to a flank ought to be a big improvement over yesterday

[01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:40.210]
when the board off.

[01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.490]
Yeah.

[01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:41.370]
Either way at the beginning.

[01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:42.150]
That's the best part.

[01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:43.990]
Just to see if they...

[01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.770]
You think they get on the earth?

[01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:45.130]
They can get on the earth.

[01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:47.590]
Or we're good ones to talk the way things have been going here lately.

[01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.330]
This is true.

[01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:49.950]
What was that deal on Monday?

[01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:50.750]
That was very exciting.

[01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:51.230]
That wasn't...

[01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:52.410]
That was the...

[01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:53.230]
We can pochkage.

[01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.810]
Yeah.

[01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.930]
We can lunatic.

[01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:56.250]
So we can little children.

[01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:56.690]
Sure.

[01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:59.350]
We can play games in a radio station like it was in a record.

[01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:00.950]
By the way, we did trace it down.

[01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:04.890]
And the buttons being pushed that had no business being pushed as the cause of that was.

[01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:07.730]
That's why nobody saw it right away because people were just...

[01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:08.150]
How unusual.

[01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:09.590]
The buttons that ran them.

[01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:10.250]
How unusual.

[01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:11.110]
Right or not.

[01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.970]
Not.

[01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:14.670]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:15.670]
The Joe Bell era man.

[01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.110]
It's not as quite as good as the...

[01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:19.670]
Not as perfect as the Scam Scam era almost was.

[01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.530]
But pretty damn close.

[01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:23.690]
And don't forget to waste from today the book comes out.

[01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:24.550]
Oh baby.

[01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:28.810]
What about my hearing there?

[01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:30.130]
Door opening and closing.

[01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:31.010]
Oh.

[01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.030]
Is it just things sound bad?

[01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:33.990]
I don't hear any people though.

[01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:34.990]
Did you hear typing?

[01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.950]
No.

[01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.330]
Okay.

[01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:37.990]
I don't hear any like other than you.

[01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:38.970]
I hear no people in there.

[01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:40.010]
I hear no people.

[01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:41.250]
What are they doing?

[01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:42.390]
Milling about.

[01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:43.230]
Oh.

[01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.130]

Six thousand dollars, you ferry.

[01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:22.390]
Uncontrollable, oily discharge.

[01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:25.630]
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

[01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:29.450]
My hardest part is to manage the office and connect a rack to the wall on terror.

[01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:30.030]
Haha!

[01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:32.310]

[01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:59.530]
This is where a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier.

[01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.230]
Just so long as I'm a dictator.

[01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:21.630]
