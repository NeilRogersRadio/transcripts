possible to conceal I'm spotted a Woody you fairy I feel like an absolute out of

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.200]

[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:15.060]
so it goes to the west he was part one too follow him up to the gates of

[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:25.260]

[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.020]
jungle room we're spotted what is a man's best oh it's really impossible to conceal

[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:44.740]
I'm spotted what is a man's best I feel like an absolute without a wheel I'm spotted what is a man's best

[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:56.240]

[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.020]
well George is pretty pissed off about today's poll Sean he's really upset

[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.300]
ah well the whole city ever gets about the poll because he doesn't cure it's just I don't

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.640]
think it's very fair although since when did we ever say that life was fair how it is

[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.640]
that's started no it isn't look at where we are I know I don't know where we used to be and look

[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.820]
where we are now anyway serious is now to 17 cents a share and speaking of that the fake Greg

[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.360]
Budell is back this morning at least somebody's back boy it is slim and grim on those emails wow

[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.080]
well it's the holidays you know and it's this but it's a bit bit of a bit about people are

[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.180]
putting up the Hanukkah Bush and the Christmas tree and all this other crap and they're

[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.080]
shopping till they're dropping et cetera I don't believe it I think what we ought to do is put up

[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.300]
an out of business sign on the door the one thing that keeps us going is that as much as they're

[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.320]
trying to drag us down and believe me they've done a fabulous job of that at least we still are

[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.180]
above all the other day parts on the station every trend every book yeah for now I can't wait

[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.520]
till we get down to a point oh that'll be something and won't be with jolly joe bellotale

[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.440]
it's possible we know we we never will this show never will as long as we have this format on this

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.220]
station we'll never what we'll never be the last show we'll never be anything at the top show

[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.860]
are you knocking the format again yeah playing pit music on the air we'll get a better number

[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.700]

[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.880]

[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.160]
up I'm losing my voice do you hear it I'm so emotional about what's going on with us

[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.600]
not not good not sounded good I think I need to rest for a few weeks so the fake Greg

[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.920]
Budelle says subject going bust he's talking about serious so this is sunny fox maybe we don't

[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.740]
know who this is nor quite frankly do I care it's one of those losers who's you know who's salted

[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.180]
away his future wasn't bad enough that saw foods ripped him off for 600 grand but now

[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.580]
something has put his future in the hands of people that are going out of business soon like

[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.620]
probably this year this coming year the fake Greg Budelle says you've got many fans here meaning

[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.980]
it's serious but the problem is you're completely understandable interest in making money we are

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:33.500]
fresh out we are fresh out you want money we don't got none son if QA is paying you a million

[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.000]
year with bonuses for five years then you got a good deal where do you get that number

[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.540]
always dreaming you've got community continuity and security as well we would not be able to

[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.160]
offer that and that's it that's all he says we would not be able to offer that as if

[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.320]
isn't this amazing this is all because puppet love sponge on the first of next month is going

[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.160]
back to terrestrial radio and therefore these goofballs whoever the hell they are have been plotting

[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.060]
and planning oh it's going to be filled well it's not going to be filled because you just signed

[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.460]

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.380]
disturbing but you know what you got the right idea and I'm going to do the same thing yeah

[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.840]
I had nothing to do with Johnny Rockets which is great no no I understand that it had to do with

[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:48.940]
early 90s he punctuated his reports by ringing a cowbell like he was a GD 18 century town cryer

[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.640]
now that I think about it he was the equivalent of Chris Matthew just a lot of noxious jackass

There is some confusion on the pillow talks of music

[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.760]
They weren't famous, this would be absurd

[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.560]
She's into a soul

[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.560]
She can't win a match

[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.360]
And he can't bet bad

[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.600]

Must be a local game, eh?

[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.140]
Because Clarence is in the building

[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.160]

[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.040]

[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.700]
We have a bank line in the bank united center

[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.400]
I believe it's at the UM place

[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.640]
Do you have any idea what you're talking about or not?

[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.660]
Now you're starting to get like me

[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.260]
No, it's

[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.820]
Because one place is the bank and land

[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.220]
I have an excuse I'm going to go for it

[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.420]
Hurricane Wrap Up after the game

[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.720]
And then DA from 9.30 to midnight

[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.540]
DA who sent us that hostile email earlier

[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.580]
I'll tell you the real ones are from the real Johnny Dark

[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.660]
You don't believe that you think that all the emails are fake

[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.980]
Those are the real ones

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.620]
A bitter old man filled with hate

[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.000]
I don't doubt that he is

[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:36.860]
What?

[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.420]
A bitter old man filled with hate

[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.940]
I just doubt that those are the real emails

[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.660]
No, they are

[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.780]
I'm smelling your man

[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.220]
They are the real Johnny Dork

[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.680]
You better get with it

[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.360]
Brandon says I know it's too late

[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.980]
But somebody you missed I heard you were before was Kelly Mitchell

[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.980]
Well guess what Brandon that poll was yesterday

[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.700]
We left a lot of people off there that we could have put on there

[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.560]
But that poll was yes, Turd day

[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:00.340]
So let's move onward and upward

[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.020]
Brandon's generally pretty good with this crap but you know

[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.860]
It's a little ponderous and I got somebody

[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.660]
Do I have the picture to come out?

[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.360]
Yeah billboard who sent me this?

[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:12.600]
Eddie thanks Ed

[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.620]
It's an ancient billboard from about the year 20 BC

[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.660]
They even had promotion and were smart enough not to show Molly Turner

[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.680]
It says is Ed and four lot of ale good point

[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.500]
Member Molly Turner?

[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:23.960]
Nope

[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.680]
Oh come on

[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.600]
Get out of here

[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.380]
See you

[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.300]
She was a nice person though I met her once I think Molly Turner

[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.360]
She was nice to me right and she's a nice person

[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.780]
I tell you it was not nice what Sally fits

[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:35.760]
God

[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.200]
Right what a bitch

[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.720]
Yes

[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.640]
Well humorless bitch too

[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.840]
If you're not going to have a sense of humor

[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.800]
Don't be sticking a whole bunch of stuff in your

[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.980]
Recko and then having the whole world find out about it

[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.540]
Yeah keep it a secret boy

[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.360]
That's right

[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.680]
And then people won't laugh at you Sally

[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.420]
Anyway so the billboard is the team to trust

[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.640]
The team to turn to our kids chopped off

[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.400]
News watch 10 6 and 11 p.m.

[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.620]
And there's man bishop looking really really

[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.920]
Butch in the upper left hand corner and the upper right is little Glenn rinker

[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.860]
And the bottom left is Chuck Gowdall

[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.780]
And then the bottom right is Walter Kronis

[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.640]
With the thick coke bottle glasses and the bow tie

[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.100]
The big bow tie

[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.680]
And he's still live Walter Kronis

[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.980]
Can we find out how old he is?

[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.180]
He's got to be at least 200

[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.100]
Or Google

[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:30.340]
How Glenn rinker I believe is dead isn't he?

[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.380]
I believe so yeah

[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.160]
He was real stinker that little Glenn rinker

[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:35.860]
He was alright

[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.800]
Man bishop is dead

[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.020]
Chuck Dowdall I'm sure must be still alive

[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.120]
He was a young guy back then

[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.380]
Allo who knows you know

[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:43.480]
Yahoo's

[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.860]
Oh did you know that NFL players

[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.760]
I'm asking Chris because you don't care

[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.500]
Right their average life expectancy is 20 years less than like other non players

[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.280]
I know it was a lot and you know what the exact one is

[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:55.880]
20 years less

[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.160]
So that means if the average life expectancy for a guy is like 72 or something like that

[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:04.260]
The average life expectancy for a male NFL player is 52

[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.140]
But of course that includes all those big tubby linemen you know

[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.240]
All those big fat turds who masquerade his athletes in their gender

[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.900]
Just big fat slabs you know

[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.840]
Nothing worse than a big 320 pound lineman

[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.600]
And that's an athlete give me a break big tub of crap

[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.680]
Am I right Chris or what?

[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:24.940]
Yep

[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:27.740]
So did you look up all the chroni-

[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:34.260]
Yeah I can't find a CRO and I see well if you can't find anything I at least found some stuff on the

[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.700]
Yandex they want WPLG and everything like that nothing like an end date for him

[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.540]
Well that's because he's still alive that's what Brandon said

[00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:44.280]
This is Sarah somebody said one not necessarily

[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.760]
That's you know let's find out inquiry minds want to know if

[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.920]
Water Cronice is still alive and he says still wearing those stupid bow ties

[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.760]
I'm telling you I think he morphed into um

[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.040]
Footy and then he got candid I would be

[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.980]
What's Dave Lamont do in these days is he on here anywhere?

[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:06.260]
I know he got candy he got shoveled out there too got screwed over by Ken Charles

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:09.220]
Nice going there normal trying to get me hired by cheap channel and Ken Charles

[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:16.400]
Want another assassin another liar and phony BS artist oh near Rogers is the gold standard of talk radio

[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.500]
And we just have to have him over here don't sign anything yet there over there because is it too late is it too late?

[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.020]

And they put on a bunch of crap and then Jimmy syphilis in the morning

[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.240]
Wow

[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.940]
Oh Johnny Dorcas back again the truth is I've always admired and respected your talent

[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.600]
You turned on me based on an impostor's email

[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:42.460]
You are the racist who used to talk about the schwarzes and hurricanes before it became unpopular

[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:49.060]
Why don't you say something nice to someone for a change why not call out someone like Ron St. John

[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.880]
Who is a great talent has been on the air Miami for years

[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:58.900]
He gets no credit except for way to the PA the dolphin games God bless him I dare you to say something nice

[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:04.720]
Well, I don't know Ron St. John he did a hell of a lot better job at the PA at the dolphin games than what's his name

[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.800]
Then a jerk from our morning show Kenny Walker

[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.540]
And a hell of a lot better job than that goofball from the you win from the Huracun's what's his name?

[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.840]
The pickle guy J. Roqueach J fat J Roqueach God hurricane basket by oh my god he is just

[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:29.080]
Get a life already J for a crime of letting the gun a gun a pin of the box and that's going to be his resume his whole life

[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.600]
He was the voice of the hurricanes on the PA

[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.840]
Overgrown child maybe he can look with Rosie Rosenthal

[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.320]
Hey Rosie

[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:44.520]
The truth is I've always admired see and you're saying this isn't a real Johnny dork who really and truth is a big fan of mine

[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:45.760]
Yeah

[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:49.280]
He is he's just getting out of the

[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.160]
Here's a pull from Brandon boy. He's busy today

[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:59.160]
What is something you regret doing having sex before marriage having sex with a relative having sex with a minor having unprotected sex

[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.920]

He's just zero, you know, he like they thought he was gonna be the next big thing because of the whole PTI

And he's fine on PTI when he has a script and he knows what to do. He's fine

[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:33.620]
But it is nothing and he's not funny. I've always told you there's nothing worse nothing worse than a guy trying to be funny

[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:35.900]
He was not and that's a true Tony Cornhole

[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:30.980]
I said no, he's a good guy and he cares about this show is the only one him and muffed muff used to care about us

[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.760]
But you notice he's a a wall lately

[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.560]
Now that we got no restrum deals anymore

[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:38.300]

I'll bet you do

[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.600]
That was quite a story and George is telling me this long

[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:11.120]
Oh, yeah, wait to it this morning and what he doesn't know but I'll tell him right now on ears that I missed half of the story because I was out in the other room

[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.660]
Get that's a bottle of soda. You didn't know it's much getting organized for the show and stuff that I do every morning

[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:19.640]
I thought now would be a good time to sure get all that stuff done because when I come back to her just still gonna be

[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:26.660]
He was oh, yeah, the words still going on with the story. I don't know. I don't think I missed much. He didn't I

[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:30.780]
Missed I missed a little bit of the part where you said that your wife's friends were a holes, but other than that yeah

I don't know when you get to be this old all the days blended to each other just happy get up in the morning and

[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.500]
Crawl out of bed like Wayne Arnold said he's happy at the age of 70 you can put one foot in front of the other one

[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:03.720]
He'll be open soon Wayne Arnold and then then they will fear us when they get those neatly burgers going

[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:09.260]
But before he opens we're gonna have to stick with Johnny F and rockets right I

[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:15.040]
Think you should tell that whole story again on the year will kill least another hour. I told it like twice going take a nap. Yeah

[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.380]
I can go buy some bacon. I don't have any damn bacon

[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:25.940]
Steve and Richmond Virginia says oh, it's so good to hear from people out of town. I feel so much better about life

[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:33.140]
I first started listening to you in 1989 when I moved to South Florida from Virginia and I must say between you and Rickon

[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.960]
Sods I was a daily listener with interest

[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.240]
Like you I deeply appreciate the meeting with radio and growing up in Richmond

[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.860]
I used to tune to anything I could pick up at night usually New York City stations of course now

[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.600]
I'm able to get a lot of stations with my grondig radio at night and at least a few nights a week

[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.120]
I listen to that target of your affection joy Reynolds Pinto which I get from

[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.240]
Flame Thore in Buffalo

[01:01:53.960 --> 01:02:00.180]
A flame throw in about what does that mean a flame throw? I don't know is he on WKBW? Oh God forbid

[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.860]
Although you and he have quite different styles

[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.340]
I find him somewhat interesting even though I tend not to have much interest in celebrity is him chat

[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:14.100]
But word you to our similar is the keen ability to present coherent thoughts over long periods of time and maintain decent enough numbers to stay on the air

[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:18.460]
I believe this takes perhaps a natural talent that is special. There's no question that Joey is special

[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:19.900]
Steve

[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:26.140]
But where you really interest me is the many topics you talk about that you present politically you and I are miles apart

[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.340]
And I sense that even though you're smart enough to know what really goes on in the world you presented on the you're differently

[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:38.260]
Sometimes in order to maintain your image. Oh, what does that mean that means you are he smart you're not you're only pretending to be a liberal

[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:43.180]
Because everybody knows that liberals are stupid and this guy writing is smart this evidence by your justified criticism

[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:47.320]
Of swallowing other Democrats, but come on to Republicans honestly deserve you are sometimes out of line

[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.880]
Iyer thanks very much for the gas prices are stock plunges mr. President Bush has nowhere very little control over these things

[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:59.000]
And you know that no I do not know that I do know that the Saudis and the Bush family are as tight as a snare drum is what I know Steve

[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:03.780]
Bandar Bush I'm not the one who invented that phrase by the way they did

[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.220]
No matter I remain into and by the way

[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:13.380]
It must I must be way out of touch because 99 and 9 10% of the rest of the world also agree with me about Bush

[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.320]
Right you continue you and Joe Bell continue to lick Bush's ass

[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.600]
No matter our main devoted listener what it was knowledge you're very effective use of humor and as a thought process and

I didn't get on the air

[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.340]

The sports

[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.380]
Did he chuck it or did he cock it?

[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.220]
Oh

[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:46.220]

[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:46.220]

[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.480]
Think

[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:55.200]
Although my own face are blue and red is for full face. I don't know why they hate me

[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.740]
Oh, why they always read me it must be because I got people with red is for full face

[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:05.600]
My mom on my arm like a random alley map a locker one. I got things on my nose

[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.900]
Nobody knows that under my clothes. I wear fancy hoes, but that don't mean that I'm gay

[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:15.420]
If you think my arms are bad you ought to see my legs. I might as well keep on smoothing shave to show a little clas the next time

[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:20.540]
I'm raping it. I can go to a surgeon, but that gives me the shivers. I would not want to walk on looking like John Rivers

[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:27.260]
Where am I? I buy it the least the fat little freak. I did him a favorite now. We can't afford the heat

[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:32.860]
The reason I dismissed that speaking fat bastard is because he wouldn't shut up and he can't play conaster

[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.660]
Hey, somebody talk over there nobody talks when I rap I rap then you talk

[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:43.920]
Look at me. I'm hit I ain't no square. I'm a ding dong daddy man. I'm really dead

[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.520]
I buy a ready what I want I don't care

[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.520]
Especially if they make me flip my wig made a smelly green hair

[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:56.480]
I got fired myself and even happens to the greets Westwood once said you'll get out of here or else we break your legs

[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:02.740]
So now I sit by the pool life since good as it gets it with my paladin cocktail placing bets on the jets

[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.720]
Empowered ice paradise. I don't kiss nobody's hair sin power in dice

[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.480]
I'll be shoving up the screwkins when I get the chance that the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants

[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.400]

[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.760]
Healthy calling for play. It was just a little thought. So what I left this thing

[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.420]
I think that's funny. Why not?

[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.400]
I was buddy. I can do what I want because the management loves me

[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.660]

I know he stick is to be angry, but this is just too much. Why does he need to blast everyone?

[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.280]
Maybe it's me, but he's gotten too negative lately. I've listened for 10 years

[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.140]
But this is it good bye to the Roger show good bye Madeline

Well, I mean Johnny dorks case just being an a hole. I mean that should be proof enough and yet you're still

[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.900]
skeptical okay, you want to hear the life of pros acron if you must from Barry and then at the end sincerely

[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:03.580]
I'm your friend. I'm your friend. So Barry's obviously a knitwood

[01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.580]
The life of pros acron

[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.040]
pros acron is two brothers and one sister

[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.780]
Ron's parents had troubles with him and placed him in a program on state hospital grounds

[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:16.860]
He was there from the ages of 13 to 17. He was labeled as a manic depressive

[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:23.320]
After his stay there, he was placed in regular school one day another student came out of the classroom and punched Ron in the nose

[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.160]
His nose was broken into places

[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.580]
Maybe that's why he talks like that

[01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:33.340]
Ron was placed in special ed classes and teased most of the time in school after school

[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.880]
He did odd jobs at restaurants pros acron was seeing a girlfriend and she accused him of child abuse

[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.940]
pros acron denied the accusations and fought for his rights and won fought FAUGHT

[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:49.720]
The child was the mother and former boyfriend all had the same the child the mother and the former boyfriend all had the same disease

[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.460]
pros acron was tested and released

[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.680]
He later went to settle out of court and several social workers were fired

[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.320]
The girlfriend was protecting the boyfriend for the crime he did

[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.820]
They tried to blame pros acron and Ron went to a lawyer one is case after he was tested and released

[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:09.080]
The former boyfriend went to jail for his bad crime on a child the girlfriend was blaming pros acron because he had a disability

[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.140]
After Ron settled his parents got him a home where he's very happy

[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.440]
Aren't you happy?

[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:14.840]
Not yet

[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:20.800]
pros acron has been with the same girlfriend for eight years and this Thanksgiving he fed eight people who had no families

[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:26.820]
pros acron cooked a delicious turkey and all the trimmings everyone was delighted so he could he could cook so well

[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.260]
He should go to cooking school

[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:33.160]
pros acron was adopted and seven years found his birth mother issue sends him any DVD he wants

[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:38.320]
She recently sent him a 42 inch plasma TV and an HP touch smart computer

[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.420]
pros acron's hobbies are he's a major star track fan and as every figure you can think of and as a talk radio shan of all

[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:48.620]
Fan of all shows his favorite is the nea Roger show because you all give him a voice

[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.280]
Sometimes people want to put him in a vacuum cleaner bag and turn it on

[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.400]
He still says Neil makes him laugh and pros acron is never mean when he calls in a Neil show

[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.200]
He laughs every time you say I'm your friend and kindly goes back to his room with all the start to figures and DVDs

[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:07.380]
So I hope you enjoyed the life of pros acron for he's a big kind-hearted guy would give the shirt off his backs and

[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.240]
Serly very I'm your friend

[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:16.000]
He's a bad person. He's a stalker. He deserves to be a resident or something like that. He's not funny

[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.960]
He's not amusing us. We've asked him nicely. I've had he needs to be put away several attempts on an off-theer to have civil conversations with him about getting him to stop

[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.440]
I said he's not amusing us at all

[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:34.660]
And if he died I'll throw a party the likes of which has never been seen on earth

[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.140]
Know what a nice place. Oh

[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.660]

They think he should go to Sirius and leave the money. Yeah, yeah

[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.640]
Let me go to Sirius and work for free till they go out of business then at least I won't lose anything when they show it down

[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.360]
Not a good idea. That's it sounds like a gay plot game plan

[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.940]
Now listen I threatened before to mention this and I forgot all about it and it's already Tuesday

[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.740]

Vile insulting things on too many occasions to count for the for Barry

[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.700]
Say it again Barry said that pro-zecron only says nice things when he calls

[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:36.340]
Absolutely untrue. He has called us every name in the book. He calls obnoxious. He's had to be dumped

[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:43.540]
On many occasions. He's a bad person. You said dumping. I'm gonna go do a joy. Yeah. Are you excellent? I did it turn now, you know by an hour ago

Oh wait a minute one last thing for Madeline. All right

[01:18:56.380 --> 01:19:01.680]
The reason I think you're more negative is that every day you talk about serious stock and how bad it's doing

[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.020]
And you seem to get really giddy when talking about it the radio industry is falling apart and you're taking joy in it

[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:12.480]
I thought Neil was smarter than this. No, I'm not taking any joy in it. It's just is it's a it's just happening

[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.540]
I'm not responsible for it. I'm not a party to it. It's just happening

[01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:19.740]
And all these people give me a song and a dance about oh you should go to serious

They have enough money to pay a hundred million year and mel carmes into millions a year

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.560]
How come they don't have enough money to go promote the damn thing somewhere else

Sticking their nose interfering with the show. Okay. I'm doing just fine. I just put another big fat check in the bank couple days ago, okay

Speaking of strangling people

[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.100]
Wouldn't you like to find out who some of these people are

[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.800]
Just strangle him with your bare hands

[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:46.480]

It's serious

[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.780]
Wouldn't you like the chance to do your show sense or free

[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:58.260]
And we heard crystal clear to almost 20 million people

[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:00.880]
You already had the ISD in hookup so it would be easy

[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.660]
Are you scared or just lazy

[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.680]
None of the above

[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.000]
I'm just you know again

[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.940]
When nobody has offered you any money to work for them

[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.540]
The idea that I'm going to work for them

[01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:10.880]
Part-time full-time

[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.860]
Half-time uh whatever it's just ludicrous

[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.540]
Speaking of him

[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.360]
All these people oh we love Neil Rogers

[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:24.340]

Oh serious serious serious like a disease

[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.380]
And you know what this is exactly what you'd expect from people like on the way down when they're

[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:41.520]
When they're floating underwater and they've got like 40 pound weights on each

[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:41.820]
Link

[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:45.980]

Good morning Mr. Rogers as I'm sure you're aware of the market is way up

[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.140]
Today never mind the drop of nearly 8 year 8% yesterday

[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.960]
Today is still a buying opportunity

[01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:06.760]

Oh US Senator Mel Martinez won't seek reelection

[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.320]
He struggled to boost his appropriations because of close ties to George Bush

[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.140]
And on today he will not seek a second term. Thank God. Yeah

[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:35.840]
Oh, and here we go is this from Barry again? Is this yeah, Barry I'm your friend

We've got Barry who wants to turn it into the Prozac Ron show and then we've got the Sirius crowd

[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:53.720]
Started with that fake red view del one and from there although at least that one was honest. We have no money

[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:01.140]
Yeah, I don't blame you for wanting to make money to get paid for your work and we were fresh out remember that were fresh out

[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:07.780]
They're fresh out. All right anybody that would put Alex Bennett on here that that should tell you all you need to know

You want to hear the follow-up from Barry I'm your friend. Oh, yeah, sure

George seems to be upset at Prozac Ron. It was always jambah who was me not Prozac Ron

Prozac Ron is so scared he keeps a night light on

[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.140]
He's afraid a Republican might be under his bed

[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:52.080]
He said that he even gave George a Star Trek doll to make peace with him. Do you do that? Yeah, but he didn't make peace

[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:55.420]
Stop action figure. Look cutus

[01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:01.660]
That's our plea today. I mean it's the second of December. Okay. It's almost time to the year

Leave us alone. We don't want none to do with you serious or Prozac Ron

[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.940]
I know George doesn't hate Prozac Ron. He's got a heart too

[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:24.320]
George don't be upset with Prozac Ron. He likes you

[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:29.460]
Chamba and you need to be in a ring so you can fight each other like all I would love to have this agreement

[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:34.580]
Please don't hate Prozac Ron. He has issues. I'm your friend. It doesn't matter. He's got issues. All right

[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:39.080]
We don't want to be a we don't want to be the target of his issues. Okay, put him away in a room with him somewhere

[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:44.460]
Put him in there with Chamba. Hey Ron. Hi Ron. If he stops calling

[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:52.360]
It's a world having a fair with his show and jolly joebell sits on his big fat pimpley ass spewing out bloody wild uncontrollable diarrhea

[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.440]
Oh my god, and this is what we're stuck with

[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:01.880]
Very jackass is back again. I hope. Hopefully this one has nothing to do. Yeah

[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:19.480]
I mean these idiots over there are like interfering with my life and I don't like it. I don't like it

[01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:21.860]
I could like it, but I don't want to

[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:29.500]
Look at that Spanish soap's winning hands down your pants 68 best flesh Baywatch 41

[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:34.020]
Always had a little kid with a short kid with a black hair on Baywatch

[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:40.700]
Peter Laurie. No, you come on. I don't know. I think Prozac Ron's got a point. That's your bag dad

[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.980]
What I've never watched the single episode. What do you mean I do?

[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.780]
There's some hot chicks on Baywatch. Pam Skank was on Baywatch. Oh, that's guaranteed it

[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:53.540]
I would never watch past the opening credits. Well anyway, he was real cute

[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.580]
Barry jackass who's really grotesque

[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.920]
The fake buries says Scarborough negotiating we turned to radio. Oh, no

[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.720]
We're a scared david charvay

[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:08.700]
David charvay. No, he was the French way. He was he was okay, but he's not the one I'm thinking of

[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:11.440]
David charvay looks really gay, you know

[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.040]
Are you finding somebody else? I'm trying to look Jason Brooks. No

[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:19.580]
Jason Simmons. No

[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:22.580]
Jason Gedrick. No

[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.880]
Chris Fiori. No, I don't know

[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:31.420]
Joe Scarborough tells TV newser that he and his MSNBC morning Joe coast

[01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:36.260]
Mecha Burjinsky are indeed his rumors have posited moving closer to launching a radio talk show

[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.840]
But he responded in New York radio message board discussions of his joining citadel talk

[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.560]
W A B C by saying we've talked to citadel on several other networks. Oh god

[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.520]
You're right. This business is gone not just into the toilet, but all the way down to the bottom. Where wherever it goes

[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.440]
Wherever it goes, that's where this business is gone. You know, once you flush

[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:01.600]
Yeah, once it's gone. That's that's right. Once it's gone. It's just gone Scarborough added that if we had our

[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:05.840]
brothers we'd sign with citadel only because they launched Russia and Bosch on Hannity all the most

[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:10.140]
successful talk shows in the country is I explained to Mecha there are two types of radio shows

[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:13.860]
Those that have clearance on W A B C and those that don't have clearance on W A B C

[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:16.560]
It's just a radio station like New York Times is just a newspaper

[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:18.700]
But whatever that means

[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:23.040]
If we're going to get into radio we wanted to be by the beginning of the year

[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.920]
He said he would know about a deal in the next couple of weeks to show more most likely air from 10 a.m. to noon

[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.640]
10 a.m. to noon. Oh my god

[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.620]
Joe Scarborough is going to be on up against this. Can you imagine

[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:36.720]
It's not bad enough. We got to deal with Russian with the man cow who did a point

[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:38.760]
and with Bill O'Reilly point oh

[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:46.220]

[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.060]

[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:55.020]

[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:56.420]
idiot?

[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.420]
He was like one of the main characters on there like in the later years

[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:07.020]
I don't know after they got rid of that fruitcake that French David Charvets

[01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:13.560]

Don't you get depressed when there's a big low

[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.880]
No, take some calls though. Oh, yeah. Hey

[01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:37.980]
He's not going to call yes. He will he's too embarrassed and humiliated for being such a real simple when we don't hear from him again

[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:42.060]
That's when I don't hate him. It's just that he with a butterfly not to drag his ass away

[01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:46.820]
We can only pray in hope and also his friend bear it and then boil him in oil. I'm your friend. I'm your friend

Get out of here. No, I'm serious

[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:10.040]

There's no way he lives right next door to me. The what a man. Yeah, I say in every I feel most everything my kids love him

[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:17.980]

Supervisors are yard work and you know, he's great with all the kids in the neighborhood

[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.600]

[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:27.060]
No, he doesn't but he still has them all

[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:29.720]
Yeah, he liked to show them off the people

[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:34.820]
Well, yeah, but he does okay. Give him a big kiss for us. Yeah, just let him know that he's a lot of money

[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:39.640]
It's a good guy man. He's actually you're pretty interesting guy. Do you know he was in the movie the shining? No

[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:45.840]
He was the radio voice in the shining for the weather man. I hated that movie. Okay. Have a great day

I bet it's Billy Warlock Billy. Well, you got it now. How did you know that?

[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:57.600]
They didn't show his face there. So I clicked on them and I kind of looked him up online to see who he was and I remembered the face of the guy so

[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.960]
What do you what is that mean? You knew I would like him is that what you're trying to say? Yeah, exactly

[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:21.280]
So keeps them off the streets are on the street or whatever

[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:29.080]
This one is from Rob from Lauderdale remember him that I blocked yesterday with his racist grotesque email

[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:31.620]
Yes, who's a real chronic pain in the ass

[01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:39.180]
Because nobody else has got DCC RFM at aol.com except Rob from Lauderdale who's a jerk a jackass

[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.020]
Good morning. What that idiot didn't tell you and this and this one was deleted by the way

[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.320]
I just read it just to see what kind of spew to me he was spewing

[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.920]
What that idiot didn't tell you about gas go energy is that six months ago

[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:50.860]
trading at four dollars

[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:55.700]
55 cent and now it's trading at 55 cents so you lost your ass if he bought it a few months ago

[01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:00.900]
Great buying opportunity until the market crashes another six hundred and seventy five point no name on this one

[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:02.760]
Though as if I'm not going to recognize that email address

[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:08.320]
You're an idiot Rob you you're oh god you smell like subhuman smegma

[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:10.340]
You're nauseating

[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:14.020]
Now here's one that's more interesting from the fake Josh Cortes

[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:19.600]
And guess what it's about it's about an offer from the unmancionable ones

[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:20.440]

[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:04.340]

[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:13.620]
Oh, here's another one from another fake Tom jicca with another fake code word

[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:18.020]
You mentioned you had the displeasure of hearing Joseph Gackey and Don Bailey Jr. on Saturday

[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:19.860]
What did you think I think they sucked

[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:25.280]
Don makes Phil Sims like Kurt gaudy. Kurt. Er, Kurty gaudy. It says Kurty

[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.760]
You know, Kurty gaudy? No

[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:35.020]
He's suck and Don Bailey Jr. That's the first time I ever heard him in my in my entire life

[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:40.640]
He was bad. He like I said yesterday. He sounds like a dicky v wannabe

[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.820]
Oh, that was a wonderful play

[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:48.820]
You know over nothing or absolutely nothing and talk about an in-house shill my god

[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:53.580]
Rick says during the last commercial break you ran a commercial for the above of

[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.280]
Anyway

[01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:04.760]
Well, I'm not talking about commercials with a little like the QM management and sales holes will have run a fourth of July sale next week

[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:08.640]
I see we ran a the day after Thanksgiving sale spot

[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:13.780]
Well, Rick if that's your biggest problem. I wish I could share your life

[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.600]
So I continue that should be your biggest problem. We made a mistake

[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:20.000]
But you know what we always make a mistake

[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:24.240]
I make a mistake every weekday morning Monday through Friday at 8 30 in the morning

[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.720]
I sit my ass down in this chair and this morning I listen to George going out about

[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.880]
Johnny F and rockets for an hour and a half that's right

[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.680]
Papa it was good though because you never took a breath or give me a chance to like you know

[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:37.480]
Waddel out of here and go get my shoulder

[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.900]
I could have made my bacon if I had an it that's right you could have gone shop is up to 54. It's up to 54 wow

[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:52.880]
So that word by the way we'll never if you hear that sound it probably is, you know yeah, just as well

[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:53.720]
right

[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:00.300]
Nazzi nauseated from them. Where the hell did that start that sunny fox is he the one that started that crap with the fake baby

[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:01.580]
the fake brick Vidal yeah.

[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:08.360]
And then poor little bald and stupid Tommy Jikker got suckered in I think to some of

[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.440]
that remember he wrote that stuff and they started quoting because he listens he's probably

[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.800]
listening right now on his horse.

[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:17.940]
Just like fat jolly Joe is listening right now too.

[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:23.000]
He wouldn't be surprised if he's responsible for that boy they love they love to farm

[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.280]

the whole game by themselves they didn't need somebody to keep interrupting but back in

[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:20.360]
the day when we we didn't have people interrupting like every of two seconds interjecting a lot

[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:24.580]

Hi, is this a cut?

[01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:21.510]
On the A.C.O. Hanaka

[01:59:22.290 --> 01:59:25.810]
My parents gave to me

[01:59:26.650 --> 01:59:29.330]

So that's like, let's see, this coming Sunday is what?

[01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:56.330]
7th, two weeks from Sunday

[01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:58.630]
And sundown is Chanukha, Chanukha

[02:00:01.530 --> 02:00:02.070]
Now what are they?

[02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.410]
What are they?

[02:00:02.410 --> 02:00:03.330]
They spell it with an H

[02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:07.970]
I don't know, they give us this goyish of version, there's water done

[02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:10.070]
Why do they leave the sea of Hanaka?

[02:00:10.530 --> 02:00:12.670]
I don't know, it's not Hanaka, it's Hanaka!

[02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:14.170]
Chanukha

[02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:17.970]
Now what kind of stupid stuff do we have to do for Hanaka?

[02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:19.870]
Besides giving the exchanging gifts every day

[02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:20.830]
Spin the draidel

[02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:25.250]
What else, drink some wine?

[02:00:25.530 --> 02:00:26.190]
Always drinking wine

[02:00:26.890 --> 02:00:27.730]
Why not?

[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:29.210]
Fake Larry King asked

[02:00:29.210 --> 02:00:30.470]
Did you like the Dolphin game?

[02:00:30.650 --> 02:00:33.510]
Some day, boring game, but Gust Johnston and Don Bebe were great

[02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:36.110]
Didn't watch it fake Larry, I was on route, I was on a plane

[02:00:36.110 --> 02:00:38.690]
And wouldn't watch it anyway

[02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:42.590]
The Dolphins in St. Louis, I'm going to watch that, my god

[02:00:43.210 --> 02:00:45.010]
My eyes hurt just thinking about that

[02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:48.650]
Oh, Paul's suggestion from Greg

[02:00:49.110 --> 02:00:51.550]
Glad you had the email contact now, it's great

[02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:54.370]
Yeah, it is, if we get some different people on it, it will be fantastic

[02:00:54.370 --> 02:00:56.270]
Neil at Neuronters.com

[02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:59.950]
Just go to our webpage, NeilRotters.com

And on the right hand side there, under the mailbox

[02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:06.030]
There's a thing to click, email Neil, email George, email your ass

[02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:09.010]
So I've listened to you since the mid-80s

[02:01:09.010 --> 02:01:11.330]
And I love your show, how about this for a Paul's suggestion?

[02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:15.070]
The best or worst characters that have been mentioned or involved in your show

[02:01:15.070 --> 02:01:20.090]
The Bird, Noth's Landing Lady, Bridge Tender, Alex Bennett, Gilbert, Guy with the Eyes

[02:01:20.090 --> 02:01:24.790]
Mohawar David and Dada Dada, Rick Riley, Mike Disney, Tom Dennenberg,

[02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:27.750]
The Scouting Lady, Fat Rich, Jimmy Johnny, Dark, etc.

[02:01:28.210 --> 02:01:30.730]
The list could be huge, Diel

[02:01:32.170 --> 02:01:34.290]
It says it's the holiday, it's a good time for nostalgia

[02:01:35.730 --> 02:01:38.150]
Thanks for all the great entertainment throughout the years, says Greg

[02:01:38.150 --> 02:01:39.810]
Thank you, Greg, I like that, you like it?

[02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:41.430]
Yeah, sure, why not? You like it?

[02:01:42.610 --> 02:01:43.450]
You like it?

[02:01:43.730 --> 02:01:46.250]
Yeah, that's the obvious question, I think it's not bad

[02:01:46.610 --> 02:01:49.850]
Of course we'd have to, you know, add a lot to it

[02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:52.670]
But nevertheless

[02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:54.830]
Well that's it, I think I'm done with the emails

[02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:56.230]
Oh my god

[02:01:56.230 --> 02:02:00.390]
And Madeline, I told you she was a heartless cruel, nasty fake bitch

[02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:02.770]
Not even a real person, like you said

[02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:04.810]
And you know what? What difference does it make?

[02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:11.330]
It doesn't, it's all for the purpose of entertainment, all for the purpose of killing a little time, four hours a day, keep you off the streets

[02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:18.130]
Let's see, here's some old emails that I never got to, they'll be very timely, I'm sure

[02:02:18.730 --> 02:02:20.090]
It's like those best of tapes

[02:02:20.090 --> 02:02:21.110]
Oh, we love the tapes

[02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:24.990]
Alien in the Pope, those are our favorites

[02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:27.850]
Let's see, I'll put that in my pile from Greg

[02:02:27.850 --> 02:02:28.490]
Thanks Greg

[02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:35.230]
Tim says, a wonderful combination of portabello mushrooms and bacon cover with nice slice of Swiss cheese

[02:02:35.230 --> 02:02:39.310]
Would let us tomato in a touch of mayo, when these gourmet Swiss burger is a winner

[02:02:40.210 --> 02:02:43.430]
Says Tim, this is from a few days ago

[02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:45.850]
I'm sure it's still a winner though, even now

[02:02:45.850 --> 02:02:47.850]
You ever had that? No

[02:02:48.610 --> 02:02:50.590]
The one that's called the gourmet Swiss burger, what?

[02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:51.370]
Sounds good

[02:02:51.370 --> 02:02:55.510]
Sounds fantastic, portabello mushrooms and bacon with a nice slice of Swiss cheese

[02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:59.850]
Let us tomato in a touch of mayo, oh hold the mayo, that's for goyem

[02:03:01.530 --> 02:03:05.670]
Gregory says, I move from sunrise to Lareda, Florida

[02:03:05.670 --> 02:03:10.490]
I remember this guy from Lareda, four years ago, but old habits never die, I can still hate

[02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:13.650]
George usually is enough to keep the virus molding

[02:03:13.650 --> 02:03:17.830]
But reading about Julie, women waving his magic approval wand over Obama's cabinet

[02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:19.270]
Pigs really made me a joy of brick

[02:03:21.770 --> 02:03:25.770]
The Democrats are about to be indebted for attempted murder by kindness, they're not vilifying the

[02:03:25.770 --> 02:03:29.210]
Liberman for his horing from McCain, we'll come back to FM, says Greg

[02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:32.490]
Going to come back to FM, right in the electom? Yeah, like that

[02:03:34.330 --> 02:03:40.190]
Not by the way, that was not the real, I'm sure you know, the real pro-Zach-Ran before?

[02:03:40.610 --> 02:03:41.170]
Of course I know

[02:03:41.170 --> 02:03:48.410]
Okay, do you know that Chris? I'm your friend and I'm used cream, we use the S cream, man

[02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:51.890]
Although I do believe that last part though

[02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:52.770]
Uh-huh

[02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:55.550]
Oh no

[02:03:58.350 --> 02:04:01.710]
Well I'm reading some of these there, they're just not air-worthy

[02:04:01.710 --> 02:04:03.990]
Did you hear Tony Cicarello has gone, yes?

[02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:07.810]
I heard it 80 million times, I don't care

[02:04:09.070 --> 02:04:12.270]
If I were there, I wouldn't watch him, silly person reading the news

[02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:15.530]
It just, it's never made any sense in the beginning and it does make any sense now

[02:04:15.530 --> 02:04:17.010]
Hey Tony, rip it out

[02:04:17.010 --> 02:04:20.050]
And he's doing it, see he knows when to get out

[02:04:20.670 --> 02:04:22.850]
I'm like me, I'm gonna keep doing this until I croak

[02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:26.970]
And even if it's not on the station after the five year, if the deal doesn't work out after five years

[02:04:26.970 --> 02:04:30.670]
I'll find someplace, they'll stay on KAT or somewhere, I'll buy my way on the year

[02:04:31.410 --> 02:04:35.350]
And we can hire a muff to go out and sell the show, muff and your friend Bob Eisenberg

[02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:40.310]
Heck of a job by the way Eisenberg, sponsored this pouring in

[02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:43.130]
WQAM, hello

[02:04:43.130 --> 02:04:44.670]
Hello Neil

[02:04:44.670 --> 02:04:45.550]
Yes sir

[02:04:48.450 --> 02:04:49.570]
WQAM, hello

[02:04:51.090 --> 02:04:52.650]
QAM, hola

[02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.490]
Yes

[02:04:53.490 --> 02:04:57.770]
Hey where's the surprise yesterday with you and Ponte?

[02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:59.850]
Quarter slotch

[02:04:59.850 --> 02:05:01.170]
What's that?

[02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:03.450]
This is a quarter slot hole

[02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:05.810]
This is a good guy, Neil

[02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:07.210]
In the A hole

[02:05:07.210 --> 02:05:09.650]
I'll be so angry and bitter all the time

[02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:10.890]
I'm not A.V. or bitter

[02:05:11.650 --> 02:05:13.230]
I'm not either, I'm not good

[02:05:13.230 --> 02:05:13.770]
Goodbye

[02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:17.670]
What was the surprise with Ponte?

[02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:18.250]
I'm not in your business

[02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:24.130]
None of your freaking business, okay? My life is none of your business, none, not any of you, none

[02:05:25.570 --> 02:05:28.250]
Oh but you're on the radio, exactly, that's the point

[02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:31.670]
Here's one from Carlos from 8000 days ago

[02:05:32.150 --> 02:05:34.770]
Neil, where did you dig up the Gilbert guy? He's a freaking nerd

[02:05:35.290 --> 02:05:39.630]
Please never find this guy and put him on the radio, I guess he can use his laugh because it's funny

[02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:42.910]
But please don't put him on the radio, why would we put him on the radio?

[02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:45.510]
I don't know, he used to but that was 100 years ago

[02:05:45.850 --> 02:05:50.030]
I don't know why people complain about George as a fellow Cuban I can appreciate all the great things he says

[02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:54.830]
He's a lot smarter than all the morons who call but that's not saying much compared to all the colors of a QAM

[02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:55.330]
Got that right

[02:05:56.190 --> 02:05:59.110]
Thank you for not taking any calls, I hated all those people who would call up

[02:05:59.110 --> 02:06:03.050]
I'm your friend and all the other stupid asses that would have nothing to say

[02:06:03.050 --> 02:06:04.630]
It was a great waste of all our times

[02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:11.010]
In closing, Carlos says I hate Joe Bell, Joyce, everything on QAM except you show, and then Alphans

[02:06:11.010 --> 02:06:12.710]
And there are no fags in the church, not

[02:06:13.890 --> 02:06:18.130]
Q, nice Carlos, Carlos knows there's just tons of fags in the church

[02:06:18.130 --> 02:06:18.790]
You fairy

[02:06:20.290 --> 02:06:20.890]
WQYM, hello

[02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:24.070]
I'm your friend, I'm your friend, I'm no little bomb, I got a cold

[02:06:24.070 --> 02:06:27.430]
I don't know who's the most serious but I take a cold

[02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:29.070]
And I have a cold

[02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:32.990]
WQYM, hello

[02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:37.270]
Maybe he'll be dead by tomorrow, we can only hope

[02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.890]
QAM

[02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:40.170]
Hola

[02:06:40.170 --> 02:06:41.370]
Mr. Rogers

[02:06:41.370 --> 02:06:42.370]
Yes sir

[02:06:42.370 --> 02:06:47.570]
The poll that you're planning to do tomorrow, don't do it because I was a Dan La Bastard poll

[02:06:47.970 --> 02:06:50.210]
Don't do that one because he's going to rank on you if you do it

[02:06:50.210 --> 02:06:51.170]
What are you talking about?

[02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:55.810]
No, the one that what does the man have to know how to change your tie or how to cut his shoe?

[02:06:55.810 --> 02:06:58.070]
No, no, that's not the poll we're doing tomorrow

[02:06:58.070 --> 02:06:59.510]
Okay, well just don't do that

[02:06:59.510 --> 02:07:02.990]
The poll tomorrow is what past features of Neil Rogers show would you like resurrected?

[02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:06.090]
That's the poll for tomorrow and guess what we'll do, any poll we want to do

[02:07:06.090 --> 02:07:07.630]
I don't give a crap about Dan La Bastard

[02:07:09.070 --> 02:07:13.810]
Don't do this and don't do that and don't don't don't don't we're leaving and bye bye bye and that yeah

[02:07:13.810 --> 02:07:14.250]
Right

[02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:19.630]
They got the radio turned off so loud that the walls are shaking

[02:07:20.370 --> 02:07:22.950]
Remember in the clockwork orange when they hit him locked in the room?

[02:07:23.210 --> 02:07:23.410]
Yes

[02:07:23.410 --> 02:07:28.410]
And they had Ludwig Vaughn just blasting at the speaker

[02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:32.050]
The whole room was shaking with good vibrations from the loud music

[02:07:34.450 --> 02:07:37.050]
Don't do this, don't do that, no Dan La Bastard

[02:07:37.610 --> 02:07:41.210]
Give a big hiss to Dan La Bastard, okay, run in his fat, simply ass

[02:07:41.210 --> 02:07:45.830]
And remind him that it was the Cubans that won the World Series back in 87 or whatever it on year was

[02:07:46.710 --> 02:07:47.990]
97 what year was that?

[02:07:48.170 --> 02:07:48.550]
Leavon

[02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:50.550]
Yeah, 1997

[02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:52.810]
Well, talk about it, got it, got off the hook

[02:07:52.810 --> 02:07:53.490]
I love you Miami

[02:07:53.490 --> 02:07:54.310]
I love you Miami

[02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:55.270]
Huh? I love you Miami

[02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:58.770]
Yeah, I love you Miami, I love you Miami, not anymore though

[02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:02.710]
He's probably no longer playing right, he played for the Giants for a while

[02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:03.970]
Leavon

[02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:07.610]
Actually he was playing last year so he was playing with what?

[02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.830]
My Dan La Bastard

[02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:10.670]
I think the QAA is still in the low

[02:08:10.670 --> 02:08:12.750]
Yeah, Neil got a couple of things

[02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:15.890]
First, the city court brought out Washington, mutual, right?

[02:08:16.770 --> 02:08:18.070]
You're asking me? I don't know

[02:08:18.070 --> 02:08:18.610]
Well, they did

[02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:22.010]
And then the city court also got a few truckloads of money from the government

[02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:23.330]
They're out, no, what, Kovia?

[02:08:24.210 --> 02:08:25.150]
I don't know, but anyway

[02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:25.510]
Oh

[02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:30.610]
Wama who is now just let us know that they're going to let 9,200 people go

[02:08:30.610 --> 02:08:33.310]
So this bailouts working real good

[02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:38.490]
Now secondly, quite the gasoline has come way down to about $85

[02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:42.250]
But diesel fuel is still like almost $3 a gallon

[02:08:42.250 --> 02:08:46.550]
And diesel fuel is less to refine in gasoline

[02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:48.170]
It's lower on the refinery scale

[02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:50.690]
The word you're looking for is rape

[02:08:50.690 --> 02:08:51.430]
That's right

[02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:55.570]
It's just another way to keep the truckers making less money

[02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:58.310]
Or having to charge more and all that stuff to keep the price of time

[02:08:58.310 --> 02:09:02.510]
But now most importantly, the beast is terrible on the air

[02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:06.850]
He sounds like a drooling 12-year-old with a speech impediment

[02:09:06.850 --> 02:09:07.310]
Right

[02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:08.890]
And then he's ducked up nose

[02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:09.410]
Right

[02:09:09.410 --> 02:09:11.650]
I swear to God, it's horrible to hear him on that spot

[02:09:12.170 --> 02:09:13.590]
It's ridiculous, he has no business here

[02:09:13.590 --> 02:09:17.270]
Never again, that Thanksgiving show is the last time he's ever going to do this show

[02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:19.290]
Well, I don't care about that, I mean just even spot

[02:09:19.290 --> 02:09:21.530]
I don't want to hear his voice at all, he sounds horrible

[02:09:21.530 --> 02:09:22.270]
Okay

[02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.770]
Bye

[02:09:23.190 --> 02:09:23.570]
Thanks

[02:09:24.570 --> 02:09:28.090]
You're done beast, though, they hate you, they despise you

[02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:29.810]
They wish you'd explode

[02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:31.070]
That's right

[02:09:31.070 --> 02:09:34.270]
Like a big balloon at somebody stuck a pin in

[02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:36.870]
How about you fact Chris would stick a pin in his ass

[02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:39.150]
I don't want to be anywhere near that

[02:09:39.150 --> 02:09:40.070]
Or something

[02:09:40.890 --> 02:09:41.850]
The biggest name

[02:09:41.850 --> 02:09:42.890]
The best town

[02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:45.170]
You don't have no right to make any snowy

[02:09:45.170 --> 02:09:46.830]
The 5.60 Q.A.M.

[02:09:46.930 --> 02:09:48.410]
The fourth league

[02:09:49.090 --> 02:09:50.290]
The biggest name

[02:09:50.290 --> 02:09:51.770]
The best town

[02:09:52.710 --> 02:09:57.690]
You're listening to sports radio 5.60 W.Q.A.M.

[02:09:57.750 --> 02:10:00.130]
My Miami for Lauderdale

[02:10:00.130 --> 02:10:02.250]
It's the Lauderdale 2 hour

[02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.770]
All right

[02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:07.990]
All the white folks hate the black folks

[02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:10.450]
And the black folks hate the white folks

[02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:12.730]
To hate all but the right folks

[02:10:12.730 --> 02:10:15.370]
Is an old established rule but during

[02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:17.410]
National Brotherhood Week

[02:10:17.410 --> 02:10:19.890]
National Brotherhood Week

[02:10:19.890 --> 02:10:24.390]
Lena Horn and Sheriff Clark are dancing cheek to cheek

[02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:27.110]
It's fun to utilize but

[02:10:27.110 --> 02:10:31.950]
People you despise as long as you don't let them in your school

[02:10:35.290 --> 02:10:37.890]
All the poor folks hate the rich folks

[02:10:37.890 --> 02:10:40.210]
And the rich folks hate the poor folks

[02:10:40.210 --> 02:10:42.410]
All of my folks hate all of your folks

[02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:44.210]
It's American as Apple Pie

[02:10:44.210 --> 02:10:45.090]
But during

[02:10:45.090 --> 02:10:47.330]
National Brotherhood Week

[02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:49.690]
National Brotherhood Week

[02:10:49.690 --> 02:10:52.650]
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans

[02:10:52.650 --> 02:10:53.950]
Cause it's very chic

[02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:56.750]
Step up and shake the hand of

[02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:58.790]
Someone you can't stand

[02:10:58.790 --> 02:11:01.570]
You can tolerate him if you try

[02:11:04.810 --> 02:11:07.330]
All the Protestants hate the Catholics

[02:11:07.330 --> 02:11:09.270]
And the Catholics hate the Protestants

[02:11:09.810 --> 02:11:11.790]
And the Hindus hate the Muslims

[02:11:11.790 --> 02:11:14.590]
And everybody hates the Jews but during

[02:11:14.590 --> 02:11:16.790]
All the National Brotherhood Week

[02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:19.110]
National Brotherhood Week

[02:11:19.110 --> 02:11:21.670]
It's National Everyone Smile at

[02:11:21.670 --> 02:11:23.730]
One and Neverhood Week

[02:11:23.730 --> 02:11:26.270]
Be nice to people who are

[02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:28.110]
In theory or to you

[02:11:28.110 --> 02:11:31.310]
It's only for a week so have no fear

[02:11:32.610 --> 02:11:36.190]
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year

[02:11:37.770 --> 02:11:39.110]
Not enough for all of them

[02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:40.330]
No National Brotherhood Week

[02:11:40.330 --> 02:11:41.230]
Everybody hates

[02:11:41.230 --> 02:11:41.930]
They just hate

[02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:43.190]
Me, they hate George

[02:11:43.190 --> 02:11:44.590]
They hate each other, they hate themselves

[02:11:44.590 --> 02:11:45.890]
They sure hate fat Chris

[02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.390]
Hate

[02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:52.130]
May not be good or at least they're consistent

[02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:54.190]
Speaking of fat Chris, you're poor, you got 418

[02:11:54.190 --> 02:11:55.170]
All right

[02:11:55.710 --> 02:11:57.170]
You think you got a shot of 500?

[02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:58.330]
Yeah, no, no

[02:11:58.330 --> 02:11:59.550]
No, we already broke 400

[02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:00.830]
We got an hour, we can do it

[02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:01.550]
No

[02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:03.690]
If everybody chips in, we can do it

[02:12:03.690 --> 02:12:05.150]
If everybody what?

[02:12:05.590 --> 02:12:07.150]
Chips in, we can do it

[02:12:07.150 --> 02:12:08.830]
Back on an Erica Strata craft again

[02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:11.090]
419, look at that

[02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:12.550]
They're trickling by the ones

[02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.790]
420

[02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:18.310]
You need 80 votes in 58 minutes, you're not going to do it here

[02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:19.650]
We're going to do it

[02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:20.290]
Crazy

[02:12:20.290 --> 02:12:21.370]
450 would be nice

[02:12:22.110 --> 02:12:25.350]
But this is a poll that we put on like when the show started today

[02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:28.410]
Don't you understand?

[02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:29.610]
Is this thing on?

[02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:30.410]
No

[02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.850]
Not really

[02:12:30.850 --> 02:12:33.290]
My microphone button's broken again, I just

[02:12:33.850 --> 02:12:35.350]
Listen, you can't play too much

[02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:36.590]
Oh, listen, I'm just...

[02:12:36.590 --> 02:12:38.210]
No, that's not a complaint, that's just a statement

[02:12:38.210 --> 02:12:38.670]
So you know

[02:12:38.670 --> 02:12:39.690]
Observation? Right

[02:12:40.110 --> 02:12:42.610]
George's mic switch is broken again for the 400th time

[02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:46.170]
And that's because you can't complain about the engineering maintenance of QM

[02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:46.890]
Because there isn't any

[02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:50.130]
Oh, that might cost money, Neal, you don't understand

[02:12:50.130 --> 02:12:52.110]
Well, we're on a limited budget now

[02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:54.830]
Oh, yeah, screw you

[02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:57.530]
Well, I'll tell you one thing

[02:12:57.530 --> 02:12:59.290]
If they brought an efficiency expert into that place

[02:12:59.290 --> 02:13:00.210]
Just in one day

[02:13:00.210 --> 02:13:02.330]
Remember lots of time they did that a long time ago

[02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:03.670]
Did they? Here?

[02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:08.410]
I'll tell you, I'll tell you the first people to go that I would blow out of there

[02:13:08.410 --> 02:13:09.730]
Besides Ray Perry

[02:13:13.050 --> 02:13:13.450]
Yeah

[02:13:13.450 --> 02:13:15.290]
Here's the poll, what? Sorry

[02:13:16.290 --> 02:13:18.930]
You get my drift, a lot of dead weight in that place

[02:13:18.930 --> 02:13:20.290]
Lots of dead weight

[02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:24.930]
Lots of people sitting around at desks having meetings, stuff like that

[02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:26.250]
I'd make flee the GM

[02:13:27.090 --> 02:13:29.450]
Because at least he would do something for our show

[02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:32.090]
At least he'd acknowledge its existence

[02:13:32.850 --> 02:13:35.330]
I'm like that stiff red neck sales manager they got

[02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:36.830]
What a bimbo, what a joke

[02:13:37.610 --> 02:13:39.710]
What movie your TV show is the best flesh?

[02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:41.110]
This is a really bad poll

[02:13:41.110 --> 02:13:44.470]
Should've just been TV show, not a movie

[02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:47.250]
How do you mix and match movies and TV shows, huh?

[02:13:48.670 --> 02:13:49.790]
Right? Right?

[02:13:50.530 --> 02:13:50.830]
Not fair

[02:13:51.290 --> 02:13:55.050]
That's like asking what's the best TV show or movie show of all time?

[02:13:55.050 --> 02:13:56.850]
I mean it's just silly

[02:13:58.330 --> 02:13:59.870]
Spanish soap 84

[02:14:01.110 --> 02:14:03.390]
Baywatch 49 with what's his name again?

[02:14:05.850 --> 02:14:06.650]
David Charvet

[02:14:06.650 --> 02:14:08.770]
No, Billy Warlock

[02:14:08.770 --> 02:14:09.470]
Billy Warlock

[02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:11.710]
It's such an unusual name

[02:14:11.710 --> 02:14:13.030]
I think I'll be able to remember, I've got to

[02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:14.530]
I got to be able to say for it on Billy

[02:14:14.530 --> 02:14:17.890]
He kind of looks like a clone of David Charvet

[02:14:19.810 --> 02:14:21.030]
At least to me

[02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:25.030]
He looks about as much like David Charvet as George looks like your ass

[02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.990]
Okay?

[02:14:26.370 --> 02:14:27.870]
You're a crazy person

[02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:30.990]
Billy Warlock looks like a clone of David Charvet

[02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:32.970]
Yeah, they both look like these like you know a little

[02:14:32.970 --> 02:14:35.510]
I don't want to grab your David Charvet in a bathing suit

[02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.890]
He was his alright

[02:14:37.530 --> 02:14:39.010]
And he was definitely not

[02:14:39.010 --> 02:14:40.510]
So quit spreading those rumors

[02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:44.410]
Caligula 46, Boogie Knight 36, that was a great flick

[02:14:45.130 --> 02:14:45.610]
Yep

[02:14:46.210 --> 02:14:50.190]
Wild Things 33, Showgirls 31, Porquies 22, Piece of Crap

[02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:53.490]
Oh, you can't say that Neil, there goes your mail audience

[02:14:53.490 --> 02:14:55.170]
Next you'll be knocking Caddy Shack

[02:14:56.070 --> 02:15:00.530]
Basic instinct 20, Las Vegas 14, Entourage 14, sopranos 11

[02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:04.190]
Girl next door 10, Romtan from Dustyildontan

[02:15:05.210 --> 02:15:08.570]
Supernatural 6, who's on top, who's on the bottom?

[02:15:08.590 --> 02:15:09.690]
Is it Sam, is it Dean?

[02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:12.890]
Kind of, what kind of a question is that?

[02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:14.170]
That was one of the emails we had, right?

[02:15:16.030 --> 02:15:16.190]
Yep

[02:15:16.650 --> 02:15:17.890]
Who's the bottom?

[02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:20.850]
Bachelor Party 5, the BoobTube

[02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:25.290]
Cube 4, Euro Trip 3, Frisky Business 3

[02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:31.030]

The OC 1, none for the Covenant, Meatballs 3, back to school to the seniors

[02:15:38.850 --> 02:15:40.410]
Meatballs 3

[02:15:40.410 --> 02:15:41.590]
Oh Sean

[02:15:41.590 --> 02:15:47.050]
I don't know what kind of drag Sean is doing but I think a lot of people would like to share

[02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:51.370]
He's definitely on heavy medication, isn't he with some of this pole cramp?

[02:15:51.550 --> 02:15:55.470]
The whole ideas are almost always good but some of the selections he puts on there

[02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:56.910]
Oh my God

[02:15:58.010 --> 02:15:58.370]
Wow

[02:15:59.450 --> 02:16:02.270]
That was up to 15, that's all, not going to get your site about

[02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:04.070]
Where's my latest email from Madeline?

[02:16:04.450 --> 02:16:05.190]
No, don't got one

[02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:08.550]
Here's one from somebody

[02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:10.990]
Love the show, but what happened to the naked woman on your site?

[02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:15.330]
Oh my God, Jordan Washington's got a bad head A2 for crying out loud

[02:16:16.450 --> 02:16:18.330]
What happened to the naked woman on your site?

[02:16:19.650 --> 02:16:20.610]
How long, what is that?

[02:16:20.650 --> 02:16:23.250]
Like two and a half years ago since we've been able to put that up?

[02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:24.070]
Can't do it

[02:16:25.290 --> 02:16:26.730]
That's your fascist government, okay?

[02:16:26.810 --> 02:16:29.650]
We can't do it or we'll get sued and we'll go to jail with this and that, whatever

[02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:33.350]
Also, if you've seen the old Sean Connery James Bond movie on high definition DVD

[02:16:33.350 --> 02:16:35.010]
Now I didn't like him in the first place

[02:16:36.350 --> 02:16:40.610]
There's a scene with Connery in a bathtub sporting any wrecked member

[02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:43.730]
Thanks to high definition you can clearly see with, oh no

[02:16:44.970 --> 02:16:47.910]
I would send you the image but you don't click on attachments

[02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:49.090]
Oh and I don't want to see that

[02:16:49.890 --> 02:16:52.030]
I want to see Sean Connery's member?

[02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:54.670]
Oh my God, you've got to be kidding me

[02:16:54.670 --> 02:16:55.410]
Is it a gold member?

[02:16:55.970 --> 02:16:56.730]
A gold, yeah

[02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:58.990]
It was, it was not a member, it was a finger

[02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:00.930]
It felt like a finger

[02:17:02.970 --> 02:17:04.230]
Here's one, it says greetings

[02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:07.350]
Recently my company discovered, oh look at this, this is not...

[02:17:10.410 --> 02:17:10.890]
Ahahahahahahahah

[02:17:11.610 --> 02:17:13.930]
Oh, this is the best

[02:17:16.470 --> 02:17:20.990]
Recently my company is discovered long forgotten bank account containing $500 billion US

[02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:24.130]
These funds must be distributed to a small group of individuals

[02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:29.350]
Considering consisting of Ron, Prozac, Ron, Gilbert, any other listener you feel are worthy

[02:17:30.110 --> 02:17:33.130]
Please have them show up 10 miles west on Eleigator Alley at Sundown

[02:17:33.130 --> 02:17:35.850]
Make sure they wear white t-shirts with bulls eyes on them

[02:17:35.850 --> 02:17:37.590]
Thank you

[02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:42.950]
Please, P.S. tell them my name is Joe Idiot and about it too

[02:17:44.350 --> 02:17:47.030]
What does that mean? Tell them my name is Joe Idiot about it too?

[02:17:47.310 --> 02:17:49.110]
I don't get that, but I like the other part

[02:17:50.370 --> 02:17:52.590]
Meet this guy's got a lot of money for you guys

[02:17:52.590 --> 02:17:55.130]
Hit him on the alley at Sundown

[02:17:56.290 --> 02:17:57.290]
That was kind of cute

[02:17:59.270 --> 02:18:02.930]
I had a double take on that one in the beginning I thought, oh don't tell me this is...

[02:18:02.930 --> 02:18:05.190]
Because it didn't look like those all looked the same

[02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:08.430]
In addition to which those are never addressed to you

[02:18:08.430 --> 02:18:09.650]
They're not addressed to...

[02:18:09.650 --> 02:18:10.610]
Undispoised recipients

[02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:13.130]
Right? Right

[02:18:13.590 --> 02:18:15.170]
They're never addressed to us

[02:18:16.710 --> 02:18:19.810]
Oh and by the way that guy that called before was wrong and I was right for once

[02:18:19.810 --> 02:18:24.510]
Just a wild guess, Citibank bought white kovia and JPMorgan Chase bought Washington Mutual

[02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:25.490]
Correct

[02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:27.070]
So get it right, Pally, get it right

[02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:30.570]
One of the guys upset he probably lost his ass like everybody else

[02:18:30.570 --> 02:18:33.610]
Here comes the buddy and there goes your money I told you take it to the track

[02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:37.230]
Take it to a hard rock, take it to Gulfstream

[02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:39.690]
Take it to somewhere where you might have a good time I mean you'll lose it

[02:18:40.350 --> 02:18:41.070]
But nevertheless

[02:18:42.970 --> 02:18:45.750]
Brian says I'm enjoying your show today except for the callers

[02:18:46.510 --> 02:18:50.370]
I agree with the Ficklery King Gus Johnson is one of the best NFL announcers

[02:18:50.370 --> 02:18:51.550]
I don't even know who that is

[02:18:52.130 --> 02:18:54.890]
Yeah, he's a good guy. I couldn't tell you what it looks like when everybody's gone

[02:18:54.890 --> 02:18:55.550]
He's a good answer

[02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:00.350]
Where would I know him from?

[02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.630]
I think he does

[02:19:03.670 --> 02:19:06.390]
Oh wait no, Gus Johnson does a lot of basketball for TNT

[02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:08.190]
Well I don't watch basketball

[02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:12.350]
The bird was okay on W.Y.N.Z.Z.

[02:19:12.350 --> 02:19:15.830]
Before in the first year on IOD but he seemed to lose interest toward the end

[02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:18.610]
He never made it a year on IOD

[02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:20.350]
He made it a few months

[02:19:20.350 --> 02:19:27.690]
Because we went there in November of whatever year that was 8788

[02:19:28.450 --> 02:19:31.050]
And by the summertime he was long gone

[02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:36.210]
Once that baseball started once the cupston Harry Curie stuff started he was long gone

[02:19:36.210 --> 02:19:37.510]
Head on the table

[02:19:37.510 --> 02:19:40.070]
Yeah, he'd be perfect now though

[02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.470]
Yeah

[02:19:41.350 --> 02:19:41.370]
Right?

[02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:45.350]
Because that whole thing made a comeback that whining and moaning

[02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:49.850]
I remember he hated you talking about the cups or anything having to do with sports

[02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:55.870]
Is jica really now this is interesting because it says is jica really doing a story about your career

[02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:58.750]
If so it's about time I don't know he hasn't said anything to me about it

[02:19:58.750 --> 02:20:00.430]
And how would this person know that?

[02:20:04.530 --> 02:20:04.890]
Huh?

[02:20:05.490 --> 02:20:05.650]
Right

[02:20:06.610 --> 02:20:11.090]
I mean I had a couple of emails alleging that he would like to like jay what's the guy jay marvin

[02:20:13.050 --> 02:20:13.410]
Who?

[02:20:13.410 --> 02:20:18.970]
I have no idea. When I read from jay marvin or the W. W. W. L. S. Chicago used to work in Tampa at FLA

[02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:24.150]
What slots did your friend have luck with at Hard Rock last weekend Brian? Brian's writing a book

[02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:28.430]
I don't know something called extreme luckiness or extreme I don't know

[02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:34.890]
Some stupid thing where it's got like sevens and bars and then if you get a match then they're like two sliding reels

[02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:41.070]
With multiples you know five times three times and this and if you get a number on the first reel

[02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:48.190]
And the second reel goes real slow you know and and you think you're gonna get like five times or ten times and it's just got a stop there

[02:20:48.190 --> 02:20:54.050]
And it doesn't it stops just below or just above almost all the time and his didn't and he got 1600 bucks

[02:20:54.930 --> 02:20:55.870]
How do you like that?

[02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.450]
Yep

[02:20:57.110 --> 02:21:00.530]
And you think I know something after reading that great book you sent me?

[02:21:03.330 --> 02:21:06.050]
You know what I learned nothing here comes the bunny

[02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:12.870]
Oh Madeline is back just one more time. I heard you in George saying that I'm not a real person

[02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:17.430]
I am real I'm glad to send you a picture if you like maybe you can pass it on to Gildi

[02:21:17.430 --> 02:21:19.230]
Oh you've got a thing about your picture.

[02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:20.250]
I'll send it back a picture.

[02:21:20.250 --> 02:21:20.390]
Right

[02:21:21.450 --> 02:21:22.250]
It's the beak.

[02:21:22.390 --> 02:21:23.570]
Maybe this is the beak.

[02:21:24.570 --> 02:21:25.290]
Oh god.

[02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:27.070]
You're choking me up man.

[02:21:27.250 --> 02:21:30.190]
I'll send her a picture. Who do I want to be Harvey Firestein or Kate Moss?

[02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:31.190]
There you go.

[02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:35.030]
Boy if you sure taking her time getting the hell out of here I'll tell you.

[02:21:35.470 --> 02:21:36.490]
Bye Madeline.

[02:21:36.690 --> 02:21:37.690]
Bye bye.

1-17-560.

[02:22:30.790 --> 02:22:34.150]
Notice I'm playing all oldie moldies today and I think maybe through the end of the month too.

[02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:35.930]
But as well those were the fun ones.

[02:22:36.210 --> 02:22:36.330]
What?

[02:22:36.890 --> 02:22:38.350]
The oldies were the funny ones.

[02:22:38.890 --> 02:22:40.550]
No, not the ones that we can play.

[02:22:41.390 --> 02:22:42.770]
The oldies that we can't play.

[02:22:42.850 --> 02:22:43.730]
Those were the funny ones.

[02:22:45.610 --> 02:22:46.670]
Maria B is back.

[02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:48.150]

[02:22:48.790 --> 02:22:49.910]
Take it from the horse's mouth.

[02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:53.190]
City group attempted to purchase walk-cov-y, but the video was rejected.

[02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:57.430]
Wells Fargo purchased walk-cov-y, and we'll be keeping the name the same for the next 12 months.

[02:22:57.870 --> 02:23:02.630]
A perfect example of how our free markets operates is the Grotesque Maria.

[02:23:03.390 --> 02:23:06.670]
Make sure to catch me this afternoon on the closing bell since silly Maria B.

[02:23:08.050 --> 02:23:09.350]
Take it right from the horse's ass.

[02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:15.110]
Oh, do I even want to read these from a very on-ear friend?

[02:23:16.810 --> 02:23:17.590]
You tell me?

[02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:29.010]
I don't know.

[02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:39.430]
I don't know.

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:39.430]

[02:23:39.430 --> 02:23:40.350]
I don't know.

[02:23:40.350 --> 02:23:40.350]

[02:23:40.350 --> 02:23:40.710]
I don't know.

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:40.710]

[02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:41.930]
I don't know.

[02:23:41.930 --> 02:23:43.370]
I don't know.

[02:23:43.370 --> 02:23:44.510]
I don't know.

[02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:46.530]
I don't know.

[02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:51.870]
I don't know.

[02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.090]

[02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.090]

[02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.090]

[02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.090]

[02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.210]
Thank you.

[02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.270]

[02:23:59.330 --> 02:24:05.150]
Well, that's a little teach them the silly old goat he's dead.

[02:24:06.970 --> 02:24:08.670]
We can hear the voice.

[02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:11.950]
Can you fire George when you ask him a question he just answers.

[02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:13.630]
is yep, adding nothing to your question.

[02:24:14.350 --> 02:24:15.930]
Whenever you need information on something,

[02:24:16.050 --> 02:24:17.050]
George would be on top of it.

[02:24:17.210 --> 02:24:18.650]
Instead, he seems out of it,

[02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:20.710]
almost like he's not into his job anymore.

[02:24:21.010 --> 02:24:21.630]
What would you be?

[02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:23.930]
Would that 3% raise he's getting next year?

[02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:24.910]
Would you be into your job?

[02:24:25.870 --> 02:24:28.090]
He probably surfs for porn during the show

[02:24:28.090 --> 02:24:30.890]
and his father at any time you ask him to chime in.

[02:24:31.310 --> 02:24:33.230]
George, get your act together already, says John.

[02:24:33.570 --> 02:24:34.470]
John James.

[02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:38.050]
Likely story, John James might ask.

[02:24:38.310 --> 02:24:41.110]
Oh, here we go, the China Cultural Center Award for 2008.

[02:24:42.010 --> 02:24:43.410]
I've been awarded $80 million,

[02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:46.110]
not all I got to do is send them my shoe size and et cetera.

[02:24:46.570 --> 02:24:47.950]
And my penis on a platter.

[02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:50.730]
441, that thing ain't moving.

[02:24:50.930 --> 02:24:53.330]
I bet your Eric's got the break on just to piss you off.

[02:24:53.370 --> 02:24:53.830]
He hates you.

[02:24:55.230 --> 02:24:56.630]
443, what do you think about that?

[02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:58.750]
Very happy, Tommy.

[02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.550]
Yeah, you pleased?

[02:24:59.850 --> 02:25:00.450]
We're gonna get it.

[02:25:00.750 --> 02:25:01.970]
Oh, the sun is peaking through.

[02:25:02.030 --> 02:25:02.770]
I can't believe it.

[02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:03.870]
That's the first time I see the sun

[02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:04.850]
since I left Florida.

[02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:08.530]
Boy, that must be warming things up.

[02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:10.570]
I bet it's like at least 35.

[02:25:11.130 --> 02:25:11.810]
What do you think?

[02:25:12.690 --> 02:25:12.930]
Okay.

[02:25:13.730 --> 02:25:14.150]
No snow.

[02:25:14.890 --> 02:25:18.010]
It's already December 2, it's zero, it's 32.

[02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:19.630]
Why bet you it's a toasty zero though.

[02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:21.870]
You know the difference between like a toasty,

[02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:24.670]
tolerable zero and a really freezing ass cold zero?

[02:25:25.290 --> 02:25:26.150]
No, what's the difference?

[02:25:28.470 --> 02:25:30.130]
I think John James has got a point.

[02:25:30.330 --> 02:25:30.510]
Mm-hmm.

[02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:33.470]
How you doing on there, Alfas?

[02:25:33.610 --> 02:25:34.950]
So you get up to 450 or what?

[02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:37.090]
Before you get to 500, you got to get to 450.

[02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:39.110]
448.

[02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:41.250]
448, we got a chunk.

[02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:42.230]
We got a clump.

[02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:43.910]
Oh, we got a clump.

[02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.730]
Do you ever have a clump?

[02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:45.850]
Just this morning.

[02:25:46.490 --> 02:25:47.290]
Oh, God.

[02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:49.670]
Well, I tell you one thing, when I made that mad dash earlier,

[02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:51.510]
I don't want to get too graphic, but wow.

[02:25:52.490 --> 02:25:53.290]
Holy moly.

[02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.730]
Woo.

[02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:56.910]
Even I was scared to death by that.

[02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.670]
Where are you?

[02:25:58.470 --> 02:26:00.590]
Even Barry, I'm your friend says,

[02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:02.810]
do you think George has upset at Prozac Ron?

[02:26:03.170 --> 02:26:04.750]
If we have many nice things that was given to him,

[02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:06.490]
while George has to work for his things he gets,

[02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:09.250]
don't you let the rationalities.

[02:26:09.250 --> 02:26:09.450]
The rationalities?

[02:26:09.630 --> 02:26:10.330]
It's very simple.

[02:26:10.690 --> 02:26:13.590]
Stop calling and no more animus.

[02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:14.790]
It's very simple.

[02:26:14.930 --> 02:26:16.950]
That plasma TV in HP is very cool.

[02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:18.870]
Job needs to be on medications and therapy.

[02:26:19.250 --> 02:26:21.930]
So, George, why don't you and Prozac Ron talk one day?

[02:26:22.250 --> 02:26:23.670]
You might find he's very resourceful and good.

[02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.910]
We did.

[02:26:24.330 --> 02:26:24.870]
We did.

[02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:26.150]
I have to invite you to dinner.

[02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:27.790]
You and he are good people.

[02:26:27.970 --> 02:26:29.550]
Plus Prozac Ron brings your ratings up.

[02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:30.070]
Oh, yeah.

[02:26:30.570 --> 02:26:32.070]
Damn, you're put the show off the year.

[02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:35.050]
Plus you should give him a chance at least to be on time

[02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:37.110]
unlike Chris who's always later no shows.

[02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.630]
I give him a chance.

[02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:39.270]
I'm going to take him to medications sincerely.

[02:26:39.610 --> 02:26:40.670]
Barry, I'm your friend.

[02:26:40.930 --> 02:26:42.150]
He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.

[02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:43.510]
It's got about 85 he-he's.

[02:26:43.630 --> 02:26:46.030]
I tried on several occasions to have a rational conversation

[02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:47.750]
with him both on and off the phone.

[02:26:47.770 --> 02:26:48.910]
You can't have rational conversations

[02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:51.030]
with an irrational, with an irrational person.

[02:26:51.130 --> 02:26:51.390]
That's right.

[02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:52.830]
Oh, my God.

[02:26:53.770 --> 02:26:54.570]
Oh, oh.

[02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.390]
Oh.

[02:26:59.390 --> 02:26:59.470]
Oh.

[02:26:59.470 --> 02:27:00.270]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:01.770 --> 02:27:03.670]
I just received the worst memo.

[02:27:04.270 --> 02:27:05.830]
The last memo I got from the station

[02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:07.910]
that was this bad was a little about no food, you know?

[02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.210]
Yeah.

[02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:12.550]
From jolly jobell in that piece of turd clearance.

[02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:14.470]
I'm not done crying, by the way.

[02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:17.390]
From Josh Dero,

[02:27:19.090 --> 02:27:20.710]
December 2nd, 2008,

[02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:22.550]
carbon copy jolly jobell.

[02:27:23.610 --> 02:27:25.630]
And what's that just talking about this before?

[02:27:25.810 --> 02:27:27.050]
Just let the other blow out of there.

[02:27:27.050 --> 02:27:27.190]
Yeah.

[02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.250]
Yeah.

[02:27:27.350 --> 02:27:28.350]
She wasn't, it wouldn't be one of them.

[02:27:28.350 --> 02:27:28.530]
Uh-uh.

[02:27:30.170 --> 02:27:31.670]
See, the wrong people get screwed.

[02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:32.190]
That's right.

[02:27:32.350 --> 02:27:33.230]
People have their nose up clearance

[02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:34.150]
and jobells ass.

[02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:36.130]
They, they're the ones that get shoved out the door.

[02:27:36.210 --> 02:27:37.830]
This is, this is an infomnia.

[02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:41.050]
I'm sad to have to tell everyone

[02:27:41.050 --> 02:27:43.290]
that Allison Turner is no longer with WQAM.

[02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:46.230]
Due to the downturn in the economy and cutbacks here

[02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.750]
at the station,

[02:27:47.330 --> 02:27:49.470]
Allison's position has been eliminated from the budget.

[02:27:50.850 --> 02:27:52.370]
Allison was a great asset to the station

[02:27:52.370 --> 02:27:53.990]
and to me is the executive producer.

[02:27:54.270 --> 02:27:55.330]
She was a tremendous worker

[02:27:55.330 --> 02:27:57.070]
with a great passion for WQAM.

[02:27:57.430 --> 02:28:00.690]
It's very unfortunate as are the economic realities we are facing today

[02:28:00.690 --> 02:28:02.390]
as a radio station

[02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:06.270]
from Clarence Freakin Dero.

[02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:07.190]
How do you like that?

[02:28:07.490 --> 02:28:07.770]
I don't know.

[02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:09.790]
I don't know.

[02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:10.970]
And that's because she'd like this show.

[02:28:13.390 --> 02:28:15.910]
And she's not one of those people, you know,

[02:28:16.010 --> 02:28:17.110]
like Ray Perry, for example.

[02:28:17.310 --> 02:28:18.330]
What, what does he do there?

[02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:19.050]
I'm not sure.

[02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:21.430]
He parks underneath the building in an expensive car.

[02:28:21.970 --> 02:28:22.290]
Yeah.

[02:28:22.990 --> 02:28:23.510]
I'm done.

[02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:27.150]
I mean, Maddie Bell, of course,

[02:28:27.330 --> 02:28:28.190]
Maddie Bell was Jewish.

[02:28:28.810 --> 02:28:29.750]
Allison, is she Jewish?

[02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:31.290]
I don't think so.

[02:28:31.430 --> 02:28:31.950]
I don't think so.

[02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:34.970]
Well, better tell them that they might change their mind.

[02:28:36.010 --> 02:28:37.030]
Of course, parents is Jewish.

[02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:39.230]
That doesn't seem to make any difference with them

[02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:41.030]
because he's got the naked pictures

[02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:42.190]
of the beastlies and the billy goats.

[02:28:44.210 --> 02:28:48.470]
He's got a gigantic decanter full of jolly joe bells,

[02:28:48.710 --> 02:28:49.350]
bloody diarrhea.

[02:28:50.670 --> 02:28:52.030]
And he's saving it as evidence.

[02:28:52.570 --> 02:28:55.310]
If I were you, I'd go in there and I'd scour through his drawers.

[02:28:56.770 --> 02:28:57.330]
No, sorry.

[02:28:57.470 --> 02:28:58.450]
Look, he was doing that one day.

[02:28:58.510 --> 02:28:59.530]
He was scouring through his drawers.

[02:29:00.130 --> 02:29:01.510]
I almost vomited.

[02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:03.550]
I almost fell off the chair and discussed.

[02:29:05.970 --> 02:29:08.470]
454, and just as a thought that he might find something

[02:29:08.470 --> 02:29:09.390]
and they're all the way doubted.

[02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:11.770]
455 on your point.

[02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:13.430]
You need 45 votes in 37 minutes.

[02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:14.930]
You're closing the gap, baby.

[02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:16.750]
You've got a chance to redeem yourself.

[02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:18.830]
So what, what do you make of that?

[02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:21.190]
The fact that they chose her to blow out and eliminate her.

[02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.870]
What do you mean what do you make?

[02:29:22.050 --> 02:29:25.450]
We talked about the fraternity since the first week I was in this building.

[02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:27.030]
And she wasn't part of it.

[02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.990]
No, she's not a guy.

[02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.850]
First of all, she is Jewish.

[02:29:29.950 --> 02:29:31.310]
But second of all, she's not a...

[02:29:31.310 --> 02:29:31.930]
Why do you say no?

[02:29:32.310 --> 02:29:33.610]
I said, I don't think so.

[02:29:34.650 --> 02:29:35.770]
Well, how do you know she is then?

[02:29:36.090 --> 02:29:37.470]
Because I was just told that she is.

[02:29:37.650 --> 02:29:37.990]
Uh-huh.

[02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:38.370]
See?

[02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:41.210]
But she's not a mad guy.

[02:29:41.930 --> 02:29:41.930]

[02:29:42.430 --> 02:29:42.570]
Hey.

[02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.150]
Jewish.

[02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:44.510]
Eddie K. Jewish.

[02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:46.090]
Niels contracts sliced in half.

[02:29:46.270 --> 02:29:46.470]
Jewish.

[02:29:46.470 --> 02:29:50.710]
I think the ADL ought to get involved in this.

[02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.810]
What do you think?

[02:29:52.310 --> 02:29:52.910]
Or the ADD.

[02:29:53.690 --> 02:29:53.870]
Yeah.

[02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:56.790]
Now, what were you saying before I so rudely interrupted?

[02:29:57.290 --> 02:29:58.130]
That she's not a guy.

[02:29:58.690 --> 02:30:00.950]
She's not part of this jock-huffing fraternity over here.

[02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:02.190]
She's a radio person.

[02:30:02.350 --> 02:30:03.910]
Even though she is a big sports fan, as you know.

[02:30:16.610 --> 02:30:17.950]
So sad day.

[02:30:18.090 --> 02:30:18.470]
Mm-hmm.

[02:30:18.810 --> 02:30:19.530]
A very sad day.

[02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:20.870]
Sad, sad day.

[02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:22.390]
At QAM.

[02:30:23.350 --> 02:30:27.170]
People who do a good job, people actually are there for a purpose that we can define.

[02:30:28.250 --> 02:30:29.290]
They get stoch.

[02:30:30.450 --> 02:30:32.470]
A real stoch right in the old...

[02:30:32.470 --> 02:30:32.850]
Brackum.

[02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:33.770]
At ass.

[02:30:35.170 --> 02:30:36.730]
But people who we can't even...

[02:30:36.730 --> 02:30:39.090]
We can't even determine what they are doing there.

[02:30:40.090 --> 02:30:41.970]
As long as they have their nose in the right place.

[02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.470]
Brackum.

[02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:43.090]
Here we go again.

[02:30:43.090 --> 02:30:43.970]
It's a busy ass.

[02:30:45.350 --> 02:30:46.470]
They stay forever.

[02:30:46.650 --> 02:30:47.730]
Like the beast, for example.

[02:30:48.090 --> 02:30:49.210]
What the hell does he do there?

[02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:51.330]
You mean who?

[02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:54.190]
What is his purpose there?

[02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:57.770]
What is his function besides being a trouble making waddler up and down the hallway?

[02:30:57.890 --> 02:30:58.510]
What does he do?

[02:30:59.630 --> 02:31:01.030]
Again, do you mean who?

[02:31:01.450 --> 02:31:02.330]
Who does he do?

[02:31:04.050 --> 02:31:04.490]
Clarence.

[02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:05.010]
We know that.

[02:31:07.710 --> 02:31:13.470]
You ever seen that big gigantic economy-sized family-family-sized jar of gasoline on

[02:31:13.470 --> 02:31:14.030]
the ground?

[02:31:14.650 --> 02:31:15.010]
Yeah.

[02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.970]
That's him and the beast.

[02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:21.930]
Very sad.

[02:31:22.750 --> 02:31:23.170]
Yes it is.

[02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:24.470]
But believe me, there's more to come.

[02:31:24.610 --> 02:31:25.350]
Trust me when I say it.

[02:31:25.530 --> 02:31:25.910]
I better...

[02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.170]
You better watch your backpack, Chris.

[02:31:28.410 --> 02:31:28.990]
Well, not Jewish.

[02:31:29.690 --> 02:31:30.470]
Oh, that's true.

[02:31:30.750 --> 02:31:31.730]
Hey, we got a goi on the show.

[02:31:31.770 --> 02:31:32.510]
We got two goi-im.

[02:31:33.130 --> 02:31:33.410]
Mm-hmm.

[02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:35.190]
That counterbalances me.

[02:31:35.350 --> 02:31:37.250]
Plus I'm an atheist anyway, so I don't cut that much.

[02:31:37.330 --> 02:31:38.470]
That counter is only part you.

[02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:40.290]
So, you're late.

[02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:41.550]
It's a back talent.

[02:31:41.550 --> 02:31:43.050]
It's a DJ show.

[02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:44.710]
We're nights for being to alive in Iran.

[02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:45.630]
But sports for you.

[02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:46.370]
5.6 feet.

[02:31:46.570 --> 02:31:46.890]
2.8.

[02:31:47.410 --> 02:31:47.890]
V.

[02:31:48.330 --> 02:31:48.770]
Sports.

[02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:50.990]
Me, oh God.

[02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:53.290]
Thanks, Flee.

[02:31:53.450 --> 02:31:54.470]
Flee fixed the rejorns.

[02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:55.370]
He's a heck of a gun.

[02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:58.730]
I need eight piles of rostracing.

[02:31:59.610 --> 02:32:02.350]
Two vis-a-fee beaches of Miami.

[02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:04.970]
That's all it takes to reach it.

[02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:06.550]
Say the Taliban.

[02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:08.270]
This gate plans.

[02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:09.270]
This gate plans.

[02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:10.230]
This gate plans.

[02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:14.130]
Look away, the rat that was on our head.

[02:32:14.770 --> 02:32:17.730]
Now we have to use toilet paper instead.

[02:32:18.450 --> 02:32:19.990]
This gate plans to Miami.

[02:32:20.350 --> 02:32:22.710]
Next target of the attack.

[02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:30.150]
A tropical paradise loaded with epiphythia.

[02:32:30.430 --> 02:32:31.190]
We're out there.

[02:32:31.690 --> 02:32:31.770]
The sun.

[02:32:32.470 --> 02:32:32.510]
The sun.

[02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:36.690]
They're serving us ice tea at the end.

[02:32:36.690 --> 02:32:40.210]
But we really rather dreamt our day.

[02:32:41.230 --> 02:32:44.810]
Slash a few throat-sensees of hope.

[02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:48.390]
Point to towards Miami and off we go.

[02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:52.170]
To where the angry humans slaughter their goat.

[02:32:52.390 --> 02:32:53.050]
To the attack.

[02:32:53.530 --> 02:32:53.950]
Attack.

[02:32:54.490 --> 02:32:54.670]
Attack.

[02:32:55.370 --> 02:32:55.790]
Attack.

[02:32:56.090 --> 02:32:56.090]

[02:32:56.170 --> 02:32:56.910]
That's our plan.

[02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.830]
This gate plan.

[02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:59.750]
This gate plan.

[02:33:00.330 --> 02:33:00.950]
The plan.

[02:33:01.210 --> 02:33:01.710]
Our plan.

[02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:02.610]
This gate plan.

[02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:04.830]
131.65 WQAM.

[02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:08.630]
We're out there.

[02:33:10.030 --> 02:33:10.590]
We're out there.

[02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.590]

[02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.590]

[02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.590]

[02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.590]

[02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.590]

[02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.610]
We're out there.

[02:33:10.610 --> 02:33:10.610]

[02:33:10.610 --> 02:33:10.610]

[02:33:10.610 --> 02:33:10.610]

[02:33:10.730 --> 02:33:11.290]
We're out there.

[02:33:11.290 --> 02:33:11.290]

[02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:12.250]
We're out there.

[02:33:12.330 --> 02:33:12.890]
We're out there.

[02:33:13.010 --> 02:33:13.410]
We're out there.

[02:33:13.410 --> 02:33:14.190]
We're out there.

[02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:14.990]
We're out there.

[02:33:15.090 --> 02:33:15.810]
We're out there.

[02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:17.250]
We're out there.

[02:33:17.730 --> 02:33:18.130]
We're out there.

[02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:19.150]
We're out there.

[02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:20.590]
We're out there.

[02:33:20.770 --> 02:33:21.570]
We're out there.

[02:33:21.630 --> 02:33:22.950]
We're out there.

[02:33:24.470 --> 02:33:25.070]
We're out there.

[02:33:25.210 --> 02:33:26.430]
We're out there.

[02:33:33.690 --> 02:33:34.810]
We're out there.

[02:33:53.410 --> 02:34:02.290]
We're out there.

[02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.290]

[02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.290]

[02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.290]

[02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.290]

[02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.290]

[02:34:02.290 --> 02:34:02.290]

[02:34:04.510 --> 02:34:04.670]
In here.

[02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:05.470]
to check your email.

[02:34:06.250 --> 02:34:06.650]
Mark.

[02:34:07.170 --> 02:34:07.710]
Right now.

[02:34:07.970 --> 02:34:08.890]
Is there a picture there?

[02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:11.390]
Let me do the old son of a kid.

[02:34:11.470 --> 02:34:14.070]
Madeline who was certainly not Madeline, but is also illiterate.

[02:34:14.370 --> 02:34:16.310]
Please, I send my picture to George.

[02:34:16.310 --> 02:34:17.330]
Please tell him to look for it.

[02:34:17.370 --> 02:34:18.110]
I send my picture.

[02:34:18.690 --> 02:34:19.050]
Illiterate.

[02:34:19.810 --> 02:34:20.610]
Uh-huh.

[02:34:20.930 --> 02:34:21.170]
Yeah.

[02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:22.590]
And?

[02:34:24.070 --> 02:34:24.830]
Forwarded it to me.

[02:34:25.250 --> 02:34:25.550]
Sure.

[02:34:26.850 --> 02:34:27.890]
Now, what is it?

[02:34:28.290 --> 02:34:29.730]
It's a fat lady, but it's not.

[02:34:29.910 --> 02:34:32.290]
I could send her a picture of Christ and say it was me.

[02:34:32.430 --> 02:34:33.010]
I mean, you know.

[02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:33.970]
I understand.

[02:34:34.850 --> 02:34:35.970]
It's part of the game.

[02:34:36.070 --> 02:34:38.190]
The whole thing with the emails is just a game now.

[02:34:38.310 --> 02:34:38.850]
Which is fine.

[02:34:39.330 --> 02:34:40.310]
As long as we get stuff.

[02:34:40.570 --> 02:34:40.950]
You know what I mean?

[02:34:41.290 --> 02:34:44.030]
Let me save it and then send the actual pictures so you don't click on that.

[02:34:44.410 --> 02:34:46.210]
As long as we get stuff like this.

[02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:50.710]
But a beep, but a boop, but a bob.

[02:34:53.790 --> 02:34:54.450]
Oh yeah.

[02:34:55.050 --> 02:34:55.970]
Think about it easily.

[02:34:56.190 --> 02:34:56.690]
Likely story.

[02:34:59.810 --> 02:35:00.990]
It's probably from Joe Bill.

[02:35:00.990 --> 02:35:03.630]
Oh, well, you know, we got all the Nile.

[02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:05.990]
We got to keep Nile and pay him about 50 bucks a week.

[02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:11.190]
Here's the fake Barry Jackass who's starting to really, really get under my skin.

[02:35:11.350 --> 02:35:11.650]
You know what I mean?

[02:35:12.650 --> 02:35:12.830]
Yeah.

[02:35:13.290 --> 02:35:17.430]
And you choose to stick around with these grave robbers question mark as if I have a choice.

[02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:23.750]
When the last contract ended, remember that period of time and we were waiting and waiting

[02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:25.410]
and normal was sitting there waiting for the phone to ring.

[02:35:25.630 --> 02:35:30.750]
There was absolutely no interest in the erudgers by anybody for any amount.

[02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:36.590]
There was no offer, not a dollar, not a dime, not a nickel, not a loony, not a toony, nothing,

[02:35:36.990 --> 02:35:38.510]
not a zip and doodah.

[02:35:39.130 --> 02:35:41.510]
See the thing that Joe Bell did first successfully when it came in.

[02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:47.550]
I was screaming about this at the time is he was devaluing my value in the market and the

[02:35:47.550 --> 02:35:47.810]
show.

[02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:53.150]
You thought he was stupid and then he did a fabulous job and you know, it came on at the

[02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:56.410]
anyway.

[02:35:57.030 --> 02:35:58.090]
That's just where it is.

[02:35:58.230 --> 02:36:00.110]
Yeah, I choose to stick around like I got a choice.

[02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:00.590]
Guess what?

[02:36:00.770 --> 02:36:01.590]
I got bills to pay.

[02:36:01.650 --> 02:36:01.890]
Okay.

[02:36:03.410 --> 02:36:06.090]
I want income and I'm like, I'll you idiots out there.

[02:36:06.090 --> 02:36:07.730]
Oh, you need to go over and sign up with this.

[02:36:07.790 --> 02:36:08.270]
Go to FM.

[02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:08.910]
Yeah, go to hell.

[02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.650]
That's my suggestion.

[02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:12.050]
That Barry Jackass fake wheel or whoever.

[02:36:12.490 --> 02:36:13.150]
Go to hell.

[02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:15.870]
Go to hell.

[02:36:16.430 --> 02:36:16.790]
Okay.

[02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:18.770]
Am I going to be able to find that picture of Madeline?

[02:36:19.250 --> 02:36:19.850]
Check your box.

[02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:21.070]
The fake Madeline, huh?

[02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:21.870]
Check your inbox.

[02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:23.270]
Okay.

[02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.670]
There it is.

[02:36:24.470 --> 02:36:25.190]
Emailing Madeline.

[02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:27.870]
Let me click the attachment.

[02:36:29.310 --> 02:36:30.110]
Oh, boy.

[02:36:30.250 --> 02:36:30.590]
Yeah.

[02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:32.510]
Oh, no.

[02:36:32.770 --> 02:36:33.150]
Oh, yeah.

[02:36:33.970 --> 02:36:35.670]
Oh, my God.

[02:36:35.950 --> 02:36:36.950]
She's all over.

[02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:37.950]
She's got away 200 pounds.

[02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:38.190]
Sure.

[02:36:38.310 --> 02:36:40.230]
That's a full figure if ever there was one.

[02:36:40.330 --> 02:36:40.710]
Of course.

[02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:41.030]
Of course.

[02:36:41.070 --> 02:36:41.270]
That's a full figure.

[02:36:41.410 --> 02:36:41.650]
That's a full figure.

[02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:42.090]
That's a full figure.

[02:36:42.090 --> 02:36:42.270]
That's a full figure.

[02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:43.150]
That's a real girl.

[02:36:43.630 --> 02:36:45.650]
And you know, that's not really her.

[02:36:45.970 --> 02:36:46.070]
Oh, God.

[02:36:46.450 --> 02:36:48.390]
That's the board and calories there ever was.

[02:36:50.470 --> 02:36:51.790]
But that's part of the game.

[02:36:52.050 --> 02:36:53.650]
You know, that's turned into a game which is fine.

[02:36:53.970 --> 02:36:55.970]
Like the phone's turned into a game, but that's an audio game.

[02:36:55.970 --> 02:36:59.290]
Much more annoying and much more difficult to control.

[02:36:59.490 --> 02:37:02.530]
Well, if Neil would just screen the calls like George does, yeah, right.

[02:37:03.070 --> 02:37:05.510]
I don't want to screen the calls and I don't want to do like George does.

[02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:06.590]
George does his thing.

[02:37:06.690 --> 02:37:07.930]
I do my thing.

[02:37:07.970 --> 02:37:09.130]
Not in a lot of ways.

[02:37:09.470 --> 02:37:10.310]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:12.330]
But we both like Johnny F. and Rocket.

[02:37:12.330 --> 02:37:13.070]
So I'll tell you that.

[02:37:14.330 --> 02:37:14.870]
A lot.

[02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.790]
Yes.

[02:37:17.430 --> 02:37:18.810]
No items in this view.

[02:37:18.890 --> 02:37:19.650]
Well, that's a shame.

[02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:24.050]
After seeing that beautiful picture of the gigantic booby fake Madeline.

[02:37:24.050 --> 02:37:25.150]
Mm hmm.

[02:37:25.730 --> 02:37:26.590]
How do you like that?

[02:37:27.970 --> 02:37:30.390]
See, this is this is the end and believe me.

[02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:34.130]
Twenty four minutes will be out of here and then I'll go on with my life.

[02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.810]
Right.

[02:37:35.230 --> 02:37:39.530]
But the concept now that they got the emails, it's another way to get through to us.

[02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:41.030]
Abuse the host.

[02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:42.290]
Abuse the people on it.

[02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.430]
Sure.

[02:37:42.570 --> 02:37:43.610]
That's the soft floor mentality.

[02:37:44.190 --> 02:37:46.670]
Don't have anything to say because they never had anything to say on the phone.

[02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:48.990]
Why should they have anything to say on the email and they don't?

[02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:51.230]
For the most part, they have nothing.

[02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:52.050]
Zero.

[02:37:54.270 --> 02:37:58.990]
And thank God for all the fake to fake this one and fake that one because they're the ones who made this email thing.

[02:37:59.270 --> 02:38:00.350]
Whatever it is.

[02:38:01.770 --> 02:38:02.570]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:38:02.850 --> 02:38:03.090]
Mm hmm.

[02:38:03.370 --> 02:38:04.030]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:38:04.170 --> 02:38:04.470]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:04.570 --> 02:38:05.850]
Chris has got a chance in 500.

[02:38:06.430 --> 02:38:07.590]
Oh, this is going to be tight.

[02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.390]
469.

[02:38:08.610 --> 02:38:09.070]
What do you got?

[02:38:10.410 --> 02:38:10.770]
471.

[02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:12.450]
Twenty four minutes.

[02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:13.410]
29 votes.

[02:38:13.650 --> 02:38:14.290]
Yeah, 471.

[02:38:14.410 --> 02:38:15.230]
Can you do it?

[02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:15.870]
Yep.

[02:38:16.270 --> 02:38:17.990]
Come on people as he would say.

[02:38:19.090 --> 02:38:19.570]
Let's go.

[02:38:19.570 --> 02:38:20.590]
I'm not going to get in gear.

[02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:25.410]
Oh, and I'm not the least bit interested in the beastly report out of concare less.

[02:38:25.530 --> 02:38:26.050]
Who's this from?

[02:38:29.890 --> 02:38:30.690]
Oh, HHHGHLMNOP.

[02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:32.670]
Lucky strike me.

[02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:33.430]
It means fine tobacco.

[02:38:35.390 --> 02:38:36.670]
This is from last week.

[02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:38.090]
Neal, did you hear?

[02:38:38.310 --> 02:38:39.590]
This is the day after we talked about it.

[02:38:39.690 --> 02:38:40.210]
A length on the air.

[02:38:40.370 --> 02:38:41.790]
After we had 500 emails about it.

[02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:45.050]
Did you hear Tony Cicareto has gone with a whole bunch of exclamation points.

[02:38:46.030 --> 02:38:49.450]
Thank God I won't have to watch this silly person with gigantic ears anymore on TV.

[02:38:49.450 --> 02:38:51.390]
A whole bunch more exclamation points.

[02:38:51.810 --> 02:38:53.590]
His face truly made me ill each time.

[02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:56.590]
It was forced to look at him when I watched the news.

[02:38:56.590 --> 02:38:58.010]
He was forced to look at him.

[02:38:58.990 --> 02:39:00.890]
Here's another guy sitting there with a gun to his head.

[02:39:00.990 --> 02:39:03.650]
Oh, you got to watch that like the people who are forced to listen to this show.

[02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:08.110]
Now we must do our best to remove the following losers from TV broadcast media.

[02:39:08.410 --> 02:39:09.730]
Here's the list of incompetence.

[02:39:10.190 --> 02:39:11.030]
You want to hear it?

[02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.410]
Sure.

[02:39:12.430 --> 02:39:14.410]
Madeline will be upset because Geldies on here.

[02:39:15.430 --> 02:39:18.150]
One, Joe Zagaki, truly embarrassing on the air.

[02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:19.010]
I have no life.

[02:39:19.290 --> 02:39:20.770]
Absolutely correct sir.

[02:39:20.930 --> 02:39:21.850]
Two Jimmy Mannwich.

[02:39:22.090 --> 02:39:23.270]
What all of a sudden he does interviews.

[02:39:23.730 --> 02:39:25.310]
Mannwich fears LeBaster.

[02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:29.750]
Three Joe Rose, sings like a sissy and sucks it off an ass.

[02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:32.110]
An addition sucks Drew Rosenhaus has.

[02:39:32.690 --> 02:39:33.990]
Lonella the second going on.

[02:39:34.510 --> 02:39:35.450]
For Geldie Gelstein.

[02:39:35.970 --> 02:39:37.530]
At best, a junior high broadcaster.

[02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:39.330]
The late-year-old girl's voice.

[02:39:41.430 --> 02:39:43.570]
Five Kimba Bo camper pushing 300 pounds.

[02:39:43.690 --> 02:39:46.330]
His fat face doesn't fit the TV screen and illiterate the boot.

[02:39:46.330 --> 02:39:50.630]
Six Randy Moore, a buffoon who yells and screams with fake excitement.

[02:39:51.850 --> 02:39:54.870]
Seven Denise Pothvan, a frog, simply a frog.

[02:39:56.190 --> 02:39:56.810]
And eight.

[02:39:57.390 --> 02:40:00.130]
Jimmy Cifilis, the most horrific NFL broadcaster ever.

[02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:03.750]
Jimmy sounds worse than that wicked diarrhea feels and smells like.

[02:40:03.850 --> 02:40:05.170]
Oh, this must be from Jolly Joe Bell.

[02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:06.990]
Mm-hmm.

[02:40:07.170 --> 02:40:08.590]
Sounds like the voice of experience, don't it?

[02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:10.310]
Don't not anyone.

[02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:13.870]
Boy, you know something I was thinking about the other day and thank God that you don't know my...

[02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:14.250]
Don't know my...

[02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:14.470]
Yeah.

[02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:16.170]
For something on TV.

[02:40:18.310 --> 02:40:19.030]
Some ad.

[02:40:19.970 --> 02:40:22.150]
Oh, yeah, it's for CHFIs from one of the FM stations.

[02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:24.250]
They got a good on-air TV campaign.

[02:40:24.910 --> 02:40:25.950]
All of this is good as ours.

[02:40:27.130 --> 02:40:34.330]
And the one seeing the buffoon guy from the morning show is he's in the meat locker and he's got a big donut that he's eaten.

[02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:36.610]
Or a bouti when he gets caught.

[02:40:37.330 --> 02:40:38.890]
That was up only 159 by the way.

[02:40:40.490 --> 02:40:42.070]
And then got me started thinking about donuts.

[02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:45.010]
You know how impressionable all fat people are and everybody else too.

[02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:49.430]
And I didn't eat any but I started thinking about crispy cream.

[02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:50.590]
Are they still in business?

[02:40:51.330 --> 02:40:51.650]
Yeah.

[02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.990]
Yep.

[02:40:52.530 --> 02:40:57.770]
Because once the carb things started making a comeback and people started realizing they're dying from donuts.

[02:40:58.550 --> 02:41:00.810]
They thought, but those things are pretty good but not that good.

[02:41:01.370 --> 02:41:02.830]
Are you willing to die for it?

[02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.110]
You know?

[02:41:04.550 --> 02:41:06.310]
Kind of like Steven Strait.

[02:41:06.450 --> 02:41:07.310]
I'm willing to die for that.

[02:41:07.610 --> 02:41:08.390]
I'm dying for it.

[02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:10.330]
But not for crispy cream.

[02:41:10.330 --> 02:41:12.870]
You need 24 votes and 21 minutes.

[02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:14.670]
Come on, fat, Chris, can do it.

[02:41:14.670 --> 02:41:15.710]
What's your name?

[02:41:16.170 --> 02:41:16.830]
The word of the word.

[02:41:17.170 --> 02:41:18.290]
You don't have no logic.

[02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:20.610]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:22.470]
The fourth leader.

[02:41:22.770 --> 02:41:24.910]
The best talent.

[02:41:25.150 --> 02:41:25.950]
It's the big O.

[02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:27.330]
Orlando Elzo Gary.

[02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:28.830]
Afternoon, 2 to 4.

[02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:31.370]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[02:41:32.390 --> 02:41:33.970]
The sports cheer.

[02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:35.530]
Bus driver.

[02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.490]
Follow me.

[02:41:36.490 --> 02:41:37.890]
Down south.

[02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:39.970]
Where the mudwings go?

[02:41:40.370 --> 02:41:42.910]
To hang from trees and play banjo.

[02:41:43.150 --> 02:41:46.250]
You got some food on a station on.

[02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:49.250]
You banged old raiding old boy.

[02:41:49.350 --> 02:41:52.450]
Now as North Carolina goes.

[02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:55.390]
Rolly's a big city and old.

[02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:58.570]
And that's where the beeswings had to go.

[02:41:59.050 --> 02:42:00.870]
For Golly Riley Joe.

[02:42:02.610 --> 02:42:04.050]
A new GM.

[02:42:05.270 --> 02:42:07.410]
He'll do what he can.

[02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:10.630]
Shake your hand like a friend.

[02:42:11.250 --> 02:42:13.350]
And quickly walk away.

[02:42:13.630 --> 02:42:14.070]
Absolutely.

[02:42:14.270 --> 02:42:15.050]
They have Joe.

[02:42:15.470 --> 02:42:18.410]
Go to 560 with ratings.

[02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:21.350]
And the toilet mold to get those.

[02:42:21.810 --> 02:42:23.870]
Flaming sportful moths.

[02:42:24.050 --> 02:42:25.690]
An order and control.

[02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:27.450]
And then so.

[02:42:28.050 --> 02:42:29.870]
Golly Rolly Joe.

[02:42:30.330 --> 02:42:30.910]
A bugger.

[02:42:30.910 --> 02:42:32.750]
And in the know.

[02:42:33.050 --> 02:42:34.290]
Let's go.

[02:42:34.890 --> 02:42:36.230]
And here's what blows.

[02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:38.410]
Golly is on show.

[02:42:39.590 --> 02:42:42.010]
You make the big change.

[02:42:42.730 --> 02:42:44.910]
And read a range.

[02:42:46.030 --> 02:42:47.810]
It's worse or the same.

[02:42:48.930 --> 02:42:50.810]
He hasn't done a thing.

[02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:52.450]
For what goes.

[02:42:53.050 --> 02:42:54.790]
All the air at 2.

[02:42:55.290 --> 02:42:55.570]
Joe.

[02:42:55.770 --> 02:42:57.650]
Don't have a stinkin' clue.

[02:42:57.650 --> 02:43:08.210]
about a four, not mad essentially blows for all radio, the GM of 560 Charlie,

[02:43:08.530 --> 02:43:16.810]
Riley Joe. Oh boy, I'll tell you what a life. I just got my lunch order. Good thing I got

[02:43:16.810 --> 02:43:22.790]
a great sense of humor, you know. Text me, text mex, um, jalapeno, what the hell I think

[02:43:22.790 --> 02:43:29.670]
rules. Okay. What do you call those things? I thought you just called them crispy text mex

[02:43:29.670 --> 02:43:34.870]
rules and chicken Parmesan or as Mr. Ego would say chicken Parmesan with peppercorn

[02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:42.670]
cha. That's an interesting combination. Yeah. Well, he's an interesting guy, not 481 on your

[02:43:42.670 --> 02:43:48.330]
pull. I thought you were going to do it now. I'm not so sure. We're going to do it 485, 14 minutes,

[02:43:48.330 --> 02:43:53.390]
15 votes. They're going to do it. You load 16 votes and what do you get? I love that song,

[02:43:53.390 --> 02:44:00.890]
man. Tennessee, let's play it. It's a song coming up. Here's one from a subitiate. Can't stand

[02:44:00.890 --> 02:44:07.450]
Dan. This is a handle. Something Randy, Neil, what do you think of the Randy Moulershitch where he

[02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:13.730]
screams crazy lines from random move. Thank you for random movies that are fed to him by the

[02:44:13.730 --> 02:44:17.530]
labaster listeners when the Panther score, which is not often. I don't think of it because I don't

[02:44:17.530 --> 02:44:20.650]
hear it. I don't know about it. I don't care about it. How do you like that? Can't stand

[02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:24.970]
Dan. Can't stand the stupid email. What about labaster? All these other people in the market

[02:44:24.970 --> 02:44:32.250]
who desperate for me to like, you know, talk about them on a year. Croca crap. Croca

[02:44:32.250 --> 02:44:37.870]
something, man. Make no mistake about it. I'm going to have to order lunch here pretty

[02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:47.510]
soon. So I'll let you finish the show. Oh, what a panic. 485 vote. You still need to

[02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:51.290]
pay 15. That's not not making too much progress there, Mr. Hodgeot. You're watching

[02:44:51.290 --> 02:44:56.210]
me a whole bunch of it once 486. There is one. Eric's going to take his foot off the pedal.

[02:44:57.430 --> 02:45:06.290]
Yeah, sure. 486. You need 14. I'm almost willing to count this one down because this is going

[02:45:06.290 --> 02:45:09.990]
to be tight. It's going to be really tight. So you're getting another picture by the way

[02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:15.550]
from Madeline. Oh, no. I got it. I deleted that email. The previous one. Well, they're

[02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:20.060]
sending me web pictures. Some guy on the beach in a speed. Oh, now. Oh, great. I'm just

[02:45:20.060 --> 02:45:24.780]
getting random email. You know, web pictures like you know. So there is no Madeline. There

[02:45:24.780 --> 02:45:28.820]
is no person. Well, there is somebody in that picture with the big boobs. Yeah. Well,

[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:33.400]
you talk about a salt with a day and dangerous weapon. My God. Each one of those things

[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:38.200]
had a way at least a hundred pounds. Am I right? They had the run area codes. Each one

[02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:43.800]
of those boobs was like its own person. Oh, here's one from your friend Barry Macockner.

[02:45:44.620 --> 02:45:50.060]
Don't know if you heard, but so Tony. Tony Segredo's retiring. And then it says,

[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:56.180]
Recar. Nothing like feeding my material back to me. Barry. Hey, Barry, you fairy.

[02:45:57.740 --> 02:46:04.040]
I think of my name was Barry. I changed it. Like Barry Jackass. 487 on the

[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:09.820]
Chris's pole. It's not a good pool. Don't let me forget to change it later on this afternoon. 488.

[02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:14.600]
You got 12 minutes and 12 votes you need. You got a narrow down. You got the margin narrow down

[02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:20.380]
to a very precious view. You need 12 votes in 12 minutes. Nope. 10 votes. 10 votes in 12 minutes. Oh,

[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:25.560]
hallelujah. Happy day. Chris saves his job. All right. By the way, we're sorry. I'll listen,

[02:46:25.620 --> 02:46:29.480]
believe me profusely. Did I ever meet her? Did she come to the thing in Gulf Stream? No,

[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:34.540]
she hates clouds. Remember? Oh, I never met her, but she was always very nice to me into this show,

[02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:40.660]
which is a hard one. I didn't blow out 491. A real nice person. Very competent. Did a good job.

[02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:45.020]
Whatever she was doing. We only have a three minute break in his last break. Is that correct?

[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:51.860]
He's looking for. He's looking for. Well, there's so many units in there. You know, I mean,

[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:57.820]
we got too many units in our sales department. Remember, we had all the tens and the 15s and the five.

[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:02.800]
Let's start selling two second spots, two cents for a two second spot. Like playing a two-cent

[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:11.000]
machine at Hard Rock. What do you think? Sure. Madeline. I just said another picture. Well,

[02:47:11.140 --> 02:47:16.640]
by I think I'm going to block Madeline. Okay. Let me just block Madeline and then he can make up

[02:47:16.640 --> 02:47:22.860]
some other stupid name. That's right. It's the game. It's the game. It's the game. That's QAM. It's the

[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:33.160]
game. Tell us about the game. Tell us about the fight. How can that still be going on, by the way?

[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:39.380]
What? Boxing. Boxing and bullfighting. How can it be going on? Lots of barbarians. Now, maybe it's

[02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:45.500]
a bad comparison because at least the boxes are willing participants to agree. Right. Right. And the

[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:54.460]
bulls are not. How can those things still be going on? I think George said barbarians. That's what I

[02:47:54.460 --> 02:48:00.580]
said. I think you're right. Oh, and I almost never got to this story. Thank the Lord. We got time for

[02:48:00.580 --> 02:48:07.360]
this gay Bible angriest Christians. A gay version of the Bible in which God says it's better to be

[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:12.020]
gay than straight as to be published by an American film producer. How do you like that? It's better to be

[02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:17.500]
gay than straight. New Mexico based revision studios will publish the Princess Diana Bible. So

[02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:22.680]
name because of Dan is many good works. It says online at princess Diana Bible.com in spring 2009.

[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:27.880]
A preview of Genesis is already available in which instead of creating Adam and Eve, God creates

[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:35.600]
Ada and Eve. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Aida and she slept and he took

[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:38.600]
one of her ribs and closed up the flesh instead they were out in the rib which the Lord God had

[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:43.640]
taken from woman made he another woman and brought her under the first and Aida said this now

[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:47.860]
bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh will be called woman because she was taken out of me.

[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:52.220]
Therefore she'll a woman leave her mother and she'll cleave under her wife and they

[02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:55.260]
shall be one flesh and they were both naked. The woman and her wife and they were not ashamed.

[02:48:57.980 --> 02:49:03.460]
I bet she they didn't look like Madeline. The film studio said it would also adapt and

[02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:07.700]
direct the revised Bible as a two-part mini series. The gay Old Testament and the gay New Testament

[02:49:07.700 --> 02:49:12.280]
once it's completed. Good. There are many different versions of the Bible. I don't see why we

[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:15.840]
can't have one said Max Mitchell who directed the science fiction comedy Horror in the Wind

[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:20.700]
in which the newborn formula invented by two biogeneticists reverses the world's sexual orientation.

[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:28.360]
Everybody becomes gay. Even Stephen Strait. I got the idea from Princess Diana Bible from horror

[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:32.420]
in the wind he added after the world becomes gay religious people create the Princess Diana Bible

[02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:36.400]
which says that gay is right and straight as the sin then they burn all the King James Bibles.

[02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:41.620]
The movie has already provoked a upset among Christians which the blogger Douglas Howard

[02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:46.160]
idle chatersides describing it as inspired by a political agenda and one person to decide a

[02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:49.660]
concert not only the text but the very context of it to suit his own perspective.

[02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:54.980]
There was also criticism on Mitchell's Princess Diana Bible site. One commentator said the

[02:49:54.980 --> 02:49:59.420]
choice of title was very respectful disrespectful to the late Princess Diana. Just one more thing

[02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:05.960]
the linker to what main people believe is immoral. Sad very sad indeed it's a to which I say

[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:12.760]
screw Diana does anybody in this country care about Diana yeah they do fat shut-ins oh

[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:19.360]
fake baby Madeleine maybe Madeleine can maybe yeah maybe he does and I just dropped oh you know

[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:25.260]
that slot I told you about here on this board all on the floor oh okay so around my dilemma is

[02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:29.340]
what do I do first do I pick up all the crap off the floor or do I get on the phone order lunch

[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:51.600]
five hundred

[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:54.140]
down

[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:59.120]
about a girl called Cifullet So

[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:04.540]
had a bug and ran it around

[02:51:04.540 --> 02:51:11.260]
gave it to every guy in town

[02:51:11.260 --> 02:51:16.500]
Hey hey, I'm a little old

[02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:20.800]
Oh, hey hey, I'm a little old

[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:26.820]
I'm a little old, I'm a little old

[02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:33.840]
Oh, hey hey, I'm a little old

[02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:36.720]
I'm a little old, I shouldn't notice

[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:38.100]
on this bottom of the lid

[02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:41.040]
I end up with a urine erasure

[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:44.400]
A bottle of old always be with you

[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:47.040]
So stay away from a Cifullet suit

[02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:50.280]
It took a close I should have seen on my sides

[02:51:50.280 --> 02:51:52.960]
No defense of a friend of mine

[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:55.880]
You got it back to now I've got it too

[02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:58.840]
So keep away from a Cifullet suit

[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:02.800]
Hey hey, keep away from that girl

[02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:06.020]
Hope that the Cifullet will do now

[02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:08.560]
Keep away from suit

[02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:12.800]
She likes to sleep around

[02:52:12.800 --> 02:52:15.980]
Yeah, even did it with my back at home

[02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:18.760]
We didn't think I'd know to call

[02:52:19.940 --> 02:52:22.500]
Now I'm afraid of falling on

[02:52:22.500 --> 02:52:23.980]
Here's the moral of the story

[02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:25.380]
From a guy who knows

[02:52:26.020 --> 02:52:28.580]
Use to have the holds where this fungus grows

[02:52:28.580 --> 02:52:31.380]
And scared he pulled out the chieftain's nose

[02:52:31.380 --> 02:52:34.300]
A keep away from a Cifullet suit

[02:52:34.300 --> 02:52:38.420]
Yeah, keep away from that girl

[02:52:38.420 --> 02:52:41.220]
I don't know why I've been doing that

[02:52:41.220 --> 02:52:42.300]
Bye bye bye

[02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:45.380]
The biggest names, the best call it
