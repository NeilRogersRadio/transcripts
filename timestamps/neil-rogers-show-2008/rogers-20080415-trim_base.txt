[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.780]
So how's Eric Komorod doing?

[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.700]
Who?

[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.020]
Some stiff.

[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.260]
The biggest names, the best talent.

[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.940]
You're listening to Sports Radio 560 WQAM.

[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.320]
Miami For The Latter Day.

[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.480]
O!

[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.580]

do not represent those of the WQAM management staff or sponsors.

[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460]
Now the Neil Rogers Show on 560 WQAM.

[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.740]
Floridians, dumb as dirt.

[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.740]
Absolutely.

[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.780]
Oh, don't don't don't don't.

[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.180]
The restroom smells like roses after I am done.

[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.440]
Eric.

[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.760]
Can't understand why everybody makes fun.

[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.580]
The restroom smells like roses.

[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.860]
You need to see them okay.

[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.340]
But I might be the only one who uses the restroom today.

[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.920]
You're fairie.

[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.220]
I was only in there for a few minutes.

[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.960]
But third man, I always bring the light song and I am bruised.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200]
But now the world has out that I did it.

[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.200]
I guess I'll have to find somewhere else.

[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.400]
Now I'll have to hold it in and hike my head in this grace.

[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.160]
When I get my hair done, who spreads those rumors,

[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.320]
I'll fashion his face.

[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.860]
Cause the restroom smells like roses.

[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.220]
Whenever I am through, it smells okay to me.

[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.340]
When I do do.

[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.400]
Oh sure, it smells okay to you just like when you fart.

[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.720]
It smells fine to you but everybody else is like,

[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.060]
Oh my god, you died in there.

[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.260]
I discovered an exception to that rule.

[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.200]
And what is it?

[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.360]
When you're sick, the sick fart smells completely different.

[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.200]
It's horrible.

[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.980]
Yeah, you can't get away from them fast enough.

[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.000]
They follow you.

[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.620]
Oh yeah.

[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.740]
Anyway, George is back with us today.

[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.280]
He was sick as a dog and he'll think about it if you want to do.

[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.060]
Or not.

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.020]
Even if you don't.

[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.660]
Then we got Zach with us today because Chris is back with his teeth again.

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.140]
He's getting posts put in and all kinds of crap.

[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.420]
So he's getting crap in his mouth.

[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.120]
So we got Zach, Zach in there yet or is he smart?

[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.020]
He's right there.

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.200]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.840]
I thought maybe he was on the post game show.

[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.240]
Now we took out the post show today.

[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.600]
I thought this was the post game show.

[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.380]
This is the post.

[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.320]
And you'll be very disturbed to find out that I didn't get a call yesterday from your close personal friend Jerks.

[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.640]
Oh, you were expecting one.

[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.380]
No, he was here yesterday and the raptors just pounded the crap out of it.

[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.000]
He is usual.

[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.920]
I don't think they worked up a sweat.

[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.560]
I don't believe.

[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.740]
But anyway, so he was here and was suggested to me by somebody, maybe Chris.

[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.200]
Most of him in Chris because there wasn't anybody else working yesterday.

[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.440]
I was suggested that maybe he was going to call me and we could like hook up and have dinner or he could buy me like a, you know, something.

[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.240]
Didn't happen.

[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.040]
You could bond.

[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.880]
You could go to what, you know, I don't want to bond.

[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.320]
I want to see him.

[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.420]
I don't want to laugh at him.

[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.640]
I don't want to smell him.

[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.080]
I don't want to be near him.

[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.480]
Okay.

[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.800]
I don't want to hear the bond goes.

[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.360]
I don't want to hear the, what is he called?

[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.100]
The pole.

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.240]
The log.

[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.120]
The log.

[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.660]
That's it.

[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.540]
I don't want to hear the log.

[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.920]
Zach.

[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.360]
Oh my God.

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.460]
And what, so what's going to happen with that show now that the season is going to be over and over?

[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.840]
Was that their last game's, Zach or what?

[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.640]
No, one more tomorrow night I believe.

[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.320]
One more and then the debacle of all time is going to be over.

[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.320]
And then what are they going to do?

[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.380]
Where is the log?

[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.860]
Maybe we can recap all the other games from the season.

[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.800]
Right, and he got the mind of he draft coming up soon.

[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.940]
They're going to probably have the number one, two or three pick in the draft.

[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.520]
Yeah, who cares?

[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.060]
Who gives a flying crap?

[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.200]
And when's the NFL draft?

[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.560]
The week from Saturday.

[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.740]
It's got to be very soon.

[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.760]
Oh my God.

[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.700]
The pressure is building.

[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.200]
Man, that's what I was smelling.

[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.860]
The pressure from the NFL draft coming.

[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:56.020]
I don't notice quite as much, of course, I don't listen, but I just don't feel the usual hysteria that we have the anticipation of the NFL draft every year.

[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.440]
Like builds up on this station for days and weeks and months.

[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.700]
Oh, oh, oh, and especially now that all things are going to have this number one pick, right?

[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.480]
Yes.

[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.500]
See, if it's a sport thing, you're like talking to me.

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.320]
As it is, I know you don't have any voice.

[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.100]
And because you're going to raise your blades, but what is it that you sound like you're so far like on the moon?

[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.960]
I just turned the volume up a little.

[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.280]
There you go.

[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.620]
He was crank it up, open that pot up, and crank it up, and make the needle move a little bit.

[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.660]
How's that?

[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.800]
So we can hear you for Christ's six.

[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.540]
Jesus, God Almighty.

[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.160]
Anyway, George is back, like I said, and I don't need...

[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.480]
Let me just say this to you, okay?

[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.640]
I'm talking to the audience.

[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.980]
And this includes, especially, the chronics like Charlie B.

[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.880]
I don't need any life advice.

[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.700]
Okay?

[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.040]
I don't need dear Abby to tell me how to live my life, how to negotiate a contract, what I should do, the things I...

[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.820]
Playing Farts, demand to be able to play fart sounds out of here.

[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.040]
I mean, seriously, you're really wondering.

[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.940]
And this is a guy who will suit a win-electual Charlie B.

[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.020]
Who thinks he's smarter than anybody in the world.

[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.820]
He's a real expert.

[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.340]
And he's just another Peep-Hot.

[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.500]
He's just another one of these goofballs out there.

[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.500]
Well, hold their feet to the fire and make them allow you to play the fart sounds, and four letter words.

[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.740]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.060]
And then I got the one up there in Connecticut who's obsessed with Randy, with the goddess.

[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.380]
Oh, well, she said this, and she...

[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.960]
So I sent him finally another cross-example message today, and I said, Anthony, what part of...

[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.380]
I don't give a crap about Randy, don't you understand. What part of that don't you get?

[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.000]
I'm not interested.

[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.840]
Maybe they don't speak that language of the era.

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.260]
Oh.

[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.780]
Say it in.

[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.380]
God!

[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.640]
Here's the poll from yesterday.

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.400]
There he goes with those polls again.

[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.160]
And Tom Jicke called him up to me a message yesterday, but he's gonna be writing something in the Sun's Scent.

[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.900]
I don't know if that'd be nice, because he saw very Jack asked for it in the hero.

[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.480]
And the reason Tom didn't know anything about it is because Joe Bell didn't call him obviously, because they hate each other like poison.

[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.660]
And they would have been slamming the phone down each other's ear.

[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.180]
And that's sad?

[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.220]
Yes.

[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.080]
I don't know if it's sad.

[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.740]
Now why did Zack immediately chime in there?

[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.480]
I guess he felt froggy right then.

[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.680]
Baw!

[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.900]
If I could... I got a nice, uh, uh, my space from the beast by the way, two of them.

[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.320]
He's not too happy with your boy, Zack. Let me tell you that right now.

[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.900]
I know.

[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.220]
You're not too happy with him at all.

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.720]
Pretty pissed off and fired up.

[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.860]
But that's another story for another day.

[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.940]
1035 votes in yesterday's poll if I could relive one hour of my life it would be.

[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:37.980]
And of course leave it to me to add on the one that won by a... a grand slide, which is the poll sender, which we appreciate the poll.

[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.100]
It's a good poll, but let's off the obvious one.

[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.560]
My favorite sexual experience.

[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.640]
493.

[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.320]
47.6% almost half of yous said that, of course.

[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.540]
The last hour I spent with my father or mother how touching 171.

[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.820]
Bye, ma!

[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.040]
An exonification I was on 87 when my first child was born 86 when I first met my spouse 72.

[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.160]
The last time I was with my best friend 43 when I graduated high school or college 28 when I told my ex,

[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.680]
we're through 19.

[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:16.460]
My wedding day 17 when I quit the job I hated most 12 and my wedding night,

[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:23.320]
so I went to see at the only 7 for their wedding night which was probably anti-climactic or maybe disappointing.

[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.960]
Especially for some of the women.

[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.440]
Disappointing.

[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.340]
You know the women who say things like, I'll find it, I'll eventually find it.

[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.760]
You call that a penis?

[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.360]
Like that.

[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.700]
Here's today's poll, which boy, this is too bad I didn't put it on there earlier.

[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.120]
We'd already have 4,000 votes.

[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.160]
This is going to get a lot of votes.

[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.300]
Because they love to be able to tell me how to do the show.

[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.200]
They love to feel that they're like manipulating and sharing their expertise because they're all experts.

[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.280]
They're all program directors, they're all broadcasts.

[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.680]
They're all talk show mavens.

[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.420]
Like all the comments on the very jackass straighter and the hero.

[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.660]
Some nice ones, you know, and of course the usual crap.

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.760]
All he does is read from the newspaper.

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.040]
He's boring.

[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.540]
Ice cream talking about ice cream is boring.

[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.800]
And of course all of these people are all listening right now.

[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.000]

[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.400]
They're all listening right now.

[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.020]
Like I was saying yesterday, all the people who write these comments.

[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.220]
Good ones and bad ones.

[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.740]
Have one thing in common.

[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.380]
I have no life.

[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:20.820]
That's it.

[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.420]
People that find somebody else's article and then they have to write a comment.

[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.760]
It's like the same people who are in the chat rooms.

[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.680]
The internet can be a wonderful thing.

[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.400]
The problem is most of the time it's not.

[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.640]
I wish Neil would blank.

[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.240]
That's the poll today.

[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.240]
502 votes.

[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.400]
Change nothing 175.

[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.180]
Other than my boxers shorts, I do change those every day.

[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.500]
That's good.

[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.700]
Color you got today.

[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.120]
Red.

[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.060]

[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.960]
Red and you know, like checker.

[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.060]
Like a plant, you know.

[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.940]
Pretty paint plant.

[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.300]
I only got two kinds.

[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.580]
I got blue plant and red plant.

[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.740]
Got big plants right after the show.

[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:53.980]
Do you?

[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:55.920]
Yeah, would buy.

[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.140]
No, actually I was going to fill up my boxers shorts with.

[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.300]
I know.

[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.500]
Doody.

[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.120]
Change nothing 180.

[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.260]
Live forever 146.

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.000]
Wasn't that sweet.

[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.680]
Wasn't that nice.

[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.280]
They must have had it.

[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.260]
Take calls 141.

[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.420]
We can talk about that again or not as the case may be.

[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.380]
Oh God.

[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.140]
They just don't get it.

[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.440]
They just don't understand it.

[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.940]
We did that yesterday for about five minutes.

[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.260]
Did you hear that by chance, Zach?

[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.920]
I'm sure you didn't.

[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.420]
I did.

[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.340]
You did?

[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.120]
Yeah, I listened to your show daily.

[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.160]
Dad, I don't start sucking around.

[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.500]
I just asked you a simple question.

[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.840]
Did you hear that you're a horrible call?

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.620]
And Woody Graber was the best call.

[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.480]
The only real call.

[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.540]
The other ones were just...

[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:36.560]
That was probably an accident.

[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.160]
Yeah.

[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.600]
That was not something.

[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.020]
And I didn't want to talk to him anyway.

[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.360]
I mean, he's a nice guy but he never has anything to say.

[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.640]
But he just...

[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.240]
That was it.

[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.740]
And the rest of them were just people making sounds, making sounds with their mouth.

[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.580]
Take calls 141.

[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.020]
Stop reading stories 25.

[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.860]
Well, that's amazing that it's so small.

[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.080]
All of you 4.8% to stop reading the stories.

[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:02.860]
Retire!

[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:03.560]
13.

[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.740]
And croak only six.

[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.640]
See, I put on good stuff, bad stuff.

[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.560]
Give me a choice.

[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.740]
Croak only six.

[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.620]
That's not very good.

[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.780]
We wish you would die.

[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.360]
We hate you like poison.

[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.520]
32 years.

[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.460]
We hate you.

[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.740]
We can't stomach you.

[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.340]
That's why we're listening right now.

[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.980]
Plus, of course, footsie is on, which were more hostile comments about footsie on that

[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.060]
very jackass thing than comments about me.

[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.440]
The article was about me and yet all these people are right about all the footsie is the worst and tootsie.

[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.280]
And George has always given me crap because I talk about that on the air.

[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.120]
You're his one fan, man.

[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:37.620]
I wasn't even.

[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.220]
You know what's up with him?

[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.860]
Not his fan.

[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.660]
I think he's disgraceful on a joke.

[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.580]
Like, given you crap, I'm just pointing out.

[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.620]
You're the only one to talk about.

[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.560]
So, you can tell all these wannabe.

[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.900]
Everybody's a talk show host.

[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.940]
Everybody's entertaining.

[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.040]
You're a bull crap.

[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.120]
We heard from his partner on this stage.

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.560]
You can hear how entertaining he was.

[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.900]
The Kenny and Bull Morning Blow.

[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.900]
That was the worst morning show in radio history.

[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.900]
Is there any argument about that?

[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.180]
I'm thinking.

[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.360]
I'm trying to think what's worse.

[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.120]
I'll get back to you.

[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.360]
If Joey Reynolds was on with the chic doing the morning show, it would have to be better.

[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:10.980]
Oh my god.

[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.520]
Then the Kenny and Bull Morning show.

[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.520]
There's a combo.

[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.060]
If Depa was on, it would just gild it.

[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.140]
It would have to be better than the Kenny and Bull Morning blow.

[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.700]
Square table, gay or not gay.

[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.140]
It was contrived.

[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.200]
It's one thing if it's contrived and it's good.

[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.500]
If it's entertaining, if it's funny, if it's somewhat amusing.

[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.200]
It was contrived and it sucked.

[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.840]
It was radio cock-a-man.

[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.220]
You could smell it coming through the speaker of your radio.

[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.800]
That's how bad that show was.

[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.040]
It was radio crap.

[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.160]
But, everybody's an expert.

[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.040]
Now, let's see what we got today.

[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.440]
We got to jerk show from 2 to 4.

[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.100]
Now, see back in town, how are what, Zach?

[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.440]
I believe he is.

[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.620]
Is it a home game tomorrow night?

[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.800]
Well, what about how do you get back from Toronto so fast?

[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.440]
Airplane, I believe.

[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.660]
Oh my god.

[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.940]
Mad Dog 4 to 6.50.

[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.280]
And then 6.50 to 7.

[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.600]
We got the biggest scan going on.

[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.600]
We got a 10 minute show there.

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.200]
Jesse Angler first pitch Marlon pregame report with a bunch of spots.

[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.640]
Then the Marlon game is on across the street because we shouldn't want to do with it.

[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.040]
Dolphins all assets from 7 to 9 and then the D.A. show 9 and midnight.

[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.820]
Unfortunately for him has to follow that thing.

[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.660]
Air every night.

[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.740]
Oh my god.

[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.400]
Poor child.

[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.320]
I just had.

[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.060]
Absolutely.

[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.280]
Yes.

[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.420]
You're fairies.

[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.320]
There is all around me.

[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.240]
Everybody is broke.

[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.380]
The economy is drowning.

[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.420]
They got us by the throne.

[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.380]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:48.380]

[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:48.380]

[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:55.400]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:55.560]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:55.560]

[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:55.560]

[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:56.620]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.060]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.440]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.080]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.440]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.360]
I'd like to do some drama.

[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.360]
To the one percent.

[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.940]
It does fall.

[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.380]
And Memphis were dead.

[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.080]
Could this be a recession?

[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.660]
The headlights are oily and used.

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.400]
There's people going hungry.

[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.640]
You won't see that on the news.

[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.640]
It's like the 1930s.

[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.580]
Another great sub-grad.

[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.660]
I'm dying on the hearth.

[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.880]
We're just a rich and dirty.

[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.120]
In a portrait by gas.

[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.400]
The corporate newspapers say it will end.

[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.960]
The ones that I use for the sheets are my name.

[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.600]
You're paid for not to be left in the throne.

[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.920]
They've got us blind.

[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.280]
Now we've got us cold.

[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.120]
We're in a deep depression.

[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.260]
But they don't want you to know.

[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.440]
For the world's richest country.

[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.680]
It's the pressure in the throne.

[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.160]
Yeah, time's up, baby.

[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.300]
Twenty past ten at 560 WQM.

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.600]
That's why we should all kiss the ground if we're still employed.

[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.540]
And George is hoping to still be employed.

[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.680]
He's got a big meaning coming up with Jolly Joe.

[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.340]
Hopefully.

[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.240]
Right.

[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.680]
You said it down and you pointed finger with his face.

[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.120]
Newtell.

[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.620]
Listen, man.

[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.500]
I got mountains to feed.

[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.700]
I got a household to maintain while I'm screwing around on the side.

[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.280]
I got that roller of Derby.

[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.040]
I got to keep poaching me around with whatever you need.

[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.180]
They don't cost me money.

[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.380]
Well, don't lie about it.

[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:17.880]
Okay.

[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.960]
Tell them to cost me a fortune to sustain that cramp.

[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.020]
I'll take them out and show them a good sign.

[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.860]
That usually works, right?

[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.020]

[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.060]
And that's how you lose the boss.

[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.720]
No, it works with Bob Greenfield, isn't it?

[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:28.300]
Not.

[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.620]
Butch out a little bit, okay?

[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.460]
Because Norrmacher and Conair, he hates you like poison now.

[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.120]
All right, gee.

[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.080]
He didn't say that, but I just hit that finger.

[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.900]
Obviously, yeah.

[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.180]
That's all right.

[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.060]
Because when you offer that queen money and he turns it down for any of that, it's okay.

[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.460]
Said, I'm not interested.

[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:44.860]
No.

[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.880]
Tell George, no.

[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.240]
Thanks for both things.

[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:48.800]
That's fine.

[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.420]
That means bye-bye.

[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.420]
I got you kissed him off with that Jan Marigay.

[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.340]
You went to chicken egg.

[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.800]
That's fine.

[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.200]
I was chicken egg, okay.

[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.300]
I think he's taking care of.

[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.660]
I think he's okay.

[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.080]
I don't know.

[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.240]
I've been out of sorts for the past few days, as you know.

[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.100]
Yeah.

[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.080]
Under the weather.

[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.500]
Well, when you have your next lunch with him, find out, pan him on the head and see if he

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.040]
starts sweating.

[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.440]
I'll take his temperature.

[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.200]
You ought to be just fine, okay?

[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.400]
This is, see, people think I just show up here in the mail in the radio show every day.

[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.500]
I do that, but beside that, I got to take care of everybody in the world.

[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.640]
I got all these dependents.

[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.200]
I got to take care of this one and that one.

[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.800]
And I got to make sure this one's eating and that one's farting and whatever.

[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.040]
A lot of responsibility for an old fart like me.

[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.360]
I'm the oldest delivery man in Toronto, by the way.

[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.020]
Yeah.

[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.540]
Are the tips good?

[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.540]
You know, no.

[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.960]
No, I don't get any tips.

[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.960]
550, seven votes on the poll.

[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.320]
I wish Neil would change nothing to a one.

[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.060]
Live forever, 154.

[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.300]
Take calls, 150.

[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.740]
26.9%.

[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.140]
Want us to take calls.

[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.800]
Stop reading stories, 28.

[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.700]
No, no chance.

[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.240]
Retire, 15 and croak, 9 now.

[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.660]
We're up to 9 on the croak.

[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.860]
We can take some calls today because George can punch them up there.

[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.700]
I can't do it here because I'm waiting for the engineer to show up tomorrow morning.

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.420]
He's going to see if we need a new router in here or if he wants to see what the deal is.

[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:09.240]
Whatever you want.

[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]
I just don't want to take a chance.

[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.280]
Are we hooking that up because I don't want to lose my internet.

[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.940]
No, I understand.

[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.320]
So once the delay catch is up, they realize we're going to give it a test run here again for like we did yesterday.

[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.760]
And we'll see it like you said before the show today and you said it perfectly.

[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.300]
There are no, but we would take calls if there were any.

[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.620]
Love to have some call.

[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.040]
I'm not talking about the lights lighting.

[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.480]
That's not a call.

[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.720]
A call is somebody going to hear.

[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.260]
He's actually has something to say.

[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.300]
He's already ringing the phone.

[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.440]
You see how do you know?

[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.660]
Oh, you can smell it?

[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:36.960]
Yeah.

[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:37.440]
Yeah.

[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.660]
You want to hear it?

[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.720]
Go ahead.

[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.280]
Q.A.M.

[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.680]
Hello, this is a courtesy care notice to inform you that the vehicle you are driving will soon meet the deadline.

[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:48.780]
Hello, okay, great.

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:50.400]
Oh, great.

[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.880]
Glad I was wrong.

[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.340]
I wonder how did that come from.

[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.820]
How do you do that?

[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.640]
It's obviously one of those telemarketer things, but we just got lucky.

[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.380]
So in other words, that was just a coincidence?

[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.000]
Yeah.

[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:04.940]
A coincidence.

[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:06.800]
Wow.

[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.240]
Are the lines ringing?

[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:08.700]
Never would.

[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.580]
I got a couple.

[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:11.540]
56670560.

[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:12.820]
Pound 560.

[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.120]
We're here to serve, baby, and you people, a third of the people almost want calls.

[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.220]
We'd like to, you know something?

[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.100]
I would like to take this whole pile of stuff.

[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.900]
I have my usual huge pile of them.

[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.040]
I think are pretty interesting and important stories.

[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.140]
I'd like to take it and throw it right in the garbage.

[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.180]
And go back to doing a show that we used to do here.

[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.960]
I mean, you know, I used to have like two or three of these I would bring in every day as I recall.

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.820]
Remember?

[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.240]
Right.

[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:41.160]
I have two or three stories that were things that were really important or well written or, you know, the, or historically fine, whatever they were.

[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.180]
And I got a huge pile because there are no calls.

[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.420]
Okay, we got some.

[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.960]
We got some, you think.

[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.000]
Yeah, well, the way I'm, hello.

[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.360]
Start, start, punchin.

[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.600]
Hello.

[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.560]
Uncle Neil.

[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.420]
Riga!

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.320]
QA and hello.

[00:19:59.320 --> 00:19:59.780]
Hello.

[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:00.620]
Yes.

[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.160]
Mr. Goneal.

[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:02.860]
Speaking.

[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:04.420]
Hello, sir.

[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.060]
Good.

[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.760]
How are you, sir?

[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.000]
I'm hard-tied.

[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.380]
I didn't recognize your voice.

[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.560]
Yeah, well, it's me.

[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.040]
Listen, quick stories.

[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:11.940]
You're gonna love this.

[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.560]
Yeah, um, I'm just gettin' over, um, my dad passed away recently.

[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.280]
So, as a nice Jewish boy, you know, you don't shave for a little bit.

[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.860]
I go yesterday to get a shave.

[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.700]
I'm sittin' there, you there?

[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:25.660]
Yeah, I'm here.

[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.100]
I'm sittin' there.

[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.240]
And, you know, Barbara's shaming me and in the background, there are these two Altecokers.

[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.440]
And the one says to the other.

[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.660]
You know, you ever hear that Neil Rogers on the radio?

[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.100]
I couldn't, I couldn't believe it because I hear you always talkin' about it and gretchen.

[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:42.800]
Yeah.

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:50.120]
And once he is such an SOB, the things that come out of his mouth, listen, I've been to this place

[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.440]
like three times in my lifetime to get shaved.

[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.820]
And I just, I'm like, I couldn't believe it.

[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.860]
It was the funniest thing.

[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.040]
Wait, where is this?

[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.800]
What part of town?

[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:04.180]
I live in North Miami, just was in North Miami on the corner of like, uh, North Miami.

[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.700]
This game in honor of 25th.

[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.140]
Oh, yeah, well, hubman dread.

[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.560]
Neil, I'm sittin' there.

[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.600]
It was just so fricken funny.

[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.380]
I couldn't, I gotta call Neil, I gotta tell him.

[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.600]
Well, thanks, thanks for the good news until the feeling is mutual.

[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.060]
Thanks, Pally.

[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.780]
I dropped it on.

[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.480]
Yeah.

[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.160]
I mean, it sounded like you were done, so, you know.

[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.340]
Well, and then he gets to hear, thanks, Pally, at least.

[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:29.780]
That's right.

[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.140]
Because I gotta rely on your finger now and I don't trust your finger.

[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.600]
I'm not trying to get my psychic powers.

[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:36.640]

I need to listen to her to be informed. Is that what you're telling me?

[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.600]
I'm entertained. She is a what she is is basically a ripoff artist and not a very good one, okay?

[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.680]
Who's she ripping off now? She's been ripping off me for a year

[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.220]
She even used the the droppings for Christ's sake. That's because she loves you

[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.980]
I wish you're all the luck in the world for the imputed money that she's making but the fact that a matter is she's

[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.380]
You know, let's see last year admitted he was a ripoff

[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.720]
As opposed to just getting sued all the time and getting you know opening up a big New York mouth

[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.740]
I just don't go for the whole New York thing. It's just

[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.760]
She's the expert on everything. She's

[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.000]

[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.300]
Be a lot better if I could actually punch you something

[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.960]
Maybe during the break what I should do is try to re-hook up the

Not a good idea. I was gonna say, you know, I mean it'll be for interesting radio

[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.580]
You crawling around on the floor and losing the internet and all that stuff. It'll be funny

[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.940]
I'm not losing the internet again if I have to go from that song in advance with the bell simpantico that I think that one good news

[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.060]
The good news that you don't have any hair to pull out so yeah

[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.520]
No, I don't want to go through all of that. Yeah, Zach. Yeah, Chris was right yesterday

[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.900]
If he's right that the router is on its way out and it's not gonna help anyway

[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.940]
I think the best plan is what you're gonna do wait for that engineer to show up in real year down in five tomorrow morning

[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.900]
We route you

[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.040]

[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.980]

Hey, listen, I wanted to thank you and Georgia you guys been talking a lot about going to Gulf Stream

[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.220]
So I packed up the family left out of him went down there and we're definitely enjoyable

[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.260]
Good you win any money. Yeah, I hit the in the sixth race. I hit the one seven exactly

[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.700]
I'm about 120 so all right. All right. Excellent

[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.460]
All right, then okay good work

[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:15.400]
Yeah, Georgia's having a blast fact. I think that's gonna be his new deal when he has his lunch with Jolly Joe is that they're gonna

[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.800]
Gonna give him 500 a week gambling money in Gulfstream. I'll take it. They'll give you vouchers

[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.540]
They won't actually give it the cash. So just give you vouchers. I'll be the other machines. I'll be the spokesperson

[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:30.560]
Pit the spokesman by the way the spokesman is 0 and 3 they lost again last night the poor spokesman B.M

[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.440]
Boy, that's here makes me happy. I have no interest reading any of these teams left in the NHL playoffs

[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:43.240]
But nevertheless, it's not important that your team win, but that B.M. loses the spokesman what a loser may just see it written all over his dumb

[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:43.640]
Puss

[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.740]
While the senators ain't doing so good the spokesman's having real problems are gonna get swept

[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.800]
I think they're gonna get swept in the series

[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.880]
Be careful while you're talking like that. Why don't say so I don't worry about it. I got everything under control

[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.360]
Okay, get all pants. I'm pretty good to me today. I sound almost human

[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.880]
Okay, I got one finger on the phone button

[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.280]
Where's the other dog butt tells me when I put on some real clothes?

[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.140]

Anything to try to get me to look like an old fool, you know, that's okay

[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.920]
I don't care. It's like the one with Mark Fisher and the tears coming down the eyes with a glisser in all that stuff

[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.980]
That's a herald for you

[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.300]

Today we salute you Mr. Skin type speed awareness

[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:05.420]
Yes, we're sure that swimsuit style is all the rage on the beaches of Bulgaria

[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:11.560]
But here in North America we prefer to keep our private parts private

[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.240]
Would you really

[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:24.700]
Thank you, Mr. Skin type speed awareness, but when you come out of the surf you will learn the rest of us beach goers as to just how rigid the water is

[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.060]
Why would you want to accentuate shrinkage?

[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.780]
Your tacky drunk skull by many names, but I'm a hammock grapes mugler

[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:44.440]
The pito tube and man sock, but they all equally display the inadequacy zone

[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.340]
Mr. Skin type speed aware a real American hero

[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.880]

Which is not bad. I didn't read it says hope George is feeling better. Thanks to you in Georgia the remote at Gulfstream

[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:13.520]
I was able to catch the ass end of the show and your picks for the first two races

[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.000]
Which I don't know what the big deal is with that was a what was it an eight dollar double six dollar levels whatever we cashed

[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.260]
Yeah, walked away with money was heavy chalk. We never let one like 31 bucks 31

[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.920]
Then Sean says I'm not gonna say I had a bad day at the track

[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.340]
But before the holy bullstakes they paused for the grand opening of the Sean and drawer at Gulfstream

[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.720]
I've been on a horse attend to one he didn't finish until a quarter after three

[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:47.640]
So ancient so old Sean older than Mathusa's great grandpa and so that old so maybe he thought it was new

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.200]
Speaking of all the Pope oh, yeah

[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.320]
I think we ashamed

[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.580]
He ought to be why by that by the clothes

[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.960]
About those schmatzas that he's wearing no, what else he said there's no fact in the church

[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.220]
Pope Benedict the 16 the Nazi Pope said he was deeply ashamed of the clergy sexual abuse scandal that

[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.340]
Stained the Catholic Church and will work to make sure pedophiles don't become priest. It's stained the Catholic Church

[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.200]
Yeah, I'm really wise. Stained that blue dress right

[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.300]
Probably stained some of the priests frocks and

[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.020]
Fired tuck

[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.660]
Benedict was answering questions. I was submitted advanced by reporters aboard a special

[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:33.900]
Allotalia airliner as he was flying from Roarland to Washington to begin his first papal pilgrimage to the USA

[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.740]
I want to think about special toilets on that plane the papal toilet on allotalia

[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.640]
It's a great suffering for the church in the US and for the church in general and for me personally that this could happen

[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:50.800]
But it said it's difficult for me to understand how it was possible that be priest be tray in this way their mission of these children

[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.000]
Right, he can't understand it somebody better draw a picture. Okay?

[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.500]
I'm deeply ashamed will do as possible so this can't happen again in the future the Pope said right

[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.040]
It'll never happen again until what time is it now?

[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.640]
Benedict pleads that pedophiles wouldn't be priest in the Roman Catholic Church

[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.820]
We will absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry that in a sense speaking in English

[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:16.300]
It is more important that good priest than many priests when you better close up shop them

[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.120]
We will do everything possible to heal this wound. He said

[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:28.720]
Benedict's pilgrimage was the first trip by a pope to the US since the sex abuse scandal or rocked US dioceses in the early 2000 and

[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:36.540]
2000s and triggered in lawsuits that across the church hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements people are starving all over the world

[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.560]
We have famine. They're they're cooking up a donkey in Egypt

[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.020]
They're eating less cookies in Haiti. What?

[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.440]
Mud cookies and Haiti that eating mud cookies and Haiti. They're eating donkeys and monkeys in Egypt and

[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:54.780]
This bastard is running around the world. Oh, we're so sorry. It'll never happen again hundreds of millions just to pay off the families to shut them up

[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.320]
To pay off the victims of this pervert church

[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:06.340]
So all it is is a pedophile bunch of crap and of course a tax-free attacks exempt corrupt the business

[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:12.140]
How's that Vatican banking scandal coming? I still say you ought to watch Godfather three again just for all time sake. Oh

[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.700]
Come on, you know, you know I tried a couple times to watch you and I hear you

[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:22.720]
I did try I did try it. It would be like me watching at the movie that the professor sent me that the anime thing

[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.840]
It's still sitting there near the room somewhere. I animate for you. I don't think no

[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:33.600]
And probably your Godfather three ain't for you. What I thought for anybody

[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:40.680]
Now what's that movie that I like with Steven straight the covenant? They're covenant very good. What a memory. That's for you

[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:42.680]
I

[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.420]
Saw plenty an envelope that was for me believe you me here's Jonathan implantation to the chronic factor now

[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.760]
Says hope all as well with you. I got news for Jonathan things are just sensational

[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.580]
I've been a week ago today last Tuesday was my super neurotic day, remember that

[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:02.560]
Mm-hmm and today it was just one week later things are so good. It's beyond believe everything is coming up

[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.400]
Roses I can smell it. It says how about I wish Neil would have signed with another radio station

[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.340]
Well, that is that's like in the past and it's a mood point

[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:17.000]
Neil will probably hate this and not want to add to the pool in which my case my voters live forever

[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.700]
Okay, we'll vote for you later, Jonathan

[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.060]
What I'll add that vote for him. You are gonna put it on there. No, no

[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:30.540]
See oh another was just a theoretical vote. Yeah, okay. We have it our mind Jonathan your vote is hanging there in outer space

[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.780]
There you go. There it is. It's right

[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.940]
I can smell it

[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:40.520]
627 on Zaxful you better hurry up and get to 800. I'm telling you right now if you want to get to a thousand

[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.560]
We're gonna get it first. You got to get to 700 and you got to 800

[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.260]
You're not gonna do it no chance and especially on a controversial poll like this

[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:52.000]
We'll take more calls in the next hour, but I want to start I want to like mix and match you know, I mean

[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:58.320]
Might as well. I don't I don't want to put too much pressure on these poor bastards because after all it's been a long time

[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.560]
Yesterday we had a little bit of a flurry there. It was bad really bad today so far. I would say not so bad

[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:05.660]
And

[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.480]
Amar the engineer gets out. I don't think he's gonna be able to get it working tomorrow

[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.780]
Although I could be wrong. Maybe it's not the router that's maybe there's nothing wrong with it

[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:19.500]
So if he just looks it all up and it works fine then we don't need the new router because he's not gonna come here with a new router, right?

[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:20.960]
I don't know

[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.100]
Now if the engineers down there were like on top. I see I don't know what they've told him because he's good. He's like a real engineer

[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:33.240]
Mm-hmm. He actually knows what he's doing and actually cares about doing a good job

[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:38.720]
You know things like that. I want to say something good about fix it. Yeah, it had this. Wow. Yeah, well

[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.160]
Had that you know the DCS monitor in here was like really blurry

[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:48.600]
Like it'll make it go crazy trying to focus it because it was not able to focus and he mixed it. It's clear as a bell

[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.420]
No, yeah, he fixed it because they thought I was coming back right well

[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.260]
Who's to show you how I had a town?

[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.420]
That goes to show you how much sway you got there

[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.240]
It got the way back George right

[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.440]
They thought I was coming back and doing shows there so all of a sudden stuff that's been just falling apart and looking like garbage for

[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:11.520]
Months and years. Oh, yeah, we're gonna get that all cleaned up there because the old man's gonna be here. He won't put up with that crap

[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.160]
Just like all of a sudden the salespeople are starting to sniff around now

[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.340]
How do you like that? We had two salespeople in there? Well one and Todd Dreck

[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.320]
We had to slow him. This is a real salesperson

[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.600]
Yeah, and we had Todd Dreck who continues pretending to be one

[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.880]
How do you like that on the same morning?

[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.420]
Starting to sell live spots on issue again because our resigned the deal for five more years as opposed to well

[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.840]
He's only got like nine or ten months to go. Why would you want to sell that show?

[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.020]
Oh just because they sell out those restaurant deals every week in just a matter of five seconds

[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:50.560]
Spite remember what I told you that that's always been thing of QAnl under both regimes under Greg Reed and Jolly Joe spite

[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.800]
That's the operative word

[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.780]
That's why time jikket didn't have that article in the Sun sentle because he didn't know nothing about I I should have called Tom

[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.880]
I saw tonight. I don't cut the number anymore. I should have called him up said hey little Tommy. Right. Yes, what?

[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.600]
Your ball the stupid yeah, well he knows that

[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:13.400]
And he's got a really great looking son although my son probably about a hundred years old by now. I haven't seen him

[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.660]
I couldn't believe it. I think that he couldn't have been Tom jikket's son

[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.960]
Now what is his son dude? We have any ideas like a load of son go with Tom jikket's

[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.800]
What do you mean by that?

[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.720]
Well, he works for some newspapers something goes and eats free meals on a west post when they're doing the

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.700]
Previewing the fall shows and stuff like that

[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:37.300]
And he writes occasionally about horse racing because they got nobody else writing about racing anymore because Luther Revens is dead

[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:46.200]
Remember Luther Revens? No, no, he actually used to have a show on the KT back in the day. Oh there he goes again reminiscing about the old times, okay

[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.800]
Too bad Luther Revens he was a good guy

[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:54.040]
I think you still do the horse racing shown in it occasionally we talk about bowling

[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:03.540]
Maybe I just dreamed you talked about bowling. Let's do some bowling Rick Weaver bowling play by play on the radio. He actually did that one time

[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.900]
Fans beginning to blow the blow the

[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:11.660]
Who the white selection? Oh

[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.320]
Man he was quite a guy. I tell you one of the one thing

[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.640]
He's one of those people when after they made him they threw away the mold. You know what I mean by that?

[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.000]
Mm-hmm. He was an oldie moldy and

[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:27.680]
They threw away the mold. Oh here's some priests. Yes to rest here's some gesky on there all these encounters

[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:33.180]
The energy factor is partly due to it. I wonder how many altar boys they got waiting for the Pope when he gets here

[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:37.960]
How many gets off the plane? In fact, they probably got a bunch of them up there on the plane right and you know

[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.000]
There may be short, but I didn't know her baby. They'll chase

[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.520]
That's right

[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:48.100]
They got some midgets there on the plane the Pope is probably servicing them right now as we speak

[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.500]
Oh, I got an update on that Marilyn Monroe. Do you heard about that story? I'm sure about that

[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.800]
I don't think yeah, she's on her knees

[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.380]
Only 1.5 million George said she says once that in his deal

[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.380]
Sure have jolly Joe include that in the deal. Maybe he'll take a look at it too

[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:10.080]
GOP congressman calls Obama boy at fundraiser later apologizes. I wish you could see the picture of this geek

[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:11.240]
What a

[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:18.240]
Republican congressman use some of the most racially charged language of the election season to attack Barack Obama's fitness to be president

[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:23.700]
Closing the Illinois Center is campaign to wish a sharp-read buckeye yesterday representative Jeff Davis

[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:31.260]
Was speaking to about four hundred dollars at a fundraiser in Kentucky when he said of Obama that boy's finger does not need to be on the button

[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.480]
Boy you'd if you doubt that the shift is landed man. You're honestly this geek

[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.460]
Obama's campaign hit back against the offensive comment. It's hard to tell what's more outrageous

[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:47.740]
Representative Davis commas sending in personal attack or is absurd an offensive claim that Barack Obama's not prepared to defend America said

[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.820]
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton

[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.520]
Jeff Davis may hide behind offensive tough talk

[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.960]
But he's marched in lockstep with Bush McCain policies that have devastated our national security while Barack Obama stood up against

[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:05.180]
They misguided war in Iraq and work with their respective Republican like Dick Luger and Chuck Hagel to secure loose weapons and nuclear materials

[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:12.020]
From terrorists a Davis spokesperson said the two-timber Republican misspoke and was not trying to be erased right

[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.020]
Later in Davis issued a written apology to the Democratic frontrunner my poor choice of words is regrettable

[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:23.200]
I wasn't no way meant to impune you or your integrity Davis wrote according to the ABC News blog political radar

[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.220]
I'll for my sincere apology to you and ask for your forgiveness. Well guess what no. Don't give it to him. Okay

[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.260]
Stick your foot way up his ass

[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:35.580]
Rogers

[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:41.440]
I am the fourth leader. This is the new Roger show

[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.220]
This is your brain

[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.540]
Any questions

[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.500]
Timmy faith

[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.440]
He's on trial for that faithful day

[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.860]
I am sure he's guilty as

[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.200]
Oh, Jay

[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:10.080]
Do you believe in Tim McVeigh? No

[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:16.800]
Oh, did stand up to the IRS

[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:26.700]
Can we know when the ATF it's a good beating in the press

[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.320]
Why'd he

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:35.440]
Place that woman cause so much strife

[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:45.440]
Will he get the chair or instead will he get live

[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:47.740]
I've

[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.020]
Renoyed about the USA

[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.440]
Her room or that he might be gay

[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.900]
According to my 48 I

[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:12.620]
Hate the government just as much as most of you

[00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:14.750]
Absolutely

[00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:18.970]
Michelle

[00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:31.930]
Most of them are doing 8 to 10

[00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.650]
They can't have their weapons in the pan

[00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.530]
Well, Timmy faith

[00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.010]
Be joining them

[00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:50.710]
All the most strange the weird the

[00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:55.110]
1202 at 560 WQ and of course always in the name of religion too, you know like

[00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:03.310]
Yep the branched dividends. Mm-hmm, and like this Texas polygamy whatever that the raise all whipped up about I really don't care about it

[00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:05.330]
Yeah, I

[00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:07.490]
Don't care and all these trailer trash that are letting their kids

[00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:13.170]
Well, I don't know how they got a whole our kid band that yeah, you ever see those people oh, yeah, my girl

[00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:15.390]
They weren't born they were hatched

[00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:20.350]
They were hatched in that big cave in Tennessee. They're backed by Andy Jackson's place

[00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.850]
Wow

[00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:27.090]
A new statewide pool conducted by Hersberg based us by Hannah Poling and research ink

[00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:32.610]
In the upcoming Democratic presidential pencil-danny primary election. So it's swallowing with only a three-poinley

[00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.370]
Now yesterday we had one where she was 20 points ahead every day. There's new pools

[00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:42.330]
And I'm starting to get really cynical about the whole deal and you want to know why because I don't think they're gonna let them have it

[00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:42.990]
right

[00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.410]
I think they're gonna do the establishment is that's right

[00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:52.390]
Want Obama and I think they're gonna do whatever it takes to make sure he get in there you can feel it

[00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.250]
You can smell it

[00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.610]
Just like this whole simmits over these comments he made at the San Francisco fundraiser

[00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:02.910]
We can't anybody knows are exactly on target about that right let our bitter because they're losing their jobs

[00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:07.090]
And they don't have two nickels to rub together and right away to media makes a big simmits about it

[00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:11.250]
Because there's just too much time between primary elections. So they got to have something to full minute

[00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:13.970]
issue their cut about there those people you were just talking about

[00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.950]
Yes, and El Dorado takes

[00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:24.970]
I'll come to 18% are slung decided 40 for swallowing 37 for Obama while 4% said it wouldn't vote for either one or 1% refused to answer

[00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.890]
This represents a significant drop in this pool from her 14-poinley

[00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:33.730]
conducted March 5 to 10 where Clinton led 45-31

[00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.570]
The current pool was conducted April 6 to 10

[00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:39.110]
With 500 likely democratic voters

[00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:44.710]
Clinton's three-point lead is within the polls 4% margin rare. So the race is now a virtual toss-up

[00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.630]
Said Jim Lee the firm's president who conducted the poll for public dissemination

[00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.550]
Obama's got a strong 62 to 19 favorable to one favorable ratio in name ID

[00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:58.410]
And it succeeded in building up his positive images in the state something he said all along who is capable of doing a

[00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:03.450]
Voters had more time to get to know him at the same time swillery's name ID shows a higher negative than Obama

[00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:09.070]
With 25% having an unfavorable opinion her compared to 61% who view her as favorable

[00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:15.250]
Well, and it goes on I got you know this thing goes on like 400 pages

[00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:18.530]
Erie, let's see

[00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:26.910]
Racial heritage Caucasian 80% African-American 15% Hispanic 1%

[00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:32.090]
No, I think that's one tenth of 1% doesn't have a decimal

[00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:33.230]
But I think that's what that is

[00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:38.690]
Is your main religious background Roman Catholic Protestant Jewish or something else

[00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.130]
This is of these 500 people in this Pennsylvania pool

[00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:46.650]
Catholic 39% Protestant 25% Jewish 3%

[00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:50.450]
Backed is 5% agnostic or atheist only 2%

[00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:54.630]
Methodist 3% they better start checking out the Macy's a lot more, you know

[00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:00.250]
And agnostics right out present that's most of the same people

[00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:03.590]
Only crazy people believe the fairytales, okay?

[00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.610]
Only people are so brainwashed that they haven't got a brain to think for themselves

[00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:12.310]
Like those guys in Texas like you saw that lady there look at her look at him look at that oh my god wow

[00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:17.430]
That's inside your head here with this all important hearing the state is trying to have the

[00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.110]
News guy for Christ six. What's wrong with you?

[00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:21.470]
That guy

[00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.430]
Sorry

[00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:39.290]
Girl known as Sarah who first called an abuse hotline here as San Angelo and said that she had been beaten and raped by her much older husband

[00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:45.490]
When we talked at FLDS members last night Betty every one to a person said there was no such person

[00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:50.070]
They claim that it's a quote phantom or ghost and something that the state cooked up

[00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:55.570]
To rationalize that's right. You better get to stay out of there. Okay. They want to they want to bang all them little young

[00:50:55.570 --> 00:51:00.310]
Chicks and that's what it's all about. That's in the name of God baby. Um religion. Oh God. That's good

[00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:05.390]
There's a lot of people screaming at inside that big compound. Oh God. That's good. Do it again

[00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:06.310]
You know, mm-hmm?

[00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:12.130]
670 votes. It's all about your crap. Okay, and the public and the media you people in the media presented like you know like this

[00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.150]
That's right of the ordinary

[00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:18.070]
What's the difference between what's going on there and what this pop has been covered up?

[00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:20.210]
What what's the difference?

[00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:25.210]
We said number most of these are girls in there and then the one with the Catholic Church most they are little boys

[00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:28.810]
The Catholics have more money better PR machine. They got William Donahode

[00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:35.490]
Yeah, they got William Donahue clenching his teeth getting really agitated and pissed off. Ah, don't you pick on us Catholics again

[00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:42.430]
672 votes. I wish Neil would change nothing 236

[00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:48.270]
Take calls 189 while we're here to oblige. We took a lot of fabulous calls and we're gonna take some more soon

[00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.810]
Maybe in a minute here. What do you think?

[00:51:52.590 --> 00:52:01.870]
I can't live forever 177 stop reading stories 34 retire 24 and croak a dozen a dirty dozen said we wish you would croak. Thank you

[00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:10.150]
Let's see now. What is this this book is like the Loch Ness Monster? It's a Phantom book. I know

[00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.910]
It makes a video on Slot City pretends he's gonna keep saying it was supposed to be your last Friday

[00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:17.470]
No, it says estimated chip date

[00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:26.110]
April 28th to May 5th. I ordered it like October last year. I let you know there's a delay with one or more of the items in the order you placed October 29th

[00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:27.690]
Amazon dot CA

[00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:34.930]
John Grachowski the slot machine answer book second edition how they work how they've changed and how to overcome the house advantage

[00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:40.410]
I'm gonna tell you man the dollar wheel of fortune slots that would buy our so tight you couldn't slip a

[00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.950]
curly hair in there. That's how tight they are

[00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:47.850]
Good thing there's a space when there's nobody winning anything and everybody's belly. I can like yesterday

[00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.570]
Yeah, what's going on here?

[00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:54.570]
And of course like schmucks we keep telling him about shouldn't play those man

[00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.550]
I should go straight to the $5 machines

[00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:59.710]
If you're gonna lose two or three grand you can lose it in 10 minutes and get out of there

[00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.730]
Or if you're gonna win something big there's that alley felchie guy again on the CNN

[00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:09.450]
That bald headed queen with a vest is the vest supposed to make him look like some kind of intellectual or

[00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:10.870]
intellectual fang or what?

[00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:13.250]
Oh my god

[00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:18.810]
It's just a more efficient by by coming together they'll cut some so sad

[00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.530]
673 on x-pulls x-pulls very quiet this morning

[00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:24.550]
Yeah

[00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:33.290]
Yeah, he was just tipping the food guys. Thank you. Oh, I see there. No mr. Diet is eating from how is again probably like no wait

[00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:37.370]
Let's find out what he ordered I ordered scrambled eggs and wheat toast. Oh

[00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:39.670]
God are you kidding me? Oh, I got a great

[00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:41.950]
Diet story, okay?

[00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:49.230]
What was down in my pile here a little bit. I got another good story too the wolf blitzkriegs gonna be pissed off about Jewish liberals to launch a counterpoint to a pack

[00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.170]
It's about time

[00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:55.530]
When I'll all bunch of far-bison Zionist okay like wolf blitzkrieg that idiot a

[00:53:56.770 --> 00:54:03.850]
Large study offers the strongest evidence yet that a diet the government recommends for lowering blood pressure can say people from heart attack and stroke

[00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:04.370]
Oi

[00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:11.670]
Researchers fall for more than 88,000 healthy women for almost 25 years. What why is it that these diets are always

[00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:12.970]
Year to women

[00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:20.230]
Seems to me. I see a hell of a lot fat guys as well as fat women like especially the big the dark black women with the big asses

[00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:23.770]
You know because for the most part women are the ones that try to lose weight

[00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:30.550]
On other words men don't go on that ass Zach about that sitting right there across from your of the ass

[00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:36.430]
How you doing on that the program Zach I'm almost down 30 pounds. We'll see it too. You can see it in his neck

[00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:42.030]
Thank God you can almost see his neck and the beast by the way doesn't want to hear any more suggestions

[00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:46.950]
Anywhere a crap from your close personal buddy their Joe Rose. He's sick of it. No, he's had it

[00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:52.510]
He wants to be fat and disgusting. He's in time to be fat and disgusting. Okay, leave him alone

[00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.990]
He's a good guy. He's doing the best he can he made a baby which nobody ever believed was possible

[00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:00.050]
He did

[00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:04.990]
Why he did do that. Yeah, he did he he reproduced

[00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:11.430]
Which the thought of it to me is just so gruesome that I just I can't even begin to imagine but never

[00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:14.470]
I get pictures of the car. No, I don't want to hear about it

[00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.530]
Research is far more than 88,000 healthy women from almost 25 years

[00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:26.370]
They examined their food choices and looked at how many had heart attacks and strokes those who had who feared best

[00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.390]
Had any have it similar to those recommended by the government to stop high blood pressure

[00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:35.030]
We'll do the break and when we come back I'm going to give you the bad news about what we're supposed to eat okay

[00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:37.430]
Biggest names the best

[00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:39.070]
You know his new projects

[00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:43.450]
Thanks for later

[00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:47.730]
Oh

[00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:05.130]
I think

[00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:05.130]

[00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:05.130]

[00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:12.530]
There's always so much we can do

[00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:18.530]
I think life was up to me the oldest thing for you

[00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:35.970]
Oh

[00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:46.950]
I don't have to go

[00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.510]
I don't have the word

[00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:52.770]
I don't know

[00:56:52.770 --> 00:57:01.710]
Because life was oxygen you know found a brand new man

[00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.930]
Look up the hoover

[00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:07.870]
Such a bad out of splash you can

[00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.590]
Such a bad out of my baby

[00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:15.010]
Such a salient lead

[00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:18.430]
Such a bad out of my baby

[00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.430]
Hey

[00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:35.070]
17 get that hoover out baby and get the old long you that's right suck that fat right off my public

[00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:39.150]
So before I finish and tell you what was supposed to lose weight and be a healthy and live forever

[00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:42.630]
Let us my good friend Ken from a Tobico right off the street there

[00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:48.490]
Leave it to a Toronto listener who listens online leave it to somebody here to send me the time jica blog

[00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:52.810]
How do you like that did anybody fax it to you?

[00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:53.050]
Nope

[00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:56.750]
Anybody from down there sent it to me on my my space no

[00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:04.750]
Ken from a Tobico who's a good guy he sent it to me and I looked it up to see if it was sometimes blogging sure enough here it is

[00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:11.210]
Little Tommy jica who continues being bald and stupid he writes Neil Rogers isn't going anywhere Randy roaches back

[00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:18.810]
Rogers is agreed to new five-year contract with wqm which will keep him on here through 2013 he should live so long

[00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:25.210]
But he'll cost for a substantial pay cut more reflex to the financial situation of the station than Raj's performance

[00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:29.370]
However Raj's will still be the highest paid personality in South Florida radio and it won't be close

[00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:32.170]
It won't be close to see oh

[00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:38.170]
Yeah, they're paying big bucks over there a cheap channel. Let me tell you even George is making ten times with their pain over there

[00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:38.990]
I am

[00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:41.010]
Yes, wow

[00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:45.610]
That's a reduction is 50% the stations reported original offer

[00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:52.210]
Rogers would still be making the neighborhood of 500,000 to 750 grand a year which is a pretty fancy neighborhood 500 grand

[00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:54.670]
I'm going to work for that kind of money time. You're a crazy person

[00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.670]
What when you come up with that number

[00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:02.250]
George I don't know back home

[00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:07.410]
I thought you know what and here's some more misinformation boy Tom. Oh, you should have talked to me first

[00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:13.430]
Speaking of neighborhoods Rogers might be returning to South Florida from Toronto sometime and then out to distant future

[00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:18.750]
He's dropped hints to this effect on his 10 a into 2 p.m. Program lately. Thanks for the promotion for the show though Tom

[00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:24.070]
I might be returning he's scheduled to be back for at least a weekend to appear at Gulf City in Park, May 17

[00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:29.550]
Data of the prequel states the second jewel of third-grad racism's triple ground Gulf City will have sound cast weightry on a race

[00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:35.950]
See nice promotion for me and nice promotion for Gulfstream nice job there Tommy except for the misinformation course

[00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:36.670]
but nevertheless

[00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:42.150]
Rogers might be returning to South Florida from Toronto sometime and then out to distant future

[00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:44.370]
Yeah for that weekend

[00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:51.010]
Roads was suspended last week by scare America now she's you using that phrase I have a spy report on that which I don't want any more

[00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:51.650]
spy reports

[00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:54.990]
I don't care about her okay small potatoes believe me

[00:59:55.490 --> 01:00:00.210]
They can hack about her on CNN New York Times the Wall Street Journal the weekly reader

[01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.190]
Prove though whatever they want it's of no consequence to me

[01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.450]
She is strictly a results

[01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:13.890]
Roads was suspended last week by America for outrageous profane put down this whatever Clinton and some of her supporters in an offer speaking engagement

[01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:19.290]
So she quit and returned to Palm Beach and is resumed her program on WJNO for a new syndicator

[01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:25.530]
By the way that program was ranked number 30 quite a brand in East Mias spy report number 30 in the afternoon in the market

[01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.710]
How do you like that? What kind of a rating is that?

[01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:29.590]
About 30 man

[01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:34.690]
Out of 30 share but number 30 out of I don't know how many stations Roads is now part of the most incompatible back to back

[01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:39.810]
I'll couple pairing and radio systemy conservative icon rush limbaugh who Tom worships by the way

[01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:44.110]
Eris from noon to three with a hard left roads on three to six hard left

[01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:45.970]
Hang a hard left at the light

[01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:48.430]
Paco

[01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.190]
691 we're approaching 700 on sax pool

[01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:56.350]
Maybe you'll make 900 day okay?

[01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:57.150]
9000

[01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:04.850]
Take calls and you'll take calls we want the calls they were okay today and we'll take some more eventually when I'm good and ready or okay

[01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:07.510]
Getting back to the story about it was staying alive for two to two hundred

[01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:10.530]
Mm-hmm the plan called the dash diet

[01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:12.550]
Favourites fruits

[01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:17.630]
Vegetables whole grains low-fat milk and plant-based protein over meat

[01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.990]
Vegan diet oh yeah right

[01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:26.610]
Let me get right on that I beg your pardon. Let me get right on that vegan diet

[01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.670]
Peta

[01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:29.890]
I'm having a thotershies again. She's everywhere

[01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:30.610]
Peta

[01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:32.790]
Cazzee is two kinds of pork sandwich right now

[01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:39.010]
Women with those eating habits were 24% less like that I have a hard attack and 18% less like that have a stroke

[01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:40.990]
Then women with more typical American diets

[01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:49.350]
Those are meaningful reduction since these diseases are so common about two out of five US women in age 50 will eventually develop cardio vascular disease

[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.350]
Which includes heart attacks and strokes

[01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:56.630]
Women in the study where they're mid 30-30s late 50s when research began in 1980

[01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:01.370]
Previous research has shown this kind of diet cannot prevent high blood pressure and cholesterol

[01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:06.210]
Both of which can lead to heart attack the new study appears in the studies archives of internal medicine

[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:09.790]
Which I'm sure that you guys both read religiously. Oh, yeah, I got a subscription

[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:16.390]
People might think I don't have high blood pressure. So I don't have to follow what's at Simmons College researcher to reach a fun

[01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.350]
The studies lead author

[01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:23.010]
Remember that song by the Beach Boys fun fun fun mm-hmm got her

[01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:29.590]
However, the results suggest she said that even healthy people should get on it get on it and the diet too

[01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.950]
hop on it

[01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:38.770]
And it shows a picture here. It says a vendor arranges vegetables at a wholesale market in the northeastern Indian city of

[01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:40.990]
Silaguri a

[01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.010]
gluten-free vegan diet full of nuts

[01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:49.250]
sunflower seeds fruit and vegetables appears to offer protection against heart attacks and strokes for people with

[01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:52.850]
Toward arthritis sweetest researchers said I don't have rheumatoid arthritis

[01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.610]
I'm not a woman

[01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:55.950]
well

[01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:59.830]
Now maybe time can put that in there too. I'm having a sex change operation

[01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:04.490]
If I hit around it that on the ear wouldn't that be good? Oh, yeah, well, I could have a good time

[01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.290]
If I had a

[01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:13.150]
They could do an age change operating while they're out of the movies here. I got a pretty good start. I got two hands two hands full

[01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:17.710]
So what do you think about that vegan diet? No, thank you. No

[01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:21.210]
I want to eat man if I didn't squeal at any of the meal

[01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:23.410]
That's bad

[01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:26.470]
The Lord is gonna punish your ass for a shursher

[01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:32.230]
All these terrible things you need them animals and poor little animals the Lord's critters if God didn't want me to eat them animals

[01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:33.510]
He wouldn't have made them taste so good

[01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:38.710]
Who said they taste so good unless you put something on they don't have to talk about it well

[01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:41.430]
other than a good steak good juicy steak

[01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:44.750]
I'm sure they're gonna try and morten good. Yeah, you tell me that you've been to mortens

[01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:48.130]
Not lately. I got a place for you when you when you come down here

[01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:54.790]
Couple actually with all these on you know down there. I'm okay here. They got Mortens up there. I imagine yes

[01:03:56.870 --> 01:04:00.990]
It's been a long time. It's been a long time, but uh, yeah, it's actually learned he go home

[01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:05.610]
You know I'm here. Well, you are all time quiet as today. Well food showed up, you know

[01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:13.830]
I'm not trying to be quiet. I'm just enjoying the conversation. You're just no, you're not you're eating

[01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:15.210]
I haven't eaten yet

[01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:24.430]
I gotta wait 20 minutes till my uh, so how did you like that diet plan? I just got through reading about I think it's gonna be good for a lot of people

[01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:25.850]
But not for you

[01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:34.970]
No nuts no no nuts for me no sunflower seeds. I like sunflower seeds no fruits and veggies. I like fruits and veggies

[01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:40.510]
I love eating nuts. I like fruits. Well, I mean yeah, I know we gotta make something out of that

[01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.330]
Yeah, I really do but most of them are like loaded with sugar and you can't right?

[01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:47.810]
Like most of them of pineapple, but one not all of them

[01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:52.550]
Which ones what's uh, what's a low sugar fruit watermelon watermelon water water, but if you

[01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:55.150]
But it doesn't have a high glycemic index. I don't think it doesn't

[01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:58.870]
I don't think so. They're all sweet. What's a non-sweet fruit

[01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:08.470]
Tomato I guess you're right technically that's a fruit. I keep for you. I know my fruits mister. Okay. I know you do

[01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:14.310]
697 votes on our world famous pool and thanks to Tom jicker for writing a little something there

[01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:16.570]
Uh, he had some misinformation in there, but that's okay

[01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:19.430]
Well, it was nothing glaring this time, you know

[01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:23.250]
I'm not coming back down there. I don't I don't think I'll ever do a show there again

[01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:26.450]
In fact that week that I'm coming down. That's what we can go on on vacation

[01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:28.890]
Have you written that on the calendar? By the way or not? No, I've done

[01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:32.350]
You better start informing people. It's about a month away alert the media

[01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:38.250]
I'll be on vacation and I have to take vacation starting on that Friday because um, that's the only time I can get a flight

[01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.050]
right

[01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:44.990]
Unless the question want me to drive down in which case I could start. Hey, I can get back in aponia

[01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:47.210]
Tuesday seems to be a good day for that

[01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:55.370]
I wish Neil would change nothing 245 in other words, they're happy right now

[01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:58.790]
Take calls 196

Live forever 186 stop reading stories 34 stop with the bedtime stories stop reading the newspaper you old fairy

[01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:08.010]

[01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.270]
retire 24 and croak of your knee doesn't

[01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.210]
die on

[01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.330]

[01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:15.590]
Thank you

[01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.450]
I am

[01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:25.450]

[01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:27.950]
The Rogers on sports hall radio

[01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:38.630]
Today on dr. Fritt was doing I'm glad you're here great to be here. What happened?

[01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:42.690]
I remember landing under sniper fire what there was no breeding ceremony

[01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:47.910]
And we basically were told to run to our cars now that is what happened. Are you kidding me?

[01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:52.130]
Well one thing you know about me is that I've been taking that incoming fire for 16 years

[01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:59.390]
She is crazy and ridiculous. Yeah, and some other things that I'm not gonna mention you need serious help

[01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:04.290]
There isn't any doubt, but I'm a little busy right now. I hardly have time to sleep

[01:07:04.290 --> 01:07:07.090]
Are you drunk? Yes

[01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:11.590]
We need a good shot. You have an alcohol problem

[01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.110]
What in the world is going on?

[01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.950]
sniper fired

[01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:24.930]
Wow talking about fruits. That sounded like a gigantic raspberry didn't it? It sounded like a bomb wow

[01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:30.470]
Yeah, I couldn't imagine what that smell like and I don't want to

[01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:38.450]
732-560 WQ and we got the jerk show on a heels of another heat loss last night to the or two outer rackers right here at the scare Canada center

[01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:42.630]
So jerse was here and I say I thought I smelled something last night

[01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:46.090]
Hmm the aroma put me you know

[01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:50.830]
Anyway, Swarovie says I understand my opponent came this morning and spent a lot of his time attacking me

[01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:55.630]
So she suggested we union gathering to steal workers in Pittsburgh yesterday and she went on to say well

[01:07:55.630 --> 01:08:01.230]
You know, I know that many of you like me. We disappointed by recent remarks that he made scattered booze and calls of no

[01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.390]
No, could clearly be heard from the audience

[01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:09.710]
I think it's important you know we give people a chance to really compare and contrast us she concluded

[01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:13.830]
And you don't want to vote for that far to any way she said something like that

[01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:19.090]
They were they showed the clip last night they were boeing and hissing him yeah you bitch you know like that

[01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:21.170]
You shrill bitch

[01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:24.830]
9 on a pole don't be sorry

[01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:33.710]
Oh there protecting the pope look at the security oh yeah five months and listing 27 state local and family

[01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:37.250]
For that

[01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:40.550]
And when you're that evil you need a lot of a work for it last you think that the

[01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:47.170]
American taxpayers are subsidizing the Catholic Church and the Pope for this visit by paying for that security when everything if we were

[01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:48.950]
That would be an infomnia

[01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:52.190]
That would be disgraceful but nevertheless

[01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:58.910]
Continue if I didn't know what a nation says right wing ABC radio talk show host John bachelor is filled my box

[01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:05.790]
In these last 18 hours with emails dissecting and scouring what Obama meant when he said at a private April six fundraiser

[01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:09.490]
That small town voters in economically distressed areas of Pennsylvania are bitter

[01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:18.510]
Bachelor of law and Graham and Monica Crowley and Sean Hannity and rush and O'Reilly are ready and we're going to go quick to their guns to pay

[01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:19.470]
No, bombers in a latest

[01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:26.970]
The right has its reasons to play the cynical card. It's the Clinton campaigns rapid fire right wing populist response to Obama's remarks

[01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:31.310]
That I find so troubling in cynical and sure to hurt the party in the country in the general election

[01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:39.130]
Strip down what Obama was saying he addressed the trouble his campaign of hope and change was having in places where people feel most cynical about government

[01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:43.090]
While he's tried to speak concretely about the conditions of people's lives

[01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:48.010]
His campaign continues to have trouble making inroads among white working class voters and old economy voters

[01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:53.250]
Whose idea of change isn't hope but rather losing a job or pension yet. He's narrowing the margins

[01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:59.210]
In months he and the anteceded in morning Obama was counter-punching as he should be explaining and expanding his remarks

[01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:05.290]
The problem is our politics don't let the American people get heard people know it's not easy solving some of these problems

[01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.870]
But they want to feel like at least somebody is fighting for them

[01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:13.550]
It's interesting. Maybe there's been a little typical sort of political threat because I said something that everybody knows is true

[01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:16.390]
Which is that there are a whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania

[01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:20.410]
It sounds right here in india and in my hometown of Illinois who are bitter. They're angry

[01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:24.710]
They feel like they've been left behind. They feel like nobody's paying attention to what they're going through

[01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:30.990]
I can't think of much true in our politics today than what Obama's saying about how people don't feel they're being listened to

[01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:35.770]
What we need is a government that actually is paying attention fighting for working people day in and day out

[01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:40.830]
At a time when 81% of the country thinks we're heading in the wrong direction aren't these people bitter?

[01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.890]
Isn't it pretty clear that our economy hasn't performed well for most people for at least a generation

[01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:49.230]
And is now heading into what everyone sent he would agree are likely to be some very tough times

[01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:54.370]
Recovery from this recession is also likely to be even slower than essentially jobless recovery from the last

[01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:59.250]
The traditional means of jump-starting the economy dropping interest rates or boosting consumer spending

[01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:05.890]
Have been substantially exhausted and their pale male unregulated pursuit is a large part of what got us in the current mess in the first place

[01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.950]
The political this content is obvious and Obama's trying to speak to that

[01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:14.750]
Americans are fed up with governments faded to do anything much for them or that they're proud of being part of

[01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:20.790]
Here's how it is he's it said is April 6th remarks and a lot of these communities in big industrial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania

[01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.790]
People have been beaten down for so long

[01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:28.350]
They feel so betrayed by government that when they hear a pitch that is promised on not being cynical about government

[01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.050]
Then a part of them just doesn't buy it

[01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:35.390]
Here's where is the right generation long attack on government has done real damage to citizen confidence in government

[01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:37.090]
We see it all around us every day

[01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:42.250]
But surely the other critical source of citizen doubt is that government has in fact done little recently

[01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:48.250]
To measurably improve their lives and give them a sense of national purpose after all Bill Clinton long considered the master politician of his age

[01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:52.770]
Was basically in the business of lowering expectations of government even factor than they were disappointed

[01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:57.790]
Obama's trying to amp up expectations which the right and Clintonism have tamped down

[01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:03.190]
The right wing is clearly desperate ready to seize on anything to change the subject and hide how out of touch

[01:12:03.190 --> 01:12:04.970]
They are with an America in financial pain

[01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:10.870]
But how cynical of the Clinton campaign to claim that Obama was condescending to the people of Pennsylvania says Katrina

[01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:13.010]
You vote Katrina. You want to take some call

[01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:14.670]
Uh, okay

[01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:20.870]
Well, why are you so we're so ready to start any of the moment but I realized I didn't say there would maybe because they're gonna wait for me to give the numbers

[01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:24.110]
I don't know for the delay to catch up and then you know it'll be almost break time

[01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:28.690]
So we're gonna like a little buffer there, you know, let's do it like will he teach you would say we got some buffers

[01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:31.350]
Yeah, 5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:35.550]
pound 5 60 on the Verizon and singular wireless line

[01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:39.010]
I wonder if the Pope is writing in culture and business class. What do you think?

[01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:46.630]
An enormously important trip. Oh my god. Yeah, so important. What are we gonna do with him? I like more important than another

[01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:52.870]
Pope coming in other getch keep what are they doing in address a man in a white dress and a russi shmata on his head

[01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:59.570]
My god, they stole everything from us. Is that a Yama come by? Yeah, it's a Yama girl like I said

[01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:02.370]
They stole everything from us the Pope's got a Yama Keon

[01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:08.290]
I think it's got my bar mitzvah day. The only thing he's missing is the tallest, you know, we got any calls

[01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:12.490]
We do them we do now we do that

[01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.490]
Well, let's punch one up Qion hello

[01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:24.510]
Yeah, you can do it hello Neil baby. Yes, I wanted to say congratulations on your new deal

[01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:30.910]
I am one that is happy to hear this because there's nothing else like you and I think you're great even though

[01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:35.590]
The shows aren't what they used to be there's still better than anything. I'm glad you're having a nice life

[01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:38.550]
Okay, thank you sir. I have a wonderful existence. Okay

[01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:39.350]

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 into Verizon singular wireless like Q a m. Hello

[01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.230]
Hello, yes

[01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.030]
Speaking

[01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:54.430]
All right

[01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.430]
Let me ask you one question

[01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:10.130]
Why why were you watching me? I was too as a matter of fact was on a any eight thousand times exactly

[01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:16.170]
Can't look away, but you know you always try to look alone nuances whatever you something you just haven't seen before

[01:14:16.170 --> 01:14:20.170]
We almost have to always the one that bags up everyone at the end

[01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:26.130]
But when the gun fall is in the hospital and Michael comes to visit him and there's nobody there

[01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:30.890]
The first three dozen equals sonnie's funny. There's nobody here. Not that feels man. Not nothing

[01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:34.010]
So is that like an indication that test you was already

[01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:37.630]
You know trying to you know spoof things from from earlier

[01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:43.290]
You ever see that part? No, don't you remember them are clusky the can the crooked copy chased them all away

[01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:48.190]
I understand then why didn't test your problem. I mean, I'm gotten you reading too much into it

[01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:53.370]
I guess but you know if test you and got moved and you thought just you know would say something about you know

[01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:55.450]
I'm about my arrangement

[01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:58.070]
Yeah, I gotta get a life

[01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:00.190]
Thank you. Yeah, please. Okay. Good luck to you

[01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:04.430]
Scoot off all his arrangement now wasn't that earlier that was before um

[01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:06.330]
Tesier sold out

[01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:11.890]
Yeah, I don't have the to do with Tesier. No, of course not. That was long before that was when that was when they tried to

[01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:19.630]
Sasne Don Corleone from my knowledge that's before um Michael killed the solacea and mucloski and went on to a Corleone and

[01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:21.550]
Merida Palonia and but a bing

[01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.810]
Uh-oh the carbonate was

[01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:29.030]
How many two oh don't the bad seven I read he votes on the pole

[01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:36.470]
I still don't know why he says don't they it's dove I dove vibe and maybe he doesn't say don't they maybe he says it

[01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:37.090]
We're kind of quickly

[01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:40.450]
Yeah, you know, and it ain't his native tongue so

[01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:46.170]
Oh, like he didn't speak a perfect Italian. Are you crazy or what mr. I don't think he did

[01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:51.430]
Didn't he need a translator he didn't need a translator and remember when they were having dinner there in

[01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:56.110]
In the breeze when he was talking to Apollonia's father. He's a translate for me

[01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:57.810]
Yeah, father

[01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:01.990]
So he obviously that good but how about when he was talking to Solaco? Yeah

[01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:09.170]
No, he did get frustrated though remember. Mm-hmm. He said well what I want my was frustrated because he couldn't say it express it in Italian right

[01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:14.550]
He says what I want most horror Italian is a assurance that my father won't be bothered again

[01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:20.090]
What is sure it's gonna give you I'm the hunted one Solaco said mm-hmm. I missed my chance kid

[01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:27.130]
But to be honest all due respect the Don was slipping five years ago could I've gotten to him

[01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:31.150]
And of course Polly that's through and he sold out for all mean

[01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:33.830]
The whole time

[01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:34.930]
Oh

[01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:37.910]
Five sixty-five years

[01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:39.330]
Later

[01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:56.630]
Some independent truckers say don't stop hauling freight for a test the record high diesel fuel prices

[01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:02.510]
Off the road again. I just can't pay to fill my tank again

[01:17:03.730 --> 01:17:10.590]
These old fuel is higher than it's ever been and I can't pay to get on the road again

[01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:13.250]
I'll go roll again

[01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.190]
Oil's profits. They are such a sin

[01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:25.370]
Screaming things at those exonable men. I can't pay to get on the road again

[01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:27.950]
Off the road again

[01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:32.110]
Like a pack of suckers we go down the highway

[01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:34.830]
Hope the gouging ends

[01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:38.570]
Because the Iroh's world getting richer each and every day

[01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:47.090]
It's so lame off the road again. We're making a statement. I just can't pay to get on the road again

[01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:52.270]
We shut down for five days. I drive a truck and take it off the gasmy end

[01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:57.990]
Because I can't pay to get on the road again. We are not gonna put up with prices like that

[01:17:57.990 --> 01:18:01.210]
That's right. We're gonna go out and kill somebody because we're pretty pissed off about it

[01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:06.290]
729 in a full. I don't think I want to take any more calls for a while now

[01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:11.950]
I so just take your finger and put it back where it was before well obviously it's a little awkward

[01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:16.950]
Burnt this way right it's very awkward. It is but whatever. That's working out okay though. Sure

[01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:21.790]
Merrill and Monroe sex film and be kept private we talked about this yesterday because of course

[01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:26.310]
Could there be anything more important than this? I love these kinds of stories. Hey, there's a sucks tape. Yeah, I'm gonna see it

[01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:29.170]
Let's talk about it for a long time. It's not a tape. It's a film whatever

[01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:33.310]
Long before they head like any video tape. Yes

[01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:38.790]
A 15-minute film of Merrill and Monroe engaging in all sex with an unidentified man

[01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:39.810]
Oh my god

[01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:43.550]
If he kept from public view by a New York business man who's bought it for one and a half million dollars

[01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:46.790]
The broker that he'll say yesterday. It'll be kept from viewing view

[01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:51.590]
So you don't understand them if you put it on the internet

[01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.590]
You could make the one and a half million back in about 20 seconds

[01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.610]
Yeah, all right, right

[01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:05.410]
Number be the collector key of Morgan city recently arranged the sale of the silent black and white film from the set of a dead FBI

[01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:10.030]
Informant who possessed it to a wealthy man hadn't been a man who wants to protect Monroe's privacy

[01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:15.890]
Why is it important to protect their privacy? She's been dead for a hundred years. Why is that important?

[01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:17.050]
I don't know as that guy

[01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:19.250]
As gay Edgar Hoover

[01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:26.010]
The gentleman who bought it set out a respect for Merrill and he's not gonna make a joke out of it and put it on the internet and try to exploit her

[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:28.070]
Said remember be the collector key of Morgan

[01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:32.190]
That's not his intention and I would never get my name involved if that were to happen he said

[01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:38.530]
Monroe is clothed and the man's head remains out of the frame for the entire 50 minutes of the film said Morgan who watched it

[01:19:39.450 --> 01:19:40.950]
They head on his shoulders that is

[01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:46.690]
Monroe was rumored to have had an affair with US President John F. Kennedy and Morgan said then FBI director

[01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:51.390]
Gay Edgar Hoover a Kennedy rival went to great lengths to try to prove that Kennedy was in the film was him

[01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:58.130]
One of Monroe's ex-husband's late baseball grade Joe Demagio once tried to buy it from the collector for 25 grand

[01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:59.670]
But he wouldn't part with it

[01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.850]
According to FBI files on Monroe that are available on the FBI website

[01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:08.850]
Morgan is a well-known collector ruins member be here from the estates of Monroe and Demagio and city was friends with Monroe's other two

[01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:10.770]
husbands Jim Dirty and Arthur Miller

[01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:17.110]
Oh boy, how come she married such ugly guys? I don't get it. She did. I mean not just ugly, but I mean real

[01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:22.470]
Real ugly and believe me. I know real ugly. She had no taste apparently

[01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:26.470]
But doesn't that always happen?

[01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:29.390]
Not always not often enough. No often

[01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:31.370]
Not always

[01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:37.310]
The hot chick married some gruesome nasty other than like Reese widest one although she's not that hot

[01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:43.370]
Yeah, she's right. Well, she married one philip. Maybe he's got that eyesight. He must

[01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:49.430]
He said he learned of the existence of the film I'm working on a documentary about Monroe who died August 62

[01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.350]
40

[01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:53.330]
Six years ago almost at age 36 a

[01:20:54.290 --> 01:21:00.110]
Former FBI agent told him about it Morgan City confirmed it by tracking down the son of the FBI informant who had provided a copy to the FBI

[01:21:00.970 --> 01:21:06.170]
I thought the FBI agent was embellishing it for my documentary. I never once believed it till I pulled up the FBI document

[01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:12.990]
referring to the film organ said the lead informant son had the original while the copy remains classified in the FBI file said Morgan

[01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:16.010]
Whose deal was first reported by the New York Post yesterday

[01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:20.670]
The FBI agent that I interviewed said gay Edgar Hoover was completely obsessed

[01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:22.290]
obsessed

[01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:28.330]
A team of nine individuals were analyzing the tape inside a lab gay Edgar Hoover brought in a few prostitutes

[01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:32.470]
Well, allegedly a bit of a president Kennedy and they tried to see if it really was him in other words

[01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:33.670]
They were trying to look at his uh

[01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:37.430]
See and oh, yeah, I recognize that it looks just like his

[01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:45.830]
Wasn't that wasn't that partly a whole monica thing too that she could describe his yeah, and the Michael Jackson thing right pick it out of the lineup

[01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:49.830]
An FBI spokesman declined to comment except to point out to Monroe

[01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:55.570]
The Monroe files available online which refer to the film but make no much to give your Hoover's purported interest

[01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:57.630]
Well, of course not because that would be bad for the FBI

[01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:02.130]
That this ridiculous hateful queen was like I had all these

[01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:07.950]
File secret files on everybody from Martin Luther King to the Kennedys everybody else had a lot enemies gave Hoover

[01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:12.230]
I'm surprised they didn't out his nasty aspect then

[01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:19.370]
And believe you me. I have a feeling here. I really nasty answer. He had something on everyone who might probably

[01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:22.530]
Yeah, that's right. It was a stalemate. Right. They ever have a stalemate

[01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:25.570]
Yeah, no comment and no no answer this sir

[01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:30.730]
736 votes on the poll. I wish Neil would blank

[01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:33.890]
Change nothing 264

[01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:38.090]
Take calls to await we took more today that we've taken in months

[01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:42.770]

How about you Zach you still eating? No, I'm almost done almost done. Yeah, I'm done

[01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:55.610]

[01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:56.030]
It is full

[01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.790]
That's it

[01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:59.630]
Don't you know the slower you eat the less you eat

[01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:07.390]
Say who one of those things it's an ancient Chinese secret. That's right

[01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:11.370]
George. I would you would take calls to await live forever 191

[01:23:12.210 --> 01:23:17.230]
Stop reading stories 38. Boy, that's a big drop off only 5% don't like the bedtime stories

[01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:20.790]
Well, guess what your mama your mama's so socks and hell how do you like that

[01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:23.310]
Retire

[01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:26.870]
25 well, I don't even know why they're bothering to write that

[01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:34.290]
To answer to vote for that when when we just had the new deal time jica and very jackass both said

[01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:38.470]
I just had a new deal for five more years after this year through 2013

[01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:40.050]
2013

[01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:43.310]
Do you know how far off in the distance that seems?

[01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:48.210]
Uh really far oh my god, and I wish Neil would croak 13

[01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:52.670]
Isn't that touching? Oh

[01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:57.390]
I wish Neil would croak and die I should have put on their dial wicked death that would be good

[01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:01.270]
South Florida for you man

[01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:06.330]
It's only 13. It's only 1.7% of the audience

[01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:11.530]
Almost 2% of the audience wish I would croak and that's why they're listening right now because they hate well

[01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:18.750]
They're waiting for you to croak on the air. They won't have it. No, they're not they hate they hate me like poison and they it fills a need it fills a void

[01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:25.810]
They have this masochistic desire for me to be here every single day even on a weekend they get all depressed

[01:24:28.170 --> 01:24:32.130]
Never get the press down the weekend because your routine is like I mean, I know it's on stupid

[01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:38.070]
No, especially for a guy like me that gets up early in the morning and goes to woodland and Saturday morning and 1.900 bucks

[01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:42.750]
I was passed out sick this week. It's over so happy about that. Oh, they see there you go. It's not a lot of plans

[01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:43.890]
I mean Chris

[01:24:43.890 --> 01:24:45.670]
I think Chris finally is coming around now

[01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:49.230]
He's not there to defend himself today, but Zach knows he gave me all kinds of grief

[01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:53.910]
Because he couldn't understand why we'd get up early in the morning because I don't want to go when it's really crowded

[01:24:53.910 --> 01:25:00.550]
I don't like being in the middle of smelly crowded pushy old people that walk around like zombies that push

[01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:05.050]
That practically push you down or they're you'll say excuse me. Excuse me. You try to get by you know

[01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:10.250]
And they act like they're deaf dumb and stupid they might be

[01:25:11.150 --> 01:25:11.550]
God

[01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:18.030]
Don't give me wrong. There's a lot of fine people here of all kinds and a lot of very polite people except when they're driving and

[01:25:18.570 --> 01:25:20.410]
Except when you would like them to get out of your way

[01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:28.830]
The old ethnic man the old and like the Eastern Europeans the Russians. Yeah, I don't think they get out of the house much

[01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:30.330]
except for that

[01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:37.190]
It's just it's nauseating. I mean can you see me and and the old the Chinese man? Oh

[01:25:37.190 --> 01:25:39.170]
My god, there's nothing like an old Chinese man

[01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:40.990]
No clue

[01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:43.870]
Clueless and shoeless

[01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:51.510]
But I was quite a surprise I had the surprise visit from Todd direct this morning

[01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:55.830]
Mm-hmm. Our sales department. What I'm sorry for you. He brought Duff in just in case

[01:25:57.070 --> 01:26:00.870]
Did he really which I thought was very funny. Yeah, did he really is like like a

[01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:06.130]
Had to hide me size behind some of these coattails or behind some of these apron strings

[01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:10.170]
I got some apron strings. I talked to him and do it as I know you can talk to him directly

[01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:15.170]
But I said don't say congratulations and other than another crap and of course what's the first thing he said? Yeah

[01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:21.570]
Nobody listens to me. I got good advice and nobody will take it. I take it. Thank you Todd direct who else he couldn't

[01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:27.450]
I'll congratulate you like that man. Yeah, who that was he kidding man

[01:26:27.450 --> 01:26:31.090]
He hasn't sold anything on his show since Jesus was an infant

[01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:38.190]
And all of a sudden the day after I'm signing this deal all the sales people running are all we got live free on this and we got a live endorsement

[01:26:38.190 --> 01:26:42.790]
All of a sudden man now it's fashionable to be selling the near-roger show

[01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:50.490]
I'm just broke just out of spite. How do you like that if Todd directs all something I might actually die just out of shock

[01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:57.290]
Because we know how good he is on the copy too. He's really on top of that. Yeah, all right sure

[01:26:58.290 --> 01:27:00.210]
As this branch much though. He's the best

[01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.870]
1156 for minutes till noon at 560 WQM

[01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:13.130]
Latening and I like scrubbing my smelly grilla ass with soap made from jewels and listening to the near-roger

[01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:14.510]
I'm gonna use the hour

[01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:35.550]
I'm very old that's why my head hangs down loose and the room

[01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:47.550]
I see my toes protruding from my gown in my booties

[01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:54.290]
oh

[01:27:54.290 --> 01:28:06.990]
I spent my hours because my

[01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.830]
I

[01:28:51.330 --> 01:29:01.010]
So far I bowed six dollars in loose change and my color keys

[01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:14.410]
Hold my hair down, hold my head up, hold my hand up

[01:29:14.410 --> 01:29:22.650]
Oh, just hold my hand, oh, just hold my hand, oh, keep on right down.

[01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:27.490]
Okay, the Pope is dying over there.

[01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:28.630]
I'm dying over here.

[01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:29.570]
In the blue and smoke, people.

[01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:30.510]
Oh, I just did.

[01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:31.010]
Look at that.

[01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:34.670]
As Marelda quives us on the line with this, as Marelda,

[01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:35.230]
we can take these things.

[01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:35.810]
We can take these things off.

[01:29:35.890 --> 01:29:36.410]
We can shut down.

[01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:40.710]
As Marelda and the four tops, they got tourists.

[01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:41.570]
You see that?

[01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:43.310]
Yeah, what about it?

[01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:44.630]
Nobody cares.

[01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:45.370]
I don't.

[01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:46.570]
But it's breaking news.

[01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:51.910]
Breaking news, somebody just farted in a vice-chester.

[01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.910]
How do you know?

[01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:54.650]
I can smell it.

[01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:55.510]
I just did.

[01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:58.110]
I can smell it.

[01:29:59.130 --> 01:29:59.890]
Can you smell it?

[01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:00.410]
No, that's George.

[01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.430]
All right.

[01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:02.490]
I did just fart.

[01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:04.070]
And he's been sick.

[01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:06.010]
Yeah, I'm just talking before about those, you know,

[01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.690]
you're really sick.

[01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:07.710]
I just shut the door.

[01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:09.570]
I was sickly, sickly gas.

[01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:09.790]
Right.

[01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:12.450]
Oh, it's like, oh, my God.

[01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:13.550]
It's like really queasy.

[01:30:13.710 --> 01:30:13.870]
That's right.

[01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:15.090]
It's not the first time this morning.

[01:30:15.210 --> 01:30:15.710]
He's dropped it.

[01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:17.910]
What I would do is I'd run into a hot shower real quick

[01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:19.950]
and turn the, oh, steamy.

[01:30:20.690 --> 01:30:24.190]
Turn that real hot water on, real up, you know, I'm so pretty.

[01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:26.590]
758 on the pole.

[01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:28.290]
And we're never going to make no thousand with that.

[01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:29.210]
I'm telling you that right now.

[01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:30.710]
But so you're going to exact just hit that,

[01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:31.150]
we'll make it.

[01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:31.670]
We'll make it.

[01:30:31.690 --> 01:30:32.310]
No, you won't.

[01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:33.990]
I haven't got a chat in my sense in hell.

[01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:37.290]
It's some calls today, though.

[01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:39.570]
And boy, I bet you the audience is pretty excited about that.

[01:30:39.730 --> 01:30:41.270]
I know them were really what I would say memorable.

[01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:44.170]
The only thing memorable was the fact that there actually

[01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:45.830]
were some living and reading people out there.

[01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:48.130]
How about the first call, the telemarketer?

[01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:50.010]
Yeah, that was the best part of the role.

[01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.870]
She was excellent.

[01:30:51.130 --> 01:30:51.130]

[01:30:53.210 --> 01:30:55.850]
Jewish liberals to launch a counterpoint to APAC.

[01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:57.470]
Oh, this is so long overdue.

[01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:01.390]
Jeweliebrem and the Wolf Blitzer must be really crying

[01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.990]
their eyes out.

[01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:04.950]
Yeah, they must be bawling, so to speak.

[01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:13.430]
Some of the country's most prominent Jewish liberals

[01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:15.070]
are forming a political action committee

[01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:16.870]
and lobbying group aimed at dislodging

[01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:19.150]
what they consider the excessive hold of neocons

[01:31:19.150 --> 01:31:21.790]
and evangelical Christians on US policy toward Israel.

[01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:25.830]
The group is planning to channel political contributions

[01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:26.830]
to favored candidates.

[01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:29.130]
And perhaps a half dozen campaigns this fall.

[01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:31.590]
The first time an organization focused on Israel

[01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:34.070]
is tried to play such a direct role in the political process

[01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:35.130]
according to its organizers.

[01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:38.030]
Organizers said they hope those efforts

[01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:39.710]
couple with a separate lobbying group

[01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:42.050]
that will focus on promoting an Arab-Israeli peace settlement

[01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:44.570]
will fill a void left by the American Israeli Public Affairs

[01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:46.630]
Committee or APAC and other Jewish groups

[01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:50.150]
that they contend to title to the right in recent years.

[01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:52.150]
Did I say title?

[01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.470]
What?

[01:31:52.570 --> 01:31:53.170]
Chiltset to the right.

[01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.930]
Oh, recent year.

[01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.910]
Well, I'm not reading well.

[01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:56.190]
Maybe your head's tilted.

[01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:57.630]
That could be it.

[01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:59.110]
Maybe my head's tilted to the left.

[01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.730]
Oh, I tried it.

[01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:01.410]
It hurt.

[01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:04.510]
The lobbying group will be known as J-Street.

[01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:06.810]
What do you think about that?

[01:32:07.330 --> 01:32:10.690]
J-Street and the political action group as J-Street PAC,

[01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:13.750]
the executive director for both will be Jeremy Ben Ami,

[01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:16.250]
a former domestic policy advisor, and a Clinton White House.

[01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:19.490]
The definition of what it means to be pro-Israeli's

[01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:21.210]
come to diverge from pursuing a peace element

[01:32:21.210 --> 01:32:24.490]
said Alan Solomon, a prominent Democratic Party fundraiser

[01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:25.290]
involved in the initiative.

[01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:27.930]
In recent years, he said we've heard voices of Neocons

[01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:30.610]
and right of center Jewish leaders and Christian evangelicals

[01:32:30.610 --> 01:32:32.610]
and the mainstream views of the American Jewish community

[01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:33.230]
have not been heard.

[01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:35.270]
People like David from, for example,

[01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:39.750]
who was on one of those talking head shows on Sunday on CNN.

[01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:41.990]
What do they call that show with that press?

[01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:43.590]
No, not ETH press.

[01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:48.130]
Were they diagnosed the median?

[01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:48.910]
All out of the crap?

[01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:50.170]
What was that a bad show?

[01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.750]
I don't know.

[01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:51.370]
A horrible show.

[01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:55.070]
Solomon is a top fundraiser for the presidential campaign

[01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.470]
of Barack Obama, but the organizers include supporters

[01:32:57.470 --> 01:33:00.050]
and fundraisers for both Obama and Senator Swilery.

[01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:02.990]
Many prominent figures in the American Jewish left,

[01:33:03.230 --> 01:33:03.690]
former lawmakers,

[01:33:03.690 --> 01:33:04.690]
new government officials,

[01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:06.650]
and several prominent Israeli figures

[01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:08.950]
as well as activists who raised money for the democracy

[01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:10.990]
alliance and move on.org are also involved.

[01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:14.250]
A controversial essay in 2006

[01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:16.610]
by two eminent academics, Harvard, Steven Waltz

[01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:18.710]
and University Chicago's John Muir Shimer

[01:33:18.710 --> 01:33:20.730]
argued that a powerful pro-Israeli lobby

[01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:22.970]
that includes Jewish groups, evangelical Christians

[01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:26.590]
and others has actively served to steer US policy

[01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:29.610]
in a pro-Israel direction, often against US's national interest.

[01:33:30.610 --> 01:33:33.090]
The essay pre-cursed it with 2007 book triggered

[01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:35.670]
an angry debate among supporters of Israel and beyond,

[01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:37.390]
and even those who've been critical groups,

[01:33:37.490 --> 01:33:39.610]
such as APEC, the most influential pro-Israeli

[01:33:39.610 --> 01:33:41.790]
lobby group in Washington, said the thesis was either

[01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:42.650]
wrong or overdrawn.

[01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:45.850]
A genesis of this is really the frustration

[01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.630]
on the part of a very substantial portion

[01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:49.930]
of the American Jewish community that despite the fact

[01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:51.990]
that there's brought support for a peace-oriented policy

[01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:53.930]
in the Middle East, there doesn't seem to be the political

[01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:55.810]
will to actually carry it out, but on me said,

[01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.950]
we haven't been effective at transmitting the message

[01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:59.790]
that there's political support for these positions

[01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:01.850]
of the American Jewish community and their allies.

[01:34:02.610 --> 01:34:04.370]
So as far as APEC is concerned,

[01:34:04.650 --> 01:34:06.230]
and Jew Lieberman and Wolflet's Quake,

[01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:08.410]
Hubsay and Dread, got it?

[01:34:08.670 --> 01:34:09.230]
Got it.

[01:34:09.450 --> 01:34:10.970]
Good, get it.

[01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:15.670]
So what day is your big lunch with Joe Bell?

[01:34:15.930 --> 01:34:16.250]
Do I order?

[01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:18.770]
Probably not gonna go to lunch.

[01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:21.270]
You know, you see, if you really wanted to be,

[01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.530]
have kind of a leg up on the thing, so to speak.

[01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:25.050]
Mm-hmm.

[01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:27.710]
Stop thinking about that, having a leg up on Joe Bell.

[01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:29.470]
Boy, what kind of a position would you have to take

[01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:29.910]
to do that?

[01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:31.150]
Where's the image it like you?

[01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:32.210]
Wouldn't have to stand there.

[01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:34.190]
Anyway, maybe buying a lunch would be a good idea.

[01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:36.030]
All right, I gotta be by my own side.

[01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:37.450]
Of course, a guy like him is gonna accept.

[01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:38.150]
Yeah.

[01:34:38.850 --> 01:34:40.070]
Wouldn't it be something if he accepted?

[01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:41.370]
So okay, George, I'd be great.

[01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:43.010]
I don't know, he makes a lot more money than I do.

[01:34:44.210 --> 01:34:46.270]
Well, you think he's gonna pay for it out of his pocket?

[01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:47.630]
You think he don't have an expense account?

[01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:48.890]
Even with East Chief bastards?

[01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:49.670]
Oh, you never know.

[01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:51.830]
That'd be a good idea.

[01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:52.550]
Let's play that bit.

[01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:54.990]
Pay your bill, that's what I'm talking about.

[01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:57.490]
Oh, over and over again.

[01:34:59.290 --> 01:35:01.230]
How long do you think, how many seconds do you think

[01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:02.470]
before I get an email saying,

[01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:05.010]
oh, you know that the signature wasn't really a carol

[01:35:05.010 --> 01:35:05.490]
and be deleted.

[01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.030]
30 seconds to lay, plus another 30 degree email.

[01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:08.610]
Yeah, about two minutes.

[01:35:09.790 --> 01:35:11.150]
I wish Neil would blank.

[01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:13.310]
768 votes.

[01:35:13.610 --> 01:35:15.110]
Change nothing, 276.

[01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:16.570]
Take calls to 15.

[01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:18.990]
We took some calls that will take some more as a matter of fact.

[01:35:19.450 --> 01:35:19.930]
Aren't you excited?

[01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.790]
Woo!

[01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:22.610]
I don't know what the screen or stick my finger,

[01:35:22.730 --> 01:35:23.690]
deep in my nose.

[01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:26.650]
Live forever, 196.

[01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:28.610]
Stop reading stories, 40.

[01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:31.110]
Like that one you just read there about those Jews.

[01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.630]
Retire, 26.

[01:35:33.890 --> 01:35:34.170]
Retire!

[01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:34.790]
No.

[01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:38.230]
In fact, the reason I sent a contract was just to piss off

[01:35:38.230 --> 01:35:39.210]
those people who keep telling me,

[01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:39.670]
we're tired!

[01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:41.930]
No, I'm gonna be here forever just to piss them off.

[01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:43.210]
Just aggravate them.

[01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:45.110]
Even if I worked for nothing.

[01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:48.450]
Croke, oh, I look at that Eric and Bella should a little bit.

[01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:49.950]
Croke and Diawik are dead, 15.

[01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:52.330]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

[01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:52.810]
At a boy, Eric.

[01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:55.630]
And then the best part of it is,

[01:35:55.690 --> 01:35:57.410]
I think Eric was one of those who voted for it.

[01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:59.350]
Now, Eric loves me.

[01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:03.610]
Eric is, he's one of the tried and true staples of this show.

[01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:06.430]
We can always count on Eric, you know what I'm saying?

[01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.790]
Mm-hmm.

[01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:09.810]
We have a technical problem like that thing with the

[01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:10.850]
a backup power supply.

[01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.330]
You know what's happened?

[01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:14.330]
Everything is nice and quiet now and everything is calm down.

[01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:15.290]
I have to be empathic.

[01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:17.350]
As a matter of fact, I hate to admit this,

[01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:22.430]
but I feel so much less stressed out now that we assign that thing,

[01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.630]
you know?

[01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:25.530]
Maybe that sounds silly to you.

[01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:27.730]
But when you get to be 100 years old,

[01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:31.010]
security, job security, especially during these times,

[01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:33.370]
you know, these perilous times in which we live.

[01:36:33.610 --> 01:36:33.690]
Right.

[01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:34.450]
Yeah, I can relate.

[01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:37.290]
Job security is not a bad idea.

[01:36:37.410 --> 01:36:38.990]
No one at your next paycheck is coming.

[01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:41.650]
And by the way, Jolly Jo's done a great job with that.

[01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:44.210]
The checks actually show up a day or two early every time now.

[01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:46.650]
At a boy, Jolly Jo, thank you so much.

[01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.950]
See?

[01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:48.370]
Now I'm kissing his fat ass.

[01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:50.630]
What do you think of that?

[01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:52.070]
Uh-huh.

[01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:54.150]
Well, I think, you know, as long as we're going to be here

[01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:56.070]
a long time, and I'm assuming you will be too,

[01:36:56.190 --> 01:36:57.050]
although you never know with it.

[01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:58.470]
I'll let crap you were talking this morning.

[01:36:59.090 --> 01:36:59.310]
Yeah.

[01:37:00.330 --> 01:37:01.970]
Well, George needs more money, okay?

[01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:03.850]
George needs some more money.

[01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:04.590]
That's all.

[01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:06.970]
All the money they're saving from not paying me anymore.

[01:37:07.050 --> 01:37:08.110]
They ought to give you a little bit of it.

[01:37:08.170 --> 01:37:08.890]
Not too much.

[01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:11.750]
Because if they give you too much,

[01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:12.890]
then you'll get used to it, you know?

[01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:13.470]
Oh, yeah.

[01:37:14.690 --> 01:37:15.750]
And then you'll spend it.

[01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:16.830]
Oh, right.

[01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:19.650]
Yeah, you know, whatever you'll make, listen to me.

[01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:22.410]
Whatever you make, you'll spend it.

[01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:24.650]
And I can tell you.

[01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:26.530]
Yeah, well, getting out of debt would be a great place

[01:37:26.530 --> 01:37:27.550]
to start spending it.

[01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:29.790]
Well, why don't you have your pay off on your bills?

[01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:30.710]
Sure.

[01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:31.370]
Here you go, Joe.

[01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:33.610]
Just hand him the bills.

[01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.870]
Mine too.

[01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:35.830]
No.

[01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:38.090]
No, we don't care about your bills, okay?

[01:37:38.730 --> 01:37:39.290]
You've got to...

[01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:41.230]
I mean, you should kiss the guy that you got back in there

[01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:42.670]
after Mo blew you out, you know?

[01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.850]
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

[01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:45.390]
And then you didn't have the balls to come on here

[01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:47.050]
and tell the audience it's a truth about it.

[01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:48.930]
They were in a vice.

[01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:51.770]
Your balls were in a vice?

[01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:54.810]
Not nice.

[01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.330]
It's a device.

[01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:56.690]
It's a device, yeah.

[01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:59.210]
Yeah, the moment he did the good, I'm not your backpack.

[01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:02.350]
That is a good bit, though, because if that wouldn't have happened.

[01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:05.870]
None, he did he do that before you got candy or afterward.

[01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:07.610]
No, like the day after.

[01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:09.050]
The day after, right?

[01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.810]
Or click on that.

[01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:11.710]
Man, he's right, he's timely, he's topical.

[01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:15.930]
If it happened, like in the mid-1950s, he's on top of it.

[01:38:17.050 --> 01:38:17.990]
Like Ozzy and Harriet.

[01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:20.130]
Life was Riley.

[01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:24.550]
Now you haven't lunch with him any time soon, like today.

[01:38:24.730 --> 01:38:27.630]
Like we had a conversation since last time you asked five minutes ago.

[01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:28.310]
Yeah.

[01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:29.710]
No, it was like hours ago.

[01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:31.510]
And?

[01:38:31.890 --> 01:38:35.630]
Normally, I would have lunch with him today, but I'm B.C. with taxes.

[01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:41.610]
Guy, in your income bracket actually has to pay taxes.

[01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:43.510]
That's amazing, isn't it?

[01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:44.590]
Tragic.

[01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:45.470]
It's American F&W.

[01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:48.270]
If I didn't have to pay taxes the last ten years, I wouldn't be here right now.

[01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.890]
You'd be talking.

[01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:50.190]
Hey, everybody.

[01:38:50.890 --> 01:38:51.770]
It's a beautiful day, man.

[01:38:51.850 --> 01:38:52.210]
It's sunny.

[01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:54.190]
Let me take a look at what the temperature is right now.

[01:38:55.570 --> 01:38:56.910]
Let me take a puke at it.

[01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.830]
Nine.

[01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:02.010]
Going to be 12 today, 16 tomorrow at 61.

[01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:08.290]
20 on Thursday, that's 68 freaking degrees, and 19, 66 on Friday.

[01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:10.430]
Spring is sprung, baby.

[01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:12.370]
I've no or a thine at a time to get out of that place.

[01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:15.070]
You know what I mean?

[01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:18.110]
Well, time jikesses, I'm coming back down there, forever.

[01:39:18.970 --> 01:39:20.330]
I'll be a good day for today.

[01:39:22.130 --> 01:39:23.530]
Of exploding balls.

[01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:25.370]
Did you see all the eating out of the West Book?

[01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:27.490]
Yeah, I know what that is.

[01:39:27.930 --> 01:39:28.230]
Sure.

[01:39:28.670 --> 01:39:29.890]
Couldn't possibly be us.

[01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:32.070]
What you're back to back?

[01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.810]
Where you home?

[01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:35.850]
Wait for long, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:37.570]
What you're back to back?

[01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:38.150]
Where you home?

[01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:39.550]
Wait for long, no, no, no, no.

[01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:46.890]
I gotta think about on top of getting raped, and I don't need a rating that's a minus eight.

[01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:48.410]
Don't care what you do.

[01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:49.690]
I'm gonna send a snort.

[01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:52.530]
You gotta wait a little hotter on the guess to your block.

[01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:54.310]
A roll shit gets to go.

[01:39:55.150 --> 01:39:57.070]
There's a lot of fat producers, you know.

[01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:58.030]
That's right.

[01:39:58.110 --> 01:39:58.630]
Watch your back.

[01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:59.170]
That's that.

[01:39:59.170 --> 01:40:04.870]
Well you won't wait for no more, no more, no more, no more, no more, but you're back, back, back,

[01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:06.650]
Well you won't wait for no more, no more.

[01:40:08.610 --> 01:40:11.150]
Oh, brother, all that blah, blah, I don't know this thing.

[01:40:11.650 --> 01:40:14.090]
Now you can eat from a trot while you're in both hands.

[01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:16.930]
That big fat patch of meat are raining smooth.

[01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:19.630]
You just might climp in it all your fault.

[01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:21.630]
That is straightened your fat ass out.

[01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:24.330]
That roll will take the food out of your mouth.

[01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:26.190]
That's right, that's your fat fat.

[01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:46.510]
Yeah.

[01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:52.870]
Don't know where you're going, don't know oh my, no.

[01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:56.170]
Watch your back sack, because you never know who's wielding that described

[01:40:56.190 --> 01:41:00.190]
Sharp knife who's gonna that's sure that's getting ready to stick it in there, you know, I mean

[01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:03.590]
I'm always watching my background here

[01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:08.450]
1218 a few of you know, what do you mean by that who we got now that's oh, that's right you got jerks

[01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:14.230]
It's just the business, you know the nature of the beast jerks who did not call me yesterday and invite me to well

[01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:15.210]
He probably didn't have my number

[01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:18.770]
Don't give him my number

[01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:23.310]
He I'm sure you would have called him if I take me to like an early dinner, you know before the heat

[01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:29.550]
Lost you guys out of strip club. I can see it him buying you lap dancing. Yeah. Oh, yeah, right

[01:41:30.450 --> 01:41:33.650]
Obviously too much drugs are affected what used to be a fine mind your

[01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:41.150]
790 votes on the pool. Let's take some calls. What do you say 5 6 7 0 5 60 boy? I'm all whipped up today like I said

[01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:45.230]
I feel like I got a decent life plus it looks so beautiful outside and

[01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:48.530]
Guess what's gonna happen to a clock? You're gonna go to whip right?

[01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:49.070]
right

[01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:55.890]
And floods my gut zone have a good time of win maybe 20 30 grand when I can have maybe a $1 jackpot on the wheel of fortune

[01:41:55.890 --> 01:42:02.390]
That's a sucker back that dollar wheel of fortune bring a plastic bag just in case for what the can't have any

[01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:04.050]
No, just gave you have an accident

[01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:10.430]
See one thing about woodbind is they have lots of fine

[01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:15.750]
Tea rooms all over the facility there within arms reach well almost

[01:42:16.610 --> 01:42:21.750]
Oh, I will say this I can think of a couple of occasions speaking about when it's really crowded and those damn old Chinese mom

[01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:26.890]
Won't get out of your way and you know, and I'm kind of waddling back toward the magic room back there and

[01:42:26.890 --> 01:42:30.330]
And like some old fart will get in your way like and not move

[01:42:31.130 --> 01:42:34.450]
Yeah, and then you take a step and then all of a sudden they take a step. It's like they're like a

[01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:39.570]
Baddering ram like they're in you like a obstacle course. I've noticed that about old people not that you know

[01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:43.010]
They're at the top of their physical game anyway, but obviously they're not in a hurry

[01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:47.910]
So they shuffle right they shuffle so they must presume you're not either

[01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:54.170]
That's not that they presume anything about you they're not even or they don't even know that you exist

[01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:57.830]
They don't care that you're not okay. You're not there

[01:42:58.610 --> 01:43:00.450]
Yeah, I'm gonna get off that damn wheel of fortune

[01:43:00.450 --> 01:43:04.790]
I'm gonna start playing me some stuff with some thing. I'm gonna play that mega bucks and win millions

[01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:08.150]

[01:43:08.150 --> 01:43:10.210]
All right, higher a hitman

[01:43:11.290 --> 01:43:12.770]
Either way problem solved

[01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:52.830]
You haven't filed yet and you need the money back to refund right badly obviously well there was a chain of events

[01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:57.190]
Yeah, a shame yeah, I shouldn't await until the front

[01:43:57.190 --> 01:44:00.650]
I should before you would be back and like March would have been good like a little a March

[01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:02.030]
There's no question, but nevertheless

[01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:05.230]

[01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:15.370]
I do file as early as possible, but this is about that big fat check that the government's gonna send you in your family

[01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:16.070]
I can't wait

[01:44:16.690 --> 01:44:18.430]
Are you gonna get one? Yeah?

[01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:24.030]

When you hear this you're not gonna know whether to laugh or cry all right

[01:44:44.890 --> 01:44:51.130]
Seriously and these are the kind of stories that just I shouldn't even read them because they're so depressing to me. Oh great

[01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:54.030]
That's the American way

True story got father Trillion

[01:46:12.250 --> 01:46:18.830]
Yes, I was auditioning for the role of Sonny Corleone James Con made a recommendation for the part of Lucca Brassie

[01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:24.630]
He has just come off filming Ryan song and the recommendation was made for dick podcast

[01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:26.510]
To pay to play

[01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:32.470]
Look at Brassie. I was seriously considered but the timing of the taping couldn't be done around the bear schedule

[01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:35.830]
So they had a pass on them. No, I'll be honest. They didn't look Italian at them

[01:46:39.070 --> 01:46:42.410]
Yeah, I think much of this look of proxy. Yeah

[01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:46.270]
No wonder they shot him on a cause way, you know it

[01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:51.910]
There's a nice to have them there. Thanks for the good news, pal. Yeah

[01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:00.010]
Oh

[01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:05.970]
It's so schmalti man. It just makes you feel even the glory Mark filling even the pope is filling about that music

[01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:11.970]
Because he can relate I bet you he's been essentially I bet he's got a lot of good pizons over there in citida and Corleone

[01:47:11.970 --> 01:47:12.710]
Yep

[01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:18.430]
Remember when no, what's his name done? I don't know Tom Tomasino pulled up in that old gelopy his right

[01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:24.210]
Michael was walking with the two bodyguards and sister. Yeah, and he asked him where he was going. He looked at him

[01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:25.150]
Corleone

[01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:30.710]
Take my car take my now. I want to walk take my car. Please

[01:47:32.290 --> 01:47:36.330]
Portontano, you know that scene where he gets shot in the foot when you're running away after a right

[01:47:37.190 --> 01:47:38.550]
After done Corleone's

[01:47:46.730 --> 01:47:48.210]
Yeah, I'm sure that's what he was saying

[01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:53.790]
You know what you're gonna be probably sad to say it and I don't know. I'm an emotional old queen

[01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:54.930]
I guess but it

[01:47:55.510 --> 01:48:00.810]
It's sad to me the scene where he where he the kid when he's a little kidney escapes because they wanted to kill him

[01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:06.310]
Remember they were looking for little yeah, yeah, and he gets on the boat and the ship and the rhymes at Ellis Island

[01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:08.210]
Mm-hmm, and he's got like

[01:48:09.010 --> 01:48:10.970]
Just a handful of stuff his life

[01:48:11.530 --> 01:48:15.390]
Bloing soon his arm got a satchel there. Yeah, that's right paper back to page and

[01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:17.830]
And you know, he's like all alone

[01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:21.430]
Yeah, I'm really putting in quarantine because he has smallpox or whatever. They always remember them

[01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:24.010]
And he's there. Here's this little kid all alone, you know

[01:48:24.010 --> 01:48:27.730]
Yeah, he did all right though. Huh? He did all right. Yeah, he did okay

[01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:32.550]
He did okay for little long. I'm getting Brad. Mm-hmm

[01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:37.410]

Yeah, and you know she can cut like from

[01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:49.990]
Diagol and then you push him

[01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:54.050]
Not every time they kill somebody in the godfather. They got to push him afterwards or insult the carcass somehow

[01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:59.410]
Kick the days like when Sonny beat the crap out of Carlo. Well, it's three three remember sure or don't for Nuccia

[01:48:59.410 --> 01:49:00.950]
You know, he shoots him and then he kicks him over

[01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:07.610]
Remember that yeah, of course and Sonny they shoot him on the cause weight then they kick him in the head and how about for Frankie

[01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:11.510]
Pentangely when they thought he was dead too right Frankie five angels

[01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:14.290]
He left him for dead

[01:49:14.290 --> 01:49:21.070]
And Don Corleone says hello or this is for you. Whatever they said remember that Michael Corleone says a lot Michael Corleone says hi

[01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:22.770]
And how you doing like that?

[01:51:31.710 --> 01:51:33.210]
Yeah, what a pig

[01:51:34.130 --> 01:51:38.310]
Where the hell did I see some good cookies the other day? Oh, it was at my one of my local markets

[01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:43.070]
I was checking out. I was at the checkout and I had like some you know hot dogs and cheese and

[01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:49.130]
usual actin's kind of stuff that I buy when I'm planning on eating you know just eating that and of course I don't and

[01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:54.710]
It's a beautiful like macadamia nut chip cookies or something like that mm-hmm. You know what I mean? Yeah

[01:51:55.230 --> 01:51:56.690]
Mm-hmm. I didn't buy any though

[01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:59.470]
good why I

[01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.490]
didn't want

[01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:04.910]
Can I get to this story? This is a very important. No, it isn't

[01:52:15.570 --> 01:52:16.030]
And

[01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:19.130]
You wonder why Norm hates you. No, I don't wonder why Norm hates me

[01:52:19.130 --> 01:52:25.330]
Some Ohio lawmakers are pushing new plans to allow students to carry concealed weapons at public university

[01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:26.270]
Oh, right

[01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:34.710]
Some students are in favor of such a law saying that's might be what it would take to stop the next campus government news channel five in Ohio reports

[01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:41.010]
Would you rather just sit there covering it a desk when somebody executes you or you rather have a chance to defend your life

[01:52:41.010 --> 01:52:46.710]
That's what it really boils down to said Ohio student Michael flip craft. I wonder if Michael flitz

[01:52:48.370 --> 01:52:50.590]
I wonder if Michael's got a

[01:52:50.590 --> 01:52:51.090]
flip

[01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:58.550]
Oh, I was one of at least eight states currently considering allowing guns on campus, but supporters know they have an uphill battle

[01:52:59.250 --> 01:53:02.870]
Flip craft is licensed to carry concealed weapon on the streets, but can't bring it to school

[01:53:03.930 --> 01:53:09.750]
To me it makes no sense I can defend myself legally over there, but I'm a felon if I step on a grass over here said flip craft

[01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:16.630]
Utah Colorado and Virginia already allowed guns on campus although it's up to school officials to set policy

[01:53:17.710 --> 01:53:22.470]
Still most students aren't convinced as they say the idea scares them and you know something in damn well auto-scaram

[01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:28.990]
Somebody looking over your shoulder try to steal your answers on the exam. Turn them on and pull them away. Okay, they won't do it again

[01:53:31.590 --> 01:53:32.070]
Oh

[01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:35.110]
Only in America would they even be considering such lunacy

[01:53:37.070 --> 01:53:44.730]
Since 1966 they've been about a dozen college campus shootings as tragic as they were experts content campuses are still among the safest place for young adults

[01:53:45.650 --> 01:53:50.810]
I don't think the answer to bullets flying system or bullets flying said Ron hold of weaver state universities

[01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:53.250]
And then how you say exact weaver state. Yes

[01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:55.750]
Well why I don't know

[01:53:56.370 --> 01:53:57.850]
Remember that great boar dick weaver?

[01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.690]
Nope

[01:53:59.410 --> 01:53:59.990]
Dick Weber

[01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:03.690]
How about the Dunk harder? Yes Eddie Koalux

[01:54:05.010 --> 01:54:09.350]
Buddy bull mar thermon gibson thermon monsoon not thermon gibson

[01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:13.370]
Herman monsteria. So it's like lustrous John Kerry

[01:54:14.130 --> 01:54:18.190]
The security chief at university since and anything's the idea is a recipe for disaster

[01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:19.530]
disaster

[01:54:21.370 --> 01:54:24.910]
Somebody is shooting the office of response to the scene is a person there with a gun in their hand

[01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:28.350]
Now is that the bad guy or is that a citizen who's trying to help out siging for our

[01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:30.630]
Flipcraft said he won't give up

[01:54:31.690 --> 01:54:35.510]
I do see it in the future eventually said it might take her 10 or 15 years for it to happen

[01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:40.970]
But people being able to defend their lives on campus. He said is what it's all about and the proposals gaining support of course

[01:54:42.090 --> 01:54:45.810]
Because it's America man and real man like Charlton has to know

[01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:52.150]
From my cold dead hands and now they're cold and he's dead to which everybody can say

[01:54:52.150 --> 01:54:53.890]
All right

[01:54:54.710 --> 01:54:56.570]
What you on vacation after he croaked

[01:54:57.490 --> 01:55:00.150]
Yes, he croaked while I was still here

[01:55:02.150 --> 01:55:06.790]
And we may have a party that day. I forget I'm waiting. I blew a kazoo. All right

[01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:12.250]
Flipcraft said he won't give up. I do see the future 10 or 15 years for it to happen

[01:55:12.250 --> 01:55:19.730]
But people being able to defend their lives on campus the proposal is gaining support in national advocacy group students for concealed carry on campus

[01:55:20.410 --> 01:55:24.090]
Signed up thousands of people in recent months bringing its membership to 25,000

[01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:27.250]
Students for concealed carry on campus

[01:55:28.230 --> 01:55:33.810]
As they didn't put guns in them and it titled the group just carry on you know like luggage sure

[01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:37.230]
Citizens for carry on luggage

[01:55:39.490 --> 01:55:45.370]
Only crazy people would do things like this so they don't want any more violence on campus, but they're gonna allow you bring a gun out of campus

[01:55:45.370 --> 01:55:48.210]
They're gonna encourage you to have a gun if they if they pass this

[01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:52.770]
Everybody because everybody also have watch you don't want to be the odd man out that's not on the first day

[01:55:53.450 --> 01:55:58.710]
That's right. I think that should be mandatory everybody who gets submission into any kind of a college university

[01:55:59.610 --> 01:55:59.970]
Anything

[01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:04.130]
Guns maybe they'll sell them at the bookstore. I got a better idea

[01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:09.870]
Let's instead of it instead of these tax rebate checks that the government sending out how about sending everybody a loaded gun sounds good to me

[01:56:11.630 --> 01:56:17.170]
And you know something they're showing the gas prices again now price of regular and let it rose more than a penny to

[01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:23.330]
$3.38 a gallon. That's another reason everybody should have a gun. Don't pay for the gas. Don't hold up the gas station

[01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.850]
That's right

[01:56:24.650 --> 01:56:28.050]
Say I'm pumping it and you're if you want me to pay your lump in it

[01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:34.270]
Right. Oh, there's a like felching again. I mean he's just he's like part of the wall paper there

[01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:35.950]
He's on there all 24 seven

[01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:38.190]
Him and Ricky take his sands says

[01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:40.290]
They have hyperventilator

[01:56:42.190 --> 01:56:47.030]
816 votes on the pool. I know are they happy that we took the cost today or what I don't think it was anything

[01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:51.450]
I mean it was it was like a nothing revolutionary it was fine

[01:56:51.450 --> 01:56:53.370]
I thought they were fairly interesting

[01:56:54.210 --> 01:56:57.910]
The guy father guy was fairly interesting not not tremendously but okay

[01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:01.130]
And the guy with a story about the old ladies in the um

[01:57:01.630 --> 01:57:03.710]
Where was it in a hair place?

[01:57:04.770 --> 01:57:05.430]
I forgot

[01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:10.650]
See that you're not being close enough attention not taking notes on this if you're really a cover

[01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:15.910]
That's what Norma says if you're really a producer doing their job you'd be taking tremendous notes detailed

[01:57:16.930 --> 01:57:22.690]
Like those idiots that they they log the stern sure if you see that stuff online ever uh-huh

[01:57:22.690 --> 01:57:27.670]
No, I haven't seen it on the wearer. Uh every minute of every show every day

Oh, and how he farted at 12 at the 840 and the robin

[01:57:32.410 --> 01:57:34.710]
Sniffed it and she puked in like that, you know

[01:57:36.990 --> 01:57:41.410]
What these people are desperately try to announce to the world is simple. I have no life. That's right

[01:57:41.410 --> 01:57:46.010]
I have no life. I have no life. There's so many of those people. I have no life. I have no life

[01:57:47.130 --> 01:57:51.730]
817 votes. I wish Neil would blank change nothing to 90

[01:57:52.690 --> 01:57:58.470]
Take calls to 30 see a lot of people wanted calls we gave them to them what you want we give it here uh sometime

[01:57:59.750 --> 01:58:01.270]
Although sometime I don't want

[01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:05.530]
I'm just a friend. I what is that what

[01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:11.870]
Crawler toolbars encountered a problem needs to close. We're sorry if it inconvenience look at out of here

[01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:16.730]
Crawler way. What does that mean crawler toolbar has encountered a problem

[01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:22.010]
You're you're using a crawler toolbar? No, I'm not like I'd like 800 toolbars up there

[01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:26.390]
You know I see it as someone I see you should get rid of um, let me think all of them

[01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:32.530]
No, okay. I wish you would change nothing to 90 take calls to 30 live forever to await. Yeah

[01:58:33.150 --> 01:58:35.830]
I'll do it stop reading stories 44

[01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:41.590]
Only 5% stop reading story that means 95% of the people we still have listening say oh, yeah, it's okay

[01:58:42.230 --> 01:58:43.910]
Read on old man

Anybody has aüm

[01:59:04.690 --> 01:59:07.850]
The same thing from our way

[01:59:09.330 --> 01:59:12.310]
You vote for me при your name and food that's

Everybody's running bad, yeah, fascist USA

[01:59:32.970 --> 01:59:38.590]
In the act of patriotism, you're watching all of you

[01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:46.350]
Everyone does a suspicion, so what would you do?

[01:59:47.970 --> 01:59:53.450]
This is a distortion, and all you might love is

[01:59:54.650 --> 02:00:00.830]
In bush for the landmation, fascist USA

[02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:10.190]
You've gotta take those jewels, and Christmas if I rose to you

[02:00:10.190 --> 02:00:17.770]
Believe everything we say, on the state of renewals

[02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:24.050]
Bloodwater for cornflets, fill up your escalaries

[02:00:25.110 --> 02:00:30.950]
A roof in tiny bush venue, fascist USA

[02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:38.810]
We don't mind to see our jobs go, about the time of his good

[02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:43.630]
We're fast and they didn't buy chain, no

[02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:47.930]
Back them, for he's not stupid books

[02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:54.310]
All the hour is waiting, the tax of our hidden way

[02:00:56.570 --> 02:01:01.210]
Everybody's turning bad, yeah, fascist USA

[02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:05.950]
Alright, this is working every way, baby 1247-560-WOMER

[02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:09.850]
We got the Jerp Show come up at 2, as we'll go over those stats again

[02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:14.170]
From last night's heat loss to the erectors right here at the air Canada Center

[02:01:14.170 --> 02:01:15.890]
I'm sorry, the Scare Canada Center

[02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:20.410]
I don't want to rip off Walter's name's material

[02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.570]
Please don't

[02:01:21.570 --> 02:01:26.570]
So to prove to you that everybody is full of crap, Jim, this is a good facts, however, however

[02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:30.890]
It says, Uncle God, now I know why you stopped taking calls

[02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:34.290]
While interesting, Dick Buckers wasn't even close to coaching the bears yet

[02:01:34.290 --> 02:01:35.930]
When the Godfather was filmed

[02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:40.550]
Let me ask you a question, Zach, what years did Dick Buckers coach the bears?

[02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:43.030]
I'm not sure, Zach answers that when he gets back in here

[02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:44.270]
Where the hell is he?

[02:01:44.770 --> 02:01:45.550]
I don't know

[02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:46.910]
He never coached the bears

[02:01:48.330 --> 02:01:51.830]
I was pretty sure that, and then I just googled it for the entire list of all

[02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:54.130]
Maybe they're confusing Dick Buckers with Mike Ditka

[02:01:55.150 --> 02:01:59.670]
Anyways, as in general the call is information about his reliable is a $1 real afforture machine

[02:01:59.670 --> 02:02:01.150]
Or wet dream, right Jim?

[02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:04.490]
Sorry about the five years you were sentenced to an edisolum, it says

[02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:06.350]
But for selfish reasons I couldn't be happier

[02:02:06.350 --> 02:02:09.470]
The Father that dump gives you as priceless for your Father

[02:02:10.090 --> 02:02:13.550]
Make sure you're a stick's amount and Chris, well, whatever it's in

[02:02:15.150 --> 02:02:17.750]
So he wants you to stick around but Chris, whatever

[02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:19.370]
Well, I put it back in

[02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:21.030]
That means of course, if you

[02:02:21.850 --> 02:02:24.330]
Dick Buckers, let me know if he ever comes back

[02:02:24.330 --> 02:02:24.710]
I will

[02:02:25.570 --> 02:02:28.390]
He hasn't converted very much to us today, I'm glad that he's there

[02:02:28.390 --> 02:02:31.790]
It's better than the alternative having, like yesterday it was just me and Chris

[02:02:32.250 --> 02:02:33.130]
It was okay

[02:02:33.130 --> 02:02:34.550]
I called everybody

[02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:36.410]
What do you mean by that?

[02:02:36.610 --> 02:02:36.990]
I called him what?

[02:02:37.150 --> 02:02:41.370]
And of course, Cortus came in there in the morning to, you know, suck around him and ran out

[02:02:41.370 --> 02:02:43.010]
I called him, right?

[02:02:43.690 --> 02:02:45.350]
I called him, I called him, I got so much work

[02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:46.750]
Try to get Greg in here

[02:02:47.370 --> 02:02:51.090]
Claire did do something, Greg, one of the other morning guys, morning producers

[02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:52.210]
Greg Reed?

[02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:53.530]
Yeah, him

[02:02:54.030 --> 02:02:56.330]
Now I can see him handling the board

[02:02:58.190 --> 02:02:58.730]
That's back

[02:02:58.730 --> 02:03:02.210]
Oh, it's back, so anyway, he's got a happy face of it, must have been what you said

[02:03:05.070 --> 02:03:06.210]
Joyce, are we right?

[02:03:07.170 --> 02:03:07.570]
Yeah

[02:03:08.890 --> 02:03:15.530]
Anyway, it says, while interesting this fact from Jim, Dick Buckers was even close to coaching the Bears yet when the Godfather was filmed

[02:03:16.170 --> 02:03:16.610]
72

[02:03:17.230 --> 02:03:21.110]
I was asking you, what year's Dick Buckers was the coach of the Bears?

[02:03:22.230 --> 02:03:23.590]
I got no idea

[02:03:23.590 --> 02:03:25.470]
He was never the coach of the Bears

[02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:27.050]
Exactly, like I said

[02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:30.370]
Mike Dicker was the coach of the Bears, that's who I'm thinking that they're confusing here

[02:03:30.930 --> 02:03:31.590]
Like that?

[02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:33.550]
Buckers played for the moment he could have been

[02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:37.450]
Right, as a matter of fact, Buckers was still playing in 73

[02:03:41.650 --> 02:03:47.210]
Here, this is funny, it says, Norma sends me a text message or an email

[02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:52.650]
And he was still playing for the Bears until 73 of Dick Buckers

[02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:58.270]
Norma cancels, that is funny, I get on the card to go to lunch flip on your show and I hear you wonder why Norm hates you?

[02:03:59.050 --> 02:04:03.290]
No, I don't hate George, but if there was extra money for QM to throw around, I would have made it come your way

[02:04:06.610 --> 02:04:08.810]
Oh wait, wait till you hear this, G.

[02:04:12.190 --> 02:04:14.850]
Keep in mind though, he doesn't hate you, of course

[02:04:14.850 --> 02:04:20.950]
He says they will be grudgingly or happily keeping because you want him there, which is correct, and for no other reason

[02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:24.210]
Because they're only going to offer him nominal increases at best

[02:04:24.210 --> 02:04:29.210]
And as you said, he has the loosens of grandeur, which I could never realistically meet

[02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:31.170]
So it's better for him to find that out from self

[02:04:32.690 --> 02:04:34.530]
I said you had the loosens of grandeur?

[02:04:34.770 --> 02:04:35.330]
You must have

[02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:39.270]
If you have not read this on the ear, it is not for publication

[02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:42.830]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:45.970]
Oh, Norma, I guess, is Joseph to get back on the ear somewhere

[02:04:45.970 --> 02:04:50.090]
If he'd been that funny on the light bulb, maybe he'd still be on somewhere, but we can only hope not

[02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:53.650]
So anyway, they're going to offer you nominal increases, now is that going to be okay?

[02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:56.050]
I mean, it depends on how nominal

[02:04:56.050 --> 02:04:58.970]
Well, don't tip your hat, yeah, don't show your hand

[02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:04.050]
Or your foot, or your ass, don't show it

[02:05:05.070 --> 02:05:07.510]
So that indicates they might offer you some increase

[02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:09.170]
Now would that be good?

[02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:10.810]
We better than not

[02:05:10.810 --> 02:05:11.310]
Right

[02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:13.170]
We have a starting point

[02:05:13.170 --> 02:05:13.450]
Yeah

[02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:17.190]
Joseph says we'll offer you an extra 50 bucks a week or something like that, you say, well how about 200?

[02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:18.930]
And he says, well, how about 30?

[02:05:20.610 --> 02:05:21.770]
About 30, man

[02:05:22.450 --> 02:05:26.570]
And then you get up and do a dump on the dinner table there in the room

[02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:30.230]
Are sure he doesn't take you to that place where they took me and Bruce Beasley?

[02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.570]
What place is that?

[02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:33.350]
That place in plantation?

[02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:34.010]
I have

[02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:36.290]
No, wasn't the I have, it was worse

[02:05:36.650 --> 02:05:40.470]
No, the soup was very good, but the steak was kaka, man, it was bad

[02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:41.710]
What's the name of that joint?

[02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:43.650]
It's on that arouard boulevard

[02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:47.090]
And it's kind of like a cross from the brouard mall

[02:05:49.670 --> 02:05:50.250]
Stated beef

[02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:50.930]
Huh?

[02:05:51.330 --> 02:05:52.310]
What kind of place is it here?

[02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:54.810]
It's like a, like a doll's kind of place

[02:05:54.810 --> 02:05:59.330]
Like one of those places I can't say a name, but it's like west, just a little bit west of the brouard mall

[02:05:59.770 --> 02:06:00.730]
I'm brouard boulevard

[02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:03.470]
It's a little strip shopping center

[02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:06.770]
I never had heard of it before and hopefully I won't hear it again

[02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:09.390]
But anyway, that's where they took me lunch like a year ago December

[02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:12.610]
Can it be really a year ago December?

[02:06:13.710 --> 02:06:16.410]
And that was the first time I think I met Jolly Jo Bell

[02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:18.470]
Was there ever a second time I don't believe so

[02:06:19.410 --> 02:06:21.190]
That's the first time we ever met, pushed to push

[02:06:24.190 --> 02:06:24.950]
And you know what?

[02:06:25.190 --> 02:06:25.790]
It was enough

[02:06:27.110 --> 02:06:29.090]
I mean he was very cordial and very Jolly

[02:06:29.090 --> 02:06:31.230]
You know, I mean if you're going to be Jolly Jo you have to be Jolly

[02:06:31.230 --> 02:06:35.870]
But then Bruce Beasley was ranting on about how we want to be the best sports station in the market

[02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:37.850]
And I kept thinking, what the hell do I care about that?

[02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.210]
You know?

[02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:41.130]
Why do I care about how he believes in a good

[02:06:41.130 --> 02:06:43.330]
And an honest day's work for an honest day's pay

[02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:47.390]
That's what you should say, George, you're willing to do an honest day's work if you can get an honest day's pay

[02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:48.050]
Yeah, that'd be good

[02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:49.310]
And they like that

[02:06:49.890 --> 02:06:52.910]
And then tell them that you're really all enthused about that Beasley stock

[02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:56.710]
And you're going to buy, if they give you a raise you're going to buy a whole bunch of it and boost their stock price up

[02:06:56.710 --> 02:06:58.190]
And just make up a bunch of crap

[02:06:58.190 --> 02:06:58.570]
Sure

[02:06:59.930 --> 02:07:01.730]
So that's what Norma says now what do you think?

[02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:03.830]
I think I did say you have illusions of grandeur

[02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:07.450]
Because you think that they're going to give you a big time money there

[02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.790]
And they're not

[02:07:10.490 --> 02:07:10.850]
What?

[02:07:11.650 --> 02:07:11.930]
What?

[02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:15.770]
I don't even know where to start telling you what's wrong with that

[02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:17.350]
Okay, well go ahead

[02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:18.810]
It'll kill some good time

[02:07:18.810 --> 02:07:20.210]
It's better than taking those stupid calls

[02:07:20.650 --> 02:07:22.970]
I thought that they were going to give me big money when

[02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:26.470]
Why do I mean big money but we're compared to what you're making?

[02:07:31.530 --> 02:07:32.430]
I'm just stunned

[02:07:33.130 --> 02:07:33.490]
Well

[02:07:35.970 --> 02:07:40.210]
It's like we have the same conversation over and over and over again and it's like it never happened even once

[02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:42.870]
Yeah, which conversation was that?

[02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:45.450]
The one where you go off and bargain by yourself

[02:07:46.710 --> 02:07:49.510]
And then nobody has to be bargain with anybody

[02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:50.770]
I didn't bargain with anybody

[02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:52.870]
I've got a lawyer, I've got an agent, he bargain

[02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:57.410]
And the fact that it matters is we tried to bargain they said no this is it, period that's it

[02:07:57.410 --> 02:08:01.370]
That's the, that's the, the conversation that we had more than once was hey about this time around

[02:08:01.370 --> 02:08:06.210]
That we work something out altogether and you said okay great that's what's going to happen this time around

[02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:10.890]
Working it out altogether men including you two guys in the deal

[02:08:10.890 --> 02:08:14.230]
You're both a guaranteed job for the duration through 2013

[02:08:14.230 --> 02:08:18.970]
It didn't ever mean then nor does it mean now that I'm going to demand that they pay

[02:08:18.970 --> 02:08:21.090]
Anybody extra amount of money for me to have a livelihood

[02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:23.150]
I have to be a crazy person to say

[02:08:23.150 --> 02:08:28.070]
A guaranteed job doesn't mean that they'll make you like an offer

[02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:29.530]
Like pay you any amount of money

[02:08:29.950 --> 02:08:31.490]
Like they could pay you off for me less

[02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:33.390]
You know, we're not going to offer you less

[02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:35.890]
You never know

[02:08:37.050 --> 02:08:39.250]
Well, I'm what do they, what are you going to do if they offer you less?

[02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:39.910]
What are you going to say?

[02:08:40.150 --> 02:08:45.170]
I guess I'll have to get a job somewhere because I can't see there's there's what you want to do and what you have to do

[02:08:45.170 --> 02:08:48.490]
You see when you have mouths to feed and mortgage to pay

[02:08:48.490 --> 02:08:54.230]
In other words now you're giving me the business because you think I should have insisted on what you said

[02:08:55.110 --> 02:08:57.830]
Somebody negotiating a salary for you and you're free to get an offer

[02:08:57.830 --> 02:09:05.170]
What I would be impression that I was under because it's what you said was that the negotiation would be done for the three of us all at the same time

[02:09:06.710 --> 02:09:07.410]
And it was

[02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:13.290]
Okay, but not in terms of dollars and cents you don't and Norma can't isn't your lawyer

[02:09:13.290 --> 02:09:20.150]
Is not your agent he don't want to what I know but what can I tell you I found that out after the fact

[02:09:21.970 --> 02:09:26.130]
Like today after you contacted the Jan Murray there

[02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:32.810]
Nobody signed anything with anybody the last conversation that we had on the issue was that norm was going to be negotiating something for

[02:09:32.810 --> 02:09:39.390]
Or negotiating anything I know and I found that out today not for Randy not for you yeah not for chicken I know not for a

[02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:47.910]
Zack that's not what you said weeks ago I'm at your pardon what you said before the last time that we had a conversation about it was that norm was going to work something out for

[02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:51.810]
I know something it didn't happen I I surprise I

[02:09:54.070 --> 02:10:02.850]
Know as much as you did and I know as much now as you do the jolly Joe said this and Norma said I told normal okay and that's said

[02:10:02.850 --> 02:10:10.310]
Then that I cited and Carolyn Beasley cited and we're working here through 2013 unless they make you an embarrassing offer and they chase you out

[02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:18.950]
Which it says right in the contract I have a right to continue to choose my producer which is you well unless they pay you an

[02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:21.250]
Invercing amount in which case we all walk out not

[02:10:23.150 --> 02:10:31.270]
Georgia's staging a walk out Joe yeah just relax okay it's a 15 to 8 worry about getting your taxes paid let me get you that's it

[02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:39.970]
Things will happen things will unfold because you took Joe you made him at the roller ring there I mean you guys bonding at the

[02:10:39.970 --> 02:10:47.110]
Roller-Duty whatever the hell it was I could be better than that yeah take him to the strip club take him to the swing club like

[02:10:47.110 --> 02:10:57.090]
What like Bob Green never worked for you really good not really I'll take care of George I'll take care of George I still feel it I still feel it not to mention the fact that

[02:10:57.090 --> 02:11:04.230]
Our close personal friend Cheryl sold me down a river got herself a nice all expense paid trip in exchange for talking me

[02:11:04.230 --> 02:11:11.130]
And not having an agent when saw foods went to jail I mean the audience doesn't have any idea what we're talking about we know what they find it fascinating

[02:11:17.110 --> 02:11:19.110]
I am the sports leader

[02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:29.490]
We have it is not the real when I'm up in Belkittiga slapping old women with painted lips around the pool I listen to the new Rogers one to two I mean I mean I listen to the new Rogers

[02:11:29.490 --> 02:11:31.050]
Fair and balanced one to two hour

[02:11:31.050 --> 02:11:31.370]
Whoa

[02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:40.690]
I'm Hillary Clinton if you find yourself an award to an region like Bosnia or East LA you have to make sure you're protected

[02:11:40.690 --> 02:11:46.550]
That's why I always wear acne bulletproof pants suits made from the strongest Kedlar

[02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:53.750]
Acne bulletproof pants suits deflect weapons fire and spins my waist hips and thighs now if only acclimated a

[02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:57.050]
Pantsuit that could deflect criticism when I remember

[02:11:58.870 --> 02:12:04.010]
He'll just gonna put pitch suit make my butt look fast oh my other

[02:12:04.410 --> 02:12:09.850]
Decotiate with the Israelis and Palestinians then answer that question yeah

[02:12:09.850 --> 02:12:17.270]
102 at 560 W.D. C. E.M. It's our gigantic one to two hour on a Tuesday April 15th pay the tax man maybe or else go to jail

[02:12:18.170 --> 02:12:26.510]
You know what I know here too much about anymore what those guys who used to pedal that oh you don't have to pay tax and buy our book and we'll tell you

[02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:28.310]
And of course they all want up in jail

[02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:36.710]
Maybe that's why we don't hear about them too much anymore that could be here is somebody who says are you thinking J Alexander's absolutely correct sir

[02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:42.370]
Yeah I got the wrong correct place now have you ever been there no no don't think I'm gonna be go

[02:12:43.010 --> 02:12:47.310]
I mean maybe I just got the wrong thing on the wrong day I don't know the soup was awesome and it's a

[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:54.170]
Norma got I forget what the house soup is they got some special house soup that had everything but the kitchen sink and where he said it was just fabulous

[02:12:54.170 --> 02:13:05.950]
I think it's called runaway soup but it was looked really good I forget what kind of soup I had but was awesome and then the steak sucked nasty

[02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:11.730]
J Alexander it might be a fabulous place I don't know I'll tell you other place they're really sucks out by me out there in

[02:13:13.110 --> 02:13:18.830]
I think it's sunrise is it Fridays is it yeah okay

[02:13:20.190 --> 02:13:26.830]
your song around your own yeah by the cell crossing the song yeah it's Friday sucks blows

[02:13:29.670 --> 02:13:32.250]
they're all over the place though those Fridays restaurants it blows

[02:13:34.690 --> 02:13:37.690]
well I sure hope they weren't going to be our two for one deal this week that would be bad

[02:13:37.690 --> 02:13:43.830]
the Friday is that I'm sure it makes out yeah no well why when I why do you say that how do you know how do you know I don't

[02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:52.050]
but most for the most part aren't our deals like local places more or less not change not change I mean sometimes they have more than one location

[02:13:52.050 --> 02:13:59.250]
but even then it's like local places that are not a shame like blue moon fish company for example a 54 on a pool you're going to make I don't know

[02:13:59.250 --> 02:14:05.330]
whatever you make will make we don't care because George has all been out of shape because normal won't get him a big raise

[02:14:05.330 --> 02:14:11.090]
I think that was the essence of what he's saying in there is he's not going to be able to get you what you what he thinks you want

[02:14:11.090 --> 02:14:20.490]
what I will have delusions of is making a living well then in your in this business yeah totally that 50 years obviously I'm a crazy person yes

[02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:28.290]
and what business is that it's really not the radio business it's the QM its monkey business right it's the balls game business

[02:14:30.570 --> 02:14:37.230]
well speaking of balls the L6 hormone may affect stock trades how do you like that but there's Ali felching again for the four

[02:14:37.230 --> 02:14:44.850]
million time about the delta Northwest merger which I got that in my pile but everybody knows about it anyway so yeah why I won't get to it

[02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:52.750]
why why read stories on here that everybody knows right like like all the economy is bad oh no kidding really yeah

[02:14:53.270 --> 02:15:03.910]
gas is expensive oh wow the phone calls suck actually they weren't too bad today they were surprisingly there yeah not

[02:15:03.910 --> 02:15:09.710]
not fabulous and of course arguing about somebody who was the coach of the bears who never was the coach of the bears that's kind of

[02:15:09.710 --> 02:15:16.730]
pointless too but it was it was fun and it made me go Google it and go to Wikipedia where they listed all the bears coaches in history

[02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:21.770]
international hubs in Amsterdam and Tokyo this new deal the new delta

[02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:28.330]
Department of Transport have to approve this the shareholders have to approve it and right now the Northwest pilots don are not on

[02:15:28.330 --> 02:15:33.930]
side with this deal so let's say it gets all its approvals six to eight months down the road I think you took the best of now he's just got the

[02:15:33.930 --> 02:15:42.030]
pinstriped jacket on you know what he still looks extremely gay I think it's all on would you let me do this please

[02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:48.170]
if you want to argue again about your new deal how much what percentage do you want to increase I don't know how

[02:15:48.170 --> 02:15:57.090]
about 15 15 sure that's not very much no it's not a humble guy and how much you make it now now obviously not

[02:15:57.090 --> 02:16:02.770]
I say I haven't got any idea I have an idea how much you're making but I'm not making as much money now as I was when I was

[02:16:02.770 --> 02:16:10.050]
repoing cars 18 years ago well yeah I'm not I'm in starting next year I can say to you I'm not going to be making as much money now

[02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:15.650]
as I was when I started on the state see it's a little bit different see because you're not in danger of losing your house and

[02:16:15.650 --> 02:16:24.310]
becoming bankrupt and homeless how do you know I'm pretty sure my mortgage is almost paid off I'm just guessing I'm

[02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:31.210]
mortgage is almost completely paid off is that a wonderful thing it is and then what then then hey Georgia's

[02:16:31.210 --> 02:16:38.930]
right yeah then you refi I don't know then you get one of those reverse mortgages I don't know for you no for you

[02:16:39.890 --> 02:16:49.870]
for me okay yeah for Zach look I asked not what your talk host can do for you I don't want your money man no good

[02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:55.870]
because you're not getting it good I don't want it you're not getting it I don't want it why would you say that I'd never be like me

[02:16:55.870 --> 02:17:02.110]
saying I don't want your money right silly a lot of people want your money I'm not one of them oh here we go with this again

[02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:09.990]
huh and nothing I'm not one of them let me ask you this do I do I share my money with anybody I don't want I don't know no

[02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:16.570]
okay then nobody has actually held me up and said if you don't give me money I'm going to blow your brains out I'm going to like

[02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:20.870]
uh... say you on fire nobody has done that let's only the day yet that's not just

[02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:30.370]
I'm going to hormone that drives male aggression and sexual interest also seems able to boost short term success at finance

[02:17:31.290 --> 02:17:36.370]
but what seems to start out well can turn bad with elevated testosterone levels over several days

[02:17:36.370 --> 02:17:41.850]
possibly into an irrational risk taking in court of researchers at the University of Cambridge in England

[02:17:44.470 --> 02:17:50.350]
if people want to get practical to be good for both banks in the financial system as a whole if we had more women older men in the market said

[02:17:50.350 --> 02:17:57.790]
John M. Coates lead author of a study appearing in this week's issue of proceedings of a national academy of sciences which I scour that every week

[02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:06.330]
such a change would produce a much more stable financial system said Coates research fellow in the University's Department of Physiology Department and Neuroscience

[02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:16.870]
Coates and Joe Herbert study male financial traders in London taking saliva samples in the morning and evening they found that levels of two hormones testosterone and cortisol affected traders

[02:18:17.610 --> 02:18:24.110]
those with higher levels of testosterone in the morning were more likely to make an unusually big profit that day the research has found how do you like that

[02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:33.370]
they were more likely to make an unusually big profit testosterone affects aggression confidence and risk taking

[02:18:34.630 --> 02:18:42.130]
that means if you feel horny in the morning go to the track go to Gulfstream punch your guts out but 5,000 a win on the longest shot on the board in the first race

[02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:49.470]
knock him down to one to three one to two how do you get to be one to three that's a word of that number come from

[02:18:49.470 --> 02:18:58.330]
I know you pulled it out of your arse pull it out of my ass one to three arse remember what I told you about the chalk all we want with the chalk the other time see that

[02:18:58.330 --> 02:19:10.270]
that's not you have to take individual situation the situation I actually figured out how you did that because if that if that six was a lock like even though it was the chalk then you were almost assured the daily double

[02:19:11.250 --> 02:19:26.410]
and so yeah that's what that was the first one we were going to lay just excited to be able to say that

[02:19:26.410 --> 02:19:40.730]
now walkway area where the horses lead the paddock with Roger Houston at the meadows screaming and puking and yelling just wailing like a lunatic you know he was the first

[02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:53.330]
P.A. and answered poppano park little piece of trivia there for Roger Houston noted George yeah or you don't care no why not

[02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:59.170]
I don't know the post parade for the fourth race five minutes to post on it the meadows David Hudson and Jerry

[02:19:59.170 --> 02:20:07.430]
all the way over here it's no fun unless you're there nor is trains and gods the ones you down no that's how I would agree with that number two poker

[02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:18.450]
like Randy Farf's Richard Noel and Louis Carlow Michigan and Ohio once that when you're the Rupal people all yelling at the screens and things like that

[02:20:18.450 --> 02:20:19.510]
oh yeah that's great

[02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:24.890]
it's crying and ripping the hair out especially making sure they know the three

[02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:31.510]
loin to sharp and then they're arms around you know the four I give you my word come on my mind

[02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:36.150]
come on and get my nerve get up that right train will you will very yoder not

[02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:39.910]
don't you love those one of those names jodlers no yoder

[02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:45.650]
no carl show all Evan city Steve show for trains and drives the Amish

[02:20:47.490 --> 02:20:51.190]
what about him my sister my sister my sister maybe

[02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:53.930]
grand joy joy

[02:20:53.930 --> 02:21:00.190]
grand bucks and trains Brian Zan drives the sex I hope that was on the two that's one to two was that day

[02:21:00.190 --> 02:21:05.430]
alone did we have the day below in this race and I'll because if not I'm not watching it

[02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:06.670]
well there he is

[02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:11.750]
and original four to one there was the Danish Dineberg fast paces the four

[02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:17.430]
others Mike Milan trains day come on the southern and original all right and a

[02:21:17.430 --> 02:21:23.210]
original well that that I remember a couple of ladies once Roger Houston was calling a race at pop and

[02:21:23.210 --> 02:21:28.030]
opark and I was like I don't know where the hell I was wandering around but I was

[02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:32.890]
going back to my seat and the race ended and Roger Houston and here they are scream

[02:21:32.890 --> 02:21:39.070]
and one old lady says to the boy sounds like he's having an orgasm which I was

[02:21:39.070 --> 02:21:42.230]
surprised is he knew anything about that quite frankly so what they heard about him

[02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:45.650]
coach and Herbert study comes less than two weeks after the US researchers reported

[02:21:45.650 --> 02:21:50.030]
that young men shown erotic pictures were more likely to make a larger financial

[02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:54.030]
gamble and if they were shown a picture something scary such as a snake or

[02:21:54.030 --> 02:21:58.830]
something neutral such as a stapler or a sexy stapler all depending what you're

[02:21:58.830 --> 02:22:01.430]
going to staple what about for a guy's like you that a picture of a snake is

[02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:05.050]
something erotic that depends on what kind of snake it is and what it's

[02:22:05.050 --> 02:22:08.450]
attached to what if it's a rapper money and women triggered the same brain

[02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:13.470]
area and man the research has said how do you like that what it's the hooded

[02:22:13.470 --> 02:22:17.450]
cobra one member of that team come in a kounan an assistant professor of the

[02:22:17.450 --> 02:22:20.330]
Kellogg School of Finance at Northwestern said coach and Herbert's findings

[02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:23.350]
are very interesting and they help support the claim that emotional

[02:22:23.350 --> 02:22:28.230]
influences financial decisions that emotion influences financial decisions

[02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:31.310]
but she caused that the findings don't prove a casual link between test

[02:22:31.310 --> 02:22:35.190]
us during the profitability kounan who was not part of their study termed the idea

[02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:38.730]
that long term to high testosterone levels can lead to a rational risk taking

[02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:42.510]
an interesting hypothesis but of course risk taking doesn't mean you're going

[02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:45.490]
to win you know just because you might bet a thousand bucks to win on the

[02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:48.210]
longest shot in the board doesn't mean he's in fact he's probably going to lose

[02:22:48.210 --> 02:22:52.810]
the race in rumsand that's why he's the longest shot on the board

[02:22:52.810 --> 02:22:59.290]
right because he's got a trineman's chance in hell that's why 8.63 and a pool

[02:22:59.290 --> 02:23:02.890]
man if we make 900 that'll be just fine on a Monday the only problem is it's a

[02:23:02.890 --> 02:23:03.190]
Tuesday

[02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:07.070]
the best talent is no

[02:23:07.070 --> 02:23:09.930]
projects 4.25.60 QAM

[02:23:09.930 --> 02:23:11.710]
I think sports leader

[02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:13.990]
what is that thing real?

[02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:16.590]
there's lady in town

[02:23:17.390 --> 02:23:19.030]
she's another doctor

[02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:23.430]
and she needs to buy bread that is

[02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:26.110]
unleavened

[02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:27.310]
or you

[02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:34.610]
and she's buying bread is said

[02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:36.470]
he laid a

[02:23:37.390 --> 02:23:40.870]
Oh

[02:24:02.250 --> 02:24:04.070]
What

[02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:11.170]
So you're all set with your remata you got stocked up Zach. I got everything together. You're not eating no masa. No, I'm not

[02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:14.250]
You know what kind of people eat masa?

[02:24:14.850 --> 02:24:15.210]
Who?

[02:24:15.970 --> 02:24:18.970]
Fools. I do. Fools people mean aided because somebody told them well

[02:24:18.970 --> 02:24:23.650]
This is the time of the year. It's paysock weed. Mots and I'm gonna eat lots of though around past over my family

[02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:28.530]
I'm being a part of it. We've all said foolish people. Well, we're a little foolish. Fools Jews

[02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:31.070]
Just like people that cross themselves

[02:24:31.070 --> 02:24:35.710]
You know because somebody brainwashed them into doing that. This is when you live by a rote

[02:24:37.510 --> 02:24:42.250]
When people condition you to doing certain things at certain times for certain reasons

[02:24:42.250 --> 02:24:46.750]
You're not you're not a thinking person not living your life. You're conditioned

[02:24:48.310 --> 02:24:50.510]
You know what I mean? Yes

[02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:55.310]
And George is telling us he eats masa. Let's go saw all he can afford right?

[02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:59.070]
That's what it's free. I should have said when I'll let me ask you something

[02:24:59.070 --> 02:25:02.830]
You know you didn't pay some serious money for these gallstones deals or what same as any other parents

[02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:08.610]
Which by the way we got to talk on because you're not gonna be here on the 16th and I just found out today that they had scheduled another one of those

[02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:13.370]
Conjoined appearances on that day. Yeah, that's probably not gonna work out too well

[02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:20.790]
You know the ones where you're up there. I know well that wasn't very good planning on their part

[02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:24.970]
Well, they didn't they didn't know necessarily so we might have to move that or something

[02:25:24.970 --> 02:25:27.430]
I guess we'll have to have a conversation with someone

[02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:34.570]
Or I have a conversation with Steve slow and flea mm-hmm move it up a week or so be like traveling that day because in the day after the

[02:25:34.570 --> 02:25:37.950]
Tessa is absolutely correct. I have to get on a plane and I have to get there. I know

[02:25:39.490 --> 02:25:42.950]
Or I could leave Thursday and take off you know and an extra day

[02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:48.910]
Because I'm on vacation the fun week sort of take off like about 15 days. No big good game. Probably not a good idea

[02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:55.210]
So you're getting paid like see that's what I'm thinking and that's what you ought to incorporate

[02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:59.970]
Yeah, that one day a week that you are somewhere else

[02:25:59.970 --> 02:26:05.510]
I mean that you know appearances and things like that that all works into what I get paid in the year anyway

[02:26:06.570 --> 02:26:11.470]
That's all part of it. Well, what do you mean by that? In other words just you're not getting paid extra?

[02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:16.170]
Yeah, but that's part of my job that we once in a while I get appearances here and there and that's all part of what I

[02:26:16.170 --> 02:26:21.410]
I just said you're not listening. Yeah, you're a good point delusional. Yeah, you're not listening to me

[02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:29.030]
If it was factored in that there would sell a George appearance live every week and then add that on to what you're making

[02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:34.010]
That would be another's revenue stream. That would be a source of substantial income. I'll suggest that to Joe

[02:26:34.770 --> 02:26:37.330]
Yes, suggested to Joe as he suggested to flee and

[02:26:37.850 --> 02:26:45.350]
Anybody that might actually sell his show which leaves Brian Schmutz and people like that who in PD Lenny would probably have you at the flea market every week

[02:26:45.350 --> 02:26:47.650]
Oh, you know something would be so bad if you were to flea market

[02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:54.590]
What up? I just read a comment on jikas blog there from the guy with the eyes are really so it's stated there so it's signs

[02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:16.630]
Well, where does he come and see?

[02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:22.150]
Broward about places like oh when you hit the compensation and sunrise things. No, he didn't show up out there

[02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:23.990]
And what about a lot of other people did though?

[02:27:24.010 --> 02:27:29.970]
I mean with that fancy pants pretty early known they usually come as a pair in case you didn't know they come as a pair

[02:27:29.970 --> 02:27:33.010]
Yeah, they're guy with the eyes and the guy with a fanny pack

[02:27:33.010 --> 02:27:36.270]
Who was the security guard at the Mac arena and pulled out a gun?

[02:27:37.090 --> 02:27:38.810]
I was like you're imagining a run wild

[02:27:38.810 --> 02:27:40.130]
He let him go in here with a gun

[02:27:41.090 --> 02:27:45.970]

He's hung for his lungs. He's parked on the outside, baby

[02:28:03.350 --> 02:28:07.270]
So the guy with a fanny notice how all these people they find each other. Oh, yeah

[02:28:07.770 --> 02:28:12.350]
Isn't that a bizarre phenomenon not known up bizarre at all birds of a feather

[02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:15.730]

About the black driver that beat him out in that one race

[02:28:37.450 --> 02:28:43.090]
I'm not gonna repeat it. Okay, it would it would just be I don't know and while Randy tharps his leading this race right now

[02:28:43.090 --> 02:28:49.110]
It happens to be one of the few black drivers in harness racing. He's a good one. Little Williams was a great driver, but then he died

[02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:52.310]
He's been dead a long time. Little Williams

[02:28:54.430 --> 02:28:56.730]

[02:31:39.850 --> 02:31:44.170]
I don't ever want to hear while I'm sitting here. I mean, I don't I don't listen to the station

[02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:49.670]
But when I'm sitting here in the morning before George and or Chris come in and I have the pot open and the

[02:31:52.850 --> 02:31:55.970]
I don't want to hear his name. I don't want to know from him

[02:31:55.970 --> 02:31:59.150]
I don't care if he's winning by 80 strokes out of her if he's losing by 100

And had no control of her employees or clients actions

[02:33:52.530 --> 02:33:57.170]
It was she just making appointments like show up at you know 730 show up at nine

[02:33:58.570 --> 02:34:00.730]
Employments to do what well nothing just an appointment

[02:34:02.250 --> 02:34:05.830]
13 minute of work for Palfrey testified that she never discussed sex with them

[02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:10.010]
But that it was an implied part of the job three clients also testified in the trial

[02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:16.410]
Palfrey's lawyer pressed and burdened rest of his case yesterday without calling Senator David Vitor of Louisiana's a witness

[02:34:16.410 --> 02:34:21.410]
Vitor was on notice that he might have to appear during the prostitution trial another good upstanding Republican

[02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:23.350]
Moralist

[02:34:24.970 --> 02:34:29.110]
You think that the picture would make Marilyn Monroe an oralist ooh

[02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:36.190]
According to local news radio WTOP the case marked the first time that federal racketeering laws were used to go after prostitution ring

[02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:43.930]
Palfrey's prostitution ring operators what she claimed was a legitimate sexual fantasy business in which sex was not exchanged

[02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:50.330]
What was any exchange you know traded like for something else cookies

[02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:56.230]
Baseball cards true. So start now you're trying to get on normas good side start with the baseball card. Don't need

[02:34:57.550 --> 02:35:01.930]
Not gonna work you think you start I think I'm trying to try and he's trying to say and you don't understand it

[02:35:01.930 --> 02:35:05.910]
Is if he if the best he could do for me was to get this humongous pay cut?

[02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:09.590]
What makes you think that they're gonna give you a whole bunch more money? I

[02:35:10.050 --> 02:35:13.990]
Didn't think they were gonna give me a whole bunch more money or even a little more money

[02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:18.770]
Since they're already paying me a little bit of money a little more would not be that much more

[02:35:18.770 --> 02:35:22.170]
I think what they had to do is take just a little chunk out of what I'm giving back

[02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:25.490]
And pass that along to you that would be fine

[02:35:25.490 --> 02:35:31.750]
Well, that's where you are. That's that money. Have you when you have your big lunch at J Alexander's with Bruce Beasley and and

[02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:36.750]

[02:35:43.330 --> 02:35:46.450]

[02:36:50.490 --> 02:36:54.450]
Well, what about today before that day neither any date you pick whatever date you give me

[02:36:54.450 --> 02:36:56.590]
I'm gonna tell you there's not available on that day

[02:36:58.010 --> 02:37:00.270]
That's the way they work. Have you ever tried to use frequent flyer miles?

Because I'm a schlepper

Maybe maybe I'll pass along maybe that's what I can do for his pass along all those frequent flyer miles. Oh fly to Montana

[02:37:25.450 --> 02:37:26.970]

Okay, go for it. Oh, and you know what he left off the obvious winner on here

[02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:57.750]
He's got breakaway goal hockey, but he doesn't have the penalty shot

[02:38:58.390 --> 02:39:01.610]
Jesus Sean what is wrong with you penalty shot much better?

[02:39:02.170 --> 02:39:06.570]

[02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.250]

[02:39:07.250 --> 02:39:12.050]
The most exciting playing sports here's the list. He's got play at the plate

[02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:19.330]
Kick return for touchdown stock our crash stretch run and horse racing fast break inside the park home run

[02:39:19.330 --> 02:39:26.750]
Salkey crash. Oh, that very nice Sean Salkey crash cool. I understand breakaway goal and hockey alley hoop

[02:39:27.250 --> 02:39:29.630]
Hit her goal in soccer knockout punch

Manador toss stealing home heel Mary five on three penalty kill suicide squeeze now

So he's got alley you pervask. Oh, he doesn't have buzzer beater

[02:39:44.430 --> 02:39:49.070]
At the end of the game once okay buzzer beater is good and then on there buzzer beater

[02:39:49.890 --> 02:39:54.730]
And what about what about the shootout and hockey penalty shot gotta be on there

[02:39:55.550 --> 02:39:58.890]
Yeah, but that's not a penalty shot. That's it's the same thing, but it's not

[02:40:00.270 --> 02:40:03.270]
Difference yeah, there's yeah, there's a difference right shoot out

You get all these George no, who's that in these on there? Well, I was going to until he started around you know

[02:40:11.610 --> 02:40:17.110]
Too much work is added here's a type of a race and I asked him to add three things to tomorrow's pool

[02:40:17.690 --> 02:40:20.950]
It's not up yet. So I can't add it. I have to tell Eric and I have to type it

[02:40:22.130 --> 02:40:23.050]
Sure it's up

[02:40:24.910 --> 02:40:26.250]
If you go to pool switch

[02:40:26.890 --> 02:40:32.350]
It's it's on there. What's the most exciting plan sports? I gave it to him hours ago and Eric being right on the ball. He's got it on there

[02:40:33.470 --> 02:40:35.490]
Now you can't bring it up. Nope

[02:40:36.530 --> 02:40:41.730]
Well, then tell you're an article do it. What I'm doing. I hate sports penalty shot buzzer beater or shootout

The shootout how many shootouts are gonna have an ascending cup playoffs Neil? Oh, none

[02:40:48.530 --> 02:40:54.210]
You don't have shootouts in the playoffs. They play overtime forever and ever and ever even Zach knows that

[02:40:54.210 --> 02:40:54.930]
Oh, yeah

[02:40:57.170 --> 02:41:03.310]
Now do you think it's just a coincidence that Joe Rose had Jacques Marton on the mini got candy got moved upstairs and

We leave him his coaching duties right afterward. Yeah Joe's the mush. That's what I call

[02:41:07.270 --> 02:41:12.710]

Well, there's much as Bob fishy I knew that you'd miss me

[02:41:54.470 --> 02:42:01.870]
You took my magnificent house for granted

[02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:18.170]
And one rake too many else now I'm gone

[02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:19.990]

Your babies effort to a now indentirt

[02:42:25.570 --> 02:42:31.930]
Now it's your time to get raped

[02:42:31.930 --> 02:42:39.470]
You might as well hurt your crappy signal in to out at space

[02:42:39.470 --> 02:42:42.670]
I knew that you'd miss me

[02:43:03.570 --> 02:43:03.970]
This is

[02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:10.310]
145 and 560 WQM who would ever believe that a little squeak my studio like healthy would be such a backstabbing clown

[02:43:10.310 --> 02:43:14.410]
That's what Rimmer says and Rimmer says he still hates the these potpan like poison by the way

[02:43:15.330 --> 02:43:19.870]
I wouldn't want to waste the 60 bucks I spent for buying them lunch and not have a little a little something to put on here

[02:43:20.610 --> 02:43:22.030]
Okay, little scuddle but

[02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:23.310]
back them

[02:43:24.090 --> 02:43:27.470]
Rimmer still got the same mustache though. He lost a lot of weight because he had that triple bypass

[02:43:28.410 --> 02:43:32.490]
And also because I haven't been around to be feeding them any meals at Ruth's Chris stuff like that's it

[02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:35.730]
And you know what good?

[02:43:36.690 --> 02:43:40.990]
I'd rather take the money that I would send the buy them meals within send it to you law

[02:43:40.990 --> 02:43:46.890]
I'm not going I know it's right, but I would rather no, don't you understand I would I would wish

[02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:52.610]
That these people would come to their senses and like at least double your salary. Oh, that'd be sweet

[02:43:53.250 --> 02:43:59.090]
And then and by the very least compensate you for those 80 million shows you do during the summertime from the middle of June till

[02:43:59.090 --> 02:44:04.010]
the middle of September which isn't that far off by something as opposed to nothing right

[02:44:05.150 --> 02:44:09.650]
Now that that's that's some bargaining power you got to be where you're doing three shows a week all summer

[02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:11.350]
I do over a third and get

[02:44:11.350 --> 02:44:15.670]
numbers in there every summer we do well we get more listeners than on the sports shows on a station

[02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:22.050]
Yes, we do just fine always get more listeners than the other people in spite of all your talk about or or derby and crap like that right

[02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:29.270]
So I'm telling you that you've got you've got possibilities in there. Okay work them in there and make some money

[02:44:30.270 --> 02:44:35.690]
I sure hope Joe is listening you always claims that he's listening. He listened to this show too much. I think I'll get him late too much

[02:44:37.610 --> 02:44:38.810]
Why I'll get him laid

[02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:45.850]
Don't be starting to talk about that kind of crap on you. What is wrong with you? Are you a lunatic or what?

[02:44:45.890 --> 02:44:51.890]
Well, yeah, you'll get him laid. Oh if he wanted that's just what he needs and nice family man like Jolly Joe Bill

[02:44:52.930 --> 02:44:58.050]
And having you down here talking about trust me if he's a family man. He needs to get laid. Well, there you go

[02:44:59.010 --> 02:45:04.930]

[02:45:11.770 --> 02:45:12.230]

[02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:17.490]
Well, I'm going to read it again anyway because this has got more details. Oh, no a

[02:45:17.890 --> 02:45:24.230]
Catholic priest charged with having sex with an 11-year-old boy in Charlottes in 1999 was booked in the Mecklenburg County jail on Sunday

[02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:27.730]
The Reverend Robert Urgels is expected in court today according to jail records

[02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:32.590]
Well, there is a Oliver. It's a thousand dollars even a hundred thousand dollars

[02:45:33.150 --> 02:45:38.830]
Yergo 43 is charged with five counts to take in decent liberties with the child and two counts of statutory sex offense

[02:45:38.830 --> 02:45:44.370]
It was arrested April tooth in Pasey of New Jersey where he lives later that we can court Yergo

[02:45:44.370 --> 02:45:45.470]
Waved his right to contest

[02:45:45.970 --> 02:45:46.450]
extradition

[02:45:47.410 --> 02:45:53.390]
Authorities have said the boy in his family were members of the St. Matthew Catholic Church in the Valentine area when the let's

[02:45:53.390 --> 02:45:59.850]
Text crimes occurred the victim recently reported that Yergo would place his direct penis into a hole that was made in the bottom of his

[02:45:59.850 --> 02:46:04.350]
Bible the Bible was hollowed out to allow the victim to place his hand on the Yergo's penis

[02:46:04.350 --> 02:46:10.410]
The victim was instructed to place baby oil on the Yergo's penis until he ejaculated the victim had reported

[02:46:12.390 --> 02:46:16.450]
Better than the popcorn trick the victim had reported this to his parents however

[02:46:16.450 --> 02:46:21.230]
They didn't believe the story until he returned home from his church service with a large amount of seamen on his shirt

[02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:22.850]
Oi

[02:46:24.190 --> 02:46:27.190]
Does this say whether it was a blue shirt or what color it was?

[02:46:28.250 --> 02:46:31.970]
The matter was then reported a Charlotte Mecklenburg detective's authorities have said

[02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:34.270]
Yergo worked around goes on about where he did it

[02:46:34.270 --> 02:46:34.950]
He left me

[02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:40.430]
No, no, I hope that the Pope is really happy with that. I'm sure you're happy father

[02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:47.090]
All this kind of crap that's been going on for decades and decades and got only knows how long

[02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:51.730]
Might be think they call it the rectum reehun. I don't know

[02:46:52.390 --> 02:46:52.770]
why

[02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:58.410]
Because you enter from the rear like that book but both father knows best you know what it is

[02:46:59.270 --> 02:47:03.510]

Everybody wants to need a Roger show on area with their company, but nobody wants to pay anybody

[02:48:12.390 --> 02:48:16.870]
That's an nature of the business. That's why we had to us surrender and whatever they know whatever sheckles

[02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:23.310]
They were pushing my way I said hey it's better and be out on the beach. I need it. I got mouse to feed. I got people to take care of

[02:48:30.170 --> 02:48:35.810]
Mm-hmm and she said why would you why do you worry about leaving money? You worked all your life to make that money

[02:48:35.810 --> 02:48:40.710]
Why don't you enjoy it? That's right. Why don't you live on it? That's right good advice

[02:48:43.930 --> 02:48:48.350]
And I looked at her and I thought to myself because I'm a schmuck can't take it with you

[02:48:48.930 --> 02:48:51.830]

[02:49:11.530 --> 02:49:12.530]

One of the best stories of all time and I don't remember the details, but he was working at I

[02:49:20.830 --> 02:49:23.610]
95 was later became Zeta I was on I&Z

[02:49:24.370 --> 02:49:27.230]
And he claimed that the the mafia they came in a

[02:49:27.730 --> 02:49:33.250]
Like did something with him in the parking lot and they held him up against the fence. I remember that story. Yeah

[02:49:35.010 --> 02:49:37.930]
I'm sure it wasn't true. I think it was kind of like a hallucinogenic

[02:49:40.050 --> 02:49:45.450]
Fairytale that he made I don't know. I don't remember the details, but it was bizarre. He had some strange things going on

[02:49:45.450 --> 02:49:49.710]
He was a good guy though Don Cox. He was a friend of ours and a friend of the show now. He's dead

[02:50:11.690 --> 02:50:16.170]
No, she got remarried and she had a family. She had breast cancer. What are you talking about? She couldn't go on with Adam

[02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:22.850]
Maybe subconscious, you know, caca. Yes subconsciously. That's why the cancer spring. That's right. Couldn't have been all that smoking
