100 years

[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.780]
That's because they don't discuss this show during the sales meetings this show never correct for conversation

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.940]
They're not allowed to discuss my name your name fact Chris's name and he's need to do with the um

[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.160]
show

[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.640]

[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.940]
We're screwed, but you know what we're still here we show up every day the vaniant warriors that we are taking crap from inside

Oh speaking of that Christian University official arrested and gay sexting

[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:05.360]
And Ohio man in a high place their conservative Christian school is accused of soliciting sex and open air

[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.040]
An open air that's an interesting phrase

[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.520]
52-year-old

[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.440]
Robert Williams Chief Financial Officer of Cincinnati Christian University was arrested with two others on Saturday

[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.280]
Said to have manually stimulated an undercover police officer in Mount Erie forest. He is charged with

[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.360]
sexual imposition. He manually stimulated him

[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:31.160]
I heard that sorry the university has placed Williams on administrative leave while officials assess the facts of the case

[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.220]
They're assessing it

[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.080]
We are shocked and dismayed by the news of Robert Williams arrested since the net of Christian University president David Fauston

[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.280]
This is a personal tragedy for him and his family. We lift them up in our prayers

[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.460]
Police things targeting men who cruise men in places such as rest stops in public parks

[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.240]
Have been regarded as entrapment by activists while healed and encouraged by figures such as for Lauderdale Florida Mayor Jim

[00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.500]
Noggle who proposed mechanical robot toilets in public places to combat what he saw as an epidemic of gay men having public says in the city's parks

[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.640]
The called a flush noggle became louder is what he called a public health campaign was criticized

[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.260]
Is anti gay prejudice which of course it is he's a bigoted lunatic

[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:15.680]
Since operations have brought attention to figures such as outgoing US senator Larry Craig of Idaho who in August

[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.620]
2007

[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.360]

To something

[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:55.560]
Ken jiles part of a mass 2007 sexting a rest recently filed suit against the Johnson city Tennessee police department after his name and address were published in local

[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.340]
Loose paper as part of the sting conducted an area known as the man cave at Johnson city's winged deer park

[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:09.580]
The action taken by the police was unprecedented photographs of the suspects were also supplied the suit charge that JCPD chief John Lowry

[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:16.320]
Opersonally approved the release violated federal equal protection law and seeking to cause the 40 suspects additional on due stress and

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.080]
Emiliation along with endangering their jobs and relationships with the family

[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:28.960]
How did this story wander so far from this conservative Christian school guy? How did it kind of like wander off into like glittering generalities?

[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.880]
I don't he manually stimulate undercover plays in other words. He touched his penis. Okay

[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.640]
That's correct

[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:43.820]
Now what kind of a good Christian what kind of a good Christian touches some other guy's penis an extra good Christian oh

[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:52.240]
Now speaking of the Jonas Brothers. Yeah, so I'm watching last night and it was some I don't know was a Billy race Cyrus and a millie and not millie

[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.640]
What's the chicks

[00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:03.220]
Hannah Montana was a concert and I'm thinking to myself who are these three kids that around there one of whom is incredibly ugly and the other two of whom are

[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.020]
Very attractive. Should we say isn't that a good way to put it? Yes. I don't want to say they're hot

[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.440]
That sounds like sexual, you know and they're born again Christian and I thought who the hell is that?

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.940]
And then at the end of the song which the coin case jumps up on the piano and that it's pretty good music

[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.620]
It's better what the fat boy here says it's bad. It's good. It's all good

[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:31.500]
Now you didn't even hear the music and he said the thank you someone where the Jonas Brothers and I thought well that's nice and I came in here and I googled it

Wiggled it. Yeah, no, I googled it. Yeah

[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.580]
No, you're going to be a QAM music broadcast group incorporated. You're gay

[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.740]
Faster than a touch-tone phone

[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.000]
Louter than a pneumatic drill

[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.900]
Ables a side step reality in a single bound

[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.820]
Look, they're on the phone. It's a random moose. It's a brilliant jackass

[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.120]
Geez, do you believe these people?

[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.500]

[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.120]
Yes, it's Yintamen

[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.260]
Strange visitor from another market for the phone growing out of his head

[00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.400]
Great warning is gonna do morning's on she

[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:07.360]
What do you think? Yintamen with a bizarre compulsion to pass along radio gossip

[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.460]
They thought it wasn't a clips of the Sun but it turned out to be Debe Ellis

[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.100]
Unbelievable Yintamen who can change the course of any discussion

[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.100]
Dial two telephones with one hand and who disguised as Lee Howler

[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.080]
Il-Menored tacos for a semi-professional radio station

[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.700]
fights a never-ending battle for rumor

[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.600]
In you window and Arbitron advances

[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.800]
Yeah, or you didn't like it? Yintamen

[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.020]
Sorry, it's never been one of my favorites

[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.940]
Jim Skyler, yeah, I know he's got some way better stuff in there

[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.980]
Well you are sorry. It's just those emails are right. Yeah, I know

[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.220]
Be sure and yeah bring George some bag of the manure. Yes, Saturday and lump a coal

[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.300]

[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.260]
So here's the first email that comes in during the show this morning to give you an idea of the pleasant people to stop for

[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.860]
First email. I'm this is supposed to be the month of a peace and good peace and peace on these and

[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.300]
Goodwill toward the men and queens and whatever

[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.280]
And they're just as nasty and surly as ever

[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:47.060]
I tell you we get a 90 share if we just did that put that on an endless loop and play that all four hours

[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:57.360]
Here's the thing and the subject B-A-S-E-L you call yourself a broadcaster. It's pronounced Basel not basal

[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.800]
Say it with me now you old boresh under educated conduct

[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.380]

B-A-S-E-L yeah, that's right

[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.900]
From Arthur who's a real moron. I didn't listen. I don't care how you pronounce it

[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.740]
I still don't care about it. I don't want to know about it

[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.720]
It's of no interest to me and stop wasting my email stuff with all this crap about Basel Basel

[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.160]
Remember Basel Rathbone?

[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.540]
You ever put some Basel on your in your sauce?

[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.580]
Just be bored

[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.760]

[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:35.460]

[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.480]
Basel Rathbone

[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.120]
Basel Rathbone

[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.760]
Basel died

[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.040]
Where the hell is that email? I'll find it

[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.900]
Take your time. We're just mailing it in from now till the end of the year

[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.880]
I am playing the hotel in the year as many old bits as I can't even I can't believe you didn't enjoy hearing that

[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.580]
Hey, I'm not seeing it's a great bit

[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.960]
What sorry, I'm a hard-ass. What can I tell you?

[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.320]
Oh my god

[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.140]
If Jim Scott out of her you saying that he would probably be like a woman. Yeah, so

[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.520]
Oh, you don't even like Jim Skylin. I don't dislike him. I get blamed for being a sour bastard. You're the one

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.920]
I don't really care what he thinks how's that

[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:34.660]
Well, I don't either

[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.520]
Especially what he cares what he thinks about you. No

[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.020]
Whatever happened to him. Is he still I don't know he's up flappin his arms up

[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.100]
Well, we could ask and then nobody will tell us because there is be flying on the emails this morning

[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.100]
It's gonna be a real people will take a whole bunch of calls today and speaking of that

[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.260]
I'm gonna mention this for the last time

[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:00.580]
Okay, okay, I got it. Oh no for the last time. There's no point in keep beating it to a pulp

[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:06.200]
But these people are saying oh genius if you would do a good show if you play those funny bits if you would do this

[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.540]
If you would do the fact that a matter is we work for the most incompetent inept management in the history of this business

[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.220]
There's nobody even a close second

[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.180]
They won't lift the finger they'll lift one finger all right, and that's the only finger they'll lift in on behalf of this show

[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.240]
Here is in my deleted emails from yesterday

[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:30.380]
720 say no from this morning 726 am from Daron Granovsky who is

[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.080]
Iron chamba the chamba guy

[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.340]
Prozac runs partner in slime

[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.740]
Subject we will never go away

[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:44.240]
Now here he offers up for the 8 million time his name. There's only one person with that name in all of South Florida

[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.340]
Easy to locate

[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.800]
sure

[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:54.720]
Neil remember we will always remember we will never go away prozac ron and myself would like to come hang out with you for a couple of days

[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.460]
We'd also like to stay a Georgia's place wouldn't it be cool with me hang out with Mrs. Rodriguez and his oldest daughter

[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.840]
Maybe George would like to have two adopted brothers

[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.340]
Wouldn't that be cool call you soon your friends forever prozac ron and chamba

[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:13.000]
P.S. Tell George to meet us at hooters for lunch next Monday our treat A.R.E our treat not only are they annoying they're illiterate

[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.360]
our treat

[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.480]
Maybe they'll take you to Johnny F and rockets. Oh, I would love it. I'm never good. Mm-hmm

[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.640]
So there it is Daron Granovsky and I'm sure that there are people in the audience who know this creep and over

[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.060]
He is where he's located. Oh, yeah, but they won't tell us

[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:37.580]
With a minimum of effort the management here could you know clean up all phone problems with a phone call like months and months and months and months and months they won't do it

[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:44.200]
We don't want to we don't want to back back. We don't want to screen the cost like George man. We don't want to

[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.300]
And as a result that's one you know one part of the show that's going in the toilet

[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.940]
But we just continue showing up every day Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m

[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.320]
And do the best we can under impossible circumstances

[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.500]
So those of you who are belly, you can oh, why don't you do this or why don't you go to Syria? So why don't you go to FF?

[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.420]
Or why don't you go to hell all another crap

[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.940]
Quit your bitching quit your belly. I can we show up and we like I said we do the best we can

[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.640]
Oh, here's one from the fake Joey Reynolds

[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.000]
You used to be such a nice boy whatever happened to guitar man and Jim Scholar

[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.960]
They are missing elements to your show. I hear you just signed a five-year contract with QM

[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.580]
No, I didn't just sign it. I signed it a long time ago

[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.700]
You've outlasted them all uncle neo. Are you going to be able to keep poker Brian on the payroll next year?

[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.580]
You know, that's an interesting question Joey

[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.920]
What do you think? Yes

[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.040]
Oh

[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.500]
And look at this this is from a real I got a block this is another idiot Anthony

[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.000]
You're a moron Anthony who wants to see that fruitcake on Saturday man

[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.720]
I got better things to do good. I'm sure you don't want to see you either you want to see Anthony?

[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.380]
Who oh and what are they chronic son here one of the cranks? Oh

[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.280]
My god

[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.760]
Here's one from Sam there. They're trickling in there starting to wake up a little bit

[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.840]
Nothing yet about the Jonas Brothers though

[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.600]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha you think there's anybody in this audience who even knows who those everyone

[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:16.720]
Get out of here you're a crazy person. Well. That's a fact, but nevertheless. It's a fact that I'm a crazy person oh

[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:23.300]
You're Sam says your show has always been entertaining over the years. I'm a loyal listener George is coming before you

[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.420]
Sorry, oh, that's sorry to lay down

[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:28.500]
Oh

[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.180]
The song they sang last night wasn't bad. I wasn't really paying any attention to song. I just

[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.640]
They could have been a lip syncing and you know

[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.800]
Playing with Donna song in your life. Yeah, they're lip syncing because they're running all over the stage

[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:47.480]
You can't sing while you're running all jumping up pretty piano. Sure you can you can yeah, I do it all the time

[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.240]
Can I finish reading sand? Please? I mean, you know, it may be the only one we get all day here today

[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.560]
Let me read it slowly and surely

[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.300]
George is coming to form. He just needs to weed out what he thinks is good radio in a reality people are clicking it off

[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:07.980]
These moments are when he has Lucy Lopez on George's whole being changes his voice tone turns very high pitched in ultra

[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.660]
Hyper matching his guest making gildy sound like a real man

[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.280]
It reminds me of a two high schoolers after his first after their first Friday night party

[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.400]
George's music if they don't have a little some little kid trying to sing a la blind melon or make some visit

[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.560]
Nothing wrong with blind melon by the way. I like blind melon

[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.140]
Remakes him bizarre noises from rubbing or hitting any metallic object lying around. He's not playing it

[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.360]
George needs to cut this cancerous part of his show off

[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.140]
Then he'll keep the people that run away when his show deforms into a slop

[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.280]
You hear that he forms into a slop. Yeah, so it seems to keep him grounded

[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:47.620]
He does not go so hyper like when Lucy Lopez is there signs Sam. I guess Sam don't like Lucy F off Sam

[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.020]
Yeah, F you Sam

[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.760]
George likes Lucy when he's not even doing whatever the only one that's I don't care

[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.780]
You can go move for four hours. Sometimes I do as long as we get this box on that's all anybody cares about

[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.420]
Because we are the outcasts

[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:10.000]
Neil streets were empty last night down here. Miami. It was freezing bitter cold. Oh, yeah poor babies. Oh, don't tell me my mouse died again

[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.540]
Oh, no

[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.220]
My mouse is froze up

[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:23.860]
Everyone was indoors huddled up by the fireplace with their hot chocolate global warming my ass. It says my

[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.840]
Mouses screwed up. Well, let me work on it during the break in the mouse to

[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.800]
What's the best talent?

[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.660]
I think

[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.200]
The biggest names the best talent. It's a mad dog Jim mandat afternoon

[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.660]

It damn near kilnomer you used to be able to cover up embarrassing personal odors with just a splash of Kelvin clients obsession

[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:03.880]
But not these days. Oh boy a sore pipe a warm place to sleep tonight. Hey buddy. I saw it first. I can't we share

[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:04.960]
Well

[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.800]
It smells like something died in here. What is that?

[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.140]
So each a dead squirrel

[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:20.420]
vomit. No, it's you during these hard economic times you can't always choose who you sleep with

[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:26.920]
That's why you need a powerful clone you need recession the fragrance to wear when you're down in the dumps

[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:37.100]
Recession from Georgio Bush. Okay 1032 a.m. 60 WQM all case. I've had to like reboot my computer and put my mouse back together again

[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:43.780]

[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.480]
So anyway, I'm rebooting. Oh, dead a homestead. I mentioned that a moment ago and you totally ignored it

[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.780]
You were more worried about the same ripping you an ass

[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:57.760]
Basel Rothbard folks singer champion black history and civil rights. He looks a little like Cila Cruz

[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.800]
Thank you, but if he acts me

[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.900]
Oh, Detta the classically trained folk blues and gospel singer who used her powerfully rich and dusky voice

[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:13.580]
To champion African American music and civil rights issues more than half a century starting in the folk revival of the 50s is died. She was 77

[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:15.940]
77

[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.780]
You know how the rest goes. Yeah, I don't have it. I never heard of her. Did you? No

[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.840]
I also never heard of Basel or Basil or any of that crap and I don't care about it. I do not care

[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:32.160]
Oh, you're so out of touch good. I want to be out of touch touch this. Oh, guess what my mouse is working again

There was some what said no problem

[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.760]
Oh my god. Can you imagine the size of his ass? Oh brother

[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.900]
The dollar's only down 57 hours making a comeback. I wouldn't be surprised if we move into positive territory

[00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:58.980]
Sometime

[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.000]
Sometime before we croak. Would that be nice? Oh, yeah, oh, we're so depressed hearing you talk about the market

[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.740]
Okay, now let me go back to outlook express because there was actually a couple maybe some more ripping you an ass

[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.440]

Neon I know you weren't paying attention to it

[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:29.760]
But I'd like to make mention the fact that the alleged university Miami managed to humiliate disgrace and shame themselves in the

[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.940]
Terrace out for it ever yet again last night when one of their basketball players decided to start a

[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.300]
Prissy slap fight and get himself thrown out of the game

[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.080]
Which they wound up losing against Ohio State just another stupid illiterate thing

[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.220]
Thug who'll have a long career in prison. Maybe I'll go through a sock at him signed the fake Ernie Sochin

[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.220]
I wonder whatever happened Ernie Sochin

[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.960]
I think he's alive

[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:52.900]
Somebody will be

[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.480]
Sad oh this mouse isn't doing all that great. Maybe I better get a new one

[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.880]
I mean it's working, but it's like oh, you're still that mouse with a ball. Yeah

[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.520]
Now what am I supposed to buy a laser mouse

[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.720]

Oh, don't tell me my mouse is it now. It's okay

[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.080]
It's a lot colder than I expected 38 degrees this morning

[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:58.420]
I know I'm a worst, but I was born and raised in South Florida my wife is also pissed off because of the cold. She is from Brazil

[00:27:59.240 --> 00:27:59.640]

Whatever I'm telling the time on the internet. Well, Jesus is your birthday on Saturday for Christ's sake

[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.760]
So can't you people be a little bit human and civilized around somebody's birthday

[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:21.940]
Around Christmas and all this other good stuff and the birth of our Lord and all this other phony baloney

[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:28.420]
By the way kids, there's no Santa Claus your parents lied just like they lied about God and about Jesus and all this other crap

[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.900]
Abraham and Solomon there wasn't Abraham Solomon though. He was my grandpa

[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.200]
Outdoor kneel at neo-rages.com. That's the email address for it's slim and grim

Slackers and just ripping you a major ass just because it's your birthday Saturday

[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.120]
I take it personally, though they're not ripping me but they will whatever except that basil guy

[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.520]
Bazzle they call yourself a broken who gives a crap about that swill

[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.020]
But should pseudo intellectual a holes with their basil. Yeah big deal

[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.940]
The drag queen show at the palace food bar will go on

[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:17.480]
My mom had each put a stop to the ocean drive bars out to her performances citing noise complaints and I need to keep sidewalks clear for pedestrians but

[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:25.400]
At a November 26 hearing attended by several female impersonators decked on and platform boots and colorful wigs as well as a thong of the throngers supporters

[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.600]
I bet wonder if Cedar Cruz was there

[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:35.000]
The city's planning board unanimously agreed to give owner Ted Tom Donnell a permit that allows performance on the terrace of the restaurant and

[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.640]
Bar at 1200 ocean drive

[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:44.320]
The entertainers who previously would leave the bar to perform for passengers by will still be barred from singing and dancing on the sidewalk or across the street

[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.040]
Oh, my mouse is dying I think

[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.000]
Does a mouse die?

[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.260]
They do those do they do yes

[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.540]
Why is there mechanical

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.040]
Everything mechanical eventually wears out and dies that's why you need an optical mouse which is not mechanical

[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.840]
Which will I don't have one now? I know you don't I may have to leave at 11 o'clock go by a mouse

[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.520]
No, no

[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.140]
What why can't I can't get I can't get these great emails without a mouse send a friend

[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.900]

[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.060]
Oh look at this they're ganging up on little George today you bastards you do lunatics or narrowly

I wouldn't care. I would be amused but yeah, whatever this the time he's just saying two or three people anyway, so who gives a rats

[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.640]
Leo says your next poll should be how long does it take to

[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:41.860]
Radio Dawa George does the show one one second three seconds or five seconds somebody should chain you and Joe and Joe

[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:46.200]
Belder with chair and be forced to listen to a show for four hours this guy doesn't belong on a radio says Leo

[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:52.480]

Yeah, and I'll say to get have anyone else fill in for you and see what they say about them

[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.800]
Oh, yeah, I don't have to wonder because I saw that

[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.180]
Come on, I get more commentary about that. I saw that because it doesn't happen very often

[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.180]
Thank God for that

[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.560]
Dear Neil I told you DeRan was mean he would show up at George's house

[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:26.620]

[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.760]
That's what we got so far as several anti-Georgia hate George emails and

[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.460]
And Prozac Ron and this one and that one and their new friend Barry

[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.540]
Hey, Barry you fairy wow

[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:56.500]
Is there gonna be this way all the way through the rest of the year because I'll just play the rack from now till new years

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:02.760]
No, this is good. This is a new good format. What rip George's ass. No, but I'm saying that the emails they're not there

[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.440]
There's nothing there. Don't you understand? That's what I'm trying to tell you

[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:09.400]
They've died down to a there are no items in this view nothing

[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.620]
And it's been that way today is Wednesday. It's been that way all week all oh, you know during Monday and Tuesday

[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.580]
They at least started puking along, you know

[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.200]
But today I had that feeling in fact overnight usually in the morning I come in here there's 15 or 20 of which three or four

[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.560]
Maybe real in the rest of them all you've won 70 billion dollars in the Australian lot of one

[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.340]
Like that

[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.860]
But today it's just a we hate George festival. What have you done to them? What is it that you have done with it?

[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.360]
I don't know I wish I do Friday. I had Friday off now. What did you do on Friday to piss them off someone?

[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.820]
I don't know I made an attempt to do a real radio show

[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.740]
I don't know if any of this has to do with a freaking Jonas Brothers nothing

[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.920]
The best talent

[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.640]
Fort like your five sixty Q.A.M.

[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.660]
The fourth

[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.320]
Elite

[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.080]
The best talent

[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.420]
Wake nights from the end to 11 here on

[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.260]
You call that a Harry scrotum

[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.300]
If you think you hate it the gym scotter for what you do

[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.700]
And a quarter billion bucks for a game

[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:31.540]
That's crazy

[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.560]
Half a mill to play each game

[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.820]
You gotta think the owners insane

[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.020]
He has to pay every time the air outspits on the ground

[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:44.900]
That's crazy

[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:51.340]
He still gets paid if he makes out and all the fast will scream and shout

[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.900]
But what does he care?

[00:33:53.900 --> 00:34:00.560]
He still gets his cash if he hits all he sits all he walks all he walks when he finds he finds

[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.440]
He's got to go go go go

[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.940]
Baby what he makes he makes

[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.720]
It's crazy because he's got a bigger contract now than can just be

[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.680]
The biggest one in history

[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.500]
He finds he buys a thing there's no way they lose

[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.580]
He buys you know what's the biggest sin

[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:25.700]
That even when they rot there's no way the rangers who win

[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.800]
Well, let me trust you now. Yeah, especially since you don't play there no more

[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.020]
But that's okay. It's all over planning oldies baby. I might just play the whole rack uninterrupted

[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.660]
Okay, there was either nobody is listening anymore. Which is possible

[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.560]
You know, I mean they've watered it down to the point where I could understand I could relate to that or

[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:48.260]
Uh, they're just ignoring us. Well, it's busy. We just had black fronty and now we're shopping and shopping and running around. Oh, yeah

[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.640]
They have nothing to say how many years have I been screaming about that

[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.700]
100 about a hundred. Yeah, nothing to say on the phone on the email

[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.500]
And like I said yesterday

[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.620]
Thank God for the fake this one and fake that one because if it hadn't been for that the last two three weeks

[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.980]
We wouldn't be getting much more than we're getting today and those guys who've taken a hiatus today evidently

[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.900]
Except for the fake Larry King who says leave George alone

[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.540]
WQM should bring fat hankin to fill in while you're out that way the listeners won't bitch about George

[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.080]
How do you like that is shot at the Humper well the thumper

[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.660]
God almighty come on fake Larry. That was funny. Yeah hysterical

[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.360]
And PR Ralph I thought you were odds with him about something

[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.800]
Well whatever makes something up

[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.460]
Well, what what what happened with him we had like a I think I like them or something huh nothing

[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.060]
You're wrong about that. Okay, why don't they hate you like party?

[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.980]
There was something a few weeks ago on these emails though. He just really frosted my ass if you say so

[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.320]
I'm telling you

[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.000]
Remember that fat Chris

[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:51.900]
um no

[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.360]
Would you know paying the attention was fine. I mean, I remember PR Ralph being talked about all time because he emailed

[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.060]
He even comic books again or what no he just doesn't remember either because he listening to his iPod

[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.720]
He's probably got a whole bunch of Jonas Brothers music. He's listening to his iPoppy boy

[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.740]
He ripped them and asked I couldn't believe it this morning. Yeah, so they can't sing at all at all at all

[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.800]
I'm gonna make you go as I see a lot of money

[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.520]
And it doesn't mean that

[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.940]
They're making a lot of money for the obvious reason that you noticed

[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.660]
Yeah, and what's that they're attractive to the hot female children and fags

[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:23.500]
Yes

[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:33.720]
Anyway, here's one from PR Ralph happy birthday George see you Saturday what you want Pasto perico or wine

[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.140]
All of the above and I love George it says

[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.720]
See they're trying to start up you know fake Larry and PR Ralph let's make George the topic today at least

[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.140]
Underweight about sure. I know what you're I didn't know anything about you

[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.960]
It's bizarre and all of a sudden out of nowhere, you know, it's like oh, there's the topic

[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.540]
Oh, here we go

[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:55.340]
Sean

[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.780]
Ask Chris about his days as a rote for the Nelson twins

[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.560]
And that's not true is it

[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.940]
Because I was um hmm

[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.120]
13 14 15 when they were out yet, they know

[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:12.840]
I

[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.900]
I think you're holding something back

[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:23.700]
You know, it's just water him he hemmed it hot about that there's more to Chris and I remember how old I was when uh the Nelson twins were singing

[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.160]
Yeah, I was on iod so it's many years ago. Mm-hmm

[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:34.820]
Had him on the ear on the phone and I remember asking them something about whether they ever diddled each other something like that

[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.360]
They got a little little giggly like little girls, you know

[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.660]
Bill says I find it unbelievable that jolly Joe can't spend 15 minutes of his very important time

[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:49.560]
Feeling like with losers like pro-zac ron and chamba and I then the like I guess he thinks this stick is entertaining

[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:55.040]
I can't speak for all but most of the since semi-normal people don't find it funny and guess what Bill neither do we

[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.260]
Neither do we who are trying to like do a productive show here on the station and make a living

[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.940]
Neither do we we get no assistance no cooperation no effort no nothing just don't do this and don't say that and

[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.500]

Say happy birthday to George happy birthday George. Thank you. I've been listening to you for 15 plus years

[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.620]
Hard a goal. There were a couple of other ones in there and they just disappeared

Well then they the um mouse the mouse ball gets me kind of like you know

[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:39.540]

Well, they hate you today. What kind of crap is this even on video upset and I have no idea why

[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.640]
Anyways, the Jonas Brothers are just another fat group put together by a music producer trying to work a group to a particular audience

[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:06.860]
There's been young girls reaching puberty and wanting to stare at boys phase and of course in these days

There are young boys wanting to stare at young boys

[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:14.120]
But that's the way of the world and is not a bad thing either and they're all queens wanting to stare at not young boys

[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:21.300]
But uh whatever they are well one of them is like 21 one of them is 19 and the other one is 16 maybe the ugly one is 16 like an only hope

[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.220]
618 votes and fat Chris's poll. That's not too bad not too shabby for a mediocre poll

I still can you know and of course he and the bird were pretty tight

[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:14.160]
So maybe he picked that up from the bird, you know you show up maybe uninvited and then you just keep coming back for more

[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:14.940]
Even though

[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:22.720]
I hadn't thought of that remember the bird pulled that act in Tampa. Yeah, maybe Johnny pulled a try to reprise that routine in our studio

[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.200]
And we sent the message back out to the front desk tell Johnny go away

[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.720]

Sock, oh they are an extra nice to the earthy yes, he is extra crispy like cocoa. Christ

[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.280]
Anyway, here's one from somebody about LeBaster's obsession with you. Oh there it look

[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.440]
They're trying desperately to get into this pink contest with him

[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.000]
I don't play that game. Don't you people over there understand it

[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.620]
I don't play it said the kid tried it didn't work. He still was doing ones and twos

[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.820]
And LeBaster you've got to be kidding me who will pay any attention to a loser like that

[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:29.920]
Apparently the LeBaster show is a blow-up doll of you in their studio on the show two days ago

[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.440]
The whole show was based on you the origin of Roy

[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.140]
The origin of Roy

[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.800]
And a breakdown of why your show is not syndicated they went on to say how you've stolen that

[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.120]
drop from

[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.380]
They have stolen from me. It's official to them using it something. Huh? By the way

[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.700]
Who why are you gonna pay any attention that that was about Roy Foster, which was long

[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.260]
Before LeBaster was ever on a radio, but nevertheless

[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.600]
Play it all you want just keep playing it over and over again. That should be really good for 20 share

[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.040]
By the way, Randy Moller is funny when he shots the movie quoted song lyric after the panther's score a goal

[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.760]
His notable ones are Wilson from the movie cast away

[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.980]
He blinded him with science. Who's your daddy and what does he do and mad the meatloaf? Oh

[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.320]
Randy Moller who stole all the rich and arrex lines too from his days in Buffalo. Give me a break

[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.200]
Clown. He's a world-beater compared to guilty

[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:26.580]
I used to listen to manage, but a couple of friends told me to give LeBaster to shot and it's apparent that he's obsessed with you

[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:31.300]
I will submit that there shows a little fresher than manages interviews with our winback for example

[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.680]
You still are god. However on the air waves and George is your son

[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.860]

[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.040]
About Coco crisp

[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:55.900]
Coco is not his real name his first real name is Cavalli. Oh, I changed that too

[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.460]
Like I said, what kind of apparent names their kid Cavalli? Cavalli crisp

[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:04.640]
Coco is just his nickname, but you thought Coco was his first name. Therefore you made a mistake

[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.060]
You made a mistake 90 90 booboo you may mistake sign microzontal you made a mistake

We've done polls on that, but we ought to get a lot of emails on it moan the stupidest name of them all

[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.980]
LeVernius. I'm sorry. I just you know, uh, maybe it's an ethnic thing. I'm sure it is

[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:54.760]
That bit that we got what it's funny. It's a funny name. Well, LeVernius. What are some of the other ones?

[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:59.640]

Well, look it up. I am

[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:13.440]
Brady quins out for the year he put his finger in somebody some guy and bend it a little bit and the finger too

[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:21.080]
Maybe he's kind of Jeff Finger from the Leafs leaves lost and send the Jose last night five to two no surprise

[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:27.200]
You won't find that score in your son sent lots of that late game late late anything that's after seven o'clock at night late

[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.820]
We don't want to give you the information we go to bed and put our 10 pages of newspaper together by seven o'clock

[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:40.000]
Hey disgrace you people out there who are continuing to pay for that garbage and proposing as a newspaper you must be crazy people

[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.780]

[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.660]
And I'm not even there to read it except I was there last weekend though

[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:51.340]
Leotus McElvin oh leotus I like that leotus. It sounds like a disease like iliitis leotus

[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:56.180]
Oh, I'm suffering from leotus man. You know, maybe now that we got Obama as president

[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:00.740]
He can start instructing the dark folks on how to like number one speak properly and number two

[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.560]
Name your kids like real names like Barack, you know

[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.760]
When you think that would be good speak proper English

[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:13.420]
I mean here's a guy who was so brilliant so articulated so educated so you know such a minch

[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.960]
And we got people like Shannon Sharpen TV making you know and all the rappers on they're making all the kids illiterate

[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.260]
Isn't that that that we got as illiterate as they want to be?

[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:30.980]
Joe says I know about the Christian Jonas Brothers the bad boys of Disney. My teen and preteen daughters can't stand them

[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.140]
As well as Hannah Montana banana

[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.900]
I could see them for what they really are posters in the Disney production targeted for simple-to-watchers

[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.660]
Well, I'm a simple-to-they may be hot, but they just don't seem like a real band

[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:48.960]
Well, who cares about their music for Christ sakes although the bay you got to admit the a backstreet boys did have a few good songs

[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.360]
I gave them one

[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:56.720]
Well, they had a few they made some good music because they put them in that recording studio in Sweden somewhere in Stockholm

[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.380]
Orbit of hell it is and anybody could be a singer in that place

[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.720]
With all the accoutrements and crap and stuff

[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.020]
Mm-hmm have a great birthday George. It says I always tune in for your Bible lessons

[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:12.460]
Enjoy skating once in a while to have a nice day Joe. Thanks. Joe and his family know about the Christian Jonas Brothers. Yeah

[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.720]
They're good Christians with that very time Christian them a couple of many way

[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:22.900]
I'd like to turn them to God. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah turn them on to God

[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.860]
Oh, you can't say that they're so young or too bad

[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:34.660]
Seems to me that Britney Spears was about 16 17 years old when I give you that rolling stone magazine 17 well there you go

[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.760]
And who's the other one Brook Shields was like 14 or 15 when she was slapping her ass with those jeans spots

[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.060]
Mm-hmm Brook Shields 14 15 years old and guys are oodling her

[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.160]
And you know what you would say to that all right. That's right

[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:53.920]
Unless it was one of your daughters. Thank you. Who would get out of here pops?

[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.880]
Sorry, that'd be

[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.220]
Oh Mr. Radio is back. I hate all the negativity

[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.200]
Oh, yeah, oh man

[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.020]
Let me print this one out. It's fairly long at least he's back. He's been for a little uh

[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.820]
Is matter of fact I see there's another one from him on here. I've been gotten to this one yet

[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:21.040]
Here's a poll suggestion if Neil were in politics what position you see him. I think the prone position get out of here quick looking my ass

[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.440]
Believe you me. It's dirty

[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.600]
Neil, I read the article on your site about gay adoption very interesting for instance something you would consider yourself

[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:33.660]
You certainly have the means to do so. I've already got an unofficially adopted grandson. Okay

[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.840]
unofficially adopted in fact my friend Linda would be willing to be your very your child

[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:46.460]
I told her about your show several years ago and she's been a fan ever since she's a rather large-boned individual with strong child bearing hips

[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.640]
She's also fully aware you happen to be a gay man would really not be interested in consummating a child together

[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.920]
However, she said that's okay

[00:52:53.420 --> 00:53:00.820]
She said all you have to do is uh masturbate into a cup and the doctor will do the rest if you're interested just say so and I'll forward her for number

[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.340]
Don't waste her based her oh

[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.340]
And see Mr. Radio you made a mistake you made a mistake

[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.280]
How do you like that? He says I thought that the Roy Bed came from last year and W.I.O.D

[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.020]
Wasn't Roy the chief engineer at Paxing he was worse than

[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:23.440]
Uh Mitch Ween weenie Mitch Weenie's a dang good engineer by the way. Don't be knocking Mitch Weenie

[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.720]
But they got to knock everybody, you know

[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:30.880]
You're wrong Mr. Radio you made a mistake Roy was Roy Foster okay

[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:37.940]
Of our sales department at WQAM and I've also of uh that black dildo fame well he fell in love with that thing

[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.540]
He kind of had that I got to have that

[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.740]
Now why why do you think he needed that?

[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:50.220]
I mean he was a big black guy named Roy why did he need a big black dildo well you know because most of us only have one

[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.120]
No you wanted a spear

[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.980]
Sure maybe maybe wanted to give it to scurrying to hold on to do we never been with women. Let me tell you something

[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:58.900]
What's that?

[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.640]
Sometimes you want more than one but they want more than one yeah

[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.880]
Okay anyway, so Mr. Radio made a bad mistake okay my mouse is still working, but I'm telling it's it's dying

[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:16.440]
Larry says just an email to wish Georgia happy and healthy birthday. How do you like that nice nice?

[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.680]
Thanks Larry. Where's the you suck?

[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.160]
No, it doesn't

[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:25.720]
He's a regular email. He's a good guy and he's not a smart ass and not a real amateur comedian

[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.240]
Oh, you want to see uh well, I'm sure you already do on your email

[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.480]
You know to see some of the stuff that comes to your people thinking that they're funny for years

[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:38.520]
The pain is so great. I was giving my email out of the dress for years now. Yeah, and yeah

[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.800]
Just what you said

[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.380]
Just what you see do you get any from

[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:49.640]
No, you know, it's really fascinating. The bastard is obsessed with that particular drop in. I mean who cares about that

[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.800]
You know, you think that maybe he would graduate move on to some a little more uh

[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.600]
recent like

[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.280]
droids like that

[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:03.400]
Wouldn't you you'd think but evidently not he's obsessed with Roy when you keep playing a Danny boy

[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.020]
You keep playing it Mr. Radio says I have no life no kidding

[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.800]
I have no life

[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:13.260]
Neil, I hate all the negativity after years of enjoyment. I want to be able to give something back instead of just being a radio yenta

[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.220]
If there's something I can do for the show, please let me know

[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:25.240]
Whoo as mentioned before I have boxes and boxes of tapes of your show going back to the W.I.N. Z days

[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.920]
I really had no life then no kidding. I have no life

[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:33.400]
If you want me to digitize any old bits rejoins or jingles just let me know with your new contract

[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.780]
I figured you can use some help

[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.920]
I'm sure you will say just go away, but that's the sad part of your show

[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.640]
It seems a lot of people have gone away. Please don't let the show die a slow death

[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:48.100]
That's the sad part of your show now the sad part of the show is that the people have gone away

[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:52.200]
I have the ones that we want to go away. I don't want you to take that personally unless you want to but

[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.980]
P.S. I'm not that pain in the S used to be joined to thift with super Dave

[00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:00.980]
I remember that guy and boy was he pondress when you're just a replacement form if you're not him you're a clone

[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.020]
A clone again

[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.000]
Unnaturally man you're just another clone anybody who called himself mr. Radio is in fact

[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.560]
That's what they intaman I was thinking mr. Radio when I played that you didn't like it all

[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:15.100]
Didn't say that you didn't say that I thought you enjoyed

[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.300]
Years ago who's been dead for what 75 years over her to leave foulard anymore

[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:27.300]
Oh, this is really funny

[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.980]
This is the coupe

[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:35.240]
Degrass I just got a message an email on my blackberry guess who it's from

[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.340]
Lord Kent no

[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.840]
JC not Jesus really

[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.760]
JC Harry JC

[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.660]
No, you're JC

[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.760]
I'm JC from the QAM website

[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:54.980]
Cordis right. Oh that JC that JC subject. It's that time

[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.160]
He kneeled sorry to bring it up again, but I'm due for another check. Thanks

[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:04.720]
Thanks

[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.540]
How do you like that?

[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:14.460]
Three or four stories he put on her Saturday which I sent him at least it doesn't he puts three or four stories

[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.780]
Oh, I don't know what happened to you. They just got lost in space

[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:27.280]
Give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me

[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.280]
You shot big six

[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.360]
The

[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:34.680]
No can it go fast, it falls not for us.

[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:44.600]
No can it go fast, car is not for us.

[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.960]
I see a Saxby Chamber's one in Georgia last night.

[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:50.660]
That was a, you know, anybody knew that was going to happen.

[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.260]
Real redneck state, real, real redneckie.

[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:00.220]
Why do you think deliverance was filmed in entry?

[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:05.840]
I wouldn't be surprised if most of Georgia, I mean I've been in Atlanta many times,

[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:09.000]
but never in like the, in the outlying areas.

[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:11.920]
Yeah, is there really such a places entry?

[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:12.860]
I don't know.

[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.840]
I mean there's an entry, talk about that in a racetrack.

[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:15.400]
What?

[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.900]
Determine that there was not or something that they made it up for the movie.

[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:23.240]
And what about the, what's the, what's the, what's the,

[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:23.680]
what's the?

[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.940]
I don't think there's any real river such real river either.

[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.880]
I'll be damned, but I'm sure.

[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.520]
Well, there's like Okie Choby Okie.

[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.880]
Well, there's nothing about the deep South that anybody with a half a brain would

[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.640]
like I'd say to that.

[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:39.620]
Well maybe the warmth, I guess, you know, the warmth.

[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.640]
Let's take a look and see for Casanova what the Toronto temperature is right now.

[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:49.540]
It looks a little bit sunny out there plus 4, it's 40 degrees.

[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.580]
Oh my god, it's a heatwave. Let's go around around naked.

[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:59.180]
You know, I've never ever in my life been in a place like this city where in the winter time

[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.680]
On a day when it's like maybe 35

[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.880]
Like today. There are business guys walking around in their

[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:11.880]
shirts with no jacket no coat no sport jacket no just walking around outside like it was 80

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.120]
Yeah, well, what do you call that besides crazy? Well, it's up north those people are used to it

[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:26.140]
How how can you get used to freezing your ass off you did not when you lived up north? No, I see

[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:33.240]
641 votes in fact Chris is pulled they went to fart sounds back joys. They want the freaking fart sounds

[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.620]
There are no items in this view. I work my ass off to get my mouse fixed. Although now it froze up again

[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.720]
I'm really doobious about this mouse. Oh, there we go

[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.560]
It's it's on the verge of death

[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:51.240]
Call everybody you know tell Neil's mouse is gonna die on the ear to get out of here. Yes. Oh, yes

[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:58.040]
I think I think the highlight of the day will be when the mouse finally opens its mouth and says

[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:03.300]
Yeah, why doesn't what's his name libastian steal that?

[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.900]
Give him time at least that's relatively amusing as opposed to

[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:10.040]
Why you know, well, what is that as opposed to

[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.300]
Then again when you're dealing with goi and what do they know from oi?

[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.320]
Fart sounds 195 funny bits 115

[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.300]
Well

[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:23.280]
I'll tell you one thing we can play like a little bit of some of these

[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.620]
Listen to me. It's just stand by and steam us. Yeah, we can play that

[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:34.660]
Maybe that's what I'll do all day today. Just play a little tiny bits from bits that we can play beautiful, huh?

[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:42.020]
Well, there's a hell of a lot more of those than there are ones we can't play no question now. I don't think this has got any fart sounds

[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.280]
Somebody

[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.280]
Right right

[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:57.200]
And it just keeps thinking thinking and sticking and sticking and sticking. Oh, I think I'll play that after the break

[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:02.760]
I got a whole folder full of four bitten bits. We can play little bits on fun. Do you? Oh, yeah, for example

[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.620]
If it'll play

[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:09.720]
I got this Jonas brothers cute up. Oh

[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.260]
No

[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:16.360]
So let me tell you something about this if you love geometry and you know there's no I can't play that no no

[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:27.140]
No items in this view Neil at neo-rogynous.com. I'm checking my outlook expressed. There's nothing coming in these people have either abandoned us and they're really busy, you know, I'm busy

[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.060]
What's wrong with that to kind of lease a bit

[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.240]
Kind of lease a bit. Yeah, that wasn't kind of Lisa

[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.660]
Then there's this

[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.620]
Oh, no, you can't play that

[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.260]
God my gosh my good dickens

[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.480]
Can't be playing that

[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:56.040]
Although it is a holiday's time to get a couple of jugs of that cider and there's a there's some I don't even dare play any part of

[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.620]
Like the GM Brown star

[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.060]
Right don't be playing that

[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.140]
I'm afraid to say

[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.600]
What's that one called?

[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.600]
Dun dun dun dun

[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.280]
Oh bodily sound the bodily functions sound bodily functions. Yeah, there it is

[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.160]
As far as we can go with it

[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.720]
I think the um

[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.980]
Today officially the email thing died mr. Radio if you want to do something constructive for the show continue sending us your constructive emails

Because you're the only one who cares enough to send you're very best or worst or or whatever

[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.520]
The emails died at 11.22 a.m

[01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:48.600]
Just like Madeline a quick listing of the show at 10.40 a.m. Yesterday before her next 600 emails remember that sure

[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.860]

[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:57.660]
So about this CD I'm gonna make for you here. Yeah, I don't know one Jonas Brothers song from another

[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:04.560]
I couldn't name one I couldn't recognize one because uh, we ever been ours you should know that we've ever been on in the background of

[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.940]
Places so I don't know which ones are

[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:11.860]
Good or bad. I'm just gonna put everything that I first is they're all bad

[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.860]
Yeah, I'm gonna put everything that I was able to download on a CD for you and send it up

[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:19.920]
I'm not getting any information other than that one email. I'm not getting any response to that other than

[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.800]
You know, they're thinking you nasty old

[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.560]
Proverted fang, but they already knew that did get my point before you interrupted me

[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.440]
I'm gonna put everything I was able to get on a disc and so if uh, it's good, bad or indifferent

[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.300]
It ain't my fault. It's just everything was able to find I think we ought to swing over to the phone

[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.040]
Do it. It's ringing. Swing it on over, baby

[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.840]
Here's the worst news in history

[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.540]
Jeb Bush considers Senate run. Oh my god

[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.220]

[01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:25.950]
I'm kind of shocked, you know

Oh yeah, because yesterday and Monday they you know we started slow but then they there was a continual trickle

[01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.510]

[01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:20.990]
That was special wasn't it? Yes extra. Let's take a break and recover from that

[01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:22.630]
I'll get the breath

[01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:31.810]
I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers

[01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:40.470]
All right

[01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:52.330]
In this little room

[01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:57.990]
When I turn around and not see room and then the end here smells like a tune

[01:06:57.990 --> 01:07:01.710]
I saw you know perfume we gotta talk to you missing my

[01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:05.630]

[01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:09.250]
Get the hell out pull away. We're up and jump down now

[01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:14.010]
In Hollywood West for the wrong near death run away North West East now

[01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:15.090]

They know they did it got stiggy

[01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:36.750]

[01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:48.750]
Roll yeah, we're right done it and you can only imagine what that would smell like 1131 and 560

[01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:54.350]
I'm happy you a wednesday to you for it's Wednesday already. I'll be danged. I'll be gosh danged

[01:07:56.110 --> 01:08:00.830]
Here's one from the fakular king. Where is fat Chris today? Not a peep out of him. Give him a little peep Chris

[01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:02.530]
Say what I've been talking back and forth

How about a peep peep peep? There you go

[01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:11.890]
Where is fat Chris today? He's been talking up a storm a Hannah storm

[01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:18.390]
So what about those Jonas brothers, huh? What about a I don't know

[01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:22.310]
I'm almost sorry that I saw that thing because you know me. I feel compelled to talk about

[01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.430]
We don't have to jump anything they say

[01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.430]
Oh

[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:48.590]
I know they put on a good act that's what I mean no

[01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:55.230]
Here we go it took a little while, but Johnny dork there you go again Johnny dork

[01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:58.190]
I heard you take another shot of me this morning. What did I ever do to you?

[01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:02.330]
It's these annoying emails you didn't do anything to me until you stare with these annoying emails

[01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.950]
Why do you look down on everyone else in the biz? I don't

[01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:12.190]
The only one you revered nice to was Bill Carter. Are you dating Paco? No, I'm not dating Paco and Bill Carter was a good friend of mine

[01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:13.010]
and a good talent

[01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:19.810]
And a good guy and not a backstabbing phony and not something that would sit and waste his life away

[01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:23.830]
sending a bunch of useless emails to some schlep on the radio. That's why Johnny

[01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:27.650]
Fat man after dark. I'm glad you played that just there

[01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:36.730]
Says the Jonas Brothers performed during half time at the Cowboys game on Thanksgiving and all the girls in my family ages 9 to 16 ran in and shouted along with their music

[01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:41.510]
They might be attracted to you, but check out their crazy religious beliefs. It's scary

[01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:44.650]
See this kind of thing is scary to me

[01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.810]
Ted

[01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:49.870]
Well, why do why do I care about their religious beliefs?

[01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:55.350]
Why do I care because you're gonna join their church? Yeah, am I ever gonna?

[01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.650]
If I were gonna meet them I'm gonna know the fundamentalists so they do a lot of

[01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:04.510]
I'm gonna take a shower with the two uh good ones. They believe in anointing with oil and the laying on hands

[01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:09.770]
So what difference is it's scary. They're crazy religious to me. All religious beliefs are scary

[01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:17.510]
I

[01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.630]
Hold on

[01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:24.970]
So who cares? Hey, that's when you brought them up before and that's all I said is that they suck. They can't sing at all

[01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:29.670]
They suck. Well, that sounds like a good start. Well, I was talking about their singing. Oh

[01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:34.590]
Yeah, cuz that's I saw them on the uh, I guess it was the Cowboys game also

[01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:39.010]
Never seen them before heard about them because it's like, you know the new Disney thing and stuff like that

[01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:42.710]
But uh, it never seen before and they did I don't know two songs three songs

[01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:45.990]
Now I'm just gonna like oh my god these kids suck

[01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:54.930]
Here's one from Kurt. I think I finally get it with these a holes

[01:10:54.930 --> 01:11:00.490]
They seem to think somehow they can hijack your show and turn themselves into the wack pack south

[01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:06.190]
I guess there aren't any open editions on the steering show for mental defectives have a good day. No, he's got enough already

[01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:12.510]
Here's one from John who's asleep at that genie dump button

[01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:17.310]
That's why we decided you will eliminate calls again. You cannot let call her say or spell the word

[01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:23.710]
Yeah, that's right. They heard it online. If respectfully Joyce. Mm-hmm. I told them. There's no effect on the internet

[01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:30.450]
What I warned them to that again, please okay, please. It's another thing they don't care about right?

[01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:34.030]
I'm doing the way thing about and it's just the way it is. It's a radio thing so they don't know from it

[01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:38.350]
Instead of being a misfit enjoy the fact that you can hear those things every once in a while

[01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:40.990]
Mm-hmm. That was wrong with you. Hey, no skin off our teeth

[01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:45.030]
Well, I have never seriously. I bet you that even in Bangladesh

[01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.130]
You'll never find so many unhappy people as in South Florida, right?

[01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:55.490]
They find things to be upset about and pissed off about that nobody in their right mind could care less about

[01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:57.670]
Let's be very boring here. Oh wait. It is

[01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:03.270]
They might be attractive to you, but check out their crazy religious beliefs and getting back to that

[01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:08.190]
I'm really not sure what they look like because you know the concert last night is like a lot of makeup and stuff

[01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:14.490]
And I'm looking at the pictures online and you bet I am and I don't know it's hard to tell until you until you meet somebody in person

[01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:16.870]
You don't really know what they look like. You know what I mean by that? Yep

[01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:20.450]
Some people photograph well some people photograph very poorly

[01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:24.750]
Correct some it's just as well, you know

[01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:27.390]
Some they do and some they don't

[01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:30.770]
I take a little sniff. I'll tell you that

[01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:36.690]
Have all those little girls clawing at my back. I'd I'd waddle my way in there and take a little sniff

[01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:41.330]
In fact, this is the sports station. Why don't we take showers with the two hot Jonas brothers?

[01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:50.670]
I'll do it. I'll volunteer. Yeah, they'll be the tall boy. Here's my close friend Greg in Detroit. Oh, he's not in Detroit anymore. He's in round rock, Texas

[01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:52.530]
Wow

[01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:59.970]
He says I'm the guy who tried to hire you back to Detroit. Well, I'm not going to Detroit for a visit for like an animal for anything

[01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:01.050]
I'm not going there Greg

[01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:06.490]
Detroit my the outdoor toilet makes South Florida look like paradise like Mo would say

[01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:07.490]
Paradise

[01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:10.270]
Then he says his labaster the

[01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:15.210]
Liberry Tard trying to start a war. He is is the effing nuts. Yes

[01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:19.630]
He did over there. That's their new deal. Oh, we're gonna suck your needle into it

[01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:24.630]
And the Sedano tried it and said the kid tried it and now a labaster go ahead have a good time

[01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:27.690]
Just keep my name alive. That's all because this station sure doesn't do it

[01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.090]
Haven't streamed in a while, but I am today. I'm loving it

[01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:34.650]
I would actually put you on because I read you might be replacing

[01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:38.770]
Bubba on Howard 101 do it do it now. I'm not replacing anybody on anywhere

[01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:43.650]
Okay, I got five more years to go here after this month expires and nobody has made me an offer anywhere Greg

[01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:47.610]
Except you I should have taken that offer Detroit. We'd have been big there

[01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:53.950]
Can you imagine oh? Yeah, I'd have been I'd have been big stuff with all of my spurs in Detroit

[01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:58.030]
I'll take that we got all the Motown songs and those are jingles. That's right

[01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:00.770]
All the jingles all the time

[01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:05.550]
Could have gone to lunch there with Dick pertin at loose finder deli, which he says really sucks now

[01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:09.350]

Oh, just want to go to 666 red as in LDablo

[01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.930]

So I just find out from Lee that uh one of the Jonas Brothers. Yes, was dating Taylor Swift

[01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:33.970]
Who's like an up-and-coming country star?

[01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:36.470]
Beautiful girl and he dumped her

[01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:40.530]
Yeah, because they have that whole promise ring thing going

[01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:45.270]
Where they don't miss is she want she wanted to touch it? I guess did she want to look at it?

[01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:48.310]
She want to sniff it and he said uh, I can't do that. I'm sorry. No

[01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:55.410]
Can't really really get out of here promise my ass get out of here. I do all the time. Oh my god

[01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:59.930]
Those takers though somebody looks like that and he's turning down flesh you got to be kidding me

[01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:03.350]
Fat man after dark is right crazy religious beliefs is correct

[01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:07.550]
God wasting away those great years of his life

[01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:16.810]
The Carolina Panthers have fired Peter Lava uh Lava Leritzis Lava Lava Lelet and replaced him with Paul Marisse

[01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:22.510]
Oh Paul Marisse back to the scene of the slime. How do you think it'll affect the Eastern conferences? I don't know and I don't care

[01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:24.830]
Peter Lava Leritzis

[01:15:25.410 --> 01:15:31.770]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and then somebody wants me to go through that whole shawna everything because he just is a former girlfriend or whatever

[01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:38.390]
Said something about sloppy seconds and crap. Oh, the whole thing is just shawna reads a slime ball

[01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:40.370]
That's also what do we just make at least he's consistent

[01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:45.490]
Let's do some hockey talk that'll teach these bastards a thing or two

[01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:51.770]
So what is it again now one of the Jonas Brothers which one maybe the ugly one? I don't know

[01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:55.710]
It doesn't have a name. There's Joe and Nick. I don't know what one from the other

[01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:59.810]
I think Joe is the real real real real real real real real a hot number

[01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:02.330]
Hey Joe, but you know Joe

[01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:08.130]
These are kids for Christ's Day. They're like 16 19 and 21. They're just kids

[01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:12.850]
You know what I mean? Yeah, so what's wrong with that?

[01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:18.670]
Is there something wrong with looking at somebody and being like somewhat aroused?

[01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.970]
Not to me

[01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:27.730]
I mean if they were like nine and ten eleven. Yeah, then there's something really sick about that, but they're not

[01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:33.050]
And like I said, I'm not really sure what they look like. I'll have you send them up here for maybe over the

[01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:37.330]
Section you can do and I'll inspect and I'll let you guys know I got plenty of room on my shower

[01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:38.490]
I have a nice stall shower

[01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:42.890]
Apparently it was the lead singer who in a way laughing about

[01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:47.150]
Because I was like well, which one is the lead singer and he's like trying to describe like the hair when he goes

[01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:48.690]
It's the good looking one

[01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:52.010]
So which one's good looking what I least at it

[01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:55.710]
That's why I'm laughing. There's two of them that are good looking the one with a dark jet black hair

[01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:59.110]
I think is Joe he's the real okay. That's the one. He's the real deal

[01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:03.790]
The wheel deal you like nervous laugh. No, it's not a nerd. It's funny because I'm like well

[01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:07.730]
Which one is it so I can tell you know Neil or whatever he's like and he's trying to describe like the hair

[01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:12.210]
He goes well, it's the good looking one and I you know just hearing him saying there's good looking one

[01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:14.430]
Good to me. I got my eye on two of them

[01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:18.930]
Christmas Hanukkah gift one for a Christmas gift one for a Tannuka gift

[01:17:18.930 --> 01:17:21.770]
Well, they're eight days of answers as in the dumpster that other one

[01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:26.090]
How they how can they be related the three of them one of them two of them are so cute and one of them is so ugly

[01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:28.010]
How's that possible?

[01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:33.830]
Mm-hmm. Maybe he's got maybe he's got like something defective in his jeans. Maybe he's the mailman's kids speaking of my mouse dying

[01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:37.950]
The biggest names the best talent is the mad dog

[01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:41.470]
Oh

[01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:45.410]
The sports video 560 QAM these sports leaders

[01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:54.430]
Oh my god

[01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:07.650]
I'm right on the air you can tell your fans you don't like their demands if they have some

[01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:09.290]
Just say no

[01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:16.750]
And then tell goma can't to tell the management you want nobody missing with your show

[01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:24.430]
Go round from Finland to and when your shift is through tell George you can relax and smoke some weed

[01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:32.410]
And then go tell joebell that he can go to hell even almost makes you miss great greed

[01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:39.590]
But don't play a fart the sound of a fart. I don't think George would understand

[01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:47.350]
Because if you play a fart the sound of a fart you'll be in trouble with the beastly clean

[01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:02.570]
You

[01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:15.930]
Lumb 47 13 to noon at 560 WQAM one thing. I'll say about that Josh Cortes

[01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:23.450]
Boy does he have a lot of hootspa? I just got your setting him a check not that long ago. Did I? I don't know wasn't that long ago

[01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:28.670]
You sure as I wasn't no three months. I'll guarantee you that well I do know

[01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:34.510]
When it gets closer to like Christmas in Chinooka time then maybe I'll send you some more money Cortes

[01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:39.050]
Otherwise get out of my face get out of my face and get out of my space and

[01:19:39.890 --> 01:19:44.890]
Talk about being out of touch with this show Greg formerly from Detroit who tried to hire me several times

[01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:51.290]
He says I know Detroit blows. That's why I'm in Austin nobody in radio will hire me. So I open a business F clear channel

[01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:57.130]
Glad to hear your well play the sofa king spot makes me pee my pants every time like we can play the sofa king spot

[01:19:57.130 --> 01:20:05.050]
Greg are you claiming or what he is so out of touch and we wish like you don't know we should have played for you right now 10 times can't do it

[01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:05.890]
Can't do it

[01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:12.390]
Can't do this and can't do that and can't play this and can't play that because these people are scared crapless man

[01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:18.210]
They are scared of their own shadow and when it comes to competing. It's not it. That's the words not of their vocabulary

[01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:22.190]
Now fat man after dark is back again

[01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:26.790]
Senior see I told you and let me say it again. I don't care how religious they are

[01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:32.650]
Because one thing I've discovered about people who proclaim to be religious just like Jim Baker and Jimmy Swagger and all the other

[01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:36.630]
The more religious they claim to be the more horny they are and the more they're screwing and doing

[01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:44.010]
So fat man says senior I told you that Jonas Brothers are religious nuts which probably means they're just looking for someone to step in and

[01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:49.190]
Reverse their brainwashing any volunteers. I got my hand up in the air and I got the other one up in the year too

[01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:54.190]
But I only got two hands of the third one the ugly one he'll have to he'll have to a concert with somebody else

[01:20:56.390 --> 01:21:00.190]
You know I made a bad mistake or toward besides showing up here today

[01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:06.450]
I invited mr. Radio as the subject critiques of the show. I didn't ask for critiques of the show

[01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:11.730]
I asked for some material okay not for a critique of the show. I don't do critiques mr. Radio

[01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:17.230]
One take calls but we'd out the cranks half that Chris screened the calls call block the cranks

[01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:23.290]
One number one we can't call block anybody on this horseball station and number two. I'm not I'm not in the screening calls

[01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:27.490]
And I'm also not in the people tell me how to do the show you a hole

[01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:30.690]
Did I tell you this guy's a jerk you mentioned that

[01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:34.270]
Number two have someone on staff record news and TV broadcast

[01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:40.830]
If you're interested if you play each day this will be material talk about

[01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:46.250]
Cillin on staff like we've got a staff you ask for material and you got it. Oh my god

[01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:50.410]
This man is a crazy person treat bring back the old bits. Sorry. I can't play him

[01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:56.170]
For bringing you friendly guests once in a while remember the Dion show at WIOD. Yeah, there's one

[01:21:56.170 --> 01:22:02.850]
And five people of the inside to radio talk radio wars are great. Oh this guy is just

From hunger you are the worst the all-time mr. Radio 610 is his email address by the way

[01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:11.890]
Mr. Radio 610

[01:22:13.090 --> 01:22:17.570]
I wonder if that's just a coincidence or if he just happens to be one of those chronics over there

[01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:21.070]
Bring back the radio wars. Oh

[01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.370]

What do you think what do you think maybe go away mr. Radio like a show do us a favor

[01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:32.770]
He asked what he could do here's the answer go away

[01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:34.230]
You're annoying

Is it because of that ring thing or some other thing? Yeah, they got ring

[01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:58.630]
Well, I can't tell you what kind of ring they wear yeah

[01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:01.010]

It's got pictures in all here. There's the ugly one on the right. I

[01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:19.650]
Nick I'm sure is the Joe is the one with a dark jet black hair and the little punky one

[01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:25.330]
I think is Nick who looks like he needs a meal somebody feed him please he looks like he's got Karen Carpenter syndrome

[01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:33.090]
So who sent this manny thanks manny and telehassee you know let's see the people in Dayton Broward stiffs and telehassee

Neil at neorages.com by the way is that address mr. Radio go away. I'll block you again. You just get out of my face. You're an idiot

[01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:43.910]
Critiques of the show

[01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:52.190]
Go critique somebody else's show k. You smuck you loser you he's got boxes and boxes and boxes of tapes

[01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:55.750]
But he's gonna critique the show like I need some assistance from a loser like him

[01:23:56.230 --> 01:23:57.730]
To tell me how to do a radio show

[01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:05.090]
I know how to do a show with my hands tied behind my back and believe you me. That's what we do every day here

[01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:08.610]
Wow from the Sunday

[01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:12.670]
Brick times online the Jonas Brothers no need to lock up your daughters

[01:24:13.450 --> 01:24:19.550]
The Jonas Brothers are the celibate squeaky clean boy band of pre-pubescent dreams. What would it take to lead them in his temptation?

[01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.510]
And

[01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:25.530]
There's a long article here. I could read this to put everybody into a coma

[01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:30.530]
Said I read it. Are you threatening me? It'll take us till midnight. It goes on forever

[01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:35.470]
I just don't think that anyone in the audience is as interested in the Jonas Brothers as you are

[01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:42.830]
Although are you kidding me? There's some spoilers. I'm sorry. Are you kidding me? There's some queen barb barring them. Yeah, some sorry. Yeah

[01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:49.130]
Already a small number of teenage girls are stalking the soho hotel the Jonas Brothers have only been here a few hours

[01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:51.530]
They arrived last night on a private jet from

[01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:55.670]
Lofton from Germany to to Luton from Germany. We're according to one publicist

[01:24:55.670 --> 01:25:00.990]
There are several a CD signing caused mayhem fans hysterical with hormonal overload

[01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:05.850]
desperate to read the same air as the objects that their love lusted fantasy and not that good

[01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:11.790]
The Jonas their fans call them did you know that? No, see we learned something already here

[01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:14.270]
The Jonas are what happens when teenage girls rule

[01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:20.330]
They are three almost perfect pretty pop stars except for the ugly one untouched and untouchable working pretty much the same

[01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:22.630]
Dynamic as the osman several decades ago

[01:25:23.490 --> 01:25:25.470]
You hear the sirens coming to get me

[01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:29.670]
Kosey and real they sing nicely crafted pop rock songs last year

[01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:33.570]
They toured with Miley Cyrus and earlier this year they did their own multi-million dollar tour

[01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:38.350]
Their movie camp rock was Disney channels most watch non-sequel film on a premier this year

[01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:43.990]
They've entered the Forbes top 100 most powerful celebrities at number 89 earning six million pounds over the last year

[01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:46.570]
That's 12 million bucks and that figure is rising fast

[01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:54.630]
Their music has aged nuance whether rock or rapi they cite their influences as prince Elvis Castello and Johnny Cash

[01:25:54.630 --> 01:26:00.970]
They walked the line they both look fine the songs are written mostly by Nick the youngest of the band at sixteen

[01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:05.270]
Joe is 19. He has straight here. He's straight while the others are curly

[01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:09.810]
He's flirting and wants to be Mick Jagger Kevin 21 is thin lip serious

[01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:16.070]
I can't tell which is what they never put the names under the pictures except the Joe is 19 that's old enough

[01:26:17.530 --> 01:26:22.590]
It's hard to believe their songs of love and life and all its complicates are written by a 16 year old who's never had a serious relationship

[01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:26.050]
And it seems unlikely to have anyone anytime soon given that they're

[01:26:26.710 --> 01:26:33.070]
Either touring the world promoting albums or locked into another TV studio for Jonas the TV show which seems to be reality show in the mode of the monkeys

[01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:38.270]
They say it's more like the cult sitcom flight of the concords

[01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:45.230]
Which makes things really weird or what makes things is what Russell brand put it out at the MTV Music Awards

[01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:48.230]
Each wears a ring to say they are not going to have sex before marriage

[01:26:48.230 --> 01:26:51.710]
They can have sex with any woman they want but choose not to or with any guy they want

[01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:55.410]
That's like Superman deciding to use the bus instead of a superpowers

[01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:58.010]
Americans find this hard to take

[01:26:58.590 --> 01:27:03.390]
The American idol winner Jordan Sparks who also wears a ring retorted not everybody wants to be a slut

[01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:06.730]
My race service also has a purity ring

[01:27:06.730 --> 01:27:11.590]
She was rumored of mandating they also ring Nick Jonas you can't help wondering what they didn't what they didn't do

[01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:15.490]
But he tells me later they didn't have any kind of romance she might have liked taking a sniff, you know

[01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:22.510]
Anyway last night loads of German fans went crazy for what they couldn't have Kevin beautifully groomed him accidentally

[01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:29.790]
Press trousers jacket buttoned up indoors tight curly here comes down to talk to me first and it goes on and on and on

[01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:32.390]
On hundred pages of this

[01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:38.150]
When Nick was 13 you discovered he had diabetes

[01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:40.250]
How do you like that?

[01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:43.830]
See you have an in maybe he needs to be nursed back to health

[01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:48.230]
Unless Nick is the ugly one in which case let him maybe he takes injections and you can help him

[01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.070]
Oh no there he goes again

[01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:56.250]
Recktoes starting with that filth I never I never brought that starting with that disgusting filth

[01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:58.550]
That's all you think about is hanky spanky

[01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:01.410]
Too bad they can't swim

[01:28:02.710 --> 01:28:05.030]
This is the reason that people barely listen to you anymore

[01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:08.330]
Says somebody who's listening you're totally out of touch with what's going on here for example

[01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:13.850]
I remember how much you ran it endlessly when the i95 flyover was built now they built these new i95 express lanes

[01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:16.090]
Which are much worse you haven't read the word about it

[01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:20.570]
Have you had you been ranting about it when it opened your phone board would know it out of been lit up like Christmas tree

[01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:22.730]
And you know what they still would have built them and nothing would change

[01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:26.270]
I ran at the bottom. We're good. There you go. George is down there

[01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:31.230]
He's yeah like I want to be there so I can talk about highways and the crap like that and the metro fail

[01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:37.070]
Get cereal and I love people have emailed me telling me that nobody listens to me anymore except they're listening

[01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:40.930]
They can tell me everything I do talk about and everything I don't talk about

[01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:49.790]
Fake Larry King says tell that mr. Raider to get a life what station is he on tell him and Johnny dark to go make love and go the hell away

[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.670]
What make another one?

[01:28:57.210 --> 01:29:02.870]
This is mark Morgan is the 12 to one hour on Q8M

[01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:11.790]
In record stores now. It's the most repulsive Christmas album. You'll ever hear

[01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:15.030]
Ali McBio purges all the Christmas favorites

[01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:29.470]
Listen to it while eating a fruit case

[01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:36.490]
How do you like that?

[01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:41.730]
Bravo to the 560 WQM what's that Wednesday schedule look like we got the big O2 to 4

[01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:45.930]
Oh, who's always rock solid and then it got some bad news for you. No mad doggy today

[01:31:27.130 --> 01:31:28.350]
He makes me look modest

[01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:33.430]

And and nothing he you know, that's it end of story

[01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:07.070]
If it's legal then it's fine and even if it's like very close

[01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:15.170]
You know, I mean by that no what check ID always check ID. That's a good idea check ID and then go nuts

[01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:21.490]
I'd I'd whip that ring off so fast that chastity ring. I you know people are

[01:35:21.490 --> 01:35:25.670]
I'm one of those believe in living let live do no harm all of that. I've talked about it for years, but

[01:35:26.410 --> 01:35:31.130]
I do not understand people. Well, what what is that whole I mean obviously it's a scam

[01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:37.250]
To make them more appealing to the young girls so that the parents don't get all you know freaked out

[01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:43.930]
Mm-hmm. You see what I'm saying? Yes, that's obviously what that's all about make them more wholesome, you know more

[01:35:44.490 --> 01:35:44.890]

Okay, here's a very Steven Jersey who's just out of control. I mean this is so long

[01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:16.910]
But I'll read it because we don't have any other emails because your call sucked

[01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:24.330]
I think what I could do the rest of the day today is just play

[01:36:24.330 --> 01:36:26.190]
Roy Roy

[01:36:26.710 --> 01:36:30.890]

[01:36:59.410 --> 01:37:01.950]
Used to be big shot used to be hot stuff

[01:37:03.130 --> 01:37:06.510]
It says Mr. Show live Tuesday, but enjoying the archive this morning

[01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:09.530]
It's a real treat listing when I want to like the rest of the vast audience

[01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:12.390]
It doesn't have to wake up in south road to hear you and on the archives

[01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:16.650]
List is conserved through the endless awful QA and commercials to get back to the show

[01:37:17.670 --> 01:37:23.090]
Amen to your comments on sports and options that can't shut the f up can't leave a second go by without somebody putting unneeded

[01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:25.870]
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup in can't just let the action go

[01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:30.650]
I remember the days when you could listen to the background sound even on golf for 10 seconds and just soak it in

[01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.850]
I

[01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:41.050]
Had the TV on with the sound down on some sports show yesterday between jox nippers and suits and tie and tie and hyperventilating over plexigo

[01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:46.430]
I caught Dan La Bastard his face was so orange either bathed in man tan or he went face down into a

[01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:48.710]
pumpkin

[01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:52.810]
It's a chopped off of something pumpkin

[01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:57.570]
The other day an emailer commented on token blacks on f NFL shows

[01:37:58.570 --> 01:38:04.530]
WTF he says there's four black guys with shaved heads on suits on every desk on every show shanol please

[01:38:04.530 --> 01:38:05.430]
I thank god

[01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:08.030]
I don't have to watch and listen to that much mouth junkie Michael Irvin either

[01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:15.770]
There are the requisite white guys Terry Danny Jimmy Chris Collins worth and the second all time couldn't win the big one token white guy boomer

[01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:24.010]
The thought that anyone listened to these two pinheads Jim Rome Wiggorx Wiggorx Jordan there and Joe Scarborough only confirms that people will listen to anything

[01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:30.110]
And then he goes out about the wall marked the buckle and a near death experience he had which is too long

[01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:31.430]
Neil keep up your medallion

[01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:35.590]
I'm not listening anymore updates and please keep the serious violets and whispered down updates

[01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:41.430]
And keep checking on George to see if he's actually listening to the show and unimmersed in this online Cuban soap porn

[01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:49.230]
PS the very last godfather trivia the baby that Michael is godfather to baptized while everybody is getting whacked is

[01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:52.310]
Sophia Coppola years before she bought the franchise to a screeching halt

[01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:55.750]
You didn't know that did you nope that's the baby it's Sophia

[01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:02.310]
Maybe he poured too much water on the schnauz and like grew yeah it grew some

[01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:08.670]
Why do I not pay any attention I got Cuban soap down so 73 what I said I'm not paying any attention

[01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:13.410]
I got Cuban soap porn going over here. Oh good no items in this view. How do you like that

[01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:16.650]
Like I said today is the day the emails died

[01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:22.090]
And I got news for I'd rather have it say no items in this view than mr. radio that that that

[01:39:22.570 --> 01:39:23.790]
crap that critique

[01:39:24.490 --> 01:39:27.830]
Although stupid ass suggestions a each one dumber than the previous one

[01:39:29.650 --> 01:39:33.950]
Everybody who listens to these shows thinks that they can do it better that they they got a better idea

[01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:38.090]
How you should do it or even though they listen every minute of every day and have zillions of tapes

[01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:41.430]
They've got tapeworm. They've got so many tapes mr. Radio

[01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:45.130]
I wonder what he does that I would be maybe he polishes Disney's nose

[01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:55.070]
Fourth

[01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:25.830]
The twist, because God has broken

[01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:29.030]
That dance is a success

[01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:32.430]
There won't be no dance in this sin

[01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:33.630]
I believe the party too

[01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:35.030]
I can't go on as proud

[01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:37.990]
If they catch a dance and be a shit

[01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:40.230]
I think they'll say they do what they have to work

[01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:45.130]
Unless you will and to take the chance

[01:40:45.130 --> 01:40:47.990]
I wouldn't try it, I think I'll pass

[01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.930]
Don't dance

[01:40:50.830 --> 01:40:51.930]
Don't dance

[01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:55.270]
Don't do the best with Tader

[01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:56.650]
Or what you'll see too

[01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:58.390]
Or a martial arts problem

[01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:59.430]
It's gonna bust you

[01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:00.650]
Don't dance

[01:41:04.650 --> 01:41:05.330]
Don't dance

[01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:07.530]
We don't allow dancing here

[01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:09.430]
You will see two dancing

[01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:11.270]
Maybe at least not so now

[01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:13.270]
Stop, go to hell

[01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:16.090]
Oh, don't let go to hell

[01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.390]
Let me with our new general

[01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:19.590]
That you'll go to hell

[01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:21.710]
It's your time to go to hell

[01:41:21.710 --> 01:41:24.770]
Oh, don't say go to hell

[01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:27.590]
Oh, don't say go to hell

[01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:29.730]
Let me with our new general

[01:41:29.730 --> 01:41:31.070]
That you'll go to hell

[01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:33.310]
It's your time to go to hell

[01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:35.390]
Oh, don't dance

[01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:36.650]
Don't dance

[01:41:37.930 --> 01:41:41.090]
And space will rise above your head

[01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:44.790]
And the hookah, hookah, got to do

[01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:47.910]
Will rise in wide a fist

[01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:50.750]
That's flying the root of love

[01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:54.730]
Damn God

[01:41:54.730 --> 01:41:58.530]
From 18 to 560 WQM, here's an immediate response from Mr. Radio

[01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:00.930]
Hopefully the last one

[01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:02.630]
Just go the hell away already, will you?

[01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:04.730]
Just go away, I already turned it that a couple weeks ago

[01:42:04.730 --> 01:42:05.450]
Go away

[01:42:06.350 --> 01:42:07.850]
How rude, how this?

[01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:09.010]
Yeah, just get a life

[01:42:09.010 --> 01:42:11.290]
Okay, I'm not interested in you and your boxes of tapes

[01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:13.850]
And your digitized A-hole and whatever else you got

[01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:16.370]
He says, you surly bastard

[01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:18.550]
I think Johnny Dork is right about you

[01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:20.210]
See, he's still doing stick, Johnny Dork

[01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:22.850]
You've become so surly in your old age

[01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:23.770]
I'm not surly at all

[01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:25.970]
I'm the same as I was 10 years ago, 20 years ago

[01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:26.710]
Am I right?

[01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.590]
Yeah

[01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:29.250]
Not anymore, surly

[01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:31.050]
Maybe more girly

[01:42:31.050 --> 01:42:33.550]
I thought you asked me for a critique earlier

[01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:34.870]
Did I ask him for a critique?

[01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.590]
I don't remember that

[01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:37.590]
No, I said if you want to help the show

[01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:39.590]
Just continue sending your material and your crap

[01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:41.070]
And all this other stuff

[01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:42.830]
And that would be the way you could contribute

[01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:43.910]
Because that's what he asked before

[01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:46.810]
Because I said nobody else very much is emailing the day any out

[01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:48.990]
I didn't ask for some kind of a stupid-ass critique

[01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.610]
And then he says, excuse me for trying to contribute to the show

[01:42:52.610 --> 01:42:54.010]
Well, if that's your idea of contributing

[01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:55.870]
You used to tell me how to do the show then blow it out

[01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:58.170]
Your stupid anonymous ass, Mr. Radio

[01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:00.130]
What did I tell you before?

[01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:03.470]
Anybody who calls himself Mr. Radio is just a lifeless groupie

[01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:04.310]
In fact, how many times?

[01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.970]
I have no life

[01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:06.270]
How many times did he say I have no life?

[01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:07.190]
Not 30, man

[01:43:07.190 --> 01:43:07.910]
I have no life

[01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:08.070]
Right?

[01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:09.410]
In the earlier email

[01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:10.690]
I have no life

[01:43:10.690 --> 01:43:12.610]
See, when somebody tells you they have no life

[01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:14.690]
I mean, that's you can bet your life on it

[01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:19.190]
I mean, a lot of these people don't have to tell us that we already know it

[01:43:19.190 --> 01:43:21.170]
But when they volunteer the information

[01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:24.890]
That's like putting in big bold letters on a billboard

[01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:28.010]
Saying Mr. Radio has no life and he doesn't

[01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:30.970]
So just take all those tapes and go back to the old days

[01:43:30.970 --> 01:43:32.110]
When I wasn't so surly

[01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:33.810]
When I was a really nice sweet guy

[01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:35.350]
And all this other

[01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:37.330]
The dows only have 14 points by the way

[01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:37.550]
Oh

[01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:39.970]
Today's Woodbine Wednesday by the way I'm going to make a lot of money

[01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:41.350]
Good or not?

[01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:42.450]
I'm going to have a good time

[01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:42.910]
I'll say that

[01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:44.250]
Two o'clock I'll be out of here

[01:43:44.250 --> 01:43:47.030]
I'm going to keep you posted with Bulletin's on when I got my shirt on

[01:43:48.650 --> 01:43:50.830]
I'll let you know when I have my pantaloonies on and my shoes

[01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.330]
Oh, you don't put your pants on first?

[01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:57.430]
First what?

[01:43:57.650 --> 01:43:58.350]
Before my shirt?

[01:43:58.570 --> 01:43:58.890]
Right

[01:43:59.490 --> 01:43:59.810]
No

[01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:00.270]
Okay

[01:44:00.850 --> 01:44:02.950]
You put your pants on before you put your shirt on?

[01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:03.770]
Sometimes

[01:44:04.290 --> 01:44:05.890]
What a surety idea that is

[01:44:05.890 --> 01:44:08.130]
Well, I don't talk it in like you do

[01:44:09.730 --> 01:44:10.490]
Or my shirt

[01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:11.030]
I want to be sure

[01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.350]
Yeah

[01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:13.810]
I wonder if the Jonas Brothers talking in

[01:44:13.810 --> 01:44:14.530]
A bit of they do

[01:44:14.530 --> 01:44:17.470]
Maybe I'd like to talk those two of them into bed at night

[01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.950]
Haha

[01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:20.650]
Yo, baby

[01:44:20.650 --> 01:44:21.350]
Be the official

[01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:23.390]
You've had a bedtime guy

[01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:24.710]
That last picture

[01:44:24.710 --> 01:44:26.010]
And it wasn't naked either

[01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.270]
And in what I tell you they look better with their clothes on

[01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:29.350]
Believe me, especially the one

[01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:31.910]
He looks like he has not a meal in 80 years

[01:44:32.770 --> 01:44:34.530]
God, somebody feed that kid a sandwich

[01:44:34.530 --> 01:44:35.330]
Maybe that's what

[01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:36.550]
And no sex, no food

[01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:40.290]
And there was some other little article I was reading about

[01:44:40.290 --> 01:44:41.630]
And what the whole deal?

[01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:46.450]
You know, no drugs, no smoking, no drinking, no touchy, no peepee, no nothing

[01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:49.490]
What kind of a life is that?

[01:44:51.690 --> 01:44:52.410]
A lie

[01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:53.230]
That's what it is

[01:44:53.230 --> 01:44:54.250]
Oh, they say that

[01:44:54.250 --> 01:44:54.870]
You don't believe it?

[01:44:54.970 --> 01:44:55.870]
You think there's not a drinker

[01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:56.890]
I've been there, I've been there done that

[01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.350]
I've been a teenage born again Christian

[01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:59.990]
I know exactly what goes on

[01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:01.450]
Hanky spanky

[01:45:01.450 --> 01:45:01.670]
Sure

[01:45:02.690 --> 01:45:04.450]
I remember one year, many years ago

[01:45:04.450 --> 01:45:07.230]
I was like vacationing and I was in Panama City beach

[01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:09.450]
For somebody, I was just driving around the state

[01:45:10.710 --> 01:45:15.430]
And they had one of these Christian retreat kind of things for the kids you know teenagers

[01:45:16.570 --> 01:45:17.630]
On the beach

[01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:21.690]
Born again, devout, holier than all the rest of us

[01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:23.570]
And they were screwing their brains out right there on the beach

[01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:25.730]
Kind of interesting

[01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:28.290]
Carl says I'm working from home now

[01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:30.010]
So my daily poll vote is hit or miss

[01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:31.830]
What does that mean?

[01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:33.570]
But it says we're listening

[01:45:34.710 --> 01:45:39.150]
I was in a Virginia garden's hardware story yesterday and I said hey this place should have Neal on

[01:45:39.150 --> 01:45:41.830]
The owner said he was a fan but didn't know you were still on the year

[01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:43.470]
Oh my god

[01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:45.710]
Oh, I'm going to kill myself right now I'm going to do

[01:45:45.710 --> 01:45:46.730]
We hear stuff like that all the time

[01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:47.470]
What?

[01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:49.550]
Year stories like that all the time since we've come here

[01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:52.410]
Looks like a billboarder to a long way to bump the number of these girls

[01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:55.210]
They don't promote this show, they don't promote anything that we do

[01:45:55.210 --> 01:45:56.310]
We're an embarrassment

[01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:59.550]
They don't want to be associated with us, they don't want to be associated with our website

[01:45:59.550 --> 01:46:02.170]
They don't sell any spots, they don't do anything for this show

[01:46:02.610 --> 01:46:04.710]
Even muff, you notice how muff is vanished too?

[01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:06.030]
Probably no coincidence

[01:46:07.170 --> 01:46:09.390]
Unless she's on vacation or something, is she on vacation?

[01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.370]
I don't know

[01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:11.790]
You seen her around Chris?

[01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:13.210]
This week earlier?

[01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:14.330]
Yeah, it's all this week one day

[01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:14.970]
Yeah

[01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:17.210]
So not on vacation just avoiding us

[01:46:19.110 --> 01:46:23.270]
Just avoiding us because we've got no restaurant last week, we've got no restaurant this week

[01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:26.350]
I mean I don't want to talk about this stuff on the year but why did he not?

[01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:29.470]
Doff, go to the instant

[01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:33.350]
Anyways, there's just a little note to let you know tomorrow December 4th

[01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:36.390]
Is the 15th anniversary of the death of Frank Zappa?

[01:46:37.770 --> 01:46:38.910]
Were you aware of that?

[01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:39.590]
No

[01:46:40.150 --> 01:46:44.190]
Oh my god, we ought to play all the uncensored Frank Zappa bits, sure

[01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:44.490]
Like

[01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:48.690]
Hey there people on Bob and Brown

[01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:52.590]
This the on the cue is boy and down

[01:46:52.590 --> 01:46:56.130]
My car is fast, my teeth is shining

[01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:59.610]
I tell all the girls they can kiss my hiding

[01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:03.110]
What part of that bit is it that we can't play or that song?

[01:47:03.610 --> 01:47:04.530]
It's later

[01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:06.710]
Oh, well thank god for that

[01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:08.850]
Has to do with a spindle and where he puts it

[01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:10.410]
A spindle in his...

[01:47:10.410 --> 01:47:11.210]
Brechtone ass?

[01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.490]
Yeah

[01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:12.390]
Wow

[01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:16.110]
It says I always thought that you possessed some of the same qualities that he had

[01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:18.610]
Frank Zappa, the only difference being obviously that I'm still alive

[01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:22.070]
Both of you were iconoclastic, one who attacks her

[01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:24.310]
And then he tells me what that means

[01:47:26.150 --> 01:47:28.630]
In parentheses, as if I don't know what that means

[01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:29.650]
Oh, come on Bob

[01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:33.210]
And at the same time icons of respect to our form

[01:47:33.210 --> 01:47:35.770]
Please see if you can do a small tribute to this great tale

[01:47:35.770 --> 01:47:37.050]
We just did, that was it

[01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:39.750]
George's axis is some choice of Zappa tracks

[01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:41.370]
Maybe Bobby Brown partially

[01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:44.650]
Or when does it hurt when I pee?

[01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.690]
Why does it hurt?

[01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:47.330]
What is it?

[01:47:48.110 --> 01:47:49.070]
That's not...

[01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.450]
Anyway, we great to hear some Frank Zappa

[01:47:52.450 --> 01:47:54.490]
I'm your friends, his Bobby, I'm your friend

[01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:57.610]
We played a little Bobby Brown

[01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:05.110]
I tell you what, there's no Jonas Brothers

[01:48:09.190 --> 01:48:10.390]
736 votes, what's our goal?

[01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.770]
800?

[01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:12.690]
Something good to me

[01:48:12.690 --> 01:48:13.910]
Yeah, let's pick 800

[01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:15.050]
Okay, pick it right over there

[01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:16.590]
Because I changed this poll yesterday

[01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:19.090]
I don't know what time

[01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:21.470]
Late afternoon, I want to say

[01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:23.170]
I want to say and I will say

[01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:24.310]
And I'm going to say

[01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:29.450]
What past features of the Niroagir show would you like to see resurrected?

[01:48:30.850 --> 01:48:31.730]
736 votes

[01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:33.990]
Fart Sounds 217

[01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:35.130]
Overwhelmingly

[01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:38.510]
And Johnny Joe Bell in one of our very first phone conversations said to me

[01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:42.170]
I think it's ridiculous, Neil, that you can't play Fart Sounds on here

[01:48:42.170 --> 01:48:43.930]
Even on cartoons they have Fart Sounds

[01:48:43.930 --> 01:48:46.330]
Even on shows that little kids watch they have Fart Sounds

[01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:50.030]
And then I went in the ear and I played Fart Sounds the next day or whatever

[01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:53.070]
And oh gee, I didn't see you could go ahead and play Fart Sounds

[01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:57.810]
This man is so terrified of his own shadow

[01:48:59.410 --> 01:49:02.430]
That if he were a groundhog, you'd have to commit hairy curing

[01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:03.050]
You know what I mean?

[01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:06.310]
Yep, scared of his own shadow, terrified

[01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:08.910]
Oh geez, don't play Fart Sounds

[01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:27.650]
Neil I never said, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

[01:49:27.650 --> 01:49:44.670]
The autome balance tell me why on Laurie records by the way and then he left that they split up. He went to Columbia and they went to Hell I can't be the name of it tell me why sure it is. Yo. What do you mean that, can't be the name of it? It's I wonder why I bet you are doesn't Chris be creamI.

[01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:48.790]
Here talking about that yeah, I wonder why

[01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:49.270]
I wonder

[01:49:51.250 --> 01:49:54.330]
Do you know what I would have done in the time?

[01:49:54.330 --> 01:49:56.510]
I would have done it in the night.

[01:49:57.030 --> 01:50:00.530]
No, why do you?

[01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:01.170]
Maybe I do.

[01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:03.170]
No, I don't know.

[01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:05.330]
No one can hear.

[01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:10.170]
I mean that that that falsetto stuff, you know, I mean there was okay with the BG's and

[01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:13.750]
Frankie Valley in the four seasons they got away with that the falsetto stuff.

[01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:16.330]
But the bell monster.

[01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:17.950]
Oh, no one will tell you.

[01:50:18.610 --> 01:50:19.290]
Like that.

[01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:22.110]
And I'll tell you one thing, there's no Jonas Brothers.

[01:50:22.650 --> 01:50:23.770]
That's for Dan Sieg.

[01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:24.930]
The best talent.

[01:50:25.170 --> 01:50:26.250]
Your physical largest.

[01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:28.750]
Forty-two-five sixty-c.a.m.

[01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:30.330]
The fourth lead.

[01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:32.550]
Lick it and stick it.

[01:50:34.410 --> 01:50:35.150]
Dude, man.

[01:50:35.490 --> 01:50:36.830]
Nobody likes to get up in the morning.

[01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:38.610]
But let's face it, party all night.

[01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:39.370]
Sleep all day.

[01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:41.850]
Mix Johnny one unemployed convenience store worker.

[01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:44.450]
That's why you need the Rock and Roll alarm clock.

[01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:46.090]
No wimpy beep, beeps here.

[01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:49.750]
Just gut wrenching high decibel screens from today's top rock artists.

[01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:53.430]
You'll await to Bruce Springsteen and Joe Cocker.

[01:50:56.190 --> 01:50:58.150]
Chris Robinson from the Black Rose.

[01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:02.850]
And for the true comatose snooze out, there's the Who Alarm.

[01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:09.410]
That's a wake up.

[01:51:09.490 --> 01:51:10.970]
Call them or your warm food, man.

[01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:14.350]
Studies show Stoke Brands respond to the Rock and Roll alarm clock.

[01:51:14.530 --> 01:51:17.010]
Get it now and headbang your way into a new day.

[01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:25.510]
Okay, what a beautiful day by the way in the Hogtown.

[01:51:25.710 --> 01:51:28.510]
Sunshine, it's going to be five today, 42.

[01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:32.450]
And you're complaining about, oh, it was so cold last night.

[01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:33.670]
Oh, gee, Wilkers.

[01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:36.490]
Good thing it was nice and toasty when I was down there last weekend.

[01:51:36.810 --> 01:51:37.250]
Toasty was complaining.

[01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:39.790]
Somebody was complaining.

[01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:40.850]
Maybe it was Fat Chris.

[01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:42.610]
No, it was an emailer.

[01:51:43.050 --> 01:51:43.870]
Oh, it was some email.

[01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.870]
Jack asked you.

[01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:46.050]
Fat Chris don't have to complain.

[01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:47.650]
He's got enough lining on there.

[01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:48.430]
Even more.

[01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:51.250]
Here's one from Johnny Dark.

[01:51:51.370 --> 01:51:52.330]
I'm beginning to think you're right.

[01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:53.510]
This is not the real Johnny Dark.

[01:51:54.190 --> 01:51:54.930]
It's all one person.

[01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.970]
It's all Mr. Radio.

[01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:59.270]
Whoever Mr. Radio is, that's all these people.

[01:51:59.410 --> 01:52:00.370]
Eric King, Johnny Dark.

[01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:03.050]
Leave Mr. Radio alone.

[01:52:03.170 --> 01:52:04.150]
I happen to enjoy his emails.

[01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.790]
You hate everybody.

[01:52:05.010 --> 01:52:05.750]
You hate full bastard.

[01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:06.030]
You.

[01:52:08.170 --> 01:52:10.650]
I just want to be more like the people I'm talking to.

[01:52:10.650 --> 01:52:11.030]
I hate.

[01:52:11.670 --> 01:52:12.470]
There you go.

[01:52:13.130 --> 01:52:14.230]
They say I can't relate.

[01:52:14.230 --> 01:52:14.850]
So I hate.

[01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:18.290]
Here's one from the fake Josh Cortis.

[01:52:18.730 --> 01:52:20.870]
Did you drop my and for whatever reason?

[01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:22.170]
I have no idea what happened there.

[01:52:22.170 --> 01:52:26.090]
But during that last break, all of a sudden we had a whole bunch of emails come in.

[01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:28.450]
Maybe it's been on maybe somebody blocked it.

[01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:30.230]
Maybe Eric had his foot on the break.

[01:52:30.230 --> 01:52:31.010]
Maybe the log jam.

[01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.930]
Jam on this.

[01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:33.650]
Ever have a log jam?

[01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.490]
Oh, yeah.

[01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:36.650]
Once had a log jam.

[01:52:36.730 --> 01:52:37.070]
My back.

[01:52:37.130 --> 01:52:38.230]
That's beside the point.

[01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:41.810]
Fake Josh Cortis said, did you drop my check in the mail during the last break?

[01:52:42.150 --> 01:52:43.250]
Warm what kisses Josh.

[01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:45.870]
He's not due.

[01:52:47.970 --> 01:52:50.690]
I'll let you know what I'm going to send the check right around the holiday time.

[01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:51.490]
Maybe around the 15th.

[01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:52.650]
What's the day today?

[01:52:52.770 --> 01:52:53.070]
The third?

[01:52:53.210 --> 01:52:54.670]
You got a long wait, Cortis.

[01:52:55.410 --> 01:52:57.330]
I just, talk about football, man.

[01:52:57.450 --> 01:52:59.090]
He really has got balls, you know?

[01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:02.870]
Maybe when you start banging that Russian chick, his former girlfriend.

[01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:04.450]
She'll think whether he had balls or not.

[01:53:04.610 --> 01:53:05.090]
Sure it did.

[01:53:05.690 --> 01:53:06.490]
What's she saying?

[01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:08.030]
Not I can tell you.

[01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:11.990]
She said she reminded him of Nixon's former buddy, BB Robozo.

[01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.810]
Yeah, BB.

[01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:16.490]
That's Cortis.

[01:53:16.630 --> 01:53:17.350]
He's got BBs.

[01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:18.550]
Baby, he's got the balls of a butterfly.

[01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:21.190]
I wonder about the Jonas Brothers.

[01:53:21.730 --> 01:53:22.370]
I wonder what they got.

[01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:24.590]
Under that ring.

[01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:28.470]
Why did I see that?

[01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:29.830]
I'm so sorry that I saw that.

[01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:32.290]
You know, you're watching TV and your flipping channels.

[01:53:32.290 --> 01:53:35.610]
And once in a while, something catches your eye and you say,

[01:53:35.610 --> 01:53:36.750]
Oh my God.

[01:53:37.050 --> 01:53:37.510]
What's that?

[01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:37.890]
Who that?

[01:53:39.810 --> 01:53:40.790]
What is that?

[01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:45.830]
It was a Billy Ray Cyrus.

[01:53:46.850 --> 01:53:47.910]
And who's the other ones?

[01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:48.510]
No, the other ones.

[01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:49.110]
Miley Cyrus.

[01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:51.050]
Oh, he was not Miley Cyrus.

[01:53:51.190 --> 01:53:51.910]
Billy Ray Cyrus.

[01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:52.570]
And who else?

[01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:54.130]
And the one who's Miley Cyrus.

[01:53:54.810 --> 01:53:55.870]
Yeah, that's Miley Cyrus.

[01:53:56.230 --> 01:53:57.650]
It was not Miley Cyrus.

[01:53:58.030 --> 01:53:59.090]
It was the same person.

[01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:04.070]
Hannah Montana is a character played by Billy Ray Cyrus' daughter, Miley.

[01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:08.990]
Then why did it say Billy Ray Cyrus on the thing?

[01:54:09.250 --> 01:54:10.230]
It might not have.

[01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:11.510]
Maybe I dreamed it.

[01:54:11.650 --> 01:54:12.170]
Did I dream it?

[01:54:12.370 --> 01:54:13.570]
I'm not a touch with that stuff.

[01:54:13.630 --> 01:54:15.030]
I'm not 10 years old for a six.

[01:54:15.310 --> 01:54:15.610]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:54:16.090 --> 01:54:18.810]
Well, yeah, once the brothers came on, I was like five.

[01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:20.730]
I was like a queenager.

[01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:23.150]
God dang.

[01:54:23.290 --> 01:54:24.270]
They still make people like that.

[01:54:24.430 --> 01:54:24.710]
Well, good.

[01:54:24.810 --> 01:54:25.690]
Maybe I'll find one someday.

[01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:26.230]
I doubt it.

[01:54:27.370 --> 01:54:31.670]
Anyway, here's one from Robert, who's an Ojan provocateur who wants to whip up a bunch of crap.

[01:54:31.890 --> 01:54:34.510]
So I guess that's what they're trying to do across the street to start a radio war.

[01:54:34.610 --> 01:54:35.550]
That's what that's all about.

[01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:36.410]
Not going to happen.

[01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:38.350]
We don't care about you, folks.

[01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:39.370]
Okay, your small potatoes.

[01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:42.070]
You always have been since they put that garbage on in your wall.

[01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:43.550]
These might be coming from over there anyway.

[01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:43.950]
The fake.

[01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:44.650]
Of course.

[01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:45.910]
What else are they going to do?

[01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:50.730]
Niel, if you heard the tickets lay this promo, which they caught your station a bunch of little girls and husbands.

[01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.190]
How they're going to take your lunch money?

[01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.670]
Yeah.

[01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:54.390]
Take your lunch money and stick it up your ass.

[01:54:55.050 --> 01:54:57.390]
Niel, are the macho jox at WQM going to take this?

[01:54:57.670 --> 01:55:00.070]
I think Kimboville campers should go across the street and kick their ass.

[01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:00.470]
Good.

[01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:01.410]
Be a good place for them.

[01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:03.570]
And maybe you can go across the street and stay there.

[01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:09.090]
Adam in Kitchener Waterloo, where were the hell he's hanging it out?

[01:55:10.170 --> 01:55:10.490]
Subject.

[01:55:10.650 --> 01:55:11.390]
You're so full of hate.

[01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:12.130]
He's just joking.

[01:55:12.250 --> 01:55:13.950]
He says, don't let those ass hats get to you.

[01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:15.670]
Good news is it's a woodbine Wednesday.

[01:55:15.670 --> 01:55:16.370]
Best luck today.

[01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.930]
Thanks, Adam.

[01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.990]
There's a good guy.

[01:55:18.570 --> 01:55:19.290]
Doesn't have a life.

[01:55:19.450 --> 01:55:21.350]
But he's in Waterloo, Ontario.

[01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.930]
What do you expect?

[01:55:22.110 --> 01:55:22.370]
The life.

[01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:24.550]
That was up 72.

[01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:25.730]
Want me to check cereal?

[01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:27.630]
Yeah, sure.

[01:55:28.190 --> 01:55:29.030]
Let's check cereal.

[01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:30.730]
It was at 17 cents today.

[01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:32.050]
It was 22 yesterday.

[01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:35.970]
Let's see, I'm in my Google thing there in my box.

[01:55:35.970 --> 01:55:38.410]
It says Jonas Brothers Religious Nuts.

[01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:39.970]
And boy, there was a lot of stuff on that.

[01:55:46.090 --> 01:55:46.910]
Serious stock.

[01:55:47.110 --> 01:55:47.330]
Come on.

[01:55:47.410 --> 01:55:48.010]
You can do it.

[01:55:48.190 --> 01:55:48.750]
There it is.

[01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:53.650]
I got cereal.

[01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:54.630]
Oh, here it is.

[01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.590]
It's coming.

[01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:57.230]
It was 17 cents before.

[01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:58.570]
And now it's 18 cents.

[01:55:58.670 --> 01:55:59.090]
All right.

[01:55:59.530 --> 01:56:01.010]
It's a selling opportunity, Maria.

[01:56:01.710 --> 01:56:03.590]
Where's my fake Maria Bartoromo today?

[01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:05.790]
Now that's it, I was making a little bit of it.

[01:56:05.890 --> 01:56:07.810]
It was up over 8,5801.

[01:56:08.630 --> 01:56:09.730]
Well, what's going on here?

[01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:10.830]
All of a sudden with the emails.

[01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:12.110]
Not that I'm complaining, by the way.

[01:56:12.110 --> 01:56:12.910]
They finally woke up.

[01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:14.890]
Maybe they don't realize the show starts at 10.

[01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:17.610]
Oh, this is a joke.

[01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:18.890]
Should I try one?

[01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:21.230]
Oh, it's true.

[01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.850]
I want what?

[01:56:22.590 --> 01:56:24.470]
Now it's some racial thing.

[01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:25.970]
I'm not dealing with it.

[01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:27.770]
You want to do racial stuff.

[01:56:27.970 --> 01:56:29.130]
Send it to somebody else, OK?

[01:56:29.690 --> 01:56:30.930]
Send it to some racist bastard.

[01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:34.970]
Here are some shots from the copper tones sign on Valinglass.

[01:56:35.150 --> 01:56:36.410]
That is 73rd and Biscayne.

[01:56:36.730 --> 01:56:39.510]
That area has gone from one of the most depressed areas to be one of the most dynamic.

[01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:41.490]
Up and coming artsy areas, it says.

[01:56:42.710 --> 01:56:44.450]
And here's the copper tones sign.

[01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:45.210]
Woohoo!

[01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:45.710]
Hallelujah.

[01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:47.410]
73rd and Biscayne.

[01:56:47.530 --> 01:56:48.130]
Where's the hookers?

[01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.450]
Right there.

[01:56:49.450 --> 01:56:50.670]
Oh, you're so out of touch, Neil.

[01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:52.090]
And I don't understand this one guy.

[01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:52.850]
He keeps sending me.

[01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:54.850]
It just hasn't addressed.

[01:56:55.330 --> 01:56:56.530]
And there's no material.

[01:56:56.530 --> 01:56:57.250]
It says no subject.

[01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:58.950]
And there's no content.

[01:57:00.130 --> 01:57:02.270]
I think maybe he's got some kind of an issue.

[01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:03.250]
I don't know.

[01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:04.110]
Like being an idiot.

[01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:08.630]
Frank and Melbourne says a couple of weeks ago he had George play Link Ray's Rumble.

[01:57:09.110 --> 01:57:10.570]
I thought he wouldn't want to link CDs.

[01:57:10.610 --> 01:57:11.290]
Not bad.

[01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:13.190]
But while doing so, I stumbled across.

[01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:17.530]
When he sent this to me yesterday, I was just going to say, Dick Dale's Mizor-Lew,

[01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:20.390]
which we played yesterday, this George have nitro.

[01:57:20.530 --> 01:57:21.510]
We just played it yesterday.

[01:57:21.690 --> 01:57:24.010]
Oh, Frank and Melbourne, you're so, you got to listen, baby.

[01:57:24.810 --> 01:57:27.090]
Oh, this one finally came through on the third try.

[01:57:27.130 --> 01:57:28.030]
They tried it three times.

[01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:32.630]
Now that Sean Avery is gone, I can say that he was not a character guy,

[01:57:32.630 --> 01:57:34.710]
but had a lot of grit, which helped him.

[01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:36.430]
He sucks Paul and Weston.

[01:57:36.590 --> 01:57:37.370]
Go Paul laws.

[01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:39.010]
Yeah, Sean Avery is a lunatic.

[01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:40.790]
A disgrace to the league.

[01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:42.370]
End of the human, subhuman race.

[01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:43.990]
God.

[01:57:45.130 --> 01:57:47.270]
At any rate, we don't want to get into no hockey talk.

[01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:49.210]
Well, maybe the Leafs lost to the sharks is on here.

[01:57:49.870 --> 01:57:51.270]
Should I check on Leafs TV and see?

[01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.770]
It's, yeah, if you want.

[01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:53.750]
Wouldn't have made my season.

[01:57:54.430 --> 01:57:55.250]
Oh, there's Ron Wilson.

[01:57:55.410 --> 01:57:55.990]
So, do you beat the group?

[01:57:56.090 --> 01:57:57.370]
But about to me, he's a real loser.

[01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:58.710]
If ever, if ever there was one.

[01:57:59.170 --> 01:58:00.090]
Where do they find these people?

[01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:01.970]
Paul Marisa's back in Carolina.

[01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:04.430]
He said nothing could be finer than be coach in Carolina.

[01:58:04.810 --> 01:58:06.250]
And it's day off of Spadina.

[01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:09.290]
Mark and Kendall says, I have children.

[01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:11.370]
So, unfortunately, I know about these Jonas kids.

[01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:13.730]
It's the Jonas brothers to you, Mark.

[01:58:14.730 --> 01:58:17.250]
It's too bad that the hype machine is putting this crap into people.

[01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:17.690]
It's the most conscious.

[01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:20.430]
And this is the other way he spelled that.

[01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:21.030]
Don't worry, Mark.

[01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:22.090]
I'm illiterate too.

[01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:25.550]
I find it hilarious that these kids feel the need to espouse their moral beliefs.

[01:58:25.770 --> 01:58:28.530]
Reminds me a lot of Republicans as well as a lot of performers before them

[01:58:28.530 --> 01:58:29.870]
who have used the same playbook.

[01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:33.190]
I can't call them hypocrites yet because they haven't been caught yet.

[01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:35.050]
PS, who the hell?

[01:58:35.170 --> 01:58:35.950]
This is the good part.

[01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:38.770]
Forget about those Jonas brothers.

[01:58:38.970 --> 01:58:39.310]
I'm trying.

[01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.830]
I'm trying very hard.

[01:58:42.110 --> 01:58:43.990]
PS, who the hell does the beast think he is?

[01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:46.570]
He is so badly wants to be associated with your show.

[01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:48.830]
For him to say that Chris is jealous of him is ridiculous.

[01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:54.070]
And a tub, a tub of lard in his position can afford to be ridiculous.

[01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:55.090]
I added that last part.

[01:58:55.650 --> 01:58:58.050]
It says, beast will jump into the chance to take Chris's job.

[01:58:58.110 --> 01:58:59.010]
What a piece of turd.

[01:58:59.110 --> 01:59:00.970]
Hey, Chris, lose some weights as Mark and Kendall.

[01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:04.530]
Yeah, lose some weight and stay alive so that beast don't jump in there and take your job.

[01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:05.130]
Okay.

[01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:06.490]
What is his job?

[01:59:06.710 --> 01:59:08.670]
I asked that yesterday and you never really gave me an answer.

[01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:09.890]
Um, an update guy?

[01:59:11.630 --> 01:59:13.070]
He does the updates on what?

[01:59:13.730 --> 01:59:15.150]
On the big O-short A7?

[01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:16.330]
On what?

[01:59:16.770 --> 01:59:18.250]
He does them sometimes for 4 to 7.

[01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:21.290]
And he goes together the hurricanes.

[01:59:21.770 --> 01:59:23.110]
What happened to Ken by the way?

[01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:24.430]
He does 2 to 4.

[01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.870]
Oh, there it is.

[01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:27.990]
He does 2 to 4 today.

[01:59:28.090 --> 01:59:28.670]
Not tomorrow though.

[01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:29.910]
We got John Eldomar.

[01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.330]
Who's that?

[01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:31.590]
That would be Linder.

[01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:36.450]
Oh, John Linder, who occasionally fills in on the air and does some horse ball of the sports show.

[01:59:36.590 --> 01:59:36.690]
Yeah.

[01:59:36.970 --> 01:59:37.590]
I never heard him.

[01:59:37.630 --> 01:59:38.330]
He might be a good guy.

[01:59:38.970 --> 01:59:39.350]
Is he?

[01:59:39.730 --> 01:59:40.430]
He doesn't ask that.

[01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:41.310]
Oh, there you go.

[01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:42.470]
Am I as good on the air?

[01:59:43.710 --> 01:59:44.750]
I've only heard him once or twice.

[01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:45.170]
He was fine.

[01:59:45.410 --> 01:59:47.770]
He also does a show on the West Coast on Sundays.

[01:59:48.690 --> 01:59:49.830]
On the West Coast.

[01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:50.890]
Yeah, that's a big deal.

[01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.610]
On the West Coast?

[01:59:51.710 --> 01:59:52.050]
Naples.

[01:59:52.130 --> 01:59:53.830]
I don't know if it's a B-L-E station or not, but it's over in the name.

[01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:57.090]
Speaking of that, you'll never believe where the next email is from after the break.

[01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:58.890]
David in Naples, New York.

[02:00:00.170 --> 02:00:02.350]
Could that happen again in a million years, huh?

[02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:03.190]
Woo!

[02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:04.930]
The best tower.

[02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:06.330]
He's in the old Rajas.

[02:00:06.710 --> 02:00:08.770]
Forty-of-five sixty-q-a-m.

[02:00:08.890 --> 02:00:10.390]
Big, fourth leaves.

[02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:11.950]
The biggest names.

[02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:13.330]
The best talent.

[02:00:13.570 --> 02:00:15.030]
It's the big dog, Jo-Ro.

[02:00:15.490 --> 02:00:17.090]
Weak day morning, seven at 10.

[02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:19.990]
Sports radio, five sixty-q-a-m.

[02:00:20.230 --> 02:00:20.390]
Z.

[02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:21.730]
Sports radio.

[02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:24.070]
Holy macken on.

[02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:28.630]
This is Jo-Ball on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and you're listening to the Hockey Authority

[02:00:28.630 --> 02:00:29.650]
Neil God.

[02:00:29.650 --> 02:00:32.650]
Thank you, guys!

[02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:42.550]
Thank you, sir!

[02:00:48.590 --> 02:00:51.370]
Thank you all for the hard work.

[02:00:51.370 --> 02:00:51.610]
Hare Hockey, Hare Muscoff!

[02:00:52.290 --> 02:00:53.550]
Gurly Swenson!

[02:00:54.170 --> 02:00:54.390]
Hello!

[02:00:54.650 --> 02:00:54.690]
Beautiful tale.

[02:00:54.690 --> 02:00:54.690]

[02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:59.630]
Har Dis vibe, bourgeoisie!

[02:00:59.630 --> 02:01:00.430]
Oh, no.

[02:01:01.050 --> 02:01:02.910]
There's some busy hunting sport.

[02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:07.890]
Gricky ricky ricky ricky ricky.

[02:01:07.890 --> 02:01:10.270]

What was that noise?

[02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:18.850]
Let me take a look at this security monitor.

[02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:20.870]
Anything to do with sports?

[02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:23.790]
No, just a lot of buildings burning and carnage.

[02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:25.150]
My car is okay, though.

[02:01:25.410 --> 02:01:25.650]
Oh.

[02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:26.970]
Go back to the found.

[02:01:26.970 --> 02:01:50.510]
ove

[02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:56.690]
46 at 560 WQM the dollars of 70 points everybody is just happy as a pig and slop man, aren't they?

[02:01:57.610 --> 02:02:01.290]
Yeah sure what in so anyway, how many votes do we were we going for?

[02:02:03.670 --> 02:02:08.450]
887 54 you got a pretty good shot. I would say it's in the sack. It's in your sack

[02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:16.630]
Oh, they're starting again the as serious people are starting again the same old boring stuff fake berry jackass fake Phil Henry out

[02:02:17.090 --> 02:02:22.110]
Ain't gonna happen. I'm not going anywhere nobody offered me a dime full-time part-time

[02:02:22.610 --> 02:02:24.230]
My time you're a time okay

[02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:29.750]
That's the thing that so I'm using about all this so they keep talking about new Rogers up

[02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:33.630]
Well, you know something nobody has offered me a penny a scent

[02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:35.270]
Wincentavo

[02:02:36.490 --> 02:02:43.310]
So anyway, David and April's New York says thanks for your yours of excellence and good humor your Christmas specials and bid collections are among the best radio ever

[02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:49.130]
I can't wait you deserve syndication even if you're too ahead of your time and Cox and the FCC and whatever

[02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:51.490]
What what does that mean?

[02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:55.910]
I guess he assumes no, it's a beastly owns this station not Cox

[02:02:56.690 --> 02:02:59.930]
I've moved to Naples, New York on candidate will make after seven years in South Florida

And I still have to dial in to listen to your show live streaming on the internet. It's that good usually

[02:03:06.090 --> 02:03:09.090]
LOL usually don't let that slipper George get you down

[02:03:09.090 --> 02:03:12.470]
He's lucky you blessed him with a job, but he knows it. You know it

[02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:14.170]
Yeah, I'm getting you down

[02:03:15.710 --> 02:03:18.250]
Well, you why don't you know what that means?

Hope you enjoyed Toronto and the excellent people in winter sports PS

[02:03:27.970 --> 02:03:33.050]
Well, here's one the audience is gonna have to answer because I don't know. Where's the best gaming in the Northeast?

[02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:40.350]
I was disappointed by the Niagara Falls casinos two crowded no deals is there a better around anything is better than like falls view

[02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:45.130]
And I apologize for recommending that when I first came up here went and started going to falls you a couple times

[02:03:45.130 --> 02:03:52.090]
I mean if you're like a heavy player, they'll give you they'll comp your room and meals and for like four or five grand, you know comp

[02:03:53.250 --> 02:03:58.890]
You know what I mean? No, what he means not complimentary when you have to lose four or five six grand to work to get it

[02:03:59.650 --> 02:04:06.710]
Although you know what they have at the falls view casino downstairs that groan in cheese. No, oh, Johnny F and Rockets

[02:04:06.710 --> 02:04:12.490]
Oh, hey, that's what I discovered it. There was the first Johnny F and Rockets. I've rated I love the

[02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:20.010]
What you call us? What do you call it the sandwiches on rye? Oh, okay with the onions?

[02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:27.350]
Penny milk. That's right. I'm old and feeble. Don't I see you you got to be there to pick up the ball. You know, don't don't get me down. All right. Sorry about that

[02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:32.570]
I just had to redo my mouse again. So I guess that means it's almost there time to go shopping

[02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:34.450]
Am I right? Yes

[02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:41.390]
Now what what am I supposed to get and optical here's this you go into any place that sells computer mice

[02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:46.990]
and get the cheapest one and leave the store with it pay for it leave the store

[02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:50.330]
There's no such thing as a mechanical mouse anymore. Do I have to win? No

[02:04:50.970 --> 02:04:55.010]
You want you turn the computer off plug the new mouse and turn the computer on it works

[02:04:55.010 --> 02:05:01.390]
Really just like that? Well, how will you that's my kind of installation man or if you want to you know that

[02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:06.530]
Like if you go into a place like you know like best buy for example or any of those places or an office depot

[02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:12.910]
You know any any place like that they usually have the mice displayed get one that that fits your hand nicely a nice comfortable fit in your hand

[02:05:13.610 --> 02:05:18.550]
Oh, I've been looking for one of those for a long time have we all maybe the Jonas Brothers could help me out

[02:05:20.710 --> 02:05:26.050]
Maybe they've got a comfortable well mouse try them out Joe see which one fits in your hand nice

[02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:29.290]
I have two hands

[02:05:30.230 --> 02:05:34.470]
Okay, so the fake Phil Henry says my good friend bubble went on a tie right against Sirius yesterday

[02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:39.970]
He only has a few days on his contract left and Jeremy Coleman and friends are ignoring him your name came up on the year

[02:05:39.970 --> 02:05:40.590]
Yeah, so

[02:05:41.250 --> 02:05:43.210]
My name came up on the year

[02:05:43.210 --> 02:05:48.030]
Yeah, so what does that mean? Why why do these delirious people continue?

[02:05:48.110 --> 02:05:52.010]
Hacking me and bothering me with a serious crap when when first of all number one

[02:05:52.010 --> 02:05:54.070]
They're gonna go out of business next year and number two

[02:05:54.070 --> 02:05:56.770]
They've never offered me a penny or shown any interest at all

[02:05:56.770 --> 02:06:01.410]
Set back in the beginning when Norma slept up there once they saw him they thought oh my god. This is your agent

[02:06:02.850 --> 02:06:05.690]
Not only no and here we go the fake Barry Jackass

[02:06:05.690 --> 02:06:09.990]
Who are you kidding? We have it on good word that Norma can't as in talks with Sirius XM

[02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:17.890]
Are you going to work part time on Sirius when you start no and no part time full time no time when do I start I don't

[02:06:19.110 --> 02:06:19.530]
God

[02:06:20.290 --> 02:06:23.730]
Talk about a bunch of huzzarai probably Joe Bella sending those

[02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:29.430]
Can you imagine how how he would rub his hind legs together and glee to get us out of here?

[02:06:30.150 --> 02:06:32.370]
Yeah, can you even begin to imagine

[02:06:34.330 --> 02:06:36.590]
He would be happier than a pig and

[02:06:37.190 --> 02:06:37.630]
slop

[02:06:40.050 --> 02:06:45.970]
I think I'm gonna check out Johnny Rockets next year too the local local okay now do you like uh, you know like

[02:06:45.970 --> 02:06:47.590]
Because it's not chilly with beans

[02:06:48.050 --> 02:06:49.290]
It's when they make you a chili

[02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:51.690]
I saw that on the menu. It's just chilly

[02:06:51.690 --> 02:06:54.230]
That's the only thing that's chilly like on me because I hate beans

[02:06:55.150 --> 02:06:56.170]
Beans are for beers

[02:06:57.470 --> 02:07:01.910]
So you get the chili with cheeseburger and it's like an open-faced burger and it's really good really?

[02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:06.630]
Yeah, but that's with bread. I mean the patty melt it without the bread it's ribred which is

[02:07:06.990 --> 02:07:09.990]
So you know order it without the bread on a plate

[02:07:10.630 --> 02:07:15.090]
How big of her? Have it chilly burger without the bread on a plate. Will you stop getting me down?

[02:07:16.050 --> 02:07:20.050]
Sorry, so the fake Josh Cortis is I'll have you know that my package is spectacular

[02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:22.150]
You can ask fat Chris. He'll tell you

[02:07:23.210 --> 02:07:25.990]
I don't have babies more like ping pong balls

[02:07:26.530 --> 02:07:29.830]
Georgia will be embarrassed if he chases after my sloppy seconds. Comey chick

[02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:33.070]
She'll take one look at his sack compared to mine and say yet

[02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.430]
yet

[02:07:35.890 --> 02:07:40.950]
That's kind of like what's his name so Jimmy Houston says that oh, we've tried it over the yet then yet

[02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:44.750]
Off the side of the net. He is just anxious man

[02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:47.670]
How he must have naked pictures of everybody at the cvc

[02:07:47.670 --> 02:07:52.750]
Jimmy Houston just absolutely unacceptable. So where's the best gaming in the northeast all you folks?

[02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:58.890]
You know, I've heard about those Connecticut the Indian casinos and all that other stuff. I don't never been there. Have you?

[02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:00.430]
Yeah, just this morning

[02:08:01.670 --> 02:08:05.190]
No, you've never been anywhere. Of course not. Yeah. Oh, I've never been anywhere

[02:08:05.630 --> 02:08:08.390]
Dr. Al is back then and then we get rid of him

[02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:12.550]
It says can I finally come up with an interesting email? Well, we'll see

[02:08:17.250 --> 02:08:17.650]
We'll see

[02:08:17.650 --> 02:08:22.350]
Your time daily with interesting shows. I can't even come up with an email interesting enough to read on the air not yet

[02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:24.390]
Let's see if this one works

[02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:30.350]
The only email of mine you read was about my exploding hemorrhoid, but I keep trying thanks for watching my emails

[02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:34.950]
If my email suck just don't read them, but I get my kicks trying to write something airworthy

[02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:40.030]
That's how it gets his kicks in other words. I have no lie. Right. That's just code for uh, I have no lie

[02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:47.430]
I'm squeezing it right now and anticipation of being read last night. I had a dream that we were very worried

[02:08:47.650 --> 02:08:54.230]
That doesn't mean I'm gay does it your loyal listener dr. Alps my hemorrhoids are much better now and learn to spell it would be good

[02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:58.330]
Getting him cured is a good idea get the old rubber band man out there

[02:08:58.330 --> 02:09:03.110]
Boy, I remember they tried to do that with me. They hadn't appointment schedule the whole the only somebody talked me out of it

[02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:05.670]
Said that's the biggest scam going. Yeah rubber band

[02:09:06.650 --> 02:09:12.410]
rubber band man. I love that song snap it spitter's you got it. Yeah, but I'll spin it by the spinners

[02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:14.690]
I don't want to play it because I'm burning you a CD right now

[02:09:17.490 --> 02:09:21.950]
So I don't want to touch the computer right now. Well, why are you doing that? Like mess about that? I was go to oh

[02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:27.390]
Any good songs you don't they have any I have no idea. I mean they're they're all on uh you

[02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:29.010]
You on online

[02:09:29.010 --> 02:09:33.970]
Of course with my luck my mouse had probably break down just at the moment. I was about to see the good stuff

[02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:41.150]
You know probably like to go and we were said. Where's the good stuff? I've been looking for it. No items in this view. How do you we had a flurry there man?

[02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:45.690]
We had a frantic flurry like something really was happening on a show and then all of a sudden

[02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:51.370]
That was it that was the end of that. I think I think mr. radio brought us to a crushing halt

[02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:55.250]
Either that or the fake Barry jackass and the fake feel Henry again

[02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:59.490]
Oh, they're talking about the with the norm can't not know they're not no, they're not

[02:10:00.090 --> 02:10:01.710]
They're not talking with anybody. I know

[02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:08.670]
They I guess you know the pressure gets to you when you know you're gonna go out of business and everybody

[02:10:08.670 --> 02:10:13.330]
There's gonna be out of work. I mean how are what does he carry? He's makes a hundred million year. He's got more money than god

[02:10:14.150 --> 02:10:16.250]
He's got more money than the government's got by now

[02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:22.090]
But a lot of other little people but of course it's always the little people that gets screwed right? Yep

[02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:24.650]
You guys know it. Mm-hmm

[02:10:24.650 --> 02:10:30.070]
Am I right fat Chris the little people? Yeah, I bet you with your weight. You never thought you'd be one of the little people didn't you?

[02:10:30.190 --> 02:10:31.590]
Boy, you know, but you are

[02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:37.110]
You're one of the little people at QAM that you're talking about all the time

[02:10:37.590 --> 02:10:40.490]
Because you're associated you're associated with the show just like for Allison

[02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:45.790]
She actually had the goal to say once upon a time that she liked this show you're out honey. You're fired

[02:10:45.790 --> 02:10:47.430]
We're making cutbacks

[02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:48.710]
Bye-bye

[02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:50.750]
And that's it. That was the end of her

[02:10:51.450 --> 02:10:54.090]
Is she gone now? She cleaned out her desk. She was gone yesterday

[02:10:54.750 --> 02:10:55.150]
Wow

[02:10:55.690 --> 02:11:00.930]
Did you have like a teary goodbye? I didn't get to see her, but we exchanged a couple of emails

[02:11:04.570 --> 02:11:06.130]
She was done a lot to say goodbye to anyone

[02:11:06.690 --> 02:11:09.990]
Well, what what it means she wasn't allowed to say why I don't know exactly how it went down

[02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:12.150]
But it was kind of like leave the building and then they sent off that email

[02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:19.190]
Leave the building I'm not sure exactly how it happened. That was come on. I even even I don't believe that

[02:11:20.050 --> 02:11:24.650]
Well, maybe somebody who was witness to it can tell you the story since we were locked in here doing the radio show

[02:11:24.650 --> 02:11:28.210]
Leave the building and then we're sending email out saying you don't know how to work here

[02:11:28.210 --> 02:11:32.230]
She was out of the building 20 years ago. She likes dangerous or something. Oh, yeah evil

[02:11:32.230 --> 02:11:33.070]

I

[02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:43.490]
Look at this I got a email about a place to frequent in the Northeast to place to punch your guts out, but I'll get to it in a second

[02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:50.750]
Speaking of the bird by the way in Johnny dork the real or imaginary Johnny dorks obsession with my comments about the bird

[02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:56.090]
I've been pretty nice to him actually because remember iod how he was hitting on every chicken the building yes

And about how obnoxious that was to over all of them. Yes, and everyone yes

[02:13:03.530 --> 02:13:07.110]
I don't bring that up real often because I don't like to speak ill of the dead, but nevertheless

[02:13:08.150 --> 02:13:16.430]
Here's one from uh Chris this morning mr. Ego challenged you on the air face-to-face studio debate debate about what all the same old tire

[02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:23.410]
Oh my god. He must be in real trouble almost didn't send that facts, but he claims that you monitor a show daily

[02:13:23.410 --> 02:13:27.950]
How the hell do I do that? He said he has proof that anytime you put his name on a pool

[02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:31.590]
He is the highest vote and due to the fact your jealous of him you have his name removed

[02:13:31.590 --> 02:13:35.930]
What what is this man talking about if this is accurate right? Obviously illinitic

[02:13:35.930 --> 02:13:42.270]
If you want to see what a psycho this christian Jew is take a look at his demanded website of steven his numerous children shooting guns

[02:13:43.610 --> 02:13:46.050]
PS high-run in Paul sign Chris

What does that mean everybody's looking to start a radio war now and of course who's the pivot man?

[02:13:53.570 --> 02:13:54.370]
Forget it

[02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:55.830]
Forget it

[02:13:56.690 --> 02:13:59.170]
Forget about it

[02:13:59.170 --> 02:14:06.850]
Mr. Ego challenge me to a face-to-face debate. I monitor his show. I don't even know where to find his show. My much less what I listen to it

[02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:08.390]
God

[02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:12.610]
Alisa says the Mohican son in Connecticut is okay

[02:14:12.610 --> 02:14:15.790]
Not really any great deals, but a nice place people actually do win

[02:14:16.450 --> 02:14:21.110]
I can take the ferry over from port Jefferson Long Island and make a nice day of it when it's warmer course

[02:14:21.110 --> 02:14:22.550]
I just missed needle diamond

[02:14:23.170 --> 02:14:24.850]
Played their last Friday night. Oh

[02:14:25.410 --> 02:14:26.590]
Must have been your lucky night

I'm a big thoroughbred pony fans. I love to go to bell my park in the spring and fall in of course

[02:14:30.730 --> 02:14:32.810]
So retoga but no machines there yet

[02:14:33.610 --> 02:14:37.770]
There used to be a quarter horse track on eastern Long Island my parents loved and it's where I grew to well

[02:14:37.770 --> 02:14:39.870]
Love horse racing. I can't recall the name of the place

[02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:43.410]
I don't even know if that type of racing exists anymore. Oh, yeah. They got quarter horses

[02:14:43.810 --> 02:14:46.270]
And that's what they're worth about a quarter. They still got that crap

[02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:50.810]
Los Alamedos in California. That's big. Hope this helps Alisa. So there you go

[02:14:51.110 --> 02:14:53.990]
Mohican son in Connecticut that says okay. Oh

[02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:59.610]
This is hysterical this morning mr. ego challenge you on the air to a face-to-face debate. Yeah

[02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:05.510]
Choose somebody else to try to resurrect your dead career that was never alive in the first place

[02:15:06.070 --> 02:15:07.190]
Good God

[02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:12.330]
They're all they're all just in a feeding frenzy now. What's that all about?

[02:15:13.150 --> 02:15:16.630]
Maybe the ship came in the what oh the ship the ship meant

[02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:19.150]
Here's one from the real time jicke

[02:15:21.110 --> 02:15:23.910]
And he sends me forwards me a message from a normal camp

[02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:29.390]
About all these rumors that people are starting you know about bubble and me and bubble my sees

[02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:33.750]
This is what Norma says to Tom jicke tell you what I'm gonna do Tom

[02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:36.690]
And it's the only comment I will make I will give you word for word

[02:15:36.690 --> 02:15:39.430]
What serious told me at the end of a lengthy series of negotiations

[02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:43.850]
This is from their executive program director our director of programming Jeremy Coleman

[02:15:44.530 --> 02:15:46.530]
Norm you've got several fans of Neil here

[02:15:46.530 --> 02:15:49.730]
But the problem is you're completely understandable interest in making money for Neil

[02:15:49.730 --> 02:15:53.170]
Who's one of the highest paid a m talents in industry we are fresh out

[02:15:53.590 --> 02:15:56.890]
Jeremy Coleman does that line sound familiar from the fake Greg VW yesterday

[02:15:56.890 --> 02:16:01.310]
We are fresh out of money. We are fresh out must be just a coincidence not

[02:16:03.450 --> 02:16:06.690]
After that email with a five-year offer from this is Norma going on

[02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:11.710]
After that email with a five-year offer from QAM putting close to a million a year on the table with bonuses

[02:16:11.710 --> 02:16:13.150]
The fact you left out some of your articles

Of course.

[02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:28.290]
I'm sorry. Thank God.

[02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:29.670]
Thank God it's not only me.

[02:27:31.470 --> 02:27:33.570]
Neil, the name Earl the Pearl came up today at work.

[02:27:33.690 --> 02:27:36.110]
Was he a DJ down here? Is that name from a movie or something?

[02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.550]
Thanks.

[02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:39.030]
He was a DJ on I-95.

[02:27:39.290 --> 02:27:41.670]
I was working at a cross down the hall at W.I. and Z.

[02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.950]
At night.

[02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:43.630]
And Earl the Pearl, he was a good guy.

[02:27:43.810 --> 02:27:44.850]
He still is a good guy.

[02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:46.670]
Where else did he work?

[02:27:46.990 --> 02:27:48.070]
He works currently at Kiss.

[02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:49.170]
He does?

[02:27:49.470 --> 02:27:49.610]
Yes.

[02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:50.610]
Well, I'll be damned.

[02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:51.290]
How do you like that?

[02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:51.890]
He's a good guy.

[02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:53.410]
He works at Kiss.

[02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:55.050]
So unfortunately he works for the beesleys.

[02:27:55.330 --> 02:27:57.010]
But this is the business we have chosen.

[02:27:58.330 --> 02:28:00.670]
Michael, this is the business we have chosen.

[02:28:04.470 --> 02:28:07.230]
Here's one from one of our regular emailers who I think is

[02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:08.250]
giving me a little stuc here.

[02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:08.630]
I don't know.

[02:28:08.730 --> 02:28:10.590]
It says when Bubba left office and W.I. came in,

[02:28:10.650 --> 02:28:12.250]
you said, we are really going to miss Bubba.

[02:28:12.310 --> 02:28:12.810]
Mark my words.

[02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:13.350]
And we did.

[02:28:13.650 --> 02:28:14.790]
We've had eight years of hell.

[02:28:15.350 --> 02:28:16.630]
Eight years of hell.

[02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:19.910]
But that doesn't mean we want Bubba back.

[02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:20.330]
Okay.

[02:28:20.390 --> 02:28:21.650]
I mean, you know, let's move forward.

[02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:25.610]
We elected Obama and let's give him a shot and not have Bubba

[02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:26.350]
standing there.

[02:28:26.410 --> 02:28:27.910]
I mean, we realized we got swillery there.

[02:28:28.050 --> 02:28:29.110]
And what are you going to do?

[02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:31.590]
Are you thrilled about that?

[02:28:31.870 --> 02:28:32.030]
No.

[02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.330]
No.

[02:28:33.370 --> 02:28:36.310]
Here's one again about your close personal friend, Prozac Ron,

[02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:40.350]
who seems to have his own group of his own support group.

[02:28:40.350 --> 02:28:40.710]
Oh, yeah.

[02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:41.650]
Birds of a feather.

[02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:45.210]
Sincerely Brian, Subdicronic Colors.

[02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:47.430]
This is probably written by Joe Bell.

[02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:51.930]
Deer Neal, even though Prozac Ron has a mental illness,

[02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:53.650]
no one should be hard on him.

[02:28:53.650 --> 02:28:55.550]
He needs attention and a place with no foam.

[02:28:56.130 --> 02:28:59.090]
Has George tried to reason with him and tried to tell him not to go away?

[02:28:59.090 --> 02:28:59.470]
Yes.

[02:28:59.870 --> 02:29:00.450]
I beg you.

[02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:03.390]
Maybe George likes Prozac Ron and the attention he gives to the erotician.

[02:29:03.390 --> 02:29:03.570]
No.

[02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:04.210]
No.

[02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.950]
No.

[02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:07.410]
Put Prozac Ron on a time slot.

[02:29:07.530 --> 02:29:09.730]
Maybe he can make a difference and not be a pain in the butt.

[02:29:10.290 --> 02:29:10.350]
Yeah.

[02:29:10.450 --> 02:29:11.110]
Put him on a tie.

[02:29:11.250 --> 02:29:14.210]
Let's take the first of all, it starts, he's got a mental illness,

[02:29:14.290 --> 02:29:16.050]
and then says, put him on a time slot.

[02:29:16.250 --> 02:29:16.490]
Mm-hmm.

[02:29:16.890 --> 02:29:18.610]
We've got crazy people managing the place.

[02:29:18.770 --> 02:29:20.290]
We don't need to have crazy people on the air.

[02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:24.150]
When I heard you read about him, I felt bad for Prozac Ron.

[02:29:24.490 --> 02:29:26.830]
By the way, happy birthday, George, from your friends at Best Buy.

[02:29:27.650 --> 02:29:27.970]
Thanks.

[02:29:28.630 --> 02:29:29.730]
You have friends at Best Buy?

[02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:30.490]
I guess I do.

[02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:31.070]
I didn't know I did.

[02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.870]
There you go, you didn't know it.

[02:29:31.930 --> 02:29:32.790]
I'm going to go right over there then.

[02:29:33.050 --> 02:29:34.930]
I used to have friends at Best Buy, they're in the sawgrass.

[02:29:35.170 --> 02:29:35.970]
You know what they have at Best Buy?

[02:29:37.410 --> 02:29:37.690]
Nice.

[02:29:37.930 --> 02:29:38.490]
Computer mice, yes.

[02:29:39.150 --> 02:29:40.390]
Oh, I don't need to go to Best Buy.

[02:29:40.410 --> 02:29:41.810]
No, no, you should shop anyway.

[02:29:41.810 --> 02:29:41.870]
Anyway.

[02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:44.590]
And they're down the street where they saw the wall green.

[02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:45.450]
Does any office supply?

[02:29:45.610 --> 02:29:45.870]
Is anything?

[02:29:48.190 --> 02:29:48.750]
Future shop.

[02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.370]
Okay.

[02:29:49.690 --> 02:29:51.070]
It's like, you know, it's like Circuit City.

[02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:53.150]
Circuit City?

[02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:54.250]
Circuit, shmitting.

[02:29:54.910 --> 02:29:56.330]
No, you almost suckered me into that.

[02:29:56.490 --> 02:29:57.690]
See, just like that email.

[02:29:58.870 --> 02:30:02.050]
Oh, my God, trying to sandbag the old man.

[02:30:02.130 --> 02:30:02.810]
He wants the show.

[02:30:02.830 --> 02:30:03.510]
Circuit, shmitting.

[02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:03.750]
What?

[02:30:04.090 --> 02:30:04.830]
He wants the show.

[02:30:05.470 --> 02:30:06.110]
Yeah, right.

[02:30:06.470 --> 02:30:06.670]
Very significant.

[02:30:06.690 --> 02:30:09.330]
When you're interested in a new mouse, get a log attack, wireless.

[02:30:10.030 --> 02:30:10.390]
Logitech.

[02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:11.190]
Logitech.

[02:30:11.570 --> 02:30:12.030]
It's worth it.

[02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:13.190]
Don't get a wireless.

[02:30:13.710 --> 02:30:14.010]
Don't.

[02:30:14.210 --> 02:30:14.890]
It's worth it.

[02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.890]
It's not expensive at all.

[02:30:16.330 --> 02:30:17.570]
The wife and I are off to the hard rock.

[02:30:17.690 --> 02:30:18.770]
The gamble today is her birthday.

[02:30:19.130 --> 02:30:21.970]
And when the players stop, so they give her 500 claim is to play with not bad.

[02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:25.910]
For birthday gift, next time you're with the hard rock, try the council oak steakhouse.

[02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:26.910]
Okay, Willary.

[02:30:27.730 --> 02:30:29.270]
I like hard rock a whole lot.

[02:30:29.370 --> 02:30:30.990]
Of course, I got to go to Johnny F and Rockets.

[02:30:31.170 --> 02:30:31.850]
That's right.

[02:30:32.910 --> 02:30:36.250]
Whatever you do, don't get a wireless anything.

[02:30:37.090 --> 02:30:37.350]
I agree.

[02:30:38.350 --> 02:30:39.450]
You like changing batteries a lot.

[02:30:39.550 --> 02:30:40.270]
You like your mouse dying.

[02:30:40.270 --> 02:30:42.450]
You like to like beat it and bang on it.

[02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:43.750]
Because it just won't sleep my mouse.

[02:30:43.890 --> 02:30:44.050]
Yeah.

[02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:45.630]
Because it goes to sleep.

[02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:48.590]
Changing the batteries all the time.

[02:30:49.010 --> 02:30:50.570]
My mouse has been asleep for a long time.

[02:30:50.810 --> 02:30:52.830]
Can I say that the councilor last night?

[02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:54.190]
Don't get a wireless mouse.

[02:30:54.270 --> 02:30:54.790]
I'm begging you.

[02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:56.490]
What makes you think I'm going to do that?

[02:30:56.750 --> 02:30:58.970]
I don't because that suggestion that email guy suggested that.

[02:30:59.050 --> 02:31:00.490]
No, because I'm going to get the key.

[02:31:00.670 --> 02:31:01.230]
Keep us the easiest.

[02:31:01.310 --> 02:31:01.790]
There you go.

[02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:03.930]
Like you said, unplug the old one and shut the thing off.

[02:31:04.330 --> 02:31:05.730]
And then plug in the new one.

[02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:06.370]
Turn it back on.

[02:31:06.370 --> 02:31:06.810]
Turn it back on.

[02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:07.870]
That's it.

[02:31:07.870 --> 02:31:08.770]
But I won't buy any.

[02:31:08.810 --> 02:31:09.610]
Even I can handle that.

[02:31:09.690 --> 02:31:11.430]
I mean, look at the way the last two days here.

[02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:12.890]
Four times I fixed my niece.

[02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.350]
Right?

[02:31:14.650 --> 02:31:14.710]
Right.

[02:31:14.810 --> 02:31:14.890]
Right.

[02:31:15.090 --> 02:31:18.190]
I opened up the back thing.

[02:31:18.310 --> 02:31:19.470]
I had that little ball drop.

[02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:21.850]
I tell you, it's not a good idea if you don't keep your eye on the ball.

[02:31:22.030 --> 02:31:22.270]
I know.

[02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:24.770]
I know.

[02:31:24.810 --> 02:31:24.810]

[02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:25.290]
I know.

[02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:25.330]
I know.

[02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:25.330]

[02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:25.330]

[02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:25.330]

[02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:25.330]

[02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:25.330]

[02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:26.150]
I know.

[02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.150]

[02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.150]

[02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.410]
I know.

[02:31:26.690 --> 02:31:26.890]
I know.

[02:31:26.890 --> 02:31:27.050]
I know.

[02:31:27.050 --> 02:31:27.050]

[02:31:27.050 --> 02:31:27.050]

[02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:28.590]
I know.

[02:31:28.610 --> 02:31:28.790]
I know.

[02:31:28.890 --> 02:31:29.070]
I know.

[02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:29.350]
I know.

[02:31:31.390 --> 02:31:31.390]

[02:31:31.390 --> 02:31:31.390]

[02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:32.070]
I know.

[02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:32.850]
I know.

[02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:34.390]
I know.

[02:31:35.230 --> 02:31:35.750]
I know.

[02:31:41.350 --> 02:31:41.870]
I know.

[02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:52.230]
I know.

[02:31:55.930 --> 02:31:56.330]
I know.

[02:32:07.050 --> 02:32:07.650]
I know.

[02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:07.650]

[02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:07.650]

[02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:07.650]

[02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:07.650]

[02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:07.650]

[02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:07.650]

[02:32:07.650 --> 02:32:08.050]
this I like to be one isn't it?

[02:32:08.050 --> 02:32:08.550]
Oh, well you know you won't forget your graduation party.

[02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.550]

[02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.550]

[02:32:08.550 --> 02:32:08.590]
I told you,

[02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:08.590]

[02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:08.590]

[02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:08.590]

[02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:08.590]

[02:32:08.590 --> 02:32:22.210]
Pronounce Mud عن威.

[02:32:22.210 --> 02:32:22.850]
about the exercise.

[02:32:22.850 --> 02:32:24.970]
They're all shripping around in their golf cart,

[02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:27.210]
drinking up a storm.

[02:32:27.210 --> 02:32:28.830]
That sounds real healthy to me, you know,

[02:32:29.230 --> 02:32:31.010]
getting just plastered,

[02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:33.950]
playing around at golf and talking about this course

[02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:36.190]
and that course, my God, how about intercourse?

[02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:38.410]
Oh, don't say that, the Jonas Brothers

[02:32:38.410 --> 02:32:40.390]
will never come anywhere near you.

[02:32:42.910 --> 02:32:45.410]
So we got it narrowed down to what Joe, Joe Jonas.

[02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:47.630]
Remember Joe Jones?

[02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:48.510]
You talked too much.

[02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:50.010]
How about you got that in your pile?

[02:32:50.210 --> 02:32:50.610]
Let me check.

[02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:51.850]
Joe-Jones manure, Joe Jones.

[02:32:53.410 --> 02:32:55.230]
Oh, you know who I saw on one of those

[02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:56.950]
information, clearance frog man Henry,

[02:32:57.430 --> 02:33:00.030]
I had never seen anything that looks like that.

[02:33:00.930 --> 02:33:03.970]
What is it, Frog Man, yeah.

[02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:06.990]
Joe, Jones I told you.

[02:33:07.070 --> 02:33:08.050]
Was it a uncle's back the year?

[02:33:09.670 --> 02:33:10.710]
Man, 1962,

[02:33:12.430 --> 02:33:13.050]
1960, scrutine.

[02:33:13.230 --> 02:33:14.810]
Famous, or kind of intensity,

[02:33:15.850 --> 02:33:17.610]
Bulloch back and positive goes on.

[02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:24.770]
you talk to one you worry me to death Joe Jones that was a

[02:33:24.770 --> 02:33:29.290]
medley of his face by the way Joe Jones mm-hmm now that'd be a good poll

[02:33:29.290 --> 02:33:33.990]
question who looks better Joe Jones or Joe Jonas we don't know what Joe Jones

[02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:39.810]
looks like he's probably dead you want to google Joe Jones Fatsow don't know

[02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:50.130]
Fort Radio 560 QAM

[02:33:50.130 --> 02:33:52.010]
Big fourth leader

[02:33:52.010 --> 02:33:54.910]
So take us away to that talent

[02:33:54.910 --> 02:33:56.310]
It's the T.A. Joe

[02:33:56.310 --> 02:33:58.110]
We're not streaming to an island here on

[02:33:58.110 --> 02:34:00.290]
Fort Radio 560 QAM

[02:34:00.290 --> 02:34:02.730]
The sports here

[02:34:02.730 --> 02:34:06.150]
This is Joe Ball and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs they don't come any

[02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:07.410]
better than Neil Rogers

[02:34:10.010 --> 02:34:10.610]
Oi

[02:34:10.610 --> 02:34:13.430]
he's

[02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.270]

[02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.510]
March

[02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:17.250]
Yes, it's my sex.

[02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:19.890]
I have to keep the rest with some terror,

[02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:22.630]
God, I'll prove what the culture wrong.

[02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.890]
The culture wrong.

[02:34:24.310 --> 02:34:27.590]
I only slap you up with a card for the curse.

[02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:29.910]
For the reason that it's human death.

[02:34:30.130 --> 02:34:32.810]
Look at what you love around and it's got to know

[02:34:32.810 --> 02:34:35.090]
the fight, the white Peter is me.

[02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:38.090]
A-A-A-A-A-WOW!

[02:34:38.310 --> 02:34:38.450]
Oh!

[02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:41.990]
Titch it, you're sure, I'm going to roll you.

[02:34:43.430 --> 02:34:45.970]
Titch it, you're going to roll you.

[02:34:46.750 --> 02:34:48.050]
You're going to roll you.

[02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:49.610]
131 at 560.

[02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:51.470]
We're digging out the old days for the end of the year.

[02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:52.790]
It's December the turd, baby.

[02:34:52.910 --> 02:34:57.050]
Wow, before you know it, it's going to be 2000 and 2000 and...

[02:34:57.050 --> 02:34:58.150]
Yeah, I...

[02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:59.590]
Is he still around by?

[02:34:59.650 --> 02:35:00.410]
I keep asking that.

[02:35:01.010 --> 02:35:01.210]
Yeah.

[02:35:01.350 --> 02:35:01.690]
Yeah, he is.

[02:35:02.270 --> 02:35:02.670]
Why?

[02:35:03.470 --> 02:35:04.970]
November 27, 2005.

[02:35:08.130 --> 02:35:09.970]
Is when Joe Jones died?

[02:35:10.270 --> 02:35:10.330]
Yes.

[02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.550]
Oh.

[02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:14.010]
What a shame.

[02:35:15.350 --> 02:35:17.110]
Well, thank God Joe, Jones is still alive.

[02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:21.230]
He was born in 1989.

[02:35:23.850 --> 02:35:24.810]
Did you know that?

[02:35:25.470 --> 02:35:25.730]
No.

[02:35:26.650 --> 02:35:27.510]
I guess why?

[02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:28.610]
To the math, that makes him 19.

[02:35:28.610 --> 02:35:29.310]
I still don't.

[02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:30.510]
He's 19.

[02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:38.650]
Anyway, the fake lyric king who's an idiot, just a total idiot, is Lester Greenshirt still

[02:35:38.650 --> 02:35:38.930]
around?

[02:35:38.930 --> 02:35:40.270]
Remember, Lester Greenshirt?

[02:35:41.430 --> 02:35:41.810]
Yeah.

[02:35:42.430 --> 02:35:46.070]
From the call to race track day, they still called it and I used to go and we had this guy

[02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:48.930]
and it was a real person and he always wore the same green shirt.

[02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:50.290]
And that's what we called him.

[02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:51.530]
Lester Greenshirt.

[02:35:51.650 --> 02:35:51.790]
Hmm.

[02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:52.250]
Quenching.

[02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:56.290]
And this idiot is moron pretending to be my good close personal friend, Larry.

[02:35:56.430 --> 02:35:56.690]
Uh-huh.

[02:35:57.550 --> 02:35:59.870]
Lester Greenshirt still around, like it's a name.

[02:36:00.330 --> 02:36:02.110]
G-R-E-E-N-S-H-E-R.

[02:36:02.310 --> 02:36:03.510]
What a moron, Larry.

[02:36:03.970 --> 02:36:04.850]
What a jackass.

[02:36:04.850 --> 02:36:05.210]
Uh-huh.

[02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:08.830]
By the way, and lose the callostomy bag too, it really stinks on a year.

[02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:14.090]
So you only got a show on TV, you can actually smell something through the TV set?

[02:36:14.490 --> 02:36:14.730]
Really?

[02:36:15.150 --> 02:36:15.750]
Larry's bag.

[02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:16.890]
Smell of it.

[02:36:17.610 --> 02:36:18.550]
Oh, god.

[02:36:18.730 --> 02:36:19.750]
Can you imagine if we had that?

[02:36:20.630 --> 02:36:22.890]
I'll tell you one thing, I'd have been sniffing at the screen last night.

[02:36:23.010 --> 02:36:23.750]
I bet you'd have been looking.

[02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:24.110]
Oh.

[02:36:25.010 --> 02:36:25.190]
Oh.

[02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:26.050]
Woo.

[02:36:27.010 --> 02:36:28.150]
I'd have been sniffing around.

[02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:29.230]
Yeah.

[02:36:29.450 --> 02:36:31.350]
At least I'm honest about this stuff.

[02:36:31.390 --> 02:36:31.510]
Yeah.

[02:36:31.770 --> 02:36:32.810]
Oh, G-H-O embarrassing.

[02:36:32.810 --> 02:36:33.770]
Not even a thing.

[02:36:33.770 --> 02:36:34.830]
It's just the truth, man.

[02:36:36.310 --> 02:36:37.750]
If it looks good, think about it.

[02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:40.250]
And it's available, do it.

[02:36:41.330 --> 02:36:42.390]
Screw it and do it.

[02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:43.630]
Like George always says.

[02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.350]
That's right.

[02:36:45.010 --> 02:36:49.150]
Tony West Kendall says, Saludos to George and I'm listening to your show and the best

[02:36:49.150 --> 02:36:51.990]
part of it was 11.25 AM, the quarter-schlots guy.

[02:36:52.430 --> 02:36:56.610]
And once again into my many others disappointment, you cut him off saying he has nothing interesting

[02:36:56.610 --> 02:36:57.030]
to say.

[02:36:57.330 --> 02:37:00.030]
How can we list it and determine that he's if he's not allowed to speak?

[02:37:00.470 --> 02:37:01.730]
Love your show very much.

[02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:03.570]
Take, try to take a little more calls.

[02:37:04.030 --> 02:37:06.390]
Tony West Kendall, obviously must be the quarter-schlot guy.

[02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:07.730]
Take the call out.

[02:37:08.810 --> 02:37:08.910]
Huh?

[02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:10.170]
Yeah, call out.

[02:37:10.350 --> 02:37:11.130]
See if I take your call.

[02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:13.530]
If I, let me reach over and shut the monitor off just to make sure.

[02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:16.030]
Quarter-schlot guy.

[02:37:16.090 --> 02:37:17.210]
That's all this guy ever writes about.

[02:37:17.330 --> 02:37:21.150]
Tony West Kendall is, how come you don't let the shorter, the shorter our clock guy on?

[02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:23.470]
The what?

[02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:24.710]
The short of schlots guy.

[02:37:24.810 --> 02:37:26.110]
The Bumba schlots guy.

[02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:29.710]
Here's one from Brian.

[02:37:29.710 --> 02:37:32.750]
It says, work great and you never have to change the battery.

[02:37:33.630 --> 02:37:35.490]
You just put it on the charger to recharge.

[02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:36.850]
What, what work great?

[02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:39.250]
A rechargeable wireless mouse.

[02:37:40.610 --> 02:37:41.650]
Never listen to George.

[02:37:41.650 --> 02:37:43.790]
He's a retard smoking the wacky stuff.

[02:37:43.890 --> 02:37:44.110]
Yeah.

[02:37:44.110 --> 02:37:44.710]
Melt's the mind.

[02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.970]
Right.

[02:37:46.210 --> 02:37:47.150]
You'll ruin the day.

[02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:49.410]
You'll ruin the day.

[02:37:49.430 --> 02:37:49.830]
Don't fight.

[02:37:50.090 --> 02:37:52.790]
This, this has served me well for almost seven years here.

[02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:57.490]
Now this mouse that's dying and believe you me, we ain't got another seven years here.

[02:37:57.890 --> 02:37:59.050]
And probably I don't either.

[02:38:00.850 --> 02:38:01.230]
God.

[02:38:03.390 --> 02:38:07.550]
Somebody sends me this article from the New York Times in South Florida, tropical Bohemia

[02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:12.090]
in the makings and it's a long, long, ponderous article which I guess I'm supposed to wipe

[02:38:12.090 --> 02:38:12.590]
my ass with.

[02:38:12.670 --> 02:38:15.450]
There's something 824 votes on your pool.

[02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:16.610]
We could get a 50.

[02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:17.150]
What do you think?

[02:38:17.390 --> 02:38:18.470]
Should we give it a big push?

[02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.450]
Sure.

[02:38:19.510 --> 02:38:19.710]
Why not?

[02:38:19.790 --> 02:38:20.190]
We can do it.

[02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:23.310]
I mean, we already got our 800 so we can come back again tomorrow.

[02:38:23.550 --> 02:38:23.910]
Exactly.

[02:38:24.450 --> 02:38:26.370]
Don't forget Gildi from Ad Dog this afternoon.

[02:38:26.370 --> 02:38:27.350]
Don't say I didn't warn you.

[02:38:27.810 --> 02:38:28.590]
Oh my God.

[02:38:28.590 --> 02:38:29.730]
The squeakmout master.

[02:38:31.570 --> 02:38:32.510]
Maybe what's your name?

[02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:34.190]
Melinda will be calling into Gildi.

[02:38:35.210 --> 02:38:37.990]
You know, each one of her boobs had its own zip code.

[02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:41.030]
That's how gigantic they were.

[02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.570]
Am I right?

[02:38:42.370 --> 02:38:44.470]
Oh yeah, and that fake picture we got of the fake Melinda.

[02:38:46.850 --> 02:38:52.450]
The only real email we can be sure of today was the one from Tom Jicke by way of Norma

[02:38:52.450 --> 02:38:53.050]
Kent's response.

[02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:57.670]
So maybe Tom really is writing something about me, which he hasn't talked to me about

[02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.790]
it.

[02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:58.350]
I'll tell you that.

[02:38:58.670 --> 02:38:59.930]
Everybody else seems to know about it.

[02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:02.510]
Just like everybody knows we're going to serious, which we aren't.

[02:39:03.890 --> 02:39:04.650]
Everybody's an expert.

[02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:05.310]
Have you noticed that?

[02:39:06.010 --> 02:39:06.590]
Always had been.

[02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:08.110]
Everybody's a freaking expert.

[02:39:09.990 --> 02:39:12.910]
What past features of the Aradjus show would you like resurrected?

[02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:14.170]
That's the poll question.

[02:39:16.850 --> 02:39:18.610]
Fart sounds 237.

[02:39:19.930 --> 02:39:22.970]
I sure hope that those Jonas brothers don't fart.

[02:39:23.650 --> 02:39:24.730]
That would be disgusting.

[02:39:26.190 --> 02:39:27.530]
Funny bits 178.

[02:39:28.410 --> 02:39:31.290]
Cross over talk with subsequent or prior talk host 95.

[02:39:31.690 --> 02:39:32.290]
No chance.

[02:39:33.490 --> 02:39:34.850]
That hand crossover thing.

[02:39:34.930 --> 02:39:35.270]
Remember that?

[02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:36.210]
Yep.

[02:39:36.350 --> 02:39:39.690]
When they put poor hand on in the morning, what kind of a lunatic would do that in the first

[02:39:39.690 --> 02:39:40.010]
place?

[02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:43.790]
There was no chance he's not a morning guy.

[02:39:43.790 --> 02:39:44.690]
He even said that to me.

[02:39:44.810 --> 02:39:45.790]
There's no way I was ever going to work.

[02:39:45.910 --> 02:39:46.590]
I'm not a morning guy.

[02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:47.250]
I knew it would fail.

[02:39:47.550 --> 02:39:51.750]
And then I was getting that crap from fat boy, not our fat boy, but the real fat boy

[02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:52.090]
and others.

[02:39:52.410 --> 02:39:54.010]
Oh, you wanted Hank to fail in the front.

[02:39:54.010 --> 02:39:54.870]
No, I didn't want him to fail.

[02:39:54.930 --> 02:39:56.810]
I wanted to stay where he belonged in the afternoon.

[02:40:00.310 --> 02:40:02.430]
God, the things that they've done.

[02:40:03.650 --> 02:40:04.770]
Lightning round 79.

[02:40:05.390 --> 02:40:06.510]
No sidekick 46.

[02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:08.410]
Kamilis House fundraiser 43.

[02:40:08.730 --> 02:40:09.430]
The Kamilis House.

[02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:35.090]
POS.

[02:40:36.270 --> 02:40:37.150]
Luke Crones.

[02:40:37.310 --> 02:40:39.010]
Oh, here's last night's loss, I think.

[02:40:39.070 --> 02:40:43.650]
All in holy, had an empty net, but he couldn't make contact.

[02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:47.170]
Strollman, run into the whole way.

[02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:50.670]
Holy trying to get it freed up in his back now for air hot.

Air hot, sending it in.

[02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:54.330]
Strollman plays it back on the boards.

[02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:56.670]
And Holy sends it on the right wing side.

[02:40:56.890 --> 02:40:58.830]

[02:41:29.350 --> 02:41:29.350]

[02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:30.970]
Too bad Dan from Maryland business still around.

[02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:32.650]
Too bad, he's off in the Philippines with his alleged

[02:41:34.390 --> 02:41:34.770]

[02:41:35.970 --> 02:41:38.390]
And allegedly gone. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, jeez.

[02:41:38.410 --> 02:41:40.550]
I got to go back to that. There was some harness racing on for

[02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:41.450]
where that could have been from.

[02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:42.930]

[02:41:48.050 --> 02:41:48.250]

[02:41:48.570 --> 02:41:53.190]
One fifty one and three in the fifth that he sounds like a real

[02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:53.630]
foodtaker.

[02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:55.870]
It's an air down at the inside working our way.

[02:41:55.930 --> 02:41:57.650]

[02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.510]

[02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.510]

[02:44:25.510 --> 02:44:25.550]
you know, you know

[02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:25.550]

you know

[02:44:49.870 --> 02:44:50.650]
you

[02:44:50.650 --> 02:44:51.610]
have

[02:44:51.610 --> 02:44:55.890]
gang

[02:44:55.890 --> 02:44:55.890]

[02:44:55.890 --> 02:44:58.210]
have

[02:44:59.890 --> 02:45:01.430]
Maybe Geldik could replace my mouse.

[02:45:02.490 --> 02:45:03.230]
He'll be right up.

[02:45:03.530 --> 02:45:04.550]
Here's one I have no idea.

[02:45:04.710 --> 02:45:05.710]
Peter from London asks,

[02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.810]
what happened to Ed?

[02:45:07.610 --> 02:45:09.230]
Was he the one that was related to Stan Mage,

[02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:10.190]
the guy who owed you money?

[02:45:10.450 --> 02:45:11.830]
I have no idea what he's talking about.

[02:45:13.090 --> 02:45:13.350]
Ed?

[02:45:13.810 --> 02:45:14.270]
The murder.

[02:45:16.690 --> 02:45:18.450]
What are you talking about, Peter, from London?

[02:45:18.590 --> 02:45:19.130]
You lunatic.

[02:45:19.490 --> 02:45:20.150]
Boop, boop, boop, boop.

[02:45:20.290 --> 02:45:20.470]
Yeah.

[02:45:21.890 --> 02:45:24.530]
Too much, too much of time with the Queen probably,

[02:45:24.730 --> 02:45:25.330]
over there in London.

[02:45:26.190 --> 02:45:27.530]
I still can't get over that.

[02:45:27.610 --> 02:45:28.750]
All that pomp and circumcise,

[02:45:28.750 --> 02:45:29.910]
no, the crap that goes on it.

[02:45:30.410 --> 02:45:31.810]
Antivatican, too, with that swish guard.

[02:45:32.510 --> 02:45:32.730]
Mm-hmm.

[02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:35.010]
And they must look really, really hot

[02:45:35.010 --> 02:45:36.450]
and they must be very accommodating.

[02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:39.130]
In other words, they must put out for papa.

[02:45:40.290 --> 02:45:42.430]
Let's see, when's the evening rain?

[02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.570]
Beautiful now.

[02:45:44.650 --> 02:45:46.010]
I'll start to cloud up a little bit,

[02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:47.390]
just in time for the ride to Woodbine.

[02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:50.330]
Squalls tomorrow and zero, 32 for eye.

[02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:52.790]
Friday, flurries in a high of 28.

[02:45:54.250 --> 02:45:54.650]
Wow.

[02:45:55.610 --> 02:45:57.350]
I wonder what cash turnover thinks about that.

[02:45:58.930 --> 02:46:01.490]
You know, on you, uh, goofballs out there in the business,

[02:46:01.490 --> 02:46:03.870]
I know every single one of you is listening right now,

[02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:07.570]
including the people who disparage me in the show

[02:46:07.570 --> 02:46:08.450]
and poor little George,

[02:46:08.570 --> 02:46:10.530]
there was another shot at you, which I just deleted.

[02:46:12.090 --> 02:46:12.730]
Oh, gee.

[02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:14.370]
The show started with shots at George,

[02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:16.750]
and I guess it's gonna end on the emails with shots at George.

[02:46:16.990 --> 02:46:17.550]
How do you like that?

[02:46:17.950 --> 02:46:19.190]
Mm-hmm.

[02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:19.790]
Yeah.

[02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:21.250]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:46:21.630 --> 02:46:22.190]
We don't care.

[02:46:22.670 --> 02:46:23.190]
Screw you.

[02:46:24.650 --> 02:46:27.550]
Chris says, do not go wireless, nothing but problems.

[02:46:27.890 --> 02:46:28.030]
Right.

[02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:31.050]
I'm not, I'm not going wireless.

[02:46:32.250 --> 02:46:32.690]
Sirius.

[02:46:33.670 --> 02:46:34.110]
Sirial.

[02:46:34.450 --> 02:46:35.250]
You know what we ought to do?

[02:46:36.050 --> 02:46:36.350]
What?

[02:46:36.770 --> 02:46:37.950]
Let's make up a story, okay?

[02:46:38.110 --> 02:46:39.310]
Starting January 15.

[02:46:39.530 --> 02:46:42.050]
We're going to go on serious, uh, Howard's 101 channel.

[02:46:42.690 --> 02:46:43.130]
Sure.

[02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.890]
Yeah.

[02:46:44.570 --> 02:46:45.250]
Sure what?

[02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:47.310]
I'm a serial.

[02:46:47.670 --> 02:46:48.110]
All right.

[02:46:49.570 --> 02:46:51.870]
Subject Johnny F and Rockets from somebody that says,

[02:46:51.870 --> 02:46:53.930]
did you ever have a Nathan's Franky Johnny Rockets?

[02:46:54.090 --> 02:46:55.930]
I never saw Nathan's Frank on a menu, did you?

[02:46:56.370 --> 02:46:57.610]
Not that I recall, but it might be.

[02:46:57.690 --> 02:46:57.810]
No.

[02:46:58.570 --> 02:47:00.610]
They are at all Johnny Rockets restaurants.

[02:47:00.770 --> 02:47:02.210]
Well, I didn't see it.

[02:47:02.650 --> 02:47:05.070]
Also, Brad Pitts will be on Luric King tonight.

[02:47:06.610 --> 02:47:08.410]
Oh, wait, wait, did you hear the rest of this?

[02:47:08.550 --> 02:47:08.790]
Okay.

[02:47:09.270 --> 02:47:10.730]
I love listening to all the pits.

[02:47:11.650 --> 02:47:13.650]
Let Dan on the ticket work for ESPN.

[02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:15.330]
You are better than Dan at the ticket.

[02:47:15.850 --> 02:47:17.350]
Dan was on PTI last night.

[02:47:17.690 --> 02:47:19.670]
Happy birthday, George, from Nancy and Del Ray Beach.

[02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:22.730]
Nancy is a cent of stuff before and she's still got kind of like a, uh,

[02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:24.890]
a little grammatical problem there.

[02:47:24.970 --> 02:47:25.430]
That's all right.

[02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:26.170]
You know what I mean?

[02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:27.070]
It's okay.

[02:47:27.150 --> 02:47:28.770]
It's not perfect except me.

[02:47:29.970 --> 02:47:30.850]
Here's one that says,

[02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:32.770]
future shop is owned by Best Buy.

[02:47:33.070 --> 02:47:33.930]
Well, Lottie, duh.

[02:47:34.090 --> 02:47:34.590]
How do you like that?

[02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:36.170]
I thought they were owned by a circuit city.

[02:47:37.210 --> 02:47:38.010]
It's all the same.

[02:47:38.190 --> 02:47:41.650]
It's all, you know, like 10 companies own everything in the world.

[02:47:42.250 --> 02:47:43.410]
Like Ted Rogers who died.

[02:47:43.650 --> 02:47:45.290]
Oh, yesterday after the show, I got an email.

[02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:49.010]
Alerting me that Ted Rogers died at 75 as if I didn't already know and talk about it.

[02:47:49.210 --> 02:47:53.290]
And then it said, any relation, any relation, Ted Rogers, like that's my real last name.

[02:47:53.850 --> 02:47:56.010]
And like if Ted Rogers was, I was related to him.

[02:47:56.010 --> 02:47:56.890]
I'd be sitting here working.

[02:47:57.830 --> 02:48:04.190]
That guy had billions, billions Rogers cable, Rogers wireless, Rogers this, the Roger Center.

[02:48:05.430 --> 02:48:06.390]
Oh my god.

[02:48:06.510 --> 02:48:10.390]
Talk about a man who he might as well have just had a printing press in his home because it's all he did

[02:48:10.390 --> 02:48:10.970]
was make money.

[02:48:12.470 --> 02:48:14.570]
He was, I guess, pretty good guy, charitable guy.

[02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:15.430]
You know that kind of stuff.

[02:48:15.570 --> 02:48:15.730]
Yep.

[02:48:16.350 --> 02:48:17.190]
But he's dead.

[02:48:18.430 --> 02:48:21.890]
It says also did you see how air Canada is facing a severe cash crunch?

[02:48:21.890 --> 02:48:25.050]
They lost hundreds of millions betting the press oil would say hi.

[02:48:25.150 --> 02:48:25.510]
Well, good.

[02:48:25.810 --> 02:48:29.150]
If anybody deserves to lose money, it's those grave robbers at air Canada.

[02:48:29.970 --> 02:48:33.370]
God, the way they rape the public is just unconscionable.

[02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:34.350]
Un-un-un-on.

[02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:34.810]
Conscionable.

[02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:40.550]
If you had any idea what I spend round trip business class going just to Fort Lauderdale,

[02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:41.430]
you would plots.

[02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:43.850]
You'd drop a brick right in the chair right now.

[02:48:45.630 --> 02:48:46.070]
Unreceptible.

[02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:51.010]
Now here's one from Barry MacCockner who, you know, he's a good, he's bad, he's in between.

[02:48:51.010 --> 02:48:53.610]
This is his best effort short and sweet.

[02:48:55.430 --> 02:48:59.410]
And if Barry MacCockner knows the answer to this dilemma, then our management should,

[02:48:59.510 --> 02:49:00.410]
but they just don't want to.

[02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:03.090]
It says, prosack Ron is a douche.

[02:49:03.210 --> 02:49:03.970]
Get a restraining order.

[02:49:04.370 --> 02:49:04.610]
Yeah.

[02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.930]
That's what it says.

[02:49:06.170 --> 02:49:07.070]
Very simple, awesome.

[02:49:07.350 --> 02:49:07.610]
Great.

[02:49:07.850 --> 02:49:08.650]
Very simple.

[02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:09.350]
Nice going Barry.

[02:49:09.770 --> 02:49:10.130]
Hey Barry.

[02:49:10.330 --> 02:49:10.710]
You're fair.

[02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:12.190]
You got your thumb right on it, baby.

[02:49:13.050 --> 02:49:14.090]
Get a restraining order.

[02:49:14.210 --> 02:49:14.790]
That's all we needed.

[02:49:14.930 --> 02:49:19.830]
And of course we got that Ron Doron Doron, Doron Nagrinowski started out to show

[02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:20.350]
what that crap.

[02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:23.570]
See they, they don't even realize that they're deleted.

[02:49:23.730 --> 02:49:24.450]
They just keep sending them.

[02:49:24.570 --> 02:49:27.670]
Once in a while I sneak a peek at some of that stuff and then it turns out like that.

[02:49:28.310 --> 02:49:29.690]
Oh, we're always going to be here.

[02:49:29.770 --> 02:49:30.630]
We're always going to be here.

[02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:32.230]
We're always going to be trying to destroy the show.

[02:49:32.530 --> 02:49:34.710]
And management will always sit back and allow you to do it.

[02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:37.230]
Because that's their main goal in life is to destroy the show.

[02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:38.210]
And I'll say one thing.

[02:49:38.250 --> 02:49:39.170]
I can't say much for them.

[02:49:39.310 --> 02:49:41.590]
A boy they've done a fabulous job in that category.

[02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:44.090]
Fabulous, not good or sensational.

[02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:45.030]
Systematically.

[02:49:45.530 --> 02:49:45.690]
Yeah.

[02:49:47.130 --> 02:49:50.970]
And of course this is from the same agent who said a year ago,

[02:49:51.210 --> 02:49:53.850]
Joyce Fitz will do anything to hurt your show, to destroy your show.

[02:49:54.010 --> 02:49:55.610]
This is what Norma told me right to my ear.

[02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:58.190]
And sat back and let it happen.

[02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:01.910]
Here's one from Mario.

[02:50:03.610 --> 02:50:04.070]
Love the show.

[02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:06.490]
This is regarding whatever Schmuck said Jim the high school broadcaster,

[02:50:06.590 --> 02:50:07.910]
Rome is going to be on the ticket next year.

[02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:10.750]
How is this possible when he's on one of WFTL's 40 stations?

[02:50:12.170 --> 02:50:13.370]
Well, that's what the rumor is.

[02:50:13.370 --> 02:50:15.870]
10 to 3 maybe they're going syndicated and Role me.

[02:50:16.270 --> 02:50:16.710]
Role me.

[02:50:16.810 --> 02:50:19.970]
Home he's going to be part of that crap because they're throwing in the towel.

[02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:24.310]
Maybe what they'll do is from 10 to 3 they'll just play Roy.

[02:50:24.990 --> 02:50:25.250]
You think?

[02:50:25.890 --> 02:50:26.490]
Sounds good.

[02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:28.250]
Should be whatever else they're doing.

[02:50:28.990 --> 02:50:30.910]
Here's one from Sean, live in California.

[02:50:30.910 --> 02:50:32.150]
Maybe listen to you over the internet.

[02:50:32.450 --> 02:50:35.030]
Learned of your show through an online game, my friends, and I play.

[02:50:35.390 --> 02:50:36.350]
And one of them mentioned your show.

[02:50:36.370 --> 02:50:37.490]
So I gave it a listen on a whim.

[02:50:38.010 --> 02:50:38.630]
Your show is great.

[02:50:38.770 --> 02:50:40.070]
I think you're always happy attitude.

[02:50:40.210 --> 02:50:40.630]
That's me.

[02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:44.150]
And snarking comments would make a great addition to our online game.

[02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:45.430]
I like that word.

[02:50:45.530 --> 02:50:48.630]
Personality would make a great compliment to our world of warcraft gaming group.

[02:50:48.750 --> 02:50:51.110]
And can't wait to share your show with the rest of my friends.

[02:50:51.390 --> 02:50:52.370]
Happily the morbid night.

[02:50:53.030 --> 02:50:56.250]
PS please play more Mickey, but staggering the haters of those even more.

[02:50:56.790 --> 02:50:57.550]
The morbid night.

[02:50:58.630 --> 02:51:01.010]
Wants to stick it to all those hate monitors out there.

[02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:02.390]
Oh, you're playing that too much.

[02:51:02.470 --> 02:51:03.550]
You playing Chris Matthews too much.

[02:51:06.690 --> 02:51:09.570]
Just like what's his name in Batman?

[02:51:10.850 --> 02:51:11.210]
Batman.

[02:51:11.570 --> 02:51:12.150]
The penguin.

[02:51:12.230 --> 02:51:12.650]
That's right.

[02:51:13.410 --> 02:51:14.070]
Burgess Meredith.

[02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:15.190]
By the way, he's still dead.

[02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:17.290]
Smokey Burgess.

[02:51:17.310 --> 02:51:18.150]
I bet you he's dead too.

[02:51:18.270 --> 02:51:18.930]
I think he is.

[02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:23.290]
Smokey Burgess big fat catcher for the pirates and a bunch of other teams.

[02:51:24.470 --> 02:51:25.350]
How about you fat Chris?

[02:51:25.430 --> 02:51:26.470]
Remember smokey Burgess?

[02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:27.730]
No, not at all.

[02:51:28.050 --> 02:51:28.950]
Remember Geno Somoli?

[02:51:29.230 --> 02:51:29.490]
Who?

[02:51:29.990 --> 02:51:31.670]
I don't think you're going to get your 850.

[02:51:31.930 --> 02:51:32.590]
We're going to set our goal.

[02:51:32.890 --> 02:51:33.590]
Our goal is 800.

[02:51:34.510 --> 02:51:35.530]
We've got 842 right now.

[02:51:36.030 --> 02:51:36.710]
We've got 842.

[02:51:37.050 --> 02:51:40.510]
We got seven minutes for eight votes.

[02:51:42.210 --> 02:51:43.710]
Now if we have any audience left,

[02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:46.130]
if being the operative part of that sentence,

[02:51:46.370 --> 02:51:48.510]
if we have any left, we ought to be able to do that easy.

[02:51:49.410 --> 02:51:50.270]
The best name.

[02:51:50.590 --> 02:51:51.010]
The best.

[02:51:51.610 --> 02:51:52.730]
You're busy on projects.

[02:51:53.150 --> 02:51:53.950]
Forty-two five.

[02:51:53.970 --> 02:51:55.510]
That's my two-time name.

[02:51:55.730 --> 02:51:55.890]
A rat.

[02:51:56.090 --> 02:51:56.950]
Forty-three.

[02:51:56.970 --> 02:51:56.970]

[02:51:58.410 --> 02:51:59.150]
It's state.

[02:51:59.850 --> 02:52:01.110]
If I have the town.

[02:52:02.290 --> 02:52:03.730]
At five six, oh.

[02:52:04.810 --> 02:52:06.250]
WQ-a-m.

[02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.990]
Oh.

[02:52:15.570 --> 02:52:20.310]
They have all the oil they need to keep their gas low.

[02:52:20.930 --> 02:52:26.190]
And nothing more than corporate greed.

[02:52:26.670 --> 02:52:28.990]
No one's just controlling it.

[02:52:29.810 --> 02:52:30.630]
No one's just controlling it.

[02:52:31.570 --> 02:52:33.790]
Bad job ridiculous, car.

[02:52:35.410 --> 02:52:37.310]
Upset with flinted insects.

[02:52:37.950 --> 02:52:39.370]
Down these violins stay.

[02:52:40.030 --> 02:52:41.310]
Or screwing you all.

[02:52:44.890 --> 02:52:46.750]
Break, beat, break, beat.

[02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:48.610]
At the company, break, beat.

[02:52:48.930 --> 02:52:49.990]
Right to the gallon.

[02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:51.850]
It's higher each time.

[02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:54.410]
Break, beat, break, beat.

[02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:56.290]
At the company, break, beat.

[02:52:56.650 --> 02:53:00.370]
They're making profits at an all-time high.

[02:53:09.530 --> 02:53:12.170]
Open more on the middle class.

[02:53:12.670 --> 02:53:14.610]
The planet can trash it.

[02:53:14.610 --> 02:53:17.190]
It can trash it.

[02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:19.490]
No balls to say to push this fast.

[02:53:20.290 --> 02:53:22.410]
It's over with having it.

[02:53:22.970 --> 02:53:24.290]
Having it having it.

[02:53:24.910 --> 02:53:27.310]
You hear news in every day.

[02:53:29.150 --> 02:53:31.050]
A template to justify.

[02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:33.170]
A magical price.

[02:53:33.950 --> 02:53:35.290]
Highest the sky.

[02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:38.330]
Oh.

[02:53:38.810 --> 02:53:40.370]
Break, beat, break, beat.

[02:53:40.730 --> 02:53:42.310]
At the company, break, beat.

[02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:43.490]
They raise their price.

[02:53:44.350 --> 02:53:45.190]
Highest daylight.

[02:53:46.210 --> 02:53:47.030]
Break, beat, break.

[02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:48.610]
8.59 on your pull pencil.

[02:53:48.970 --> 02:53:49.410]
Nice roll.

[02:53:49.850 --> 02:53:50.230]
All right.

[02:53:51.610 --> 02:53:53.350]
That's something that's dry.

[02:53:55.790 --> 02:53:58.010]
You have to push your heart to the right.

[02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:59.550]
You have to push your heart to the right.

[02:53:59.550 --> 02:54:00.590]
You have to push your heart to the right.

[02:54:01.050 --> 02:54:05.150]
You have to push your heart to the right.

[02:54:05.150 --> 02:54:06.730]
The best talent.

[02:54:07.530 --> 02:54:10.850]
At your home for Miami Dovens football.

[02:54:11.170 --> 02:54:12.410]
Hey, I can't catch it.

[02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:15.990]
Sports radio 560 WQAM.
