[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]
The music expressed on the pre-season.

[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.960]
Oh, we did just hear Stormpads, didn't we?

[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.480]
Oh my god.

[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.840]
Oh my god.

[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.100]
Hey Stormy.

[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.800]
And he was racing.

[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.140]
Look how he was racing.

[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.180]
You're listening to Spokes out like you over at 16 W.

[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.020]
You're gonna blow, Jake.

[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.900]
Oh yeah.

[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.320]
I am a Ford Lutter.

[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.140]
There is a god.

[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.100]
Neo-God.

[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.080]
Now it's our almost 300 points.

[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.160]
560 WQAM presents the Neil Rogers Show to talk to Neil,

[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.720]
dial 567-0560 and day and broard in other counties.

[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.860]
A style is down on the 8775 Neil or 757-780 and Verizon Wireless phones.

[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.860]
The opinion has been set to 74 points for his college and the NNPN-13A WQAM management staff.

[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.100]
Ford is hired soon for the Neil Rogers Show on 560 WQAM.

[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.080]
Hey money penny, put me to the laser beam out of my wristwatch.

[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.880]
Ooh, put the dead roll watch.

[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.860]
Please lock him away.

[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:26.100]
For I recall the day on the side of Brunko Rye and he won't confess.

[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.700]
Oh, I don't care what they say cause oh, Jake.

[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920]
Murderer where we love.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.560]
Absolutely.

[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:51.260]
It happened so soon on the 12th of June and no Jake ran away from that bloody mess.

[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.820]
I don't care what they say cause oh, Jake.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.100]
Murderer where we love.

[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.640]
Yes.

[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.120]
I have waited quite a while but I see he's still on trial.

[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.600]
It goes on and never ends.

[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.800]
As it does I know that Oh, Jake murdered them.

[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.580]
Lock him up please and throw away the keys.

[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.940]
It's a game of the crames of his innocence.

[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.780]
I'm dying on the air.

[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.540]
I don't care what they say cause oh, Jake.

[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580]
Murderer where we love.

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.160]
Murderer where we love.

[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.120]
Better late than that world.

[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.700]
Justice will be served.

[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.440]
When I great that was the best thing to have it over the weekend.

[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.420]
Yeah.

[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.280]
Besides my having dinner with Hank had woodbying on Saturday.

[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.020]
And beside the Patriots winning yesterday at Matt Castleboy he is sure pretty.

[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.680]
I'll tell you that.

[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.080]
He's not very good but he's pretty.

[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.920]
And he played okay yesterday.

[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.480]
And the dolphins were smelling super bowl cause where my amy dolphin.

[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.580]
Oh, I just had to come down over there.

[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.600]
What?

[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.520]
Come down over there.

[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.220]
They're not going to the Super Bowl.

[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.000]
Oh yeah.

[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.320]
I mean, well, I'm smelling it.

[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.520]
The stench, the aroma of elephant dung.

[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.760]
They won a game.

[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.000]
Baby, they beat those very inconsistent San Diego charges.

[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.400]
They looked really, I didn't want any of it.

[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.460]
I didn't want a second of it.

[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.140]
I bet you were glued to it.

[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.700]
Chris, Chris, by the way, has been chewed out by the beast.

[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.200]
The beast who is the most overgrown, no, and I take that back.

[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.520]
He's the second most overgrown child of QAM.

[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.440]
The most overgrown child is our program director, Clarence Deer.

[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.240]
I love eating nuts.

[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.820]
Yeah.

[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.900]
You are nuts.

[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.620]
You're an idiot.

[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.680]
You and your UM's crap.

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.960]
Hey, by the way, how about the hurricane?

[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.980]
What did I tell you that Friday?

[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.880]
You went there a Thursday.

[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.680]
You wouldn't listen to me.

[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.420]
Chris, uh-huh.

[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.740]
What are they now?

[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.320]
One, three.

[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.300]
Two and three.

[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.200]
They played two girls teams.

[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.160]
Well, they played Texas Day and A.

[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.620]
They had an earlier girl team.

[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.940]
They had like a grown-up girls team.

[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.060]
And then the little girls team, they started the season with.

[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.100]
Two and three.

[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.040]
Three losses, man.

[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.560]
It's not good.

[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.320]
That smells bad.

[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.140]
Smells.

[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.640]
I'm smelling super bowl, because we're the Miami Doth.

[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.140]
All these front-running phonies, man.

[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.800]
You're a joke.

[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.660]
And speaking of front-running phonies, how about those cubs?

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.320]
Yeah.

[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.800]
I wonder how that guy feels.

[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.380]
That's schmuck.

[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.540]
Oh, you're getting on the bad wagon, Neil.

[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.640]
Oh, boy.

[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.080]
Where's the thing where Harry says the cubs suck?

[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.200]
I think it's just under the cubs suck.

[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.580]
No, it's not.

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.700]
The cubs suck.

[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.800]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.380]
It's under the cubs suck.

[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.960]
Trust me.

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.400]
The cubs suck.

[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.400]

[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.360]
The cubs suck.

[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.440]
No wonder I can never find it.

[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.320]
I never knew where it was.

[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.480]
The cubs suck.

[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.380]
The cubs suck.

[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.840]
They got swept by the Dodgers.

[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.460]
The cubs suck.

[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.360]
The season is over.

[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.620]
Yeah, it's over.

[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.860]
So that schmuck.

[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.160]
Oh, you got to be watching WGN tonight.

[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.860]
Yeah, all right.

[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.680]
Blow it out your ass.

[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.780]
OK, silly loser.

[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.420]
When are you going to wake up and stiff the daffodils already?

[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.960]
It's a choke franchise.

[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]
Choking and gagging.

[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.660]
And the Dow is down.

[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.740]
Three and 32 points.

[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.940]
Speaking of choking and gagging.

[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.860]
Oh, boy, not good.

[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.780]
Didn't you think that the bailout was going to get them in Asia?

[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.940]
We've seen European central banks and...

[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.960]
You have a screen.

[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.320]
You talk like a screenwriter.

[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.340]
You have their financial institutions.

[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.960]
That doesn't instill confidence over here.

[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.020]
Plus, you have the added recognition that there's really virtually no doubt at all

[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.700]
that we are now in a recession.

[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.080]
Right.

[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.620]
And the question is...

[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.120]
Thank you, Mr. President, for the recession.

[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.880]
And for all the dead people in Iraq and all the low gas prices.

[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.000]
And Sarah, by the way, she says,

[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.780]
blow it isn't qualified to be president.

[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.360]
Here's the poll from Friday from George, who didn't even watch the debate.

[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.600]
I did eventually.

[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.940]
I had the wife take it for me.

[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.440]
I watched about how.

[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.800]
Oh, did you?

[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.020]

[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.340]
Can I call you Joe?

[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.920]
Can I call you Joe?

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.900]
You got to admit she memorized your lines really well.

[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.960]
And of course, the Republicans did a great job of deballing when I fold before the debate,

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.940]
which was their whole purpose.

[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.860]
And as a result, there was no follow-up.

[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.100]
And when Sarah said, oh, I'm not going to answer your questions.

[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.700]
I'm going to talk to the American people.

[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.480]
When I just sat there with that stupid, dushman, Aiden grin on her face like, oh, well, okay.

[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:37.700]
Whatever you say.

[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.580]
I'm not going to answer your questions.

[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.860]
What kind of a debate is that?

[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.520]
Shut up, Connie.

[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.040]
In many cases, she couldn't answer the questions.

[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.300]
And there was something in spite of her home spun, winking and then thinking and whatever else she was doing and not.

[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.340]
The public still didn't buy it.

[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.640]
Everybody in their brother said, wouldn't Joe Biden want the debate and believe me, he was no ball of fire.

[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.060]
He was, he looked like a dead man on doggy donors.

[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.780]
Yep.

[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.480]
What's your take on the Vice Presidential debate was Georgia's poll question on Friday.

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.860]
Sarah Palin is a blathering idiot 318.

[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.920]
I thought we already knew that.

[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.540]
That's what I voted.

[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.860]
Joe Biden won 302.

[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.680]
That's what I voted.

[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.960]
Sarah didn't choke like I thought she would, 215.

[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.820]
She didn't gag.

[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.600]
And although I bet she she has,

[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.840]
I'm more scared of Sarah than ever 183.

[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.380]
I didn't watch it, 121.

[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.580]
8% of this is two audience didn't watch it.

[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.920]
By the way, Neil at Nearoges.com, I know it's a tough email address.

[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.760]
Very disappointing over the weekend, very little.

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.020]
Although I have another, waaah, email a long one from Gary in the New Orleans.

[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.380]
Who doesn't understand that he's chronic?

[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.100]
Chronic question, Markie.

[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.420]
I'm going to rip you an ass, Gary.

[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.120]
You simple did.

[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.680]
Didn't watch it, 121.

[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.240]
Who cares?

[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.060]
I just want to do Sarah Palin 94.

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.680]
94 we desperate guys with bad taste.

[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.680]
I mean, if she's something to get all excited about, I just,

[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.080]
I don't get it.

[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.180]
Who added that?

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.960]
Who added that option?

[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.980]
You're asking me, you were on the air.

[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.600]
I know.

[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.380]
Who cares?

[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.600]
I just wanted to do Sarah Palin.

[00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.260]
I'm sure you did.

[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.100]
Not me.

[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:11.780]
Who did it, Chris?

[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.580]
Must have been Lee.

[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.880]
He didn't show it to us on Friday.

[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.600]
He must have had it.

[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:14.780]
Oh, that's right, Chris.

[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.960]
Well, Chris wasn't here on Friday and he allegedly is going to be here again on Friday

[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.200]
because Clarence keeps taking him off of our show and sticking him elsewhere.

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.780]
Because our show takes it up the...

[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.080]
Back down.

[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:25.240]

[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.600]
Clarence and Beast sitting in a tree.

[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.680]
F you.

[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.280]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.380]
Sarah Palin 168.

[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.080]
I like Sarah more now, 32.

[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.680]
And Joe Biden is a blathering at you, only 14.

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.300]
14 right-wing elunatics like Edward Sniske or whatever's name is that keeps eating,

[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.980]
emailing me.

[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.100]
I sent him a couple of emails back.

[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.860]
Don't ask me why.

[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.060]
I guess I was bored at the time.

[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:45.680]
Must have been.

[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.960]
Just scathing.

[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.560]
Do us all a favor and retire and get off the air.

[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.660]
And obviously, listen every minute of every day whether I'm on or you're on you.

[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.240]
Hey, Ed, get yourself a hobby.

[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.160]
Clarence is on now and you can listen to Rush and Sean Hannity and Tom,

[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.200]
the Schmidt-Mistor and all the other right-wing propaganda.

[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.400]
I've just never understood people who'd listen to somebody that they hate like poison

[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.060]
and just want to bat, bat, bat, like that.

[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.160]
Because they're mean, mean-spirited right-wing A-holes.

[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.920]
Speaking of idiots, G. Goldbard in New Orleans again,

[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.060]
chronic question mark?

[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.620]
I listen every day for over 20 years and call the show twice and all that time.

[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.500]
And none in the last five or six years.

[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.360]
Thanks.

[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.400]
You switched the email for three weeks and seemed to be a little short on them.

[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.380]
So I send you a few over these several weeks.

[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.080]
A few dozen.

[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.400]
A few my ass.

[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.800]
Mainly to support your choice.

[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.680]
What do you do?

[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.120]
You curse me out and salt me, call me a chronic.

[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.740]
Use my last name on here, which you never do for anybody else.

[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.000]
And totally put me down.

[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.860]
Does this make any sense?

[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.820]
Let me tell you.

[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.520]
Absolutely.

[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:50.860]
Yes.

[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.820]
His last series of emails were all whining about the archives.

[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.680]
Man, man, the last hour's net, man, and you're totally incompetent.

[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:06.380]
Yeah, why don't you guys do something like, man, anyway, even emailing Eric whining about it.

[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:06.860]
Remember that?

[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:07.740]
Yep.

[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:17.400]
I guess what set you off was the request to get the archives back up to speed, which is the only way I get to listen anyway after all these years.

[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.300]
I understand your weird brain pretty well and read it off to entertainment.

[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.220]
At least you usually will realize when you've made mistakes in the past and are picking up to apologize.

[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.400]
The true rear quality.

[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.060]
The best or worst example is with Keith Oberman.

[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.040]
But what am I going to apologize for?

[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.980]
I'm going to apologize to this chronic idiot.

[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.480]
He's been listening for over 20 years.

[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.140]
Congratulations.

[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.460]
We'll send you a medal.

[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.320]
Okay, to New Orleans.

[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.300]
And by the way, a perfect place for you to be.

[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.860]
Keith Oberman, I stopped listening to him when you wrote him off and insulted him after the I'm a severe.

[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.100]
He stopped because I had some criticisms of him.

[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.520]
Therefore, he stopped listening to him.

[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.340]
I mean, you talk about a guy with no brain in his own.

[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.140]
If I told you to go to the Bayou right now and jump into the water and drown, would you do it?

[00:10:59.500 --> 00:10:59.940]
Oh, please.

[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.860]
That was a shame because I missed so many of his great shows.

[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.780]
I believed you when you called him an A-hole, etc.

[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.060]
After you reversed yourself, 100% of him also started to watch again.

[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.200]
He is amazing and wonderful.

[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.780]
Neil, you owe me an apology.

[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.500]
I'm not chronic and we'll never write you another email.

[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.440]
Oh, please.

[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.840]
Oh, hallelujah.

[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.840]
Oh, happy day.

[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.060]
You an Edward Snisky.

[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.760]
I'm always remain a devoted fan no matter what.

[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.780]
I just hope you see the light.

[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.940]
There's no light to see.

[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.540]
You're chronic.

[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.240]
You're out of control.

[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.180]
You're a whiner.

[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.060]
As if Georgia, I have some ability to do something with it.

[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.640]
I'm streaming for the archives.

[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.320]
There you go.

[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.220]
We have nothing to do with it.

[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.740]
You can just hope you're streaming.

[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.220]
I understand.

[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.280]
I was only trying to be supportive sending emails these last few weeks.

[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.700]
You might not read this on the air and I really don't care.

[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.720]
Keep up the good work.

[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.400]
Happy New Year.

[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.060]
Gigi's still alive in New Orleans.

[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.820]
Oh, go away already.

[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.380]
You see what a bastard you are, man?

[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.020]
Yeah.

[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.200]
Ask these people to email.

[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.260]
Say something.

[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.380]
Don't keep complaining and whining.

[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.300]
They'll understand.

[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.600]
Let's take a lot of people that is saying something.

[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.520]
There's nothing in there.

[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.160]
There is nothing in the email.

[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.840]
No items in this view.

[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.940]
How do you like that?

[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.080]
Here I've been sitting, ranting and raving for 11 minutes.

[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.040]
We've got 541 votes on the new poll.

[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:12.380]
The 553.

[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.060]
What's Chris's goal today?

[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.060]
The Dow is down 315, by the way.

[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.580]
It's not good.

[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.820]
Especially if it's 650.

[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.080]
Well, don't let me forget to tell about my dinner with Hank Saturday.

[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:23.880]
650.

[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.580]
What are you talking about?

[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.560]
I wish to get it.

[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.280]
No wonder the beast hates you like poison.

[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.740]
It wants to get your fat ass fired.

[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.680]
There's a lot of fat producers, you know?

[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.820]
That's what I hear.

[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.620]
That beast.

[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.320]
You know what this station loves the best?

[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.020]
Little troublemakers who waddle around.

[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.080]
A little Robert Gieber.

[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.700]
There's another one.

[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.600]
Little backstabbing troublemakers like the beast.

[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.720]
Don't you mess with our boardop beast?

[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.700]
You little turd.

[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.520]
You fat little waddling turd.

[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:51.660]
God.

[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.580]
Oh, there's Hank is on CNN.

What's your take on the OJ Simpson conviction?

[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.040]
Well, I can sum it up with a sound.

[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:01.880]
Oh, yeah.

[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.220]
Great.

[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.680]
Better late than never 399.

[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.240]
I don't care 103.

[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.140]
OJ got screwed 40.

[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.820]
I've actually that screw-and, voted 40 times.

[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.280]
And who's OJ?

[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.320]
11.

[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.320]
Oh, I got to do a stunt.

[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:19.620]
Oop.

[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:20.520]
What?

[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.160]
Well, I caught a third midstream.

[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.480]
You ever catch it midstream?

[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.260]
Just this morning.

[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.060]

There's a malfunction at the junk in my outer looker's press.

[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:57.560]
Really though.

[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.840]
Yeah, there was something screwed up on there, but bull.

[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:00.720]
You visited?

[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.340]
There are a few.

[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.260]
There's a couple.

[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:02.740]
Did you visit?

[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:03.840]
Nothing good though.

[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.240]
Oh.

[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.920]
Here's one from Sam, who's all been out of shape.

[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.500]
Your football knowledge is slipping.

[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.940]
Another lucky one for us, huh?

[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:17.340]
If you're so knowledgeable about football, then tell us who will win the Super Bowl as opposed to the 30 other teams who won't win.

[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:17.980]
Wrong again.

[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.800]
You're getting senile, it's the same.

[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.860]
I'm senile.

[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.760]
What did I say?

[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.460]
I said the dolphins won yesterday and we're talking Super Bowl, man.

[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.180]
We can smell it.

[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:26.700]
Hmm.

[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.720]
We're talking Super Bowl, because where the...

[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.500]
Yeah, I remember that one year, a hundred years ago when Tony Cigarette was on there.

[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.240]
Pretending to be the news guy.

[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.780]
There's nothing worse than a sports guy.

[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.640]
Pretending to be a news guy, you know what I mean?

[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.600]
I think that's back when he was still a sports nerd.

[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.120]
And it was one of those years when he started.

[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.980]
They won the first three or four games and, oh, we're talking Super Bowl.

[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.000]
That was the segment, the special segment.

[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.200]
We're talking Super Bowl.

[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.480]
Yeah, you're smelling Super Bowl is what you're smelling, Tony.

[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.580]
You're smelling it.

[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.900]
Hey, Neil, I thought you might like this.

[00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.620]
You're tied.

[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.500]
I'm writing to say you would tell you about an excellent product.

[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.160]
Oh, hefty bag, people still.

[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.800]
Jim and Kendall, thanks Jim, but no thanks.

[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.040]
Here's somebody having a Monday...

[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.960]
Yesterday, my grandmother got the right wing propaganda.

[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.400]
DVD obsession.

[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.900]
I got it and broke it in half.

[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.140]
I'm in a Howard Field mood.

[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:21.960]
Can't wait for November 4th.

[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.620]
PS, family, a guy, episode of Surfing Bird, is really funny.

[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.900]
Reminded me of your show since you updated this.

[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.700]
Since you played it live.

[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.740]
Oh, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:31.800]
Okay?

[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.820]
And here's the Manhattan Institute Daily Update.

[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.720]
That piece of crap.

[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.960]
We get so much swill on that email.

[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.560]
But you know what?

[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.920]
Delete, delete, no problem.

[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.760]
I'll see if this one was worth reading.

[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.520]
Oh, yes, same again.

[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.420]
It printed out twice.

[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.900]
Your football knowledge is slipping your scene up.

[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.440]
And that's the important parameter of what your mind is sharp.

[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.820]
Is what you have great football knowledge, right?

[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.800]
That's the important stuff.

[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.180]
Witting a ball game.

[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.880]
How about those hurricanes, huh?

[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.060]
Those hurricanes.

[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.840]
Sorry, Donna Shalaley.

[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:00.640]
Hey, Donna.

[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.500]
You're fairing.

[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.560]
Oh, now this is cute.

[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.340]
It's a joke, but it's cute.

[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.880]
I pre-read it.

[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.360]
I screamed it.

[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:09.860]
Good.

[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.960]
A teacher in Elmire, New York, who's a McCain supporter, asked her fourth grade class,

[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.640]
how many of you are McCain fans?

[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.240]
Not really knowing what a McCain fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher.

[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.420]
All the kids raised their hands except for Little Johnny.

[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.580]
The teacher asked Little Johnny why he decided to be different.

[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.960]
Little Johnny said because I'm not a McCain fan.

[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.180]
The teacher asked, why aren't you a McCain fan?

[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.860]
Johnny said because I'm a Democrat.

[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.080]
The teacher asked him why he's a Democrat.

[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.320]
Little Johnny answered, well, my mom's a Democrat.

[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.220]
My dad's a Democrat.

[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.520]
So I'm a Democrat.

[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.520]
Anointed by this, the teacher asked, if your mom was a moron and your dad was an idiot,

[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.440]
what would that make you?

[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.820]
With a big smile, Little Johnny replied, that would make me a McCain fan.

[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:48.900]
Oh!

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:49.980]
Not cute?

[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.400]
Very cute.

[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.040]
Not, you know, not like, oh, not like that, you know, but cute.

[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.580]
So Saturday, well, let's see.

[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.200]
Let's go back to the origin of this.

[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.520]
On Thursday, the Humper was in the building, remember?

[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.420]
Yep.

[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.900]
And I said, the give my, oh, and you told me that he told you that the beast was an idiot

[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.420]
and that clearance was an overgrown child.

[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.400]
Oh, you know, something about he was going to be a woodbine on Saturday to cover the two big races.

[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:17.880]
Yes.

[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.780]
For ESPN, which he was.

[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.780]
And so I said, well, give my cell number and have him call me and we'll have dinner or something.

[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.440]
Two bothers, not a good restaurant in that place.

[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.520]
Oh, that willows.

[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:27.960]
Oh!

[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:28.980]
Fets!

[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.420]
SFG, you know what that means?

[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:31.900]
No.

[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.160]
Strictly for going.

[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.620]
Ah!

[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:34.780]
Are them?

[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.080]
Oh, what a horrible place.

[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.600]
But that's it.

[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.540]
That's the fine dining at woodbine.

[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.540]
So anyway, I got there around 430 and I got lucky too.

[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.480]
I have one, a few bucks.

[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.480]
I'm not going to say how much.

[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.220]
Oh, you're going to pay tax on that.

[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.560]
My told Hank that he just laughed his fat ass off.

[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.320]
Pay tax on it, my ass.

[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.660]
I'll tell you what, I'd like to get a deduction from my gambling losses last four years of woodbine.

[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.240]
How would that be?

[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:00.940]
How does that sound?

[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:01.800]
Okay.

[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.800]
It's delicious to me.

[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.340]
Oh, delightful.

[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.380]
So anyway, I got there 430.

[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.680]
We were having dinner with six and I want a few bucks.

[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.860]
Got lucky then at 530.

[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.180]
I kept the money in my wallet and I went upstairs and watched a couple of races on the TV.

[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.900]
And at six, I went down and just like promised to 10 past six, my cell phone rang and there was another humper.

[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.140]
Unfortunately, it took him like 35 minutes to find the willows.

[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.160]
I guess he got sidetracked.

[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.740]
He said that one of the gates wasn't open.

[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.940]
I was supposed to be in...

[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.240]
There he was.

[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:36.740]
And we gave each other a big hug which for two big fat guys was, oh my god, you could probably feel the earth shake right where you are.

[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.020]
Could you feel it?

[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:40.960]
I'm feeling something.

[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:41.640]
Yeah.

[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.020]
The thunder down under.

[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.520]
And so we had the ebba feather at the willows which really is crap.

[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.100]
Hank didn't have the dessert, by the way.

[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.640]
My tip, my hat to him.

[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.440]
Which I don't think there's any room in there and I'd put it for dessert but nevertheless.

[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:02.280]
I did though. I had my dessert and my blood sugar as a result is sky high plus I found yesterday that Nestle's makes a really awesome heavily hash.

[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.180]
Oh my god.

[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:03.540]
Wow.

[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.440]
That was down 325.

[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:08.640]
360.

[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.740]
360, one.

[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.280]
Let's just... I'll tell you the rest of the show why don't we just do that.

[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.180]
I'll just keep giving the number.

[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.980]
360, two point and a quarter.

[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.300]
We just keep saying lots of numbers.

[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.900]
Yeah, we'll just make some up.

[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.700]
Big O on 2 to 4 and by the way, the hopper, Humphers not sold on that.

[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.900]
He said once a day is one time too many for the big O but twice a day.

[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.340]
He said that's when he knew that this place was really in the tank when the big O was on twice a day.

[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.420]
I bet you the beast likes that though because he's an idiot.

[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.960]
What Chris told me this morning, we're going to have a bloodlating here on a year today.

[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:42.880]
I can just smell it.

[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.680]
Can't you smell it?

[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.660]
It must be that dolphin victory yesterday too.

[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.960]
You're getting a senile.

[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.360]
I'll tell us who will win the Super Bowl.

[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.060]
I'll tell you who won't be.

[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.080]
It won't be the Patriots.

[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.200]
Well, the dolphins.

[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.300]
Or the dolphins.

[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:53.920]
That's right.

[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.880]
Probably the stinkin' giants again.

[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.640]
I don't know what the hell lit a fire under their ass.

[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.800]
Mad Dog 4 to 7.

[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.180]
Dolphins tonight, one of the worst shows in the history of radio is 7 to 8 o'clock with the wooden Kimba Bo camper.

[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.840]
And then 8 o'clock we got the playoff game, the Angels of the Red Sox.

[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.580]
Followed by ESPN radio.

[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.980]
So D.A. gets the night off because we got the playoff baseball.

[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:15.940]
Oh, dodges it.

[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.040]
It comes if necessary tomorrow.

[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.900]
I don't think so.

[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.080]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.220]
Ain't neil ya on the Cubby Bad Wagging yet?

[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.060]
You better hop aboard.

[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:23.560]
Yeah.

[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.060]
Better hop aboard now because it wasn't gonna last for a long.

[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.360]
What a joke.

[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.140]
Sick joke.

[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.380]
Let's see.

[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.020]
Here's Jonathan about yesterday.

[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.620]
I couldn't believe that I was traveling south on university drive, starting around sunrise Boulevard.

[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.980]
On every other corner was this much of religious retards standing out in the rain holding up anti-abortion and Jesus' safe signs.

[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.360]
That's funny because they were here too doing the same thing.

[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.000]
So what else could I do?

[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.980]
I exercised my first amendment right, promptly rolled on my window and called them all crazy people.

[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:53.680]
And you know what else?

[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.940]
George Carlmer was right.

[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.820]
All the women standing there were those who are against abortion.

[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.400]
I won't want to do them in the first place.

[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.360]
Says Jonathan and Boka.

[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.560]
Nice thinking Jonathan.

[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.940]
Speaking of abortion.

[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.480]
And here's a long one here from somebody.

[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.620]
Oh, how are you again?

[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.220]
Just a word of those out there with think Barack Obama doesn't have enough experience to be president.

[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.280]
There's no job experience for being president of the U.S.

[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.100]
Not years in the Senate.

[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.840]
Not being dog catcher of wasilla or governor of a trading post.

[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.540]
You can't practice for that job.

[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.720]
That being said with experience off the table, you have to look at other factors like temperament, wisdom knowledge, vision of the future.

[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.640]
Those of you who've aligned yourself with the past and the recent choices you've made.

[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.840]
John McCain has proven himself to be quick tempered, lacking knowledge of facts, content with the way things are in Iraq,

[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.720]
in bed with lobbyists and most frightening of all, looking at a choose non-qualified running mate.

[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.720]
It's not experience that makes a good president.

[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.440]
It's one who's able to see what needs to be done to bring back to the light.

[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.880]
Bring back into the light.

[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.120]
Thanks, Holly.

[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:52.920]
The guiding light.

[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.580]
That's what we need.

[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.480]
Am I right?

[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:57.360]
Yep.

[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.000]
So you actually did want to debate?

[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.080]
Yeah, most of it.

[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.440]
And?

[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.060]
And he was articulate, though boring, and wouldn't like you said.

[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.600]
And she was creating her notes and she was shaking like a leaf and she was stammering, but she didn't throw up.

[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.000]
And I think that Saturday night life sketched pretty much summed it up.

[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.460]
Mm-hmm.

[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.440]
Did you see that?

[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.060]
Yes.

[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:18.920]
All right.

[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.580]
Can I call you Joe?

[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.060]
Yeah, I can tell a couple of winners.

[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:22.640]
Take that.

[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.720]
You know, there's no logic.

[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.840]
I'm not answering your questions, Clay.

[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.880]
I'm making up my own.

[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:28.780]
Bitch.

[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.540]
The biggest names.

[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.920]
The best talent.

[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.860]
It's the big dog, Joe Rose.

[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.680]
Weekday morning, 7 a.m.

[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.620]
Sports radio 5-6-Q-A-M.

[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.280]
The Sports radio.

[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:41.680]
Oh, God.

[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.880]
Don't use today.

[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.860]
Guguito has his day.

[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.620]
The Terry's gone away.

[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.180]
On a busman's holiday.

[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.300]
Don't use today.

[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.180]
So find another way.

[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.120]
To get you through the day.

[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.900]
Cause you won't see O'Gy.

[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.900]
Why don't they know?

[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.800]
How long it's gonna take?

[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.440]
Now they all know.

[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.320]
And take another break.

[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.200]
They waste our time.

[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.940]
With something to defend.

[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.920]
Just try to die.

[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.820]
And bring it to an end.

[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.460]
No use today.

[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.360]
That's too bad, O'Gy.

[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.280]
He can't defend his rage.

[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.200]
He's locked up in his cage.

[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:24.420]
Good.

[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.420]
Not too soon.

[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.800]
Maybe they'll fry his ass in there, okay?

[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.840]
Maybe, and they've got him isolated too.

[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.580]
Cause they were afraid, I guess,

[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.800]
that some nasty, nasty inmates who don't like murderers

[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.100]
might do some to them.

[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:36.500]
Hmm.

[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.660]
When that be a shame.

[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.680]
So I just get an email from somebody saying,

[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.040]
oh, check out this op-ed piece of New York Times

[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.620]
and it's a link to Marine Douds' call.

[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.760]
That's on our website today.

[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.400]
Yeah, it's on our website.

[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.880]
Well, check it out.

[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.920]
It's just, you know, something, what's the use?

[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.300]
What is the use?

[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.520]
Other than the 10th and the 25th of the month

[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.320]
when those checks come in, what's the use?

[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.380]
You're talking to dodo birds.

[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.120]
Oh, did you see this?

[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.140]
Did you see there was a baton thurse, Daniel?

[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.340]
And you better check your football knowledge,

[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.620]
Mr. Because you're slipping.

[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.340]
You're senile.

[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.280]
Oh, to let you know, Mrs. Sarah Palin

[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.840]
will be in bokeh today says some jackball on here.

[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:24.760]
Another email.

[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.260]
That's it.

[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.360]
The emails are just as bad as the calls now.

[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.760]
There's a dearth of them and their crap.

[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.260]
Although Jerry in New Orleans though, he's right there.

[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.720]
And I owe him an apology.

[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.920]
Pull your breath, Gary.

[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.880]
Take a deep breath.

[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.900]
Wait for that apology.

[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.120]
Head out into the bayou

[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.260]
and take a deep breath and just stand there and wait.

[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:46.980]
Hang on tight.

[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:47.960]
I will activate it.

[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:48.840]
That's right.

[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.940]
OJ is being isolated from other prisoners

[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.580]
for his own safety and focusing on emotion for a new trial

[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.360]
and a strong bit for a pellet reversal

[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.320]
of his conviction for kidnapping and robbery.

[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.460]
His attorney, Yale Yanta Galentis, said yesterday.

[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.760]
Yanta Galentis.

[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.760]
Oh, I knew that they would judge him based on

[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.720]
the two people he murdered or something like that.

[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.800]
Yanta Galentis told the AP he'll continue to pursue request

[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.940]
for Simpson to be released on bond pending appeal.

[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.580]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.720]
He's got such a good track record.

[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.420]
Wouldn't you think that if you murdered two people

[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.500]
and you got acquitted based on a whole bunch of crap

[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.560]
and a bunch of hot shot attorneys got you off?

[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.940]
Wouldn't you think that from that point on,

[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.340]
you'd mind your peas and cues.

[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.800]
Anyone with good sense would.

[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.000]
Anyone with any sense would think they died

[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.240]
to bullet the first time

[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.200]
and they're not going to go do an armed robbery or,

[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.360]
you know, some other slime ball.

[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.500]
But once the slime ball, always a slime ball.

[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.600]
Even though, of course, he's revered within the halls of QAM.

[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.800]
I don't know so much about the present regime reversal.

[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.780]
But I would think so because he wants to wear a jock strap.

[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:52.720]
Give me the ball. Give me the ball. Give me the ball.

[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.040]
You know, anybody like that.

[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.440]
Meanwhile, Galanter said Simpson will be living a lonely life

[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.360]
advised by his lawyers to do no media interviews

[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.040]
and allowed to see only family members

[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.680]
and a few friends placed on a special list at the jail.

[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.680]
He's being held in Clark County Detention Center

[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.140]
to close December 5th sentencing

[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.760]
and then is expected to be transferred to state prison

[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.900]
because of the seriousness of the charges.

[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.320]
It's likely Simpson would remain in jail during his appeal.

[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.580]
He has an isolated custody being protected

[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.360]
from other inmates.

[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.880]
Yantra Galanter said a border plane as he prepared to return

[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.780]
to his Miami office.

[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.740]
Jail has taken very special precautions to make sure

[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.740]
that he is safe.

[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.880]
Yantra Galanter said this will make for a difficult incarceration

[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.680]
for the Grigari Simpson because it limits his contacts

[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.400]
with other humans.

[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.260]
But you know what?

[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.280]
Nicole and Ron, they're not having any contact

[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.140]
with other humans these days and having for 13 years either.

[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.140]
Wasn't it ironic that it was unlucky 13 for OJ?

[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.520]
13 years to the day.

[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.500]
Yantra Galanter said Simpson was okay during a jail

[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.380]
because it's Saturday where they discussed future plans

[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:54.820]
for the case.

[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.680]
He's disappointed in a bit melancholy.

[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.520]
He said, he's a little bit melancholy.

[00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:58.980]
Yeah.

[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.320]
When a doubt don't ever let him out.

[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.480]
That's my take.

[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.540]
Don't let him out.

[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:04.500]
Slime ball.

[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.200]
Scumbucket.

[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.820]
But nevertheless, the doubt is down 421 points

[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.780]
and it's only 1035.

[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.520]
The market's only been open a little over an hour.

[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.160]
Aren't you a fear?

[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.900]
Nothing in the email thing by the way.

[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.420]
Nothing in there.

[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.860]
Neal at Neorodges.com.

[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.860]
They've got nothing to say.

[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.600]
Four weeks from tomorrow is the presidential election.

[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.020]
OJ finally gets convicted.

[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.020]
Goes to the slammer.

[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.760]
The dolphins won a game yesterday.

[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.840]
They've won two in a row.

[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.520]
They're two and two.

[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.900]
And we're smelling super bowl.

[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.620]
We had that big debate on Thursday.

[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.460]
We got the next presidential debate tomorrow night.

[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.160]
Obama and M. Insane McCain.

[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.680]
The doubt is down 421 points

[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.700]
and dropping like a rock from the top of the Empire State Building.

[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.040]
And their mum.

[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.160]
Oh, here's a link to the Syrah to the Marine Dow column

[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.440]
from yesterday's New York Times, the op-ed comp.

[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.100]
What are we going to do?

[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.400]
What are we going to do about life?

[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.460]
So anyway, the Humphor had some interesting stories to tell me about Joe Bell.

[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.600]
And what a piece of turd Joe Bell is, which I already knew that.

[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.380]
And about that incident in the hallway

[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.960]
when Hank was sitting there at that desk

[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.560]
and bitching and moaning and ripping Joe Bell and assing

[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.200]
to come to find out Joe was standing only a few feet behind him,

[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.840]
which we knew that part.

[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.420]
But then evidently Joe approached him

[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.280]
and kind of a hostile,

[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.160]
oh, you want to say that again in my face?

[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:29.980]
Ho-ho-ho!

[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.160]
And Hank said, well, and what if I do?

[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.380]
What are we going to do about it?

[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:36.860]
Maybe I do.

[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:37.540]
Yeah.

[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.660]
And evidently nothing, well, you saw what they did about it.

[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.140]
Because one thing about temperamental Joe Bell

[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.120]
when he get on his bad side and your Jewish, oh my God,

[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.220]
that's 14 strikes against you right there.

[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.720]
That was down 439.

[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.660]
Oh my God!

[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.060]
627 votes on the OJ pool.

[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.520]
What's your take on the OJ conviction?

[00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.500]
Great, better late than never, 458.

[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:00.780]
Say it's great.

[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.940]
Don't care, 112.

[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.060]
How could you not care?

[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.140]
How could you be so indifferent and callous?

[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.600]
And I want to see Justice Dunn.

[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.720]
Who in their right mind wouldn't want to see him in a slimmer

[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.960]
forever and ever and ever and ever?

[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.980]
Well, those people that think he's innocent, you know?

[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.900]
And who are those, who might those people be?

[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.540]
All the people who are on the building here?

[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.480]
In the building here.

[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.620]
OJ got screwed, 45.

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.080]
Oh, those are the ones in the building.

[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.540]
45 lung kids.

[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120]
Oh, but he wore a juxtap.

[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.420]
He was a great running back.

[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.960]
Oh, and he was a great actor too.

[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.800]
And who's OJ 12?

[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.460]
12 comedians.

[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.900]
Who's OJ Myass?

[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.920]
630 votes.

[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.760]
So now, what are you going for?

[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:41.180]
900?

[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:41.980]
Fatso?

[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:42.960]
Yes, that sounds good.

[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.000]
Well, we got a lot of fat producers.

[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.100]
You know, we got the beast.

[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:46.700]
We got Zach.

[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.120]
We got Chris, at least temporarily, until beast gets him fired.

[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.800]
If we had a couple more producers, I wouldn't have to work Sunday.

[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.600]
If we had a couple more, if we had one more producer,

[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.660]
you could do this show every day instead of having to take off Friday

[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.440]
so that you can work on Sunday to fill in that wall of football.

[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.200]
Swill?

[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.920]
That's where we stand on the Totem Pull in this radio station on the bottom.

[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.520]
On the bottom.

[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.420]
Even our fat producer has to go do some crap on Friday so that they can't be attending the show.

[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.600]
Of course, if you had a pair, when you have that meeting after the show today,

[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.900]
you should put your foot down.

[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.040]
Put your pants down.

[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.780]
Take a big smelly dump right on clearance's desk.

[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.440]
And say, you want a lot more of that because that's what you're going to get if I have to work on Sunday.

[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.360]
And can't work on Friday on the world famous Neo-Rodger show.

[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.200]
That's what you should do.

[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.120]
Get any balls.

[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.020]
But you don't.

[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.980]
So you'll go in there.

[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.780]
Yes, or yes, or yes, master.

[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.440]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.160]
That's what you'll do.

[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.580]
No, you're going to get the beast fired.

[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.080]
I don't plan to get on fired.

[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:48.960]
I'm just going to tell you.

[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.040]
You couldn't get the beast fired if you held a gun to clearance's head.

[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.660]
If you stuck your foot up his ass and put a gun to his head, you couldn't get the beast fired.

[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.180]
Those two are tighter than a sneered drum.

[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.480]
I'm just going to recount.

[00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.840]
I don't know if the beast wide-houses.

[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.200]
Those two are still doing hanky, spanky, man.

[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.720]
You can bet your life on that.

[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.320]
Even George knows that.

[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.060]
Yeah.

[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.780]
No items in this view.

[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.640]
I told you that this thing would run its course, and that would be the end of it.

[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:18.760]
And I was right.

[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:19.780]
Oh, well.

[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.960]
I get nothing back to the phones.

[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.240]
Oh, what a sense of humor.

[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.320]
What biggest name?

[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:30.460]
The best house.

[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.740]
You don't have Neo-Rodger.

[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.100]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.940]
The fourth leader.

[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.520]
The biggest name.

[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:38.980]
The best talent.

[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.840]
It's the mad dog Jim Mandage.

[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:41.480]
After you.

[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.280]
Sport A7.

[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.440]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.780]
The sports leader.

[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:47.720]
You're God.

[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.800]
Can't you wipe any run?

[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.400]
Yes.

[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.700]
Let the mayor in bits and pieces.

[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.320]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.000]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000]

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000]

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000]

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000]

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000]

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000]

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.000]

[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:26.840]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.180]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.000]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.020]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.040]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.040]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.040]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.040]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.040]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.040]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.040]

[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.040]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:51.160]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.560]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.660]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.780]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.700]
The trial is moving on.

[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.160]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.920]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.000]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.000]

[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.000]

[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.000]

[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.000]

[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.420]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.100]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.080]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.340]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.100]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:23.600]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.140]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:26.680]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:26.940]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.820]
The trial is moving on.

[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:28.940]

[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:28.940]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.120]

[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.820]
Now the evidence you can hide.

[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.420]
Traces of blood everywhere.

[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.300]
That match your DNA.

[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.620]
Traces of blood.

[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.400]
That's yours, oh, Joe.

[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.340]
Well, take a few of that market, man.

[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.500]
And that was down 542 points.

[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.100]
The Toronto Stock Exchange is down 1185 points.

[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.260]
Do you have a hair-searcher thing in your life?

[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:01.940]
Not lately.

[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:02.900]
Woo!

[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.160]
I'm going to just sit here and sit and do in the show.

[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.280]
I'm going to sit here and watch the tops of the buildings outside.

[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.900]
And start waiting for people to jump.

[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.300]
I don't think it's going to be too long.

[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.260]
You're going to be jumping.

[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.620]
And I'll enjoy either.

[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.300]
That's my advice to all the losers out there.

[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.480]
Go to the tallest building you find, go to the roof, and just take a leap.

[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.560]
Take a dump.

[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.960]
Oh, here's an email.

[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:26.460]
Wow.

[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:33.880]
From Jim, it says, well, the Brentwood slasher has just had justice served.

[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:39.220]
I have a suspicion that Fred Goldman set the whole thing up, including the recordings of the robbery.

[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:47.220]
Now, Fred Goldman can come out with a book titled, If I Did Said, OJ Up, This Is How I Did It.

[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.460]
I'm putting the over-under on prison time Simpson has it 42 months.

[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.540]
Neil, where are you putting your money?

[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.060]
I'm putting my money on woodbind, baby.

[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.380]
And you know something?

[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.420]
See, I've told you for years that I learned the hard way.

[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.120]
The stock market is gambling without the entertainment.

[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.700]
You can go to the racetrack, you go to the casino.

[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.160]
At least, you're probably going to lose your ass, but at least you have a little entertainment.

[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.480]
You have a little something.

[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.420]
Something, something.

[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:20.360]
But with the market, you just give it to some broker, some con artist, some phony baloney.

[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:25.600]
And, oh, this stuff comes back so fast, just as tight, and they've got all the cliches, you know.

[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.560]
The old economy against the new economy and yada yada yada, all this other garbage.

[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.740]
And you watch your sit back and you helplessly and hopelessly watch your money disappear.

[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.420]
You watch it vanish.

[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.360]
Am I right?

[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.000]
Yeah.

[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.620]
Yes. I've told you.

[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.240]
Absolutely.

[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.600]
That guy, that S&P guy, I wonder how he's doing that one I used to call everybody.

[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.280]
Oh, the S&P is up near.

[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.040]
You're wrong. The markets where it's at near the S&P.

[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.040]
The S&P is in the toilet, sir.

[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.120]
Let me tell you right now, sir.

[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.520]
I hope you lose every dime that you ever stole.

[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.820]
You low life slimeball you.

[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.540]
You're talking about that guy, that guy.

[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.940]
Oh, that was making a little bit of a comeback.

[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.440]
Now it's down only 507.

[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.520]
507, and it's under 10,000 for the first time in four years.

[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.880]
513, 509, as panic is setting in.

[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.720]
All around the world, people are like, oh, it's all be scared.

[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.660]
That guy is falling.

[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.880]
Did you see 60 minutes last night?

[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:28.380]
No.

[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:35.380]
That guy talking about a beep, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep about all these toxic mortgages, all his toxic swill.

[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:35.960]
Yeah.

[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.420]
The whole thing is toxic if you ask me.

[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.940]
Just like the food at Willow's at the food line.

[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.100]
I'm sorry, Hank. I apologize.

[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.160]
I told him I wish, you know, if I had a little bit more notice, or if he would have had more time,

[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.860]
I'd have brought him, you know, we'd have taken a cab, come and do a roof crisp.

[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.320]
Or I could have driven him into town.

[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.840]
I had my beautiful Corvette there, and I couldn't drive into his hotel because I don't know that area out by the airport.

[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.000]
I know two things here.

[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.180]
I know downtown pretty good.

[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.420]
And I know how to get from my place to Woodbine and from Woodbine to my place.

[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:07.920]
And that's it.

[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.600]
What else do you need?

[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:10.800]
That's right.

[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.560]
Unfortunately, you know how to go to the store where the ice cream is.

[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:15.560]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.040]
No speaking English there, though.

[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:17.960]
No speaking English.

[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.420]
That's right, he's lady.

[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.780]
No speaking English to that.

[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:21.440]
Huh?

[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.500]
I'm sure you're used to that.

[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.380]
Oh, I don't care.

[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.220]
Oh, yeah, being from South Florida.

[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.660]
No speaking English.

[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.240]
654 votes on the pool.

[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:32.960]
I don't know.

[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.500]
I mean, I feel sorry for people who are going to lose a lot of money in this whole scam here.

[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.100]
But to what it goes, I've told you for a long time, nobody will listen to me.

[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.460]
I learned the hard way.

[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.000]
Believe me.

[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:43.840]
Here's an email.

[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.040]
Stop being so negative and be a little more happier.

[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:51.180]
It says, stopping so negative and be a little more happier.

[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.280]
How about being less illiterate?

[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.280]
Vasty is the name VSTY.

[00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.980]
What kind of a name is that?

[00:39:59.140 --> 00:39:59.600]
Don't know.

[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.320]
Never stop being so negative and be a little more happier.

[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.640]
What am I being negative about?

[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.460]
The fact that the dollar's down 500.

[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:07.360]
Oh, it's only down 4.95 now.

[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.200]
Thank God.

[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.000]
It's making a little bit of a comeback.

[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.640]
You believe it?

[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.300]
No.

[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:12.520]

[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.300]
Stop being so negative.

[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.160]
I'm just making it up.

[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:15.660]
Vasty.

[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.400]
You idiot.

[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.380]
You simple to knew.

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.000]
I'm pleased as punch Patriots won yesterday.

[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.440]
The dolphins as squeak by a girls team.

[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.540]
Now Sandi, it was supposedly pretty good.

[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.140]
They were in the playoffs last year.

[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.640]
Let's give credit where credit is due.

[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.680]
They got a good looking quarterback.

[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.920]
But I'm running back.

[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:35.740]
What?

[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:36.600]
Good running back.

[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.540]
Yeah, oh, one of the greatest.

[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:38.860]
Yep.

[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.380]
Dolphins stuffed him and they shut him down.

[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.960]
Or smell and super bull.

[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.520]
No.

[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.260]
Yeah, it's really funny that they had a scramble around at the last minute to get those tickets sold.

[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:56.000]
And they were in the playoffs.

[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.800]

[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:56.280]
No? Can I call you Joe? And it went over like a pregnant pole vibrates at the equator in the middle of July There's a couple of emails look at this stock market.

[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.440]
High-neil stock investments do not vanish, countless thousands of people will be happy

[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.860]
to know that a select group of individuals have new mansions, yachts, private jets, luxury

[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:12.380]
sky boxes, etc. because of these, because of their tireless sacrifices as Greg and Melbourne.

[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.640]
What does that mean?

[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.900]
I don't know, I sense a note of sarcasm there.

[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:19.600]
Yeah.

[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.960]
Well, this is a guy who's stuck in Melbourne, what do you expect?

[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.600]
He's sour.

[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.820]
Went to Ard Rock, Casino Saturday, Blackjack table started at 15 bucks, played a few hands,

[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:33.660]
made my contribution, leading next to me was hitting on 17 and went to Wheel of Fortune

[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.500]
when I ate 100.

[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.820]
Great Joe Neal, Cistoni, when 800 at Wheel of Fortune.

[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.100]
I had 400 on the line at Wheel of Fortune on Saturday while waiting for the Humper.

[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.360]
I just got the right machine, man.

[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.880]
Played about five minutes, there was 400 on the line.

[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.540]
I got the ticket out of there and ran to the upstairs to watch the race.

[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.020]
To watch Frankie Dittourig get lost in the big $2 million race.

[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.020]
He won the other race.

[00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.420]
Frankie got lost.

[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.640]
They got to send a search party out there still looking for him now.

[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.520]
Oh, and here's one with a billboard from a long time listener who's got nothing to say,

[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.840]
but sends me a cutesy couple of pictures here.

[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.980]
Oh, and now there's a bunch of emails just came in there.

[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:17.440]
Aren't you excited?

[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:18.440]
It's thrilled.

[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.300]
Maybe some of them might be worth reading after they have race.

[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.360]
What the fuck?

[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:23.600]
Don't be too sure.

[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.900]

[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:45.660]

[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:45.660]

[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.420]
Fourth.

[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:46.820]

[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:47.240]
Fourth.

[00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:48.620]

[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:56.820]
Fourth.

[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:56.820]

[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:56.820]

[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.560]
I'm statementいうことe cornerers.

[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:05.800]
Of course.

[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:06.220]

[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:11.080]
I'm cutting commands because I'm a big dog Hitler.

[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:17.760]
I'm obsessed on buying from this count of stores

[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.080]
And I don't know if I'll get through it

[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.200]
Oh no, I've spent too much

[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.820]
I bounced by check this month

[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.400]
There goes my credit rating

[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.080]
I thought I had more in my savings

[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.360]
I'm dying on the hair

[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.200]
I'll take you out to lunch

[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.620]
And you buy

[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.560]
It's the softy kind of me

[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.980]
It's the softy kind of me

[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.080]
I'm saving nickels and corners

[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:11.580]
I'm cutting coupons because I'm a victim of recession

[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.680]
Wow, you're something you were right

[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.520]
You were absolutely correct

[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.700]
I hate to say that because you're very seldom right

[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.240]
You were right, the emails are the same bunch of

[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.580]
Or maybe just a different bunch of losers

[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.040]
It's the phone, it's the same people

[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.680]
Over and over and over again

[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.380]
You're right

[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.960]
Because the masses wouldn't make the effort

[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.880]
You know, the average is your win gene

[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.460]
If they were going to call, they're not going to write

[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.300]
And vice versa, you know, it's same principle applies

[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.100]
It requires a little bit of effort, not a lot

[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:42.520]
Correct

[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.920]
Unctions quizzling, just go the hell away already

[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.520]
Okay, just go away

[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.480]
Unctions quizzling

[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.520]
Who says, by the way, I'll read one of them

[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.300]
And this will be the last one

[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.280]
I drove by the new Epic here in Sydney

[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.560]
I was it looks pretty nice, it's about ready to open

[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.000]
They already have some food on the shelves, it looks pretty nice

[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.740]
You think we should boycott them for destroying all those dillies

[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.720]
They bought wolfies, corkies, etc

[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.680]
No, I don't think you ought to boycott anybody

[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.980]
Schmuck, all in your case do them a favor and you have boycott them

[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.020]
Stay the hell away

[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.340]
Also, you think we should be concerned that often is offense

[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.880]
We shut out in the second half yesterday

[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.420]
Oh my god, is this a puss or a what?

[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:21.980]
Absolutely

[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.720]
Jesus

[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.580]
We won the game but we got shut out in the second half

[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.060]
Waaaaah, waaaaah, waaaaah, waaaaah

[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.240]
The sound is outlawed a baby

[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.260]
Waaaaah

[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.560]
People driving north on this game boulevard near the Adrienne Arched Center

[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.000]
Were forced to turn around this morning

[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.060]
Because of a collision on northeast 14th street involving a police car

[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:51.220]
A woman driving a white Nissan center was rushed to Jackson soon after 9 o'clock this morning

[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.260]
The entire front of her car was crushed

[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.400]
The Miami Police Officer who heard her right leg in the crash was transported by a data fire rescue cedars

[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.220]
The cedars medical center soon thereafter

[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.000]
Although her police car received minimal damage on the front of its right side

[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.600]
The officer was visibly hurt and needed help from fellow officers to sit down

[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.900]
Maybe she heard her ass

[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.920]
Let them or something

[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:17.220]
And a driver was injured this morning when a car side swept the copper kettle restaurant in Fort Lauderdale

[00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:17.840]
Hmm

[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.740]
I wonder how old this bag must have been

[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.620]
Doesn't say

[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:28.140]
Police said a woman was driving a green Nissan south in the 1600 block of south and resamino about 930 this morning

[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:34.880]
When she went over the curb and took out several parking meters and two newspaper racks before plowing into a brick wall around the restaurant

[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.100]
The driver was injured in the crash, thank god

[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:42.480]
Charles Kirkhiles owner of Copper Kettle City was inside the Adrienne time of the crash and heard a big boom

[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.200]
She must have been going fast, he said

[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.500]
And guess who wrote this article in the herald Adam H. Beasley

[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:50.440]
Hmm

[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.320]
So Hank said that he had a meeting a sit down lunch with the Joe Bell recently

[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:56.360]
Okay

[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.380]
And you know what Joe said?

[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:00.800]
Um, but a boot, but a beep?

[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.400]
That's it, exactly, boy, you're hot today

[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.220]
But a beep, but a boot, but about like that nothing

[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:10.460]
He didn't say anything, well I'm sorry things ended the way they did, but a boot, but a beep, you fagged you or something like that

[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.200]
You know

[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.500]
Hank seemed pretty happy though

[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:20.400]
He's traveling all over the country, he's got tough assignments, he's going out into Vegas and out to the Delmar racetrack all over the place

[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.940]
He looked a little chubby, but never left

[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.020]
I mean, what are you gonna say? You know?

[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.280]
Hi, how you doing?

[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.720]
No, we had a good time, you know, it was great to see him

[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.420]
We said that and good to see you

[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.200]
I did say that, but I'm talking about the weight situation, what are you gonna say to something?

[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.520]
We've been through this

[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.500]
You can't, yeah, you can't, there's nothing you can say

[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.480]
He didn't have the dessert, I did, I had the dessert

[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.720]
He said I'm gonna miss you

[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.160]
And he said, don't those Xavier Locke and Cop, I said yeah

[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.160]
Oh, he didn't say that, he was probably thinking that

[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:56.520]
No, I guess it was kind of tacking me to any dessert in front of him

[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:02.200]
I said, I said, is it okay if I get the, because it's the only edible part of the meal at Willow's

[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.580]
The buffet is the dessert dessert

[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.160]
The dessert dessert is great

[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.540]
The Dow is down 444, it settled down to a nice, even number there

[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:13.940]
444 as opposed to like almost 600 earlier

[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.340]
It's making a little bit of a comeback, anybody believe that?

[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:16.500]
No

[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.380]
Come on

[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:22.540]
Like that one, an email said, come on, be positive, don't be so negative, need to be positive

[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:26.420]
We're smelling super bowl cause we're the, yeah, like that, like that means something

[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.260]
Like ball games are that important

[00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:35.000]
See, this is the thing that the National Football League is done much, much better than any other sport

[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:41.820]
They've made it seem that what goes on with their games is like really life and death really important

[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.960]
Not just, you know, fairly important but really, really important

[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.500]
You mean it is

[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:48.480]
With the dramatic music, you mean it's not?

[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:49.560]
No

[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.000]
It doesn't amount to a pile of swill

[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.480]
See, I'm saying that in any year when I know the Patriots are gonna suck so it's easy to say that

[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.120]
But I'll tell you one thing

[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.300]
That match, you're looking pretty good to me yesterday

[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.660]
Hey, they've got a chance in the AFC East

[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.040]
Cause it sucks, yup, the jet suck

[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.980]
The bills, boy, we thought the bills were going off to, they got pounded yesterday by Arizona

[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:17.460]
And they didn't have their, uh, and Juan Bolton has the other receiver

[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:18.640]
What?

[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.540]
Arizona only had one of their main receivers, dude

[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.300]
There we go, there we go, I wanna hear it

[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.120]
I didn't think I had it

[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.340]
Oh yeah, I think I did

[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:35.360]
The gladiator music baby, it's important, it's like the end of the world

[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.640]
Market is crashing the election four weeks away but who cares?

[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.320]
It's the national football league baby radiator

[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.780]
You bet he was

[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:45.380]
Now why didn't you put that on me?

[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:46.300]
What?

[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.880]
Whatever he just said

[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.580]
Gladiator?

[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.300]
Yeah

[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.380]
Cause you said gladiator

[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:51.800]
You can't say that

[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.760]
Gladiator

[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.460]
No

[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:58.120]
Choice, call up Joyce and see if you can say that

[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.140]
Oh hey, call up Joyce and Mel Gibson

[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.180]
She only knows what word

[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.180]
No, no

[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:03.860]
No

[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:04.920]
Shrewd bitch

[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.640]
And by the way, Hank hates it too Joyce, although yeah, I guess she didn't really interfere with his show

[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:15.740]
423 and there's that bald-headed queen Ali Veltching, felching there on CNN

[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.340]
In your salary

[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:18.940]
Half of the world, probably plays it

[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.560]
Now who now's gonna listen to him for financial advice?

[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.900]
My God, could anybody take that thing seriously?

[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:26.860]
Egghead

[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.960]
Anybody needing egg time or just turned on CNN and they got that Ali Veltching on it

[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.360]
And they were probably a rookie tiki sances on there too to make everybody calm down

[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.800]
But you know doing his melodramatic swill

[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.860]
Here's one from Cliff and Kendall who's also chronic but at least usually says something

[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.620]
I'm you're right though about the emails, I'm a fool

[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.640]
I thought this was an open up for different reasons, yeah, huh?

[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.180]
For different reasons but yeah

[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.480]
I'm telling you I'm smelling you right now man

[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.820]
You, you, oh here's a couple on there

[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.780]
Lenny about the Humper

[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.480]
It says you're the best I'm here in plantation

[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.820]
Tell how you almost took a job here

[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.000]
Oh and fill it off here I thought it said plantation

[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:14.360]
Tell how you almost took a job

[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.800]
That's a old story I did take the job and I never went there

[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.040]
Because Dick Casper talked me out of going to Philly

[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.220]
That was a life changing moment it was bad

[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.680]
That would be a good poll to take

[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.860]
That's 100 years ago that was in 1980

[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:33.580]
When I left Miami to go to WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee to join my GM Dick Casper

[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.100]
I was on at nights and we all brother

[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.900]
What a signal they got at night WLAC

[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.700]
And I was ready to come back to Miami to WS News

[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.960]
And Dali Banks called me from Philly

[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:48.920]
She had tried to hire me a couple of other times I'd gone to lunch with that crazy old bitch

[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.540]
And she owned WWDB, the wonderful world of Dali Banks

[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.920]
FM talking Philadelphia

[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.760]
Ooh and she hired me

[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.680]
And so I called the moving company

[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.540]
I had all my stuff getting ready to move to Philadelphia

[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.240]
In fact I think it did go to Philadelphia

[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.200]
And then I had a colon and bring it back to Miami

[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.420]
And I went into say goodbye to Dick Casper

[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.940]
That was the turning point of my career and my life that day

[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.720]
When I tried to be in I Scott

[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.100]
Because Dick Casper was great to me he was like you know

[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.100]
The best GM I ever worked for

[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:22.860]
A real manch

[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.360]
You mentioned

[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:24.900]
Yeah he was great guy

[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.380]
And a big fan of mine

[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.600]
And he talked me into he's oh no you don't want to go to Philly

[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.240]
You want to go back to you know your king of the hill in Miami

[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:36.440]
When you rather work with Jerry Williams and Alice Rantell and Mr. Ego

[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.420]
And that's one of the missions

[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.920]
And he talked me into it he was a great salesman

[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.700]
Next poll it says

[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.280]
McCain or Obama

[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.080]
Oh yeah

[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.120]
Next poll my ass

[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.160]
I'll go get the law

[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.900]
Even though I'm consecutive weeks

[00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:00.720]
I'll be separated by the buy they have beaten the participants in last year's AFC championship

[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.580]
Somebody nobody expected them to do they are still in the last place in their division

[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.960]
The bills are

[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.820]
Four and one the Patriots are three and one

[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:18.140]
The jets are two and two and the dolphins are two and two and having lost to the jets

[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.100]
That means they're in last place in the division

[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:24.800]
And it says when Sarah asked can I call you Joe Biden should have said

[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.940]
You can call me Mr. Vice President

[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:29.460]
That's excellent I told you these emails are good

[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.740]
Rodney says McCain must be ready to kill himself

[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:41.380]
A hockey mom this morning why see his desperately trying to take our eyes off the ball with ears right and resco

[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:45.660]
But thanks to good old thou industrials he's farting like an into a windstorm

[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:50.500]
Thank God I lost all my money on hookers and hallucinogens and not the market

[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:54.300]
Go bomb us is Rodney nice gone Rodney good choice at least he had a good time

[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.720]
Right right screw the Dow screw the NASDAQ

[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.960]
Oh look at that less than 400 now it's not only 397 387 it's making a big comeback

[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.100]
Anybody believe it?

[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.440]
It is 46.

[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:10.380]

[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.140]
4th leader

[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.920]
So are you late?

[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.180]
Just that talent

[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:17.580]
Are you sure Joe?

[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.260]
Wake night for me to I'm a hero

[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:20.200]
4th dog

[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.640]
5.62 am

[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.340]
The sports leader

[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:29.300]
You and me white as you see me

[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:33.360]
I love you yeah yeah yeah yeah

[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:37.260]
We love you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:42.040]
We love you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.140]
You failed

[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.640]
Thank you lost your gloves

[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.680]
And here's what we have to say yeah

[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.660]
We analyze some blood

[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.820]
And it matches your DNA

[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.360]
And so we love you

[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.940]
With the pair we thought you had

[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:06.540]
Yes we love you

[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:10.480]
But the fit was really bad

[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.360]
It makes you difficult

[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.160]
But we never found the nine eyes

[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.960]
We need more proof to show

[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.940]
That you murdered your ex-wife

[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:27.840]
And so we'll love you

[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:31.560]
Because we brought up brand new friends

[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.080]
Yes we'll love you

[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:38.600]
Take your fingers right in there

[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.620]
Let them go

[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:44.880]
We love you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.960]
We love you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.640]
And when some gloves like that

[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.340]
We know you did something bad

[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.940]
And with some gloves like that

[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:59.560]
We know you did something bad

[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.000]
And when some gloves like that

[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.760]
We know you did something bad

[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.960]
Then bye

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.720]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.380]
You failed

[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.700]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, thank God. Thank the Lord that did the TS X is down

[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:27.660]
667 hours down almost 1200 points before and the Dow is down only a 401, 40 something.

[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:33.220]
Aren't you relieved? What? The one that I like that bottom was falling out there, the

[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:38.860]
first that first hour man. Looks like a whole bottom of the market was just collapsing.

[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.500]
You got any stock? How about you, Chris, with the money you're making, I bet you're

[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:48.240]
heavily invested. Oh, totally invested. I am? No, but I do have some stock. I got a 401,

[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.040]
can you do you really? Yes, stock. The 401K funds are fully protected. Don't worry about

[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.760]
that. It's separate investments. It's got nothing to do with this. Okay, your 401K is

[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:04.580]
okay. That's what this bitch on CNN is just saying. He said, don't worry. 403B. Now that's

[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:09.640]
another story. Don't have that backup. So that's the differences between the two. That's

[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:15.040]
what you need to know. A lot of fear out there about 403B is very similar to 401K is you

[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.200]
really don't have to worry, but there is that one critical difference. Okay, the last

[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:22.460]
thing, let's go back to 401Ks for a second. People, I like we talked about, you know,

[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:26.060]
they're safe that money is yours but still you can incur some losses here. So how do

[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:30.420]
you, I guess, make it less vulnerable to some of those losses? Well, you know, the Dow's

[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:35.500]
down dramatically this year. Similarly, people's 401K assets have been devastated and sadly,

[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.580]
there's no insurance against this investment loss as I was saying. That's what makes diversity,

[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:46.060]
asset allocation more important than ever. Look at Morningstarth.com to get a sense of

[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.140]
where you're portfolio. Yeah, we're spread it around and take it out on the street corner

[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.680]
and smear it around with a, what do they call a troll? And now what they call that thing

[01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:03.180]
that you, you smear a cement with? A troll. What I call a troll? A troll. A troll. A

[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:07.720]
troll. You better start learning to speak trailer trash if Sarah gets in there. You don't

[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:13.000]
throw it. It's going to be man. What in trailer trash? Yep. 714 votes. We got the quail

[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.840]
loot number on there again. 714. We seem to get that a lot. Do you? Now, wait till you

[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:24.560]
hear this email. I turned on your show on Friday and heard George and thought not this

[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.760]
dollared again, but I gave George the normal five minutes before being bored to death

[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.280]
and turn on Pandora. But this may be hard to believe. The show was good. And I listened

[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.080]
to him for the whole show for the first time ever. Oh my God. How do you like that?

[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.020]
Wow. Thank you. Good show on Friday. That's right. The Chris would know. Maybe that's

[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:49.000]
because Chris wasn't there for a minute. I see you worked with flea. How did flea

[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.360]
do? Was you a good foil? He's fine. We had some technical glitches, but that's

[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.880]
better. He's a better loyal than he is a foil, but nevertheless. Yeah. So maybe if

[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.920]
you've got to be a boy like dragging us down, you got to go up and not down like a

[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.480]
wet bag of sand, man. But before you get to a set about this email, it says, yeah, I

[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.800]
don't think I'll ever have a good show again. But from now on, I'm going to give him

[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.620]
six minutes before I turn the channel. Oh, blow it out his ass. Blow it out his ass.

[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.040]
What kind of a communist comment is that? Let me go to where he works and see how he

[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.180]
does. Yeah. All these people judging, judging you like Jesse Helmsman. Look what happened

[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.680]
to him. You start judging George and me and you're going to wind up dead someday. I

[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:35.180]
guarantee that. Cliff and Candles as I purchased my dream hominies, Candle October of 95. Imagine

[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:40.700]
when my dismay when OJ moved in a few months later, just two streets away. When I heard he

[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.540]
was coming, I thought it was one of your comedy bits. The first couple of months after he

[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:48.240]
moved in, there was a nonstop parade of news and police helicopters hovering over our

[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.360]
neighborhood at all times of day and night. A few times I ran into women in Pinecrest, my

[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.520]
blood turned to ice. So long, OJ, don't let the jail door hitches as Cliff and Candle.

[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.200]
And bad news, he says, my grandfather and barefoot Bay has been hospitalized with terminal

[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.360]
cancer. Good news. That's one less vote for McCain. All right. All right.

[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.100]
Cork quick, grandpa. Cork fast. When it doubt. Of course, I wonder if you voted absentee

[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.860]
already. Now, that's a good question. If you vote absentee and then you die before

[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:22.760]
the election, does your vote count? That's a damn good question. And they count each

[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:28.460]
house twice. Well, I'm sure that if they didn't count it the first time, Javier Suarez will

[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:33.700]
come in his bathroom, but he'll he'll double dip it for you. He'll dip it. He'll dip it.

[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:39.580]
He'll dip it. He do it. Right. Boxes. I moved to Tennessee and I missed your show. I

[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:43.740]
listened to every chance I got. I'm glad I found his website. Now I can hear your show.

[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.960]
Where can I get that best of Neil? I used to hear. Please let me know. Sorry, but can't

[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:53.180]
get a no such thing. Thanks to WQM. There is no best of Neil. There's no best of anything.

[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.620]
There's no nothing. There's no bumper stickers. There's no accoutrements. There's no there's

[01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:04.620]
no nothing. That's what we got. We got plenty of nothing. And hey, dolphins going to go

[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:10.140]
to the Super Bowl. Gotta gotta move up and not down. That's Zach, man, between him and

[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:15.340]
the beast. Watch out for those fat producers, Chris. Never trust him. Kill him. Hello.

[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.660]
Neil. Yes. There's a great talking. I'm calling you from LA. I'm from Miami. But I just

[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.860]
came out. He looked for a place to live. I'm about 30 minutes from Nathan Owles. I hear Larry

[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.960]
King is going to be there. I call the woman up. There's answers a phone there. Did he really?

[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.660]
Did he ever pay the people back to check that I was going to be able to? No, he didn't ever.

[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:37.000]
He did, right? No. So if I go into my little camera and ask him Larry, I'm from Miami. It's

[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]
nice to see you. But I was just talking to Neil and he said that you never paid the people back

[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.200]
to check that I would be that you wrote. You think what do you think you want to do for me out of

[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:51.460]
there? Give it a shot. Let us know. No, I'm going to do it. I have a little camera, small,

[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.960]
little video camera. When it, how do you know he's going to be in Nate and Owles? I just

[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.000]
talked to this woman that answers the phone there. And I told her the whole story. She goes,

[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:03.280]
you know what? He's so freaking cheap. She goes, he never gets a phone. No, that doesn't

[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.560]
answer my question. How do you know he's going to be there? I think you're making the story up.

[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.500]
No, no, no. She said, she said, we'll be there. Let me tell you what. Do you want me to call it

[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.220]
and give the phone to him when I say I got Neil Rogers on the phone? I really doubt that's going

[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:20.440]
to happen because the time difference in three hours. Neil, he's going to be there. He gets

[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:25.340]
there 845 and 20 minutes with traffic. I'm in traffic right now. I'm the 405. I'm hope I'm there

[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:29.320]
in 20. But she said, it'll be there for 45 minutes to an hour. But don't worry. You'll be

[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.920]
there. How does she know he's going to be there? Because when he's in town, he's there every day.

[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:38.360]
I see. I see. She thinks he's in town. That's why I'm calling him. I'm not good. I'm not

[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:46.720]
doing it. Okay. Write it in your diary and your memoirs. Dear diary, today I embarrassed Larry King.

[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:55.520]
You know what that guy was trying to tell us? I have no life. Right. That's right. I have no life.

[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:04.520]
I mean, why is he picking on poor Larry? Why not? Oh, I agree with that. I think it's hysterical if

[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.320]
he doesn't. But I don't want to hear any more about it. You know, it's terminal. It's

[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.180]
ponderous. Boring. But I guess he thought it was a real hoot. Something I'd be all whipped up

[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:20.580]
about. 721 votes on the pool. What's your take on the OJ conviction? Great. Better late than never.

[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:29.220]
526. 73%. Don't care. 129. OJ got screwed. 50, which has got to be the same five people

[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:35.620]
voting ten times each. And who's the OJ 16? 16 isn't that mad castle's number last time I check?

[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:40.960]
Sure. He sure is pretty. I'll play that. Hey man. The big ol' boy.

[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.560]
He don't listen to the little Rogers. 4805. 60 QAM.

[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:50.780]
Think. 4th lead. The biggest name. The best talent. It's the big ol' or land who

[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:55.260]
else would get it. 4th radio 560 QAM.

[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:01.920]
The sports leader. Nice.

[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:29.180]
Your pair. OJ. OJ. OJ. You killed the cold. You killed the cold.

[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:32.500]
You killed.

[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.380]
I killed you cold.

[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:41.340]
You killed the cold.

[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.520]
You killed.

[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.680]
That night when she turned off all the lights.

[01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:01.080]
There's no place where she could hide. Oh no. OJ was gonna get her.

[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:10.180]
OJ went out to kill her. OJ went out to kill her. OJ went out to kill her.

[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:24.960]
That night. One day the jury's gonna bet 3.080.

[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.640]
For all we know we're gonna head your way.

[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.020]
Hey. Oh yeah. And OJ's gonna get ya.

[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:41.040]
It's true. OJ is gonna come back to you.

[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.580]
And that who get away with that want to move.

[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.220]
Oh yeah. OJ is gonna get ya.

[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.580]
OJ is gonna get you. OJ is gonna get you.

[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.760]
OJ is gonna get you.

[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:05.040]
OJ is gonna get you. One night.

[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:15.840]
OJ is gonna get ya.

[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:21.280]
OJ is gonna get her.

[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.800]
You killed.

[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:56.180]
Oh

[01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:02.120]
27-0-0 and fry in a hell, oh Jay that's my thoughts. Yeah, and thanks your thoughts

[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.620]

Oh, but he was a great running back. Oh Jay we want a long time coming yeah

[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:19.180]
All those years that he had off that's right a bottle around and steal a satellite signals and do all the other crap that he did finally got his come up and

[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:20.280]

[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:26.120]
See I have no sympathy for her because anybody coming up to stay with him deserves to get the crap be round

[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:32.300]
Christie Chris, so she ought to she ought to kiss the ground. She ought to crisp the ground that she's still alive. That's right

[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.280]
Then in New Orleans says oh speaks from Longwood I

[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.460]
Don't I don't know I see his last name is Spiegel speaks from Longwood florida says

[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.460]
with powdered sugar on it God

[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.880]

Well, I love sure a mutual I'll take that I hate that place. It's a festering toilet

[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:34.220]
Just watch the movie Southern comfort. You'll see all you need know about Louisiana who put the lose in Louisiana as in house by you

[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:34.600]
Ha ha

[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.520]
And since this is another email with no kinder or sorry or content or substance

[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.900]
I figured you'd love it just as well go fins, canes, cubs and panthers Stanley Cup here we come

[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.700]
Oh Stanley Cup my ass

[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.240]
God

[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.260]
How those Toronto mate believes doing huh well least the exhibition games are over

[01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:04.560]
If you think they lost bad enough is it's gonna be really really nasty 423 points on the downside for the down. It's down

[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:10.000]
Gotta gotta move up and not down. That's what the fans said before he got fired

[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:16.900]
He's getting fired soon. I hear and I hear the beast is gonna be out by the end of the day after after Chris goes in there and the skills the beans

[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:22.120]
You should demand it. I'm not one of those people that tries to get people fired

[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.280]
But I'll make a I'm making a septum in his case after what you told me the

[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:31.040]
Freakin beast. I think Moe had a point trouble making little modeling turd

[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.680]
Am I right Chris? Oh, yeah seems to be

[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:39.420]
Try to get you fired. Yep, so that was a

[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:45.060]
You he was gonna get you fired because you wouldn't put Don Bailey Jr. on here as if you had anything to do with it

[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.980]
Correct, but you have to do with it. You're bored offing the damn show, right?

[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.420]
I did my job. I told the guys are on air. Okay, Don's ready whenever you're gonna want to go to him

[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:56.700]
So and they didn't want to go to him. They probably had somebody important on like jerk jerk street

[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.940]
Oh, I said to Hank. I said what's the big deal with this guy? I called jerk jerk street

[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.940]
I forgot that he's on ESPN and

[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:06.880]
Hank kind of like Louis the oh he mumbled it down. They like him

[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.220]
Is what he said why forgot because everybody's on ESPN, you know, you know how that is

[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:17.620]
I wouldn't be surprised if George's got his own show one day on ESPN me. Oh, yeah, George is picks

[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.420]
All right, that's enough

[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.940]
Chop it up before he says gladiator again

[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:31.620]
gladiator

[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:36.540]
Here's George

[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.180]
Or the sun is shining it looks a little toasty. I bet it's colder now

[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:47.060]
The Dow is down 414. I'm just gonna keep you folks appraised so you can decide when to pull the trigger

[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.840]
Oh, it's 10 degrees. It's sunny and 50. Oh

[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.000]
Has been too toasty here the last few days Hank came at just the wrong time

[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:05.160]
Tomorrow it's gonna warm up for 58 Wednesday 63 and 65 on Thursday all right low tonight is gonna be three

[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:13.120]
You know what that is in Fahrenheit 38 degrees. Oh my god. Oh my gosh. I'm it in me 38 degrees. They're such a temperature really

[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.740]
All the release it's plus three and not minus three

[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.740]
Hank was asking me how I handle the winners here

[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.680]
You just get used to it. You don't like it you get used to it

[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:32.260]
And then you think of the alternative like being in Florida and think oh, I like the cold weather nice and it keeps you alert and alive and crisp and awake

[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.840]
It's supposed to heat in humidity where you feel real loggy

[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:45.140]
You know, I mean by a loggy I sure do I don't say loggy. I mean loggy Kenny Gramer another chronic former IOD er chronic

[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.000]
Should your votes still count if you're dead if you vote by mail but die before election date as you vote count

[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.500]
This is from the associate of press

[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.840]
If you vote by mail but die before election date as your vote counted depends on where you lived or a gun counts ballots no matter

[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.780]
What happens to the voter so does Florida

[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:06.640]
But in South Dakota if you die before the election so does your vote

[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.740]
Your vote says I'm dying over here

[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.640]
Laws and at least it doesn't states are evenly split between telling and dumping the votes

[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.000]
No one keeps records and how often such deaths occur but in Florida

[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:25.640]
ballots counting no matter what happens so vote early if you're for Obama and if you're croaked by election day or vote still counts

[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:31.460]
On last Friday's Florida I got a wrong if you vote for Obama even after election day your vote doesn't count

[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.880]
Am I right? Yes, yes, oh

[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.960]
The guy the knob guy is out there again. I think you know the guy who the knob are yet

[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.960]
Go get you a polish

[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.280]
Hmm he's a real ugly guy. Oh well

[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:53.060]
Put a bag of money. West Kendall says last week I was listening to Sid Rosenberg

[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.720]
I do like those in the sports talk shows but not all day

[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:02.200]
He blasted you saying that every time he comes up with something I eat Roy you steal it from him. Yeah, he came up with that

[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.600]
Uh-huh

[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.100]
Roy! Yeah, that's a Sid original

[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:10.240]
Please you have him a thousand of one of all these kinds of things

[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.680]
I think it's right that you take emails and some calls

[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.040]
Obama's looking stronger and stronger every day

[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.940]
I hope the Republicans continue to put people to avoid answering questions that were all interested in having answered

[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:24.920]
You may think it's because they have no answers or maybe because the answers they have are the same we've had last eight years

[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:29.900]
Neal you're not giving the quarter schlots guy see this is a guy that starts out like he's got something to say

[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:38.800]
Yeah, are you listening I'm listening already? Neal you are not giving the quarter schlots guy time to express himself or give input

[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.560]
And I disagree with you when you say the quarter schlots guys the most annoying please pros act Ron has to be hands down

[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:50.500]
Enjoy your show very much and when you please play the skit Mr. Red talking to the hardware store great job Neal

[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.040]

When you think who else would done the executive that's my point who also condone such a crap

[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:10.900]
The fourth leader

[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.500]
It's a big dog Joe Rose

[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:19.320]
Ford is always matter

[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.320]
Sport radio 560 QAM

And the sports leader I would love to keep you all to myself

[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:36.060]
You've seen him on Channel 7 news first as a two-bit reported now as a two-bit anchor that wears more makeup than Tamife Baker and Mary Kay combined

[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.340]
Rick Sanchez

[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.000]

[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:57.620]
Kathy and Miami says I'm the the Amy emails are starting to trickle in now

[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.060]
Started real if we fear they're they're dribbling. Yeah

[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:07.840]
Kathy and Miami says I'm starting to think Obama can actually win Florida and therefore the election my cleaning lady and her husband

[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:12.760]
Were both Hillary supporters, but nothing I said seemed to convince them to back Obama until a debate on Thursday

[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:18.320]
They both thought Sarah Palin was so stupid. It scared them to death and they were very impressed with Joe Biden

[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:23.540]
I wonder how many votes of Bob will pick up because this sick old man put a crazy person on the ticket

[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:31.200]
Is she picking up enough lunatic evangelicals to justify the choice ask Kathy and Miami the answer is no their numbers are dropping like a rock

[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.580]
Can I call you Joe? Oh?

[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.460]
That was so just

[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:42.400]
That's at the tone for the whole deal. Can I call you Joe?

[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:49.740]
Bob and Miami says those baguette things at K. Feade Cafe, Dumond and morning call have a special name in New Orleans

[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:56.260]
They're called donuts. Okay French donuts and they're delicious great with a hot cup of coffee and chiquiri

[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.440]
I lived in New Orleans for 10 months and 67 68 I have to disagree with your assessment of that city

[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:08.360]
It's a lot worse than you make it out to be a real Schmidt hole strange and hostile people freaky since Bob and Miami

[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.500]
How do you like that a lot worse than I make it out to be how could it be?

[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.700]
That's like saying it's as bad as Detroit the question for you Ashville

[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:22.360]
Isn't how we can afford to focus on health care the question is how can we afford not to?

[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.360]
Yeah

[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.780]
The McCain campaign is accusing Obama of deceitful attacks on McCain's health care plan right

[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:37.040]
If McCain says it it's the truth if Obama says it it's a lie

[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:44.120]
That's the McCain campaign. It's a lie. He hangs out with terrorists and he's an evil door and he's a Muslim is right

[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:49.480]
Joe says whatever happened to the guy Rick sent his random word is car after drinking of that dolphin game

[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.960]
I'd love to hear him singing with that while just play before you

[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.400]
You're welcome Joe

[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:57.260]
See I'm not such a bad guy. Not such a hard-ass

[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.300]
Like people say like dumb

[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.000]
Pin pin that's it. Oh, I'm a lot sharper than you are mr.

[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:40.860]
Oh boy, well, you're a pin head

Something trying to try to get your ass can correct well, but you're talking to his boyfriend. Don't you understand man?

[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.520]
You're talking to the boyfriend

[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.160]
His partner in crime

[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.980]
Who didn't even go to you and but is still a you and apologist

They lost again. Oh, no, not the Kings the Kings lost the game again. Oh, no. Are we cursed down here?

[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.100]
I guess where it's like a mixed bag now half cursed half blessed

[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.980]
Because the dolphins man. We're smelling super bowl. Can you smell it? Hmm

[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.860]

Oh, and here's somebody bobbin mimie says oh, it's the same thing again. He decided to send it again

[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:30.080]
Just in case you missed it just in case I just got you reading it on the air he sends it again about New Orleans and how it sucks

[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:38.040]
Neil you like binyees. They're like Italian zippoli's fried dough with powdered sugar and of course best when they're hot so's Larry

[01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.900]
Zippoli's I never heard of zippoli. Did you know?

[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.900]
Italian I don't get to Italy as much as you do

[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.980]
Hmm, not sure

[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.900]
Okay, let's see. I'm surprised you actually had a meal with fat Hank

[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:58.180]
I assume that you have no real friends no one can stand you everyone despises you and the only people who can actually tolerate you

[01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:03.440]
Even talked to you are those who need to get any money from you or hope to do so in the future fat Hank must have been looking for a handout

[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.140]
He probably made some bad vets

[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:11.320]
Isn't that sweet yeah, you're right. That was gonna be a killer. That's a keeper in a killer. Yeah, you have no real friends

[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.760]
No, of course not why would anybody associate with me?

[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:16.520]
I

[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.380]
Did buy a dinner by the way

[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:22.740]
Well, it was it was not a memorable meal. It was crap. It was typical caca woodbine

[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:26.380]
Will I yeah, even a horses wouldn't eat that swill

[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:32.060]
Tbis says please don't get all pissed off and part up when guys like me email the show with our crap

[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:37.380]
You see in my case like most of us all bet. I'm unemployed. It doesn't look like I'm gonna get a job anytime soon

[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:42.180]
I wish I had funds to drive somewhere so that I could pursue other avenues of enrichment

[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:46.800]
But I'm dealing with depression and anxiety because I have no idea where I'm gonna get money to pay fp and L

[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:51.920]
So the little pleasure sign dulls in like emailing your show and hoping to contribute something worthwhile

[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:55.100]
Could serve in some small capacity to validate my beaten-down existence

[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:00.200]
Mostly thanks to the fascist in power and the financial whizkids or nothing more than used car salesmen

[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:02.200]
Enable as used to bankrupt the gentry

[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.320]
You think they're appailing is hot. I do. No, I don't I don't think she's even look warm

[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.240]
And I think that you guys who think that she's hot desperately need to get laid

[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:16.260]
Just like someone would think a snake eating a rat is cute. Oh, I see

[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.060]
The governor was speaking to her base over in clear water this morning

[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:24.200]
I can't think of a better place for nose pickers eight exclamation points is Tbic

[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.640]
No one you can't get a job Tbic. You got a really crappy attitude

[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:37.040]
You think Sarah's hot. Oh, she's so hot. She's a hockey mob. Oh, hockey with a little baby. Oh, she's got such a cute little baby

[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:44.120]
The way they were tossing at baby around the convention like a prop was just just enough to make you vomit

[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:46.400]
What are you doing to that poor little kid

[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:53.780]
That was down 4803 again. Oh, it's gonna be a it's gonna be an ugly day before it's over. Let me tell you right now

[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.880]
It's gonna be ugly like that little baby

[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:05.700]
Linda says while listening to a past show September 25 you mentioned the phrase whistling past the graveyard wondering what that mean

[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.500]
Well, the question made me wonder as well. So I looked it up and here's the answer

[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.660]
If someone is whistling past the graveyard

[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:16.560]
They're trying to remain cheerful and difficult circumstances whistling past as cemetery is also used

[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:22.160]
So everybody whistle while you work that I like Pat Boone and love letters in the sand. That's it

[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:29.160]
I can't I can't whistle real good only certain times. You got to put your lips together and and pucker up. I know. Oh, yeah

[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:35.060]
It's not easy to do in front of a microphone. I can whistle like in a shower

[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:39.120]
Or like in woodbine I can whistle whistle past the graveyard

[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:50.060]
Or could he sing or what had you not know if you're looking back then before we knew he's gonna turn into a fashion

[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:55.380]
You know a carcoring board again Bible thumping hippocriton. No, you got to get to the middle part where he does the whistle

[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:57.460]
Can you move it ahead? Yep

[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:04.040]
Would a boat have a view of you can't see the debris

[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.660]
You say

[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.380]
Here we go

[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:21.680]
And a little piece of trivia there was actually Pat Whistling on the song bill on die records is in hey Pat what's done

[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:26.860]
Have a deal boon in the box whistle moor and sing less. Yeah, have a good boon in the box. Hey, Piss

[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.360]
Oh, yeah

The biggest

[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:54.940]
The best

[01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.860]

[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:28.060]
Chalien

[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.920]
His defense

[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.500]
Makes no sense

[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.760]
Led by Johnny

[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.060]
Cochrane

[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:44.440]
I'm tied up here now. I see the jury

[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:46.180]

Hey

[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:17.060]
You didn't hide that glove oh

[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:30.920]

[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:40.960]
Was that Zimfar there at the end?

[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:47.040]
Sometimes what the cold was thinking at the end what was that Zimfar in the pan flute Zimfar here

[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.300]
Where's that thing about the big oh here it is

[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:06.260]
I've got some leftovers one because I wasn't on a Friday George was on a Friday. Did I have a job? Yeah, that's a good job, Georgie

[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.940]
Let's see where's the one about oh yeah Hank said the big oh shouldn't be on the year at all period

[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:15.500]
I would agree on that but nevertheless

[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.040]
Rock solid is that

[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:20.340]
And got a mammoth ego oh my god

[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:27.680]
He's the only sportscaster in town who speaks in spanglish baby talk. You know what I mean? Oh, no, he's not the only one

[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:31.700]
Are there other ones who are the I don't know but I I hear it

[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:40.540]
You're listening to all sports radio. I just uh go from you know from one station to the other back and forth trying to get as much sports information as I can

[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:47.860]

[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:50.620]
Limp wrist

[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:54.440]
Clarence you ought to go into meeting and hold Chris's hand

[01:34:56.100 --> 01:35:00.020]
In fact, you ought to go in the other room right now and just for practice hold his hand not school

[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:03.060]
I think that would be so sweet. Uh-huh

[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:07.540]
Steve says just listen to the opening of the big oh show and couldn't help but laughing out loud

[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:08.840]

[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:17.220]
He has a competition to win tickets to a playboy party on south beach. Can you imagine the losers who listen to his show chatting to playboy models?

[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.400]
Hey lady you think ladenian will run for 150 yards this week or wow you have two brecks just like the hurricanes

[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.720]
Thank you thinks he's just got awful

[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.240]
Probably shouldn't have said that on the ear huh?

[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.640]
Okay, but why not?

[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.240]
I don't care

[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:01.440]
Thanks. They've got a big mouth. He's like me fat and with a big mouth only a lot of fat or an I am wow

Nope just say I'm gonna miss you like fat rich now there is a great guy you you might wish I loved him dearly great guy

[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:22.840]
Good friend very nice a lot of fun great since very nice to me we we would talk software and stuff because that was his thing

[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.680]
That wasn't like a software writer if I have much and about something he was always very up-to-date very healthy. Yeah

[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:34.800]
And then yeah when we least expected it

[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:41.040]
Right right there at the track right at pump and oh poor. Oh, I guess he probably would have wanted that way sure

[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.580]
I imagine I mean when I croke it would be nice to decroke it would buy

[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:52.860]
Just fall off the chair at my machine and say I'm dying on the head and then just hit the floor just like that thing you just played

[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.120]
The down 444

[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.000]
Hey

[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:03.340]
That's which well that sneeze reminds me that I'm gonna Joyce and I'm the next break. I see so if I'm not back be prepared

[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:04.960]
Although you know, I'll be back

[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.140]
797 on fat Chris's pole. This is the day, baby

[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:15.820]
This is the day that fat Chris draws the line in the sand it goes in there and tells clearance what a jackass he is

[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:19.720]
And how he better cut the crap that it's not a radio station. It's not a business

[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.480]
It's a little fraternity of kindergarten kids who could be the most childish?

[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:29.860]
Oh, you didn't put down Bailey Jr. on the year. You didn't tell the guys to put him on it's you job. You're not doing your job

[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:38.440]
I'm gonna get you fired. I mean the beast is an overgrown infant and he's married and making babies. Oh

[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:41.940]
My goodness, so they have a little baby. Yes

[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:44.840]
Oh

[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:48.740]
The thought of that is just so grotesque

[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:53.440]
But nevertheless we don't want to talk about that. I would be in bad taste with it

[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:54.560]
probably

[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.600]
Well, then let's talk about it. Not

[01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:04.840]
Here is one that says black. Oh look at that

[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:10.860]
Neil Rogers doesn't like black people any city that is too many people of color is automatically a sewer at New Orleans

[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.880]
Detroit, Atlanta

[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:20.000]
Never has anyone working on the show who might be as far as it you're like Nick Lawrence who is my producer for a long time in iod and did a heck of a job

[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:27.260]
No black friends. No, I don't have any black friends. That's right automatically hates any broadcasters who are too dark

[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:34.340]
Right like your Bernie Shaw who is one of my favorites. I'm CNN. Well, he does a dark. He's kind of like. It's kind of light

[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:37.180]
No, he was not Bernie Shaw was light. Yeah

[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.540]
Can't stand any black culture music comedians entertainers, etc. Right like Chris Rock. I can't stand him

[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:51.580]
Not you only black people he might even like are those like Obama who's even wider than most white men his thin skin color

[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:57.660]
Not with standing whatever whatever that means yeah, okay, everybody knows me. Everybody knows what's in my brain. All you geniuses

[01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:59.000]
God

[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:04.880]
And here's one. Oh, this is from a speaks again. You're right New Orleans is a toilet

[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:05.760]
It

[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.800]
It is a toilet. It's got nothing to do with how many black people are there. It's a toilet

[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:16.700]
I don't even remember the ethnic composition of the city. I remember it was like a slum like a big slum

[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:23.040]
And if you watched the southern comfort item we call it name black people being in there. They were trailer trash

[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:27.460]
Like syrup halum last time I check. She's not black. She's just trailer trash

[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:32.660]
Georgia's right George Sedano from noon to two is pretty good

[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:40.780]
Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, yeah, but he also speaks spanglish is that I guess I guess that's the message there. I don't think that's the point you

[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:49.420]
No, just taking chief shots at me. That's what the emails are all about just like the colors. We hope you die

[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.140]
Like that, you know

[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:55.220]
Like that Ed Senniski you ought to read the crap that that jackass sends me

[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:02.220]
But you know what don't bother me because the one thing George knows and that this this is my motto in life

[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:06.160]
And it served me well for years and years. I don't live my life based on what other people think

[01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:10.980]
I don't give a crap out of the people think I live my life and do the best I can every day

[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:13.600]
And that's it. That ain't good enough for you. Buh, you mama

[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:14.900]
you mama

[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:22.320]
Hey Neil it's time to send Sarah and her godson Ms. Bocha back to Juneau or Anchorage or the Russian border or wherever the hell they live

[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:22.760]
It says

[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:26.780]
Sarah's the most clueless nutcase I've ever seen. How could the people of Alaska?

[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:28.940]
Both of them vote for her to be governor

[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:33.360]
Is it that cool in Alaska that suffering from brain freeze or they just dumb as dirt both

[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:36.540]
Have to get back to work. I still have a job. She's ed

[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:39.960]
You go ed

[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:46.540]
Let's see Spanish sportscaster. Yeah, that's the horror he said. Oh, yeah, he's doing a hell of a job over there

[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.760]
809 on your poll fat Chris boy. It's probably gonna be Chris's last day with us

[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.440]
You've done a nice job for us. He's last one. Is it two years almost? Yeah, almost he is nice job

[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.920]
I'll get a thousand votes today. Why?

[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.180]
You bet guess bigger than a thousand votes today for me

[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:07.900]
We're gonna get a thousand votes for you today. Well, it's my last day. Yeah, it reminds me of that misfit that mario guy

[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:12.000]
Oh, I've been here. Oh, by the way sends emails that I don't read on here and sends them over and over

[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.580]
You can send it a hundred times missfin. I'm not gonna read them

[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.240]
I've been here for you for 18 or 20 years. I've been here for you

[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.520]
But what does that mean? He's been there for me

[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:25.280]
And that's basically the same thing you're saying now. Whatever you just said

[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.980]
Bob and Miami who sent that email second time

[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:35.880]
At least had the decency to apologize. I sent the second email by mistake. Do you believe?

[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.940]
Bob no, no, yeah, sure

[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:40.920]
Now he's a good guy as long as I'm emailing you again

[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:45.640]
If I ever sent anyone a link to a webpage I always include excerpts of the article in the email before insert the link

[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:50.740]
That way the recipient can choose to read the entire article if he she or it wants to read more nice go on Bob

[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:53.060]
Who's still in Miami? It's what he says

[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:01.560]
John and Lakeworth who I thought was a lot more articulate and educated than he is. Oh, I think he's been listening too long to

[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.720]
If that just the site s-i-t-e

[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:10.900]
Just the site of Sarah Pellan is nauseating her terrorist implications are way beyond the pale

[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:14.780]
But that's the Republican way. I see that Obama's running the heating five commercials

[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:19.840]
He needs to run commercials about Sarah and all those who are refusing to appear even after being subpoenaed

[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.060]
But guess what they're not. I got an article here in my pile. Seven of them are gonna testify

[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:30.500]
They're doing the parliament song. I want to testify seven state workers now read to testify and the Tubergate probe

[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:36.100]
And ask that please insert the smelly bitch drop how the investigation is going

[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:41.180]
She makes me ill and the SNL skits are the best. That's correct. How about playing Moan Will Chamberlain can't play that

[01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:45.560]
It was one of the first and one of the best love your big guys is John and Lakeworth. Oh

[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:52.460]
site s-i-g-h-t John get it right get it right rhymes with site slight might bite

[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:53.580]

[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:21.300]
Not no more he ain't lose. He's behind bars and he's seeing stars ain't that great. Let's hear it. I made my weekend

[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:28.060]
Dinner with had the Humper at the Woodbine Saturday night. We didn't a few bucks any afternoon while I'm waiting to meet up with him

[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:31.640]
I would that was the best part. I don't want to lie Hank who was great to see again

[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:37.520]
We had a good time a good chat, but the winning the money was even more more pleasing especially the way things are these days, you know

[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.320]
Money is something you can never have too much of just ask Chris. I'll tell you

[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:42.880]
Oh

[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:51.380]
The Dow is down nearly 500 points down 484 57. Let me take a look at the Toronto Stock Exchange nothing anybody listening to me now cares about that

[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:56.420]
But it's a you know oil is down under 90 bucks a barrel. What a bargain go get some 89 78

[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:05.560]
The T.S. X is down 617 points. It was down nearly 1200 early this morning and people are getting ready to and the Canadian

[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:07.520]
Looney is down to 90 percent

[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:10.260]
All right, let me go out and spend some money

[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.440]
and that good 90 cent

[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:20.800]
When I first came up here was 62 cent and everything was a bargain and then it went to like a buck 10 as the American dollar win in the toilet

[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.400]
Thank you for the week American dollar Mr. President and those low gas prices and all the dead people in Iraq

[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.120]
Which for some reason nobody seems to be talking about

[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:35.480]
That's the one thing that really porked me off about what Obama said at that first debate that no American soldier ever dies in vain

[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.920]
How can you say such a thing

[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:41.820]
What do they die for over there for a war based on lies

[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.720]
But of course that's not the PC thing to say right. No, so rich people could get richer

[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:54.160]
What did I tell you way back in the beginning oh I L and M O any wide and I tell you that in the meantime

[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.500]
They got an 80 billion dollar budget surplus there in Iraq 80 billion dollars hanging around and we're spending 10 billion a month to like

[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:03.400]
Wind the war whatever that means there isn't any war

[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:04.640]
uh

[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.660]
Doesn't the war imply that they're like two countries fighting right

[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:13.420]
Last time I checked

[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:19.680]
Democrat Barack Obama responded was for trail by John McCain's campaign as a crony of terrorists

[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.600]
Fought fire with fire today by highlighting Republicans in brawlement and a devastating 80s financial scandal

[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.020]
A month from election day November 4

[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:32.780]
The rivals traded furious barbs as of a son of the senator McCain battle to arrest his Illinois opponents

[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:37.040]
Paul surge at a time of deep anxiety about the state of the US economy

[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:42.940]
Well, there's your president for confidence in the financial system. Oh, yeah, there's lots of confidence. That's why the market is tanking

[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:47.740]
Dropping like a gigantic boulder from the top of the grand canyon

[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:54.860]
Obama rolled out a new ad an email on slot recalling McCain's complicity in the scandal over jail tycoon Charles Keating

[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:59.180]
The collapse of whose savings and loan from wiped out the savings of many elderly retirees

[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.280]
Oi

[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:04.180]
McCain was part of a group of lawmakers that became known as the Keating five

[01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:09.360]
Who received gifts and favors from the businessman and intervened with regulators to insist his company was in good health

[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.800]
The Republican escape of the formal censure by the Senate in 91

[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.420]
But spoke of the searing embarrassment caused by the scandal which cost the West government

[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:22.920]
$124 billion to bail out the entire SNL industry went on to become a crusader for ethics reform

[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:28.660]
Sound familiar Obama campaign manager David Plough said an email to supporters after Congress last week

[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:30.680]
Passed the $700 billion bailout for Wall Street

[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:34.460]
The McCain campaign is tried to avoid talking about the scandal

[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:36.440]
But with so many parallels to the current crisis

[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:42.800]
McCain's Keating history is relevant and voters deserve to know the facts and see for themselves the pattern of poor judgment by John McCain

[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.460]
He be saying

[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:52.900]
The war of words sparked by McCain's running mate Sarah Palin raised the stakes still higher as the presidential contenders prepared to face off at the second of three debates on Tuesday

[01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:58.640]
Alaska governor Palin Saturday accused Obama of piling around with terrorists a reference to his title

[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:03.620]
Chicago to former militant William Ayers whose weatherman group bombed government buildings in the 60s and 70s

[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:11.780]
Palin told supporters that Democrat was thus not a good man who sees America as you and I do as the greatest force in the world for good

[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:18.240]
That remark appeared to wonder line that the Hawaiian Borno Obama the first African American with a serious shot at the president

[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:19.940]
He does not resemble the average white voter

[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:23.460]
But while the McCain campaign insisted won't play the race card against Obama

[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:28.640]
It does intend to portray him as a wild-eyed liberal who's not a step with hardland values and unfit to leave

[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:38.380]
McCain's spokesman Tucker bounds alleged that the University of Professor Ayers was part of a network of Chicago patrons including convicted fraudster Tony

[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:41.640]
Redskaw property tycoon used to be a top fundraiser for Obama

[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:48.680]
The last four weeks of this election will be about whether the American people are willing to turn our economy and national security over to Barack Obama

[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:55.080]
A man with a little record questionable judgment and ties to radical figures like unrepentant domestic terrorists William Ayers he said

[01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:05.120]
Obama hit back at the terrorists jab with another TV spot that castigated the 70-year-old McCain's erratic behavior as Congress wore last week or the economic rescue package

[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:15.180]
The ad noted that top McCain advised a Greg Strympel and said the Republicans campaign was looking forward to turning a page on his financial crisis and instead attack Obama's aggressively liberal record

[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:22.060]
The Illinois Senator said he wouldn't fall prey to the kind of swiftball character assassination that helps think John Kerry's campaign once he

[01:49:22.060 --> 01:49:24.060]
George W in 2004

[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:27.840]
They'd rather tear our campaign down than let this country up

[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:34.940]
That's what you do when you're out of touch out of ideas and running out of time Obama told a gigantic crowd of 28,000 people yesterday in Asville North Carolina

[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:44.500]
With crisis sweeping through Wall Street and Main Street polls not favor Obama both nationally and in battleground states as Florida

[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:45.880]
Ohio and Pennsylvania

[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:54.320]
Are you USA today MTV Gallup survey published today sure Obama now leads McCain 61 to 32 among registered voters under the age of 30

[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.120]
However McCain had a four-point lead among seniors 65 and older

[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.520]
Four-point lead among seniors. That's pretty weak

[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:06.040]
For a right wing old daughtering fool like same McCain, you know what?

[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:12.640]
You weak are you there? You're right? Well a little both you're dying over there

[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.620]
I'm not over here from what from a smell of the hollars from the go-mix

[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:18.640]
Farting up his storm nope

[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:22.580]
No, not really when fat people get really nervous. They start farting real bad

[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:27.920]
nervous one might have been nervous for because you got that big meeting with clearance coming up this afternoon. What you're gonna get fired?

[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:34.200]
Oh, well, you better mind your piece. You better say yes sir. Yes, mr. Yes, master. Yes, sir

[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:36.880]
I'm telling you right now, man. He's a hard-ass

[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:41.360]
He's a disciple of jolly joe a hard-ass bell fat ass

[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:46.760]
Yeah, oh here's the airs and emails this funny story

[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:50.960]
And I'm deleting it right now. I don't want funny stories. I don't want jokes

[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:52.580]
Okay

[01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:58.900]
You got it. Okay, I got it. I don't want funny stories that somebody else told you

[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:01.300]
I want people on this email to say something

[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:05.280]
Neil at nearages.com even if they rip me an ass like a couple that I've read

[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:08.320]
Oh, you don't have any friends and nobody would go to dinner with you

[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.820]
Yeah, even George likes me a little bit not much. Yep

[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:19.500]
Chris likes me a lot. Oh, yeah, because if it weren't for me he wouldn't have this job correct

[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:23.600]
By the way, I forgot to send that check to your close personal buddy

[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:24.800]
cordis

[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.620]
I think I should send it today. Okay. Like you can send it to me and I'll give to him

[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:33.280]
No, you won't it's got his name on it. If I so you can send it to my name and I'll capture it

[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:35.520]
His name on it. If I ever make it out. I haven't made it out yet

[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:40.080]
Sorry, Josh, but the longer I take the send it, the longer he doesn't spend the money.

[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.140]
Does that a good way to look at it?

[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:43.180]
Sure.

[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.360]
So I do people that are losing your ass in the market.

[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:48.020]
Just imagine if you would have had all that money, you'd have blown it by now anyway.

[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:51.520]
So that's money you aren't losing.

[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:52.380]
It's only on paper.

[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:53.540]
Just sit tight, man.

[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:54.860]
This stuff comes back so fast.

[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:56.300]
That's what they all tell you.

[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:58.080]
As you get broker and broker.

[01:51:58.460 --> 01:51:59.740]
That's why they call them a stock broker.

[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:03.500]
829 votes on your OJ pool.

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.320]
Fry his ass, baby.

[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:10.840]
Sal says all weekend on TV I watched people complaining about the bailout package from

[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:12.860]
700 billion that was invested in our country.

[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:15.740]
This is a bargain compared to the 9 trillion we invested in Iraq.

[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:18.440]
Thanks Mr. President for those low gas prices as sale.

[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:19.540]
Atta boy's sale.

[01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:21.780]
You know where the bodies are buried, baby.

[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:23.620]
Somewhere in Iraq.

[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:29.320]
And of course the American soldiers when they come back from Iraq in a box, they don't

[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.220]
want us to see that.

[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:31.540]
It's not good for business.

[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.700]
They don't want us to see those casket.

[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:37.220]
Atisket at casket, don't let the public see no casket.

[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:40.580]
Because they're reminding that there's somebody dead inside who used to be alive.

[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:45.980]
Living and breathing people with worthwhile lives and with husbands and wives and babies

[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.700]
and all these little babies.

[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:52.300]
Just like Sarah, they have a little baby only now they're dead because the president and

[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:56.080]
Dick Cheney decided to invade Iraq so we could get our hands on their oil for their

[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:56.800]
partners in crime.

[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.380]
Let me say it again if we should have invaded any place it should have been the freaking

[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.040]
Saudis.

[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:04.080]
And by the way, now that Ramadan is over, what are you going to do about that?

[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:05.160]
Eat.

[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:06.620]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.260]
Now they can eat.

[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.100]
Essin, Murghane, Essin, no messages in the email.

[01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:10.620]
Look at that.

[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:11.160]
Oh, there's one.

[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.500]
One just came and you know who it's from?

[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:14.740]
I get up.

[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.980]
I'm just anxious and I'm deleting it right now.

[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:19.320]
Unconscious, you're out.

[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.420]
See, there are certain idiots out there.

[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:22.060]
They don't understand.

[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:22.580]
Want to do it?

[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:23.840]
I get tired enough of them.

[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:26.820]
I see it's from them and just delete, delete, delete.

[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.880]
Get the kids names for the next town.

[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.240]
Delete it for the new projects.

[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.560]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.440]
The fourth leader.

[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:37.120]
So, what's your name?

[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.400]
The best talent.

[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:39.780]
It's the TSO.

[01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:41.120]
Wake nights for me to 11.

[01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:41.820]
Here I come.

[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.880]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:45.500]
The sports leader.

[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:47.360]
For the flagship station.

[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:59.360]
Oh, Jason's the name got no soul and we all know he's alive.

[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.320]
We're in the hospital.

[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.220]
Biggest as we have learned.

[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:05.760]
He's still so he can retire.

[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.880]
Oh, Jason went in the hotel and we've been gone in the air.

[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:13.180]
With a great big knife or two to say.

[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:16.600]
Time to strap him in the electric chair.

[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:17.960]
Oh, Jay.

[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.380]
Rod Vegas.

[01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:21.260]
Oh, Jay.

[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:22.700]
Rod Vegas.

[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:23.440]
Absolutely.

[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:24.720]
Oh, Jay.

[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.460]
Oh, Jay.

[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:27.740]
Rod Vegas.

[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:33.940]
Oh, Rod.

[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:34.560]
The first one.

[01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:34.780]

[01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:35.660]
560 WQ.

[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:36.660]
I'm happy Monday to it.

[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.760]
Next Monday is Canadian Thanksgiving, eh?

[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:40.800]
Okay.

[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.880]
I want to have offer then.

[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:42.980]
It's a major holiday Thanksgiving.

[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:44.780]
I don't know.

[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.520]
How can a Canadian be having Thanksgiving?

[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:47.800]
They stole that from us, right?

[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:49.000]
Okay.

[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.100]
I mean, there was no pilgrims in Canada.

[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.340]
Well, you're right.

[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:55.980]
They might have had a similar story though.

[01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:58.960]
A similar story?

[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.340]
What's the non pilgrims?

[01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:00.720]
You know, whatever.

[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:01.660]
A bunch of turkeys?

[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:03.520]
A bunch of turkeys running this guy.

[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.080]
I just think he's a coward.

[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:05.460]
I just even freaking Harper.

[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.060]
And that fraud step on the own.

[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:10.120]
Who stuff on the own while they move all the way?

[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:11.720]
Oh, my God.

[01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.780]
If I ever wondered which I never did, I always knew why.

[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:17.740]
But if anybody ever wondered why they hate French Canadians in South Florida?

[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:20.520]
Just go to Quebec, eh?

[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:21.860]
Oh, my God.

[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:22.560]
Go to Montreal.

[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:23.880]
Frogs.

[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:24.600]
It's a frogfish.

[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:26.100]
It's like that scene in Magnolia.

[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:30.940]
Tom says, I'm giving a couple of emails here in Arizona.

[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:34.760]
See, let me just explain something to you, which I know you think I'm an idiot.

[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:35.320]
And you're right.

[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:37.960]
I'm slow. I'm naive.

[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:38.580]
I'm a fool.

[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:39.420]
I never learn.

[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:41.540]
Yeah.

[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:50.520]
But I thought that when I stumbled upon his email ID to replace most of the calls that we did take one call today from that goofball in LA that alleged story about lyric king,

[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.200]
which may or may not be true and quite frankly, who cares.

[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:01.600]
But I thought that, you know, with even if you have like a third the audience that we used to have or a fourth,

[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.580]
I thought the potential was there for like thousands of emails to be coming in.

[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:09.680]
The potential is that right?

[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:10.240]
Right.

[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:14.860]
I mean, like all these spam emails we get, I mean, Zillions of those.

[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:24.600]
Oh, I mean, I, Jerry, I just have eight billion dollars for you if you'll just respond to this and give me your social security number and et cetera, you know, we give lots of those.

[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:26.620]
Lots of crap.

[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:33.340]
But I'm talking about people who listen to the show, people who are in contact with us with something to say.

[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:40.680]
I thought the possibilities were like unlimited because everybody's going right now.

[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:41.660]
The possibilities are.

[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:47.560]
And I, I, and the first couple of days are the first three days.

[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:48.540]
It was phenomenal.

[01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:55.280]
Phenomenal, not good, spectacular, sensational, phenomenal.

[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:00.840]
And now it's basically like I said, the same handful of misfits.

[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:02.820]
I mean, they're there.

[01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:07.720]
There occasionally is something worthwhile on there and I read as many of them as I can on the air, but generally speaking.

[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.400]
Oh, Jane, I forgot to read James.

[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.140]
There's some stuff from over the weekend.

[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:13.560]
The weekend, it's just astonishing.

[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.420]
There is nothing that comes in.

[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:16.460]
I mean, virtually nothing.

[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:21.560]
When you think weekend would be time that people are sitting down, tapping out a few things on the Internet.

[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.680]
No, absolutely not.

[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:27.400]
Most of the emails that we get, I assume, are people on their work PC.

[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:31.320]
You know, screw it off instead of doing work.

[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:32.220]
That's our crowd.

[01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:34.680]
So in other words, our audience doesn't have a PC at home.

[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:38.800]
Probably, but you know, on the weekend most people I would like to think are doing other things.

[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:40.700]
Or other people.

[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:42.920]
This crowd?

[01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.040]
I have no life.

[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.860]
Anyway, Jane and Deerfield is trying to suck up.

[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:51.820]
Remember, she was giving me the crap about the body wash and the bottles?

[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:52.240]
Yes.

[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.440]
Oh, and I got the pomegranate one.

[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:55.720]
This is the, um, salsa.

[01:57:56.180 --> 01:57:57.900]
I'm still using that pink grapefruit.

[01:57:58.100 --> 01:57:58.320]
It's great.

[01:57:58.340 --> 01:57:59.080]
I'm almost out of that.

[01:57:59.520 --> 01:57:59.980]
It is great.

[01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:00.680]
See, I told you.

[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:02.960]
Oh, that's a fag thing, Deer.

[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:04.220]
That's for fag, it's only.

[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:04.700]
Yeah, right.

[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.340]
It might be, but it still smells really good.

[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:06.900]
It's great.

[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:09.320]
It's, it's, it's sure is better than that nasty, smarmy soap.

[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:12.000]
These guys just like to have an excuse to drop the soap.

[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:12.520]
That's all.

[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:16.240]
Jane says the hell with body wash, the world is screwed anyway.

[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:17.640]
Now you got to write attitude, Jane.

[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:19.760]
I'm so depressed with everything she says.

[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.400]
When I see this pale in person, it makes me want to gag.

[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:25.180]
Then I realize these are the people that are going to hope for her.

[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.680]
According to the philosophy she follows, she should be home baking cookies.

[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:29.980]
Yeah, with that little baby.

[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.340]
It hears she is a governor and possibly a VP.

[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:36.880]
She can't name the newspaper she reads because obviously she doesn't read any.

[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:41.200]
Any woman who votes for her because she can't vote for a swelery should have the right to vote taken away.

[01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:43.720]
The same goes for any man to vote for her because she's hot.

[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:46.380]
Write you again when I have more material, love you, Jane.

[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:47.080]
Thank you, Jane.

[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:47.300]
See?

[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:51.180]
Jane redeemed herself after I bitched her out about that body wash comment.

[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:53.940]
Oh, you're not recycling the bottles.

[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:56.720]
Oh, my God, you're destroying the planet now.

[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:59.100]
And finally, Jane came back to earth.

[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.500]
And like that, you know?

[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:03.520]
Yep.

[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:07.080]
Well, I'm looking at my palm, discovering out a bunch of emails here that I haven't used.

[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:08.900]
Isn't that bad?

[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:10.920]
That's good that you found them now.

[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:11.120]
Oh!

[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.140]
And this article here, did you see it?

[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:14.780]
It was on our website.

[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.040]
Florida teacher uses the N word against Obama.

[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:17.680]
Did you see this?

[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:19.080]
No.

[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:19.300]
No.

[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:27.720]
A Florida middle school teacher faced disciplinary action after using the word Nigger to describe democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.

[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.500]
W.J.H. G's Christy Walsky reported.

[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:37.400]
The seventh grade teacher, Greg Howard asked his students what changed the form of relation to the Obama campaign

[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:39.200]
and proceeded to write out an acronym.

[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:41.600]
Acquit the acronym, come help get a Nigger elected.

[01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:44.140]
And of course, we've had how many of those zillions on the email?

[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:44.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:45.620]
Lots.

[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:46.860]
Which I do everyday.

[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:47.220]
Immediately.

[01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:53.220]
The school suspended Howard without pay for ten days and removed him from his position at the school.

[01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:57.220]
That shouldn't happen said Billy DeLaHonda no, Obama supporter because they're there to learn.

[01:59:57.300 --> 01:59:58.200]
They're not there to discriminate.

[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:04.180]
Jackson County's deputy school so pretend and confirm that the teacher used the racial slurring class.

[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:07.860]
And that's saying, well, how can you find a...

[02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:12.380]
How do you present something like that in a school?

[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.600]
No matter how much it will write in that query, huh?

[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.640]
I don't know.

[02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:19.600]
Seventh grade teacher asked his students what changed it for.

[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:25.760]
But school officials said Howard had been transferred to Jackson County adult education program, or he will continue to teach.

[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:33.260]
Howard's also been removed from his position as football coach and any and may face further action from the FDF for Department of Education.

[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:37.220]
This isn't the first instance of racism in the presidential race.

[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:43.220]
A conservative convention in September included a vendor selling Obama waffles that featured a caricature of the candidate.

[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:45.100]
The candidate reminiscent of Angie Mime is Maple Syrup.

[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:55.720]
During the Democratic primaries earlier this year, MSNBC analyst Keith Overnman called an editorial by former Bush strategist Carl Roeva attacking Obama outright racist.

[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.360]
And here it shows the Blackboard he wrote it out.

[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:02.320]
CHANG come help a N word get elected.

[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:03.720]
Just unbelievable.

[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.040]
Just pathetic.

[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:06.740]
Yeah.

[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:12.040]
I'll tell you one thing.

[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:16.140]
And they can sure serve up a lot of soup in Florida. You know why?

[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:16.780]
Why?

[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:19.060]
Because they got lots of crackers to go with it.

[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:20.540]
Oh, whoa.

[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.560]
Endless to fly.

[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:23.900]
Markets down 500 points.

[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:26.640]
499.71.

[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.140]
501 like I said.

[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:30.220]
Oh, brother.

[02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:31.540]
Oh, my God.

[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:35.560]
Now can you imagine if you got all your money, your life saving side up in that craft?

[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:36.280]
Yeah.

[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:36.500]

[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:37.180]
Yeah.

[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:42.560]
I think that might make some more bacon today.

[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:43.520]
Good.

[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:44.520]
Yeah.

[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:55.220]
On the next break as opposed to going up before it as opposed to going across to the no speaking English store and buying me a big one of those Kings Eye Snickers bars before I drive off to Woodbott.

[02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:55.720]
It's a good plan.

[02:01:56.640 --> 02:01:57.280]
Is it?

[02:01:58.040 --> 02:01:58.780]
I think so.

[02:01:58.960 --> 02:01:59.460]
But you know me.

[02:01:59.520 --> 02:01:59.960]
I'll do both.

[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:00.680]
Probably.

[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:01.840]
What do you think, Chris?

[02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:03.740]
Bacon or Snickers?

[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:04.400]
Bacon.

[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:04.520]
Bacon.

[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.440]
You're making bacon.

[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:10.360]
Bring home the bacon, baby.

[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:13.060]
858 on Chris's pull.

[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:14.080]
He's diluting himself in it.

[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:14.320]
Believe him.

[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:15.220]
We're going to get a thousand votes.

[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:16.120]
So it's not going to happen.

[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:16.860]
Oh, well.

[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:18.060]
I mean, it should.

[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:19.460]
All I need 1.8.

[02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:21.860]
Can't happen.

[02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:23.020]
It could.

[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.420]
1.8 votes per minute.

[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:28.220]
Well, let's read the result.

[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:29.220]
Maybe that'll push people.

[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:31.580]
I mean, everybody should have opinion on OJ.

[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.720]
524 points the markets in the toilet.

[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.040]
And the NASDAQ's down 116.

[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:37.880]
And that's bad.

[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:38.920]
That is read.

[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:41.980]
And the S&P is down 62 and a half points for that jackass.

[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:42.960]
The S&P is up.

[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:43.300]
Neal.

[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:43.440]
Yeah.

[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:44.040]
Up your ass.

[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.040]
858 on the pull.

[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:47.640]
What's your take on the OJ conviction?

[02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.440]
Great.

[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:49.280]
Better late than ever.

[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:50.400]
624.

[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:52.700]
72.7%.

[02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:53.460]
Don't care.

[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:54.140]
151.

[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:55.740]
OJ got screwed.

[02:02:56.020 --> 02:02:56.300]
67.

[02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:57.020]
Yes.

[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:57.660]
Screw this.

[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:01.260]
Can only hope he gets screwed there on the answer.

[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:02.540]
That's why they got a micellaried man.

[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.580]
I bet there are a lot of guys that like to take a red hot poker and stick it where the

[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:07.760]
old cockamoon don't try.

[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.040]
And who's OJ 16?

[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:15.060]
Out of 800 and 60 vote.

[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:18.520]
You need 140 and we got 60 and 20 and 80 minutes.

[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:19.320]
Not going to happen, man.

[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.580]
Unless you really push it.

[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:22.920]
Push it.

[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:23.300]
Get's name.

[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.520]
The best talent.

[02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:25.700]
You don't need to apologize.

The best talent.

[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:32.880]
Are you sure?

[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.360]

[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:41.040]

[02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:42.880]
Rock.

[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:47.100]
I don't believe it's ever been a question

[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:50.600]
That the Jewish man is guilty of sin

[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:59.060]
Maybe when office men's money caught off those two people's heads shut up

[02:04:59.060 --> 02:05:01.140]
Oh, hey shut up

[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:05.980]
You had a bad name and two people died

[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:09.100]
The cheer will let you go but you really shouldn't cry

[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.200]
You shouldn't prop it

[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:14.220]
Not one single sentence because nobody cares

[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:15.920]
You can't afford to pay rent

[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:19.520]
We all want to stay shut up the way

[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.160]
There's no way to spend

[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:25.020]
We're two to three again so I'll chase shut up

[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.860]
Shut up go away

[02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:29.220]
I'm dying over here

[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:31.260]
For a long time, 15 years sounds good to me

[02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:35.080]
530 points on the downside, downside for the dow

[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:37.700]
Not easy to say is it?

[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:38.040]
No

[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:41.260]
I'm making my bacon and when the thing goes off

[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:43.080]
I'm going to get up and run out and give them

[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:43.940]
Having some soup

[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.720]
Don't put a thing full of soup in your mouth

[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:48.940]
Till when?

[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.680]
Till I try to get my bacon because

[02:05:51.060 --> 02:05:53.120]
I'm going to go to the market and then Chris will have to talk

[02:05:53.120 --> 02:05:54.640]
Although I think he's going to crack all the time

[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:57.860]
He can tell a story about how the beast tried to get him fired over the weekend

[02:05:58.560 --> 02:05:58.920]
Again?

[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:00.780]
Again?

[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.920]
I've only told the story like 15 times

[02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:04.800]
Well tell them a couple more times, okay?

[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:07.160]
If George can't fill the page

[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.160]
And then you should post it on your blog

[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:11.460]
Oh, then I have to make one first

[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:13.940]
Yeah, I'm all in there, the audience would love that

[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.960]
I guarantee you you'd get a lot more response in your blog than I got it

[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:19.100]
Oh there's the beep beep beep beep beep beep, okay

[02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:20.660]
See ya

[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:21.600]
Bye

[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:23.340]
I got my soup going

[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:24.720]
Damn

[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:25.960]
You can move things out of the way over here

[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:26.800]
It'll just play a bit then

[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:27.780]
We should

[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:30.260]
Or we could just play a chomping sound

[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:33.480]
You know, you can loop those things

[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.960]
And now, it won't have to press any button at all

[02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.080]
I could do that all day long

[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:42.040]
He could loop anything in here in case you didn't know

[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:42.660]
That's cool

[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:46.400]
In case you were wondering

[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:47.800]
In case you really wanted to kill some time

[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.780]
Like the screams

[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:50.200]
Or the crickets

[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.260]
Or what else would be good this

[02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:57.700]
It's not that successful, this is a pleasure

[02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:00.760]
Okay, so I've been back a lot quicker except that it takes the extra 36 and it's to

[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:04.240]
You know, to tamp it down with the paper towel to get all the fat and the grease off

[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:04.760]
Got to tamp it

[02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:05.800]
Mm-hmm

[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:07.040]
I'll put a tampon

[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:07.780]
I'll tamp it

[02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:08.160]
Uh-huh

[02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:10.480]
Mm-hmm

[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:11.120]
Nice and crispy

[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:13.940]
Too bad you can't get the Schneider as a nukeable, did you ever find any?

[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.960]
No, of course I haven't looked but

[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.100]
You can't find it unless you look for it

[02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:20.800]
This is true

[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:22.720]
Try to tell you that

[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:24.720]
800 A's V-Vo's in fact Chris's pole

[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:25.760]
And the Dow is down 559

[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:28.380]
There is that Henry Waxman with that pig nose

[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:31.360]
You know the congressman from California

[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:32.440]
Yeah

[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:34.240]
He's got a pig nose, you ever see him?

[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:34.660]
No

[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:36.660]
Turn on, turn on and see him right away

[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:38.500]
Oh, er, eat

[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.540]
I might have to do it

[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:41.140]
Oh, yeah, yeah

[02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:42.220]
You're right, it is a pig nose

[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:44.920]
He's a great congressman but he's got a pig nose

[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:45.980]
All right, can I go back to mine?

[02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:47.100]
Soaps now

[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:48.520]
I beg your pardon?

[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:49.840]
Booby soap operas

[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:52.960]
And even go back to your booby soap operas

[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:53.260]
Thank you

[02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:53.680]
Oh

[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:56.140]
Look at all the grease

[02:07:57.800 --> 02:07:58.740]
From his bacon

[02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:01.420]
Here's an email from Danny

[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:04.240]
It says listen to Georgia Show on Friday

[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:05.340]
He was talking about the documentary

[02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:06.060]
Why we fight

[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:08.520]
And after bringing it up on you

[02:08:09.420 --> 02:08:09.820]
Tube

[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:12.280]
And watching I have three words to describe it

[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.120]
Absolutely correct

[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:14.560]
Absolutely correct

[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:15.460]
Keep up the good fight

[02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:16.480]
We're fighting

[02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:17.540]
It's a radio show

[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:19.060]
That's all we're not going to change the world here

[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:20.320]
It's a radio show

[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:20.900]
Mosque 11

[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:21.960]
That's all we're making a living

[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:23.140]
Sub of us

[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:24.600]
Chris

[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:26.080]
Chris is making a good living

[02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:26.860]
Till he gets fired

[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:27.440]
It's a good news

[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:30.080]
Yeah, till he opens up a big mouth of clearance

[02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:32.000]
Just remember, clearance and the beast

[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.080]
Our tightest tightest can be

[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.980]
I wonder if I have a newborn baby

[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:39.640]
What?

[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:42.600]
I wonder if I go on unemployment if I get a raise

[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:43.980]
Probably

[02:08:43.980 --> 02:08:48.060]
I would think so

[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:50.120]
What did I say?

[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:51.760]
I said we're going for 900 votes today

[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:52.760]
We got an EADD3

[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:54.980]
See, I know not to get carried away

[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.120]
You on the other hand

[02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:58.940]
Didn't you say we don't get a thousand you're quitting?

[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:00.800]
I did

[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.260]
We doesn't get a thousand he's getting fired

[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:04.820]
That might be what it is

[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:06.520]
I think even if he gets 10,000 votes under

[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:07.400]
He's still getting fired

[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:11.880]
You got some nerve picking a spat with the beast

[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:15.520]
I didn't pick you with him

[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:16.240]
He picked it with me

[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:19.480]
Like I said, quit picking on the beast

[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:23.800]
Like that email, quit picking on Sarah

[02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.380]
From that idiot Edward Sniskey

[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:29.340]
Moron, Simpleton

[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:32.960]
And like I said, nobody with any brains

[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.220]
He keeps listening here, we did somebody that they despise

[02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:37.720]
Somebody they refine repulsive and obnoxious

[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:39.580]
Speak for itself

[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:44.600]
No messages in the earth view right now

[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.880]
Email, nealandnearodges.com

[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:48.480]
It's pretty weak, pretty disappointing

[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:53.700]
Here's one from us, some queen Jason

[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:58.180]
This is our apologies, I've only had the opportunity to listen to it for an hour

[02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.620]
So if you mention this already please disregard

[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:01.240]
No, I have not

[02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:04.660]
We saw an excellent film this weekend, Religilus

[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.620]
A satire commentary documentary

[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:08.220]
Which I've seen all the ads forward with Bill Mar

[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:09.740]
That's why I haven't seen it

[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.280]
I'm not a huge fan of Mar in general

[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:15.180]
But this film was terrific, you see in it George?

[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:16.980]
No, it's not the previous though

[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:17.500]
It looks interesting

[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:20.860]
I might have to choke down my hatred of him and give it a watch

[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:21.460]
Be cool

[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:25.620]
Maybe you can give me a bogus calming a compu

[02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:26.980]
Let me get to work on that

[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:28.620]
The movie posts fun at all religions

[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.640]
But spends a great deal of time on fundamental Christians, Catholics, etc

[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:35.260]
And somebody once said, never underestimate this stupidity of the American public

[02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.460]
I think both you and George would enjoy this film a great deal

[02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:38.380]
We'll watch it

[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:41.520]
Currently it's playing out the gateway in Lauderdale

[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:42.880]
I'm sure it must be in Toronto as well

[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:43.700]
Yes it is, eh?

[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:48.480]
In any event fellow queer here, well in that case Jason, you're fairy

[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:53.420]
I'm in an LTR long term relationship for 15 years with someone 20 years older than me

[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:55.500]
I've always had a thing for older guys

[02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:59.120]
Must confess, wait, now wait till you get to this part

[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:01.540]
I want you to strap yourself in otherwise you'll fall on the floor

[02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:02.620]
Alright, I'll strap myself on

[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:03.460]
In laughter

[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.700]
Must confess, I always thought you were a very handsome guy with a quick wit and admire will elect

[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:38.660]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:45.700]
So I said I had dinner with a Humper on Saturday night. Yeah you did it. I would find no items in this view.

[02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:55.820]
Can you imagine back in the day when we really had an audience? How does email thing would have been? How great that would have been? Wow.

[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:06.980]
WQ I am hello. That people definitely know their puppy pastry. Now let's stop talking to all those gay talkers. Talk about the deafens.

[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:27.340]
Yeah that's as gay as it gets. Love the dolphins. Gay. Well who cares? Who cares what you love? Drop dead. Schmuck. Love the dolphins. Well good. How much did you love him last year when he won one game? Well I won two games this year. So they got a big improvement already. Who cares what you love? Schmuck. WQ I am hello.

[02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:56.060]
Yeah you blew it. I was with Larry. Can I show you the picture tomorrow? I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with Larry. I was with

[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:25.940]
Larry. I was with Larry. I was withView heel. You don't have to pull your feet. You don't have to pull your feet that hard. That's how so there's history in the world Japan. What'd you get at that time? What'd you get at that time? What'd you get at that time? What'd you get at that time? What'd you get at that time? What'd you get at that time? What'd you get at that time? What'd you get at that time? A time? How'd you get at that time? Oh? That's about the doctor? Oh! That's about the doctor? Oh? That's about the doctor? Oh! That's about the doctor? Oh! That's about the doctor? Oh! That happens to me. That? It's about a time for the doctor? What could you get at that time? Oh! That's about the doctor? This? It's about the doctor? Oh? That happens to me? Well, he's shooting passion out of Catherine gegenüber and how

[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:28.140]
But his bacon is pretty good.

[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:31.840]
Oh, and look at that.

[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:33.520]
Now the phone is lighting up like a Christmas tree.

[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:34.420]
I took a couple more calls.

[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:36.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:39.080]
Just because there's a dearth of emails.

[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:40.940]
No, no items in this view.

[02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:42.840]
You know what that means?

[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:43.700]
What?

[02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:47.940]
It means email thing is dying.

[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:48.900]
Or wicked death.

[02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:51.060]
And it means you're going to be...

[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:52.420]
Well, you're the one that started

[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:53.700]
by taking a lot of calls on Friday.

[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:54.620]
That's right.

[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.140]
Did you take a lot of calls?

[02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:57.060]
I took some.

[02:13:57.660 --> 02:14:00.040]
SUDs came in also, you know, so I didn't have to.

[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:01.240]
Oh, SUDs came in.

[02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:01.940]
Now I see.

[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:03.580]
I know how to cheat.

[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:06.520]
And on the radio too.

[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:08.140]
WQAM, hello.

[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:10.300]
Emil, because we live in South Florida.

[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:12.220]
I think they give us four positive experiences.

[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:13.000]
We're next to Cuba.

[02:14:16.900 --> 02:14:17.460]
WQAM, hello.

[02:14:17.540 --> 02:14:18.640]
Yeah, I'm voting for fancri.

[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:20.400]
Uh-huh.

[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.040]
Easy, because he's a good boarder.

[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:22.840]
Keep you in there.

[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:23.880]
Okay.

[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:24.460]
Thank you.

[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:27.020]
And that's the poll on the phone.

[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:28.120]
Fancri, Chris, or the beast?

[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:30.120]
Who's going to get canned first?

[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:34.380]
So your nose is just his nothing right-ass.

[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.100]
That's your problem.

[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:36.280]
Oh, well.

[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:38.020]
If you'd be in there with clearance,

[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:40.160]
kissing his ass like the beast is in all these years.

[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:41.640]
Well, the next word he was letting.

[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:42.060]
Huh?

[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:43.400]
So it's been nice working with you.

[02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:48.180]
So who are we going to have?

[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:48.680]
Flea?

[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:51.300]
No, he hasn't always got a real job.

[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:54.500]
I mean, he might do, you know, do some fill-in work

[02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:55.300]
when we need somebody.

[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:56.680]
He's laying to fill in?

[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:57.820]
I'm sure he is.

[02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:58.300]
He's one of yours.

[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:00.820]
He's gay.

[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:02.920]
Well, you're the one who said that.

[02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:04.000]
Does his wife know that?

[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:06.120]
No, he's in the client.

[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:06.980]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:07.580]
Not quite.

[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:08.040]
What do you mean?

[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:08.460]
Good.

[02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.000]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:11.240]
Hey, Neil.

[02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:13.000]
How's it going?

[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:13.860]
Okay.

[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:15.220]
Uh-huh.

[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:16.540]
We can, do you have a go-wikens?

[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:17.180]
Great.

[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:18.080]
Sensational.

[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:18.660]
What?

[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:19.800]
How about you?

[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:20.540]
You have a life?

[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:23.140]
Oh, I got a life.

[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:24.480]
Neil.

[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:25.320]
Yeah.

[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:27.440]
Did you watch the doctor's birthday yesterday?

[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:28.300]
No, I did not.

[02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:30.620]
The big tuna man, he's the same as the other.

[02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:32.100]
Yeah, tuna, tuna stinks, man.

[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:34.380]
Tuna stinks like rotten, like holy mackerel.

[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.140]
What biggest name?

[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:37.300]
The best talent.

[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:38.620]
He don't live in your projects.

[02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:40.980]
Sporting your 560 QAM.

[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:42.760]
The fourth leader.

[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:44.440]
The biggest name.

[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.040]
The best talent.

[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:46.600]
Right.

[02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:51.860]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.

[02:15:51.940 --> 02:15:54.120]
I am a fourth-lother day.

[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.800]
It's not just the one to two-hour.

[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:57.160]
It's a phenomenon.

[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:00.060]
This is I with the stew.

[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:02.880]
Among the world leaders gathering at the UN General Assembly,

[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:04.180]
our Republican Vice President,

[02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:05.460]
you can't answer a palan,

[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:07.220]
and the president of Afghanistan.

[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.440]
Listen to what he said.

[02:16:08.820 --> 02:16:09.240]
I'm a Muslim.

[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000]
Do you like hockey?

[02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:12.320]
Do you live in Alaska?

[02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:13.040]
Yes.

[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:15.160]
I'm a hockeyman from Alaska.

[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:19.020]
Do you see Russia from Alaska?

[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:19.800]
Yes.

[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:23.940]
You can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska.

[02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:25.600]
How does it look like?

[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:28.400]
What is your foreign policy experience?

[02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:30.500]
I got involved in the PTA.

[02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:33.340]
Quick photo-op with no questions from the media.

[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:34.680]
Very little chance.

[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:35.440]
She'll stumble.

[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:39.560]
What is the difference between you and President Bush?

[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:40.800]
Lipstick.

[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:45.140]
One o'clock at 560 WQAM is our gigantic 1-2 hour.

[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:46.640]
Anybody believe that?

[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:47.000]
No.

[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:47.840]
It is.

[02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:49.280]
A rat.

[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:53.100]
I think what we ought to do is we ought to have like the hidden microphone.

[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:55.140]
Or we're going to hide it.

[02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:58.880]
In Clarence's office so that when Chris goes in there after the show,

[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:00.880]
is that when your meeting is right after the show?

[02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:01.280]
Correct.

[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:03.820]
In Clarence's office?

[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:05.160]
I guess.

[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:06.020]
Correct him.

[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:09.960]
If I was you, I'd stick my nose way up in there, man.

[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:10.800]
No, it's okay.

[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:13.060]
Until it comes up to his neck.

[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:14.380]
Butter your ears.

[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:15.240]
Not okay.

[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:16.580]
Butter boy.

[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:20.040]
Butter up.

[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:20.780]
Yeah.

[02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:22.660]
Tell me you want a butter paycheck every two weeks.

[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:24.260]
Which I ain't saying much.

[02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:26.320]
Matt says, fat rich, perfect.

[02:17:27.300 --> 02:17:28.180]
I don't know what that means.

[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:33.440]
I know he was a good friend of yours and actually threw in a fat rich line during the lightning round when you were on IOD.

[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:40.300]
Something about changing the McDonald's million-served sign after rich went through the drive through with his caddy ordered a million burgers.

[02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:41.980]
Well, Rich never had a caddy but nevertheless.

[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:45.440]
I used to go to the appearance and actually spoke to Rich once.

[02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:51.200]
Unfortunately, it was right after speaking to Gilbert so my memory is a tad soiled, kind of like you're underpants occasionally.

[02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:56.040]
Love you Uncle Neil, F. Joyce, F. Jolly Joe, F. Clarence, F. My Brother Robin Newport.

[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:58.960]
Is it just me or does Joe Rosalind like Kermit the Frog when he sings?

[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:00.740]
I can't reach the off button fast enough.

[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:02.800]
You'll feel like you bought from the factory!

[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:05.980]
Gobama says, um, Matt.

[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:07.360]
Thanks, Matt.

[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:10.440]
Yeah, he does sound like Kermit the Frog.

[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.740]
Like any literate Kermit the Frog.

[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:18.340]
When he starts talking about the electric bill, I just, it just sends me into orbit, you know.

[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:21.120]
You get a monthly electric bill?

[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:21.780]
Yeah.

[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:24.160]
Electric?

[02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:24.840]
Electric.

[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:26.200]
A positive L.

[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:30.220]
MNFNOP.

[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:30.700]
Yeah.

[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:31.960]
What he's trying to mean is fine tobacco.

[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:33.820]
LSMFT.

[02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:38.900]
Mike says, I'm an airline pilot for an international cargo company.

[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:41.660]
The emails by the way are coming in by the ones they're pouring in.

[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:43.840]
Not by the ones.

[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:46.280]
Thank you for the free list on the internet.

[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.800]
I've been a fan since 84 when I arrived here from Fully.

[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:51.460]
Remember Jerry Blavett, the greeter with the heater, no, I don't.

[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:54.880]
And then says he's dead.

[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:55.400]
Well, whatever.

[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:57.920]
I recall that he's following Hurricane Andrew.

[02:18:57.980 --> 02:18:59.060]
I live near Tammy and me airport.

[02:18:59.220 --> 02:18:59.980]
We got clobbered.

[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.440]
Listen to you on the transistor radio.

[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.240]
It brought a semblance of normalcy to my world turned upside down.

[02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:07.700]
When I find myself in Europe, Asia or South America, the hour is correct.

[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:10.320]
I listen in and enjoy your familiar enjoyable style.

[02:19:11.260 --> 02:19:13.840]
We also fly to the desert quite often in support of our troops.

[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:17.640]
And I find myself sitting in a hotel in Bahrain or Dubai for several days.

[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:20.640]
Your show may be a little bit racy for people in the Middle East.

[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:22.860]
So I keep the volume down, but I laugh out loud.

[02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:25.660]
Yeah, those Middle East like the Saudis, man, kill them.

[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:30.840]
Get them over there before they get us over here at M Saudis.

[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:36.080]
And these nose packies, my God, they're fudge packing is what they're doing.

[02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:40.860]
That was down 546, a nasty day on Wall Street, nasty.

[02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:42.260]
Woo!

[02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:46.080]
I watched the debate last week from Santiago Chilli.

[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:47.380]
They have CNN wherever we go.

[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:51.200]
And just because Pailin didn't step on her thing, she's declared to be the winner.

[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:51.780]
Question mark.

[02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:53.520]
No, she wasn't declared by anybody to be the winner.

[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:58.240]
That was the thing that astonished me is that she didn't fall down and drool.

[02:19:58.240 --> 02:20:02.560]
And that in spite of that, just about everybody, every poll I saw, by an overwhelming, was the winner.

[02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:03.720]
Am I correct?

[02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:04.320]
Yes.

[02:20:05.180 --> 02:20:08.480]
And they pull numbers for over when we came, went down.

[02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:11.400]
And the people rating for Pailin went down.

[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:11.700]
Yeah.

[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:13.360]
Gotta go down before I go on up.

[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.520]
Miami, Mike says the dumbing of America never ceases to amaze me.

[02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:20.700]
Never underestimate this stupidity of the American people.

[02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:23.040]
Keep up the good work, fan to this, you're wherever my may be.

[02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:23.940]
That's another thing.

[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:27.480]
How come we don't get like Mike obviously gets around.

[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:29.080]
He's a world traveler, which is great.

[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.180]
I mean, we've got people who listen all over the world on the internet.

[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:34.880]
Right?

[02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:35.580]
Yep.

[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:38.720]
How come we don't get a lot of emails from them?

[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:40.920]
Good point.

[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:46.360]
Like in Saudi Arabia, although if they're listening in Saudi Arabia, they probably have the radio real, real quiet.

[02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:48.120]
Yeah.

[02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:49.100]
Yes, he's in iPhones.

[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:54.640]
Tommy T's got a long, long, long, long thing here.

[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:56.440]
Oh, and it's from Dave Barry.

[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:59.980]
Well, the day that I read Dave Barry on here will be the last show I'll guarantee you that.

[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:01.480]
Dave Barry.

[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:02.660]
He's real funny.

[02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:04.840]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:06.420]
Almost as funny as Bill Mar.

[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:09.000]
That movie might be pretty good though.

[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:10.560]
We got to get it and we got to see it.

[02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:12.380]
Even though it is him.

[02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:13.260]
You know what I mean?

[02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:14.000]
Yep.

[02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:17.180]
Oh, but you're wrong.

[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:18.520]
Bill Mar is a genius.

[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:19.100]
Yeah.

[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:19.660]
Okay, whatever.

[02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:20.920]
Just like what's your name?

[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:22.020]
Rachel Maddow.

[02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:22.520]
What's his name?

[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:23.760]
Mm-hmm.

[02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:25.780]
Leaves me limp.

[02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:26.920]
Awful.

[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:27.780]
Just awful.

[02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:30.960]
You know, one thing about...

[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:31.480]
Wow, what?

[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:36.840]
You know, she at least had a little bit of stuccoca of her own as opposed to just trying to be a carbon copy of me.

[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:40.560]
But Rachel Maddow makes no bones about it.

[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.240]
I mean, she's just Keith Overman, Jr.

[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:46.820]
Just like the Prime Minister here, Steven Harper.

[02:21:47.020 --> 02:21:47.900]
He's George Bush, Jr.

[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:53.640]
Name withheld on this...

[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:54.940]
What is that all about?

[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:55.560]
Name withheld.

[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.040]
They don't want you to know their name.

[02:21:57.420 --> 02:21:57.820]
Well, why not?

[02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.040]
Well, how about making up one?

[02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:03.760]
Neil God, this town sucks the stock markets in the toilet again.

[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.740]
Thanks, President A.H. Bushmeister.

[02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:07.140]
I hope he can sleep at night.

[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:08.280]
I hope he chokes on his money.

[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:11.340]
The drivers are, well, you know, you got to get out of this hole at the right time.

[02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:15.940]
No one is emailing because they're all jumping out of tall buildings because their 401k is toilet paper.

[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:20.720]
He's a worth going on or should I join him?

[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:22.080]
Name withheld, join them.

[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:23.880]
Name withheld killed himself today.

[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.580]
It says, gotta go take a big joyous love you always.

[02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:29.800]
Isn't this sad?

[02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:31.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:35.900]
Feed us some of your own material.

[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:39.100]
I know you don't have any, but feed us something.

[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:40.600]
I had my bacon.

[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:41.180]
It was pretty good.

[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:43.700]
Now, at the end of the show, I'm going to go running over to my...

[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:45.400]
No speaking English can be in store one.

[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:45.580]
Yeah.

[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:46.620]
Maybe I won't.

[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:49.760]
So you just don't talk to them at all.

[02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:54.700]
You just buy what you want and put the money down and there's no question in English.

[02:22:55.840 --> 02:23:00.540]
What I'm saying is that with people in New York, occasionally, they'll ask her for something

[02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:01.880]
and she doesn't know what they're talking about.

[02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:03.720]
And then she'll say, oh, no speaking English.

[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:05.800]
But they're Chinese, right?

[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:06.500]
Right.

[02:23:06.740 --> 02:23:06.920]
Okay.

[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:07.740]
You say, Ni Hao.

[02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:10.920]
At least.

[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:11.260]

[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:11.520]
Okay.

[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:13.200]
That's just fine.

[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:14.820]
I can get with them just fine over there.

[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:16.980]
They've got a few bucks and they're glad to take it.

[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:19.340]
And the husband always overcharges or tries to.

[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:21.040]
Oh, made a mistake.

[02:23:21.220 --> 02:23:22.200]
Oh, sorry, made a mistake.

[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:23.200]
Oh, no.

[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:24.220]
Oh.

[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:25.180]
K-Posa.

[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:26.880]
And the whole pile fell through the slot.

[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:27.680]
Oh, no.

[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:30.260]
You're going to have to bend over.

[02:23:31.320 --> 02:23:33.580]
That's real tough for you fat people with big fat.

[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:34.220]
You got to the slot.

[02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:35.360]
You know what's the slot or cost?

[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:36.540]
No.

[02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:37.980]
Quarter.

[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:39.480]
Oh.

[02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:41.560]
I was hoping to win.

[02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:42.180]
Quarter or slot.

[02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:42.540]
Yeah.

[02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:49.300]
Oh, and maybe there's something good in this pile.

[02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:52.220]
Oh, seven state workers now would read a test if I

[02:23:52.220 --> 02:23:53.020]
Intuburgate probe.

[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.380]
That's on top of my pile.

[02:23:56.800 --> 02:24:00.940]
But much more important than that is Cornel says, oh, J's got to be the biggest idiot known to man.

[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:03.640]
Oh, he's no Joe Bell.

[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:04.320]
I'll tell you that.

[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:06.800]
Boy, you should have heard me and Hank ripen Joe Bell and ask it.

[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:07.860]
And then there's Saturday night it was great.

[02:24:08.860 --> 02:24:11.180]
And like I told the Humper, I don't ripen behind his back.

[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:12.280]
I just do it right on the ear.

[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:14.320]
Or right to his face.

[02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:17.460]
Hey, Joe, you fat ass.

[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:22.240]
When you look up that word in any language, this picture will appear idiot.

[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:25.940]
The average person who can get away with murder would lay low for the rest of their lives.

[02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:26.480]
Not OJ.

[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:31.720]
If you ever see him in person, you would marvel at that big ass head he has and wonder why there aren't any brains in it.

[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:40.620]
When he dies, they must perform brain surgery on dumb ass so we can recognize stupidity and future generations before childbirth and maybe find a way to eliminate it with drugs.

[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:45.300]
Too bad those knees are gone because he's going to need them to get away from fellows in prison.

[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:50.520]
Someday we'll see videos of him dressed like Nicole and being used and abused by some six five three hundred pounder.

[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:53.060]
Go Obama now says Cornel.

[02:24:53.180 --> 02:24:53.760]
Thanks Cornel.

[02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:56.680]
909 on the pole, Chris.

[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:57.860]
You got a shot at 950.

[02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:02.140]
If we don't get to 950, Chris is retiring.

[02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:03.340]
Retire.

[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:06.040]
What do you say?

[02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:12.600]
Um, I'm trying to remember if I can afford to retire.

[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:13.220]
I think that's a no.

[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:16.060]
525 on the downside for the down, not good.

[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:16.900]
Nish good, baby.

[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:17.760]
Nish good.

[02:25:18.820 --> 02:25:22.760]
They passed that bailout bill and looks like they're not bailing them themselves out.

[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.000]
Looks like the people are peeing in their pantaloons.

[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:34.460]
Seven Alaska State employees have reversed course and agreed to testify and an investigation into whether Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah.

[02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:35.760]
Can I call you Joe?

[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:36.380]
Palin.

[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:41.280]
Abused her powers by a family commissioner who refused to dismiss her former brother-in-law.

[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:44.500]
But she started doing the winking thing and starting to talk about Joe six pack.

[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:46.540]
At that point I felt like losing meals.

[02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:48.440]
Upchukin for hours.

[02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:53.540]
Joe six pack my ass and the hockey moms and America hockey moms.

[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:57.220]
Talk about cornpone.

[02:25:58.060 --> 02:25:59.320]
Talk about redneck.

[02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:02.140]
Talk about trailer trash.

[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:11.200]
There is no indication now over that Palin or her husband will not agree to testify about the case, which is dog to her for the past several months and could hurt John McCain in the final weeks of the race.

[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:23.520]
Palin is the focus of a legislative inquiry over her firing of public safety commissioner Walt Monaghan a year after she or husband and key advisors began questioning him about getting rid of a state trooper who had gone through an nasty divorce with her suicide.

[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:23.920]
She was a former sister.

[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:25.860]
Trailer trash.

[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:32.060]
It's like what was that like dynasty or a Dallas one of those old TV nighttime soaps.

[02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:35.720]
Falcon Cris that was the one with Lorenzo Lamas.

[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:36.540]
Yes he does.

[02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:39.480]
Who you hate and I like a lot or at least I used to.

[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:40.580]
I'm sure you know it looks so good anymore.

[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:43.700]
He was one of the prettiest guys.

[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:45.600]
He wasn't as pretty as Matt the castle.

[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:47.860]
Now I take that back. He was prettier.

[02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:50.700]
I would mind seeing Matt castle naked.

[02:26:51.980 --> 02:26:52.340]
Okay.

[02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:58.040]
Well I mean why not let me in the locker room for quite a while Chris arrange that would you?

[02:26:58.160 --> 02:26:58.220]
Yeah.

[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:00.680]
When's the Patriots game at Miami?

[02:27:01.620 --> 02:27:02.440]
I can look it up.

[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:05.920]
Maybe by then we'll have our act together a little bit all the way down it.

[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:10.160]
Yeah look it up.

[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:11.200]
Look at that kid.

[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:11.400]

[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:17.040]
917 don't forget we need to get 950 or Chris ain't coming back ever again.

[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:19.520]
I would have talked about this as there a website too.

[02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:20.800]
I'm making fun.

[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:22.680]
I wonder if Josh Cortes is there with a few.

[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:25.120]
Forget the website they have another one of those like things you have to watch.

[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:30.440]
I'm not sending that check.

[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:33.640]
No I got it.

[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:34.080]
I got it.

[02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:34.780]
You know.

[02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:41.380]
Here's one from Santa.

[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:45.380]
I want to thank you for mentioning Schneider's hot dogs and saying how good they are.

[02:27:45.380 --> 02:27:51.420]
I haven't seen the dogs down here for but publics does have Schneider's Canadian bacon slices in the rexland.

[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:52.080]
How do you like that?

[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:54.980]
You might find my nukeable bacon in publics.

[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:56.260]
November 23rd 1pm.

[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:57.480]
Oh I'll be there.

[02:27:57.980 --> 02:27:59.580]
I'll be in the locker room to greet Matt.

[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:01.040]
Greet and eat meat.

[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:01.900]
Meet and greet.

[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:04.100]
And eat.

[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:05.980]
Thank God for you and you.

[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:09.640]
The best thing is out for us to offer a level Bama and my mama.

[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:10.340]
This is Santo.

[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:11.340]
Yamama.

[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:13.660]
So socks and hell they are.

[02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:15.180]
The biggest name.

[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:16.260]
The best talent.

[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:17.580]
You're a busy little object.

[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:19.920]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:21.740]
The sports leader.

[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:23.160]
The biggest name.

[02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:24.320]
The best talent.

[02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:24.680]
Yes.

[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:25.760]
It's the big dog.

[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:26.600]
Joros.

[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.040]
We dim morning 7 o'clock.

[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:31.040]

[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:33.840]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:35.980]
The sports leader.

[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:37.080]
Kill the cold.

[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:38.240]
The ramblings went on.

[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:39.700]
They passed a lot of technical tests.

[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:40.020]
You know what?

[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:42.040]
Nobody believes it.

[02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:42.700]
Mr. Bant.

[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:44.320]
You know, so if I'm not going to benefit,

[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:47.180]
I'm not going to be some bands and wonky for you guys.

[02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:48.660]
OJ, Mr. Bant said.

[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:49.780]
I'm going to pass it to begin with.

[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.500]
What makes you think you could pass it now?

[02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:52.320]
Simple.

[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:52.940]
Sign off.

[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:55.000]
Tell me I do keep somebody that makes me feel good.

[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:55.760]
What makes you think you could pass it now?

[02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:56.740]
You murdered Nicole.

[02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:58.880]
And you know you did it.

[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:01.380]
And you know, I mean, you're just amazing.

[02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:04.820]
And you, what have you ever given me, OJ?

[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:07.800]
You've never given me a damn penny.

[02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:07.800]

[02:29:08.280 --> 02:29:09.260]
You've never given me a damn penny.

[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:10.200]
You've never given me a damn penny.

[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:12.680]
You've never given me a damn penny.

[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:13.300]
You're a pig.

[02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:14.580]
You're a love line.

[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:15.240]
No good.

[02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:15.540]
Why?

[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:16.400]
Son of a gun.

[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:18.180]
Oh, wait, you know, you're pathetic.

[02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:19.100]
You guys, that's no.

[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:19.860]
You're pathetic.

[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:21.980]
No, you and Fred Goma.

[02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:23.440]
I never go on TV.

[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:25.800]
I avoid the media as much as I can.

[02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:26.420]
They chase me.

[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:29.380]
You guys, if it's a door opening, you guys are showing up.

[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:34.720]
OJ, you're the only person that's benefited from this Denise.

[02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:37.020]
You never gave me a damn penny.

[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:38.260]
You are the only one.

[02:29:38.520 --> 02:29:40.320]
You and I, we didn't get along.

[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:43.080]
We didn't get along because you couldn't control me.

[02:29:43.380 --> 02:29:43.980]
That's why I wanted to get along.

[02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:47.180]
Oh, no, I didn't get along because the court was afraid you were going to have sex with me.

[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.600]
That's why I didn't get along.

[02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:49.040]
Oh, please.

[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:49.940]
It was the colonel who just filled with me.

[02:29:49.940 --> 02:29:53.640]
I'm pleased your ego is just really riding a little bit too high, son of son.

[02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:55.320]
Oh, his ego is bigger than his ****.

[02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:56.280]
Yeah.

[02:29:58.940 --> 02:30:00.180]
117.560 WQ.

[02:30:00.180 --> 02:30:01.220]
I'm happy Monday to you.

[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:01.720]
Just relax.

[02:30:01.940 --> 02:30:02.620]
Okay, cheer up.

[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:04.660]
Thousand five thirty eight.

[02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:05.760]
What, what, what difference does it make?

[02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:06.140]
Okay.

[02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:07.840]
So we're going to be in a gigantic depression.

[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:10.080]
Right?

[02:30:10.900 --> 02:30:11.040]
Yeah.

[02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:12.420]
Life goes on.

[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.240]
You still got things to look forward to like, you know, like death.

[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:18.460]
I got some bad news though.

[02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:19.720]
I'm trying to keep it light.

[02:30:19.860 --> 02:30:20.640]
Keep it light, Neil.

[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:21.700]
Keep it right.

[02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:26.080]
Because people are, you know, they're bummed out, man.

[02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:28.140]
We're going through some tough economic times.

[02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:31.180]
And people are wondering if they're going to have two nickels to rub together.

[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:32.640]
Uh-huh.

[02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:36.880]
Original carb, ice cream, shop and a heart still closes up for good.

[02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:37.820]
Oh, no.

[02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:43.700]
The original carb, ice cream, it's last cones yesterday.

[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:48.200]
More than seven decades after becoming the suburban New York birthplace of an ice cream empire.

[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:50.560]
And you're the one that's always sticking up for Carvelle.

[02:30:51.540 --> 02:30:51.680]
Me?

[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:52.920]
I think.

[02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:54.920]
I said it's real ice cream.

[02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:55.920]
Yeah, right.

[02:30:56.160 --> 02:30:56.880]
It's a push of dairy queen.

[02:30:57.320 --> 02:30:57.500]
All right.

[02:30:58.660 --> 02:30:59.280]
It blows.

[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:00.940]
I didn't say that.
