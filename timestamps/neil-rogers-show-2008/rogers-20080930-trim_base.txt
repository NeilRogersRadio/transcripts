[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.120]
Scared to hell because I hit a button there and all of a sudden that thing fired off scared me

[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.720]
I scared

[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.660]
Well, you know something there are some people that just don't get it

[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.360]
But it's Russia show us so naturally even though the world is allegedly coming to an end as we used to know it

[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.400]
Well, we got to put on the Yamaha and go drink some wine and Baruch at all to know it all this other crap

[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.180]
There's Barney Fag and then the Diane Feinstein and Russ Feingold those are the only three

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.520]
Jewish members of Congress I can think of at the moment

[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.920]
Can you think of any other ones? Nope

[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.420]
Arlen Spector is he Jewish he must be what a horrible thought oh and of course Jew Lieberman. I forgot about him

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.660]
Trying maybe half a dozen

[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.100]
And all of a sudden well, it's a Russian son or it's the Jewish share holy day, you know

[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.620]
This is just a bunch of crap

[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.480]
In fact the one of the emails here this morning, they sure aren't a lot of them

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.660]
There's a lot of crap under today, but nothing are useful

[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.600]
Sam says no religion type of holidays worth another trillion dollar loss

[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.960]
I'll just relax Sam the markets are bouncing back nicely

[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.660]
An anticipation of the deal we're gonna make a deal on Thursday the wheel deal the wheel deal

[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.520]
That's right whatever happened to that goofball the wheel deal

Remember that yeah, sure, what do you think I keep saying that?

[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.360]
What wheel deal

[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.560]
Of course, we remember the Jewish segment of this Congress couldn't skip running around the house with the arm liquor for a day

[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.020]
We have the same mentality as the Middle East Rome is burning and we still must pray prayer and kosher dinner should be back seat to the problem

[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.440]
We're in kosher dinners or a vase mere

[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.800]
I feel like I'm going to the senator's houses bust in and rip the beanie off their heads right in the middle

[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.380]
They're happy meal and stomping on the ground then drag them to the Senate building get to work says Sam amen Sam amen

[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.680]
Don't be messing with jr. Okay, it's the it's the high-holiday holiday holy day

[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.420]
So bunch of crap like all the other holidays like all the other religious garbage

[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.640]
Monish tana halalahize as they say in Ethiopia

[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.500]
How's hailey salasi doing by the way?

[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.120]
Here's the poll from yesterday and some of these people I was I

[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.900]
Just knew this was gonna happen

[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.400]
I'll find it in my stack of email they're ain't that many of them

[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.120]
Oh, that's right. We got to do what I give them the result of the poll that we ended yesterday well

[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.020]
We'll get to that

[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.260]
Here it is

[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.680]
Here it is once again showing these people just don't understand it the poll question is the one we did

[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.660]
Are doing now who is or was the greatest play-by-play sportscaster of all time and let me tell you people sure don't know your sports casters

[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.020]
That's because most of you have been sheltered I guess in South Florida for too long or maybe never got out

[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.240]
And Paul sends me an email yesterday saying Neil you left out Howard Cosell and jack buck. I'll admit. I thought about

[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.100]
Omitting jack buck yesterday

[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.260]
Jack buck was great. He was a voice of the Rochester Red Wings before he went to the state movies cardinals

[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.600]
He was good. He was great. He's dead

[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.720]
Joe buck is his son just like what's his name is the son of a bitch

[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.360]
What's his name what's his name? I don't know

[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.720]
But Howard Cosell was a play-by-play broadcaster

[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.540]
He did boxing. I know that but that's blow-by-blow and I played by play that's that's the different horse of a different color

[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.580]
Calling a boxing match

[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.280]
Down goes phrasia down goes phrasia remember that no no

[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.760]
I bet you I bet you frat chris has heard that I've heard it. Yeah down goes phrasia

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.760]
He was good at that, but he wasn't a play-by-play guy

[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.680]
He was a commentator

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.200]
He was a commentator don't you omit people understand the difference between the color guy or a commentator or a

[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.420]
Carmage or whatever the hell he was Howard Cosell. He wasn't a play-by-play man. Jesus God Paul

[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.180]
You come up with a decent pull that somebody actually might like and right away well

[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.900]
We don't understand and you left out this wooden that way. Yeah screw you screw you

[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.420]
Like I said yesterday so many dumb people walking around on the loose

[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.040]
And

[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.160]
Then I went to wood mine last night and won twenty three hundred dollars

[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.020]
Aren't you proud of me as perch the way the economy is right now, man

[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.060]
You can't win too much at your local race. You know

[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.940]
You can't win too much and especially here where they don't tax any of it

[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.320]
Got me a good machine mine gave me five hundred twice and then it gave me three hundred on the line and it gave me a

[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.180]
1500 on the line 1500

[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.500]
I think I'm going to spend the whole show from now on talking about my exploits at wood mine tonne

[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.280]
I'm going to start writing down every pull every play

[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:30.420]
Nice that five times five times triple bar 1500 beans and they paid me my money and I arrived flew out of there

[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.180]
I put on my wings and I flew out

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.160]
I raced to my beautiful Corvette and zip-to-m

[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.220]
Anyway, here was the pull that we interrupted who who do you think I won the first presidential debate

[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.360]
186 votes Obama 599 55.1 percent it was a draw

[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.140]
17.2 percent didn't watch it 142

[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.460]
McCain 94 8.6 percent for old insane McCain

[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.300]
Who did a hell of a job?

[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.780]
I wanted to suspend his campaign old insane McCain and call off the debate tried to weasel out of it

[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.640]
Because he had a rush back to Washington to save the bailout deal well

[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.720]
As you did a hell of a job with his Republican colleagues in the house didn't he not

[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.140]
He just keeps shooting himself in a foot

[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.680]
Old insane McCain and it's already Tuesday. We're getting closer and closer to the Thursday night

[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.920]
How about you even George is going to watch that maybe although I might be out

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.440]
And don't care 64

[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.000]
Then don't care about the debate. They don't care about anything 64 5.8 percent

[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.560]
Okay, now let's get to the day's pull. Let me let me read it again. Okay. I'm not making any additions

[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.620]
It's a little bit late for that wouldn't you think I think yeah

[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.600]
How many votes we got on their Chris?

[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.580]
654

[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.920]
Six six what happened to Chris six six one six six one

[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.700]
Whoo

[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:59.080]
Well, I printed it out one of six 40 so I'll be a little bit behind the time too bad and like I said people of South Florida

[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.680]
They just they don't get it either too sheltered or just have bad taste

[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.240]
I bet you they sell a lot of an Eli screen in South Florida lots and lots maybe also butter per can

[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.300]
I mean who the hell eats butter per can ice cream

[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.580]
No, it's tasteless. Tasted you eat that. I said. I don't know. I don't think I've ever seen it

[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.500]
Get out of here. You've never seen butter per can ice cream. I'm like in the store and stuff like that

[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.660]
But I don't want to give you a bonus. Oh, no, I got it. I got it. I was paid last month

[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.360]
But since I never get my stuff. I have no way of knowing that

[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.020]
I beg you pardon you already got your bonus. Yes. I want to do that. Jenny. I asked Jenny

[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.280]
You already got it right

[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.280]
So so this is just like what you did with Treasure Island. You're trying to double them. Yeah

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.480]
That's exactly right. I think fat boy had a point. That's it. There you go. Exactly. I think fat fart had a point

[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.840]
Although actually this award begins with if I usually call him but can't say it fat fart

[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.740]
Fat F nothing spells worse than a fat fart. Oh, yeah

[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.180]
Trust me although this morning

[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.040]
I don't want to go into your

[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.720]
Bowls listen save it for Ethan Skolnik. Okay, save that save that for a bulk camper. It's good. Spelking

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.300]
That's his speciality is Ethan Skolnik's volumovance and how bad they smell and how he was at Ethan's house

[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:20.740]
It's like a little fag fraternity man. This fag sports fraternity. They all hang out together and talk the same crap

[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.360]
The same endless swill

[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.420]
How about those fish? How about those fish?

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.600]
Who is or was the greatest play by play sportscaster of all time

[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.740]
Keith Jackson is winning which just astonishes me that is so grotesque

[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.720]
94 for Keith Jackson

[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.920]
We didn't ask you who's been on the longaster who's the oldest and most sena we didn't ask you that we asked you who's the greatest

[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.020]
I wouldn't even call Keith Jackson great much less the greatest of all time. He he was okay

[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.500]
He had that cornpone

[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.380]
Effectance, you know that whole deal is

[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.780]
Al Michael 77

[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.000]
Kurt Gaudi 64 Harry carry 63 he got my vote

[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.580]
And I'm sure George would have voted for Harry too. I did

[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.460]
Did you I did well?

[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:14.700]
Holy cow. They don't come any better the Neil robber for a completely different reasons obviously

[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.880]
Oh and Brandon says butter pecans sells like vanilla. I know. That's why I said it. What do you think I said it for?

[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.880]
People with no taste. That's what they eat vanilla or butter pecans

[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.400]
Harry carry 63 male Allen 53 male israel was his name and the rumors were that he was

[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.640]

Vince cally 50 Marv halberd 45 Pat summer all 34 and

[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.080]
Inventory Adam and you know Pat was the master of understatement, but when he did that uh, I just I'm sorry

[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.500]
Not good pat but pat was already seen out by that point

[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.380]
Rick Weaver 32 Bob Prince 22. He should have got a lot more votes than that

[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:55.360]
He should be way up there near the top in fact. Oh my god. Keith Jackson. He couldn't lick Bob Prince's ass. Are you kidding me?

[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.980]
Red barber 19 Dan Kelly 14

[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.520]
That rookie that he was good Dan Kelly his son sucks

[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.120]
The older one John Kelly just the worst

[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.720]
That rookie skip carry 13 foster he would 10

[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.720]
Ernie how well nine to Kenbergate Danny Galavan 7 with a cannonate you save

He was constipated Danny Galavan Montreal Johnny most six we was rod John Miller for van Patrick for

[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.860]
Who hated those Philadelphia Eagles? You know van Patrick

[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.620]
There was a middle line backer for the Detroit Lions named Joe Schmidt

[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.540]
Was a hell of a player

[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.680]
But

[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:38.240]
Van Patrick was like obsessed with Joe Schmidt and he would call him making tackles when Joe Schmidt wasn't even on the field when he was on the sideline and be you know

[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:40.580]
Joe Schmidt

[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:47.680]
One thing about van Patrick he really knew his Schmidt Rick Generat 3 now. How come he's only got three. I mean you kidding me

[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.820]
Joe Bowen 3

[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.480]
See the hockey announces don't have any because South Florida's a hockey wasteland. They don't know from hockey

[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.520]
Fred Qsick to bill you would only two my god Bob Cole one old man cool

[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.520]
There's shoving his ass out van Miller one and Jack Quinlan didn't have any now that that's you know something

[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.760]
There's something really really rotten

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.600]
Jack Quinlan was better. He was a mid in times better than it

[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.180]
Jack asked Jack Burke House. He was horrible

[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:21.240]
Hey, hey, hey, he was he was the worst Jack Burke House and Jack Quinlan was better than Harry Carey

[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.840]
But he got he was 38 years old

[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.940]
He was at spring training in Arizona with the Cubs and he was like walking across the street and got hit by a car and killed at 38

[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.540]
A little bit too young to get killed. Don't you think?

[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.620]
Jack Quinlan. He has no votes. This is an infomnie

[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.500]
This is disgusting

[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.900]
Action my best effort in the game

[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.220]

[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.200]

[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.600]
1018 at 560 wqa. I'm happy Tuesday to it. Here's our award-winning lineup on QA

[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.980]
Mostly almost naked. Do you look at it?

[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.220]
No, it's not well. Why not?

[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.160]
Well, you are hard to get your bonus by the way. Don't be giving us this song today

[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.620]
Man, you get my bonus all right, and he's got me looking up on Arbor Tron

[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.480]
What was the date that the damn spring book came out and I'm oh

[00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:01.380]
Since I don't get my pay stubs you don't keep your stuff away of knowing that I gotta stuff do you heard about that

[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.120]
Here's a guy named Paul who's becoming ultra chronic

[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.020]
Let me read these in reverse order because the first one is just absolutely you know when you're wrong

[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.220]
Admit it when you make a mistake Paul admit it and now let me read this one first

[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.060]
Howard co-cell did Monday night football for years play by play well guess what Paul

[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.480]
He never did play by play Frank Gifford did the play by play along with the color guys

[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.560]
Which was dandy Don Meredith and Howard co-cell

[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.900]
I guess Paul don't understand play by play that's a guy that calls the game. What's going on in the game?

[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.700]
That's the play by play guy Paul mr. mr. Jock Sniffer

[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.740]
For a station that's supposed to be here's the play by play I fall off and I think for the guy to play by play

[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.680]
We'll all find a game here where this play by play

[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:52.120]
There's Bob Paul who just turned a hundred and five years old on the cvc leaves in Carolina nothing could be finer than to lose to Carolina

[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.660]
And the Leafs won in a shootout last night an exhibition this game at the scare Canada Center and they did play better in the third period

[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.340]
See there you go. There's that boring coach Ron Wilson. Oh my god. He's just coma inducing

[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.060]
So anyway Paul you're wrong. Why'd you just admit?

[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.680]
Send me a call say you're right. I'm wrong

[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:16.040]
Instead of being a hard ass and then his other he follows that up with driving homeless not I heard marv Albert calling me

[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.200]
Monday and football game. What a true professional. Yes

[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.260]
I was then comparing him to Jimmy Cifilis and the other two Jock Sniffer's

[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.880]
You know comparing marv Albert with Jimmy Cifilis is like comparing a fine

[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.300]
Surloin steak with a with a pound and a half of elephant crap

[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.440]
God

[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.700]
I use the term compare lightly good

[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.440]
Listening to Jimmy's raspy straining voices painful to my ears as for Mad Dog and Joe Mad Dog's okay

[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.720]
But between the three of them you can smell the venge and real cream coming through the radio the bend gay

[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:52.620]
It occurred to me you really do suffer with WQM's mismanagement if they could continue to use these three who all struggle with English language

[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.120]
Say what you want about Moe and his checkered pants and pizza stealing ways he was ten times the broadcaster

[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.520]
Jimmy Cifilis thinks he is no Moe wasn't ten times the broadcaster

[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.660]
He was a thousand times the sportscaster they play by play

[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.640]
And in his more co-heat co-herit days when he actually knew who'd what the teams were and what the name of the players was he was pretty damn good

[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.020]
Moe not as a human being but as a play play by play

[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.220]
Hey Jimmy you fairy do us a favor and just walk away says you fairy Paul

[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:26.000]
Would it not be the biggest slap in the bald head the Moe if Jimmy and Joe were replaced by Steve Geldey Geldstein calling again

[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.340]
Love you and love the group

[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.540]
Love the group I guess that includes you guys. I guess so

[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.620]
Well the focus group

[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.280]
No, not the focus group George already got his bonus. Don't start crying for him. Okay

[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.040]
Now let's see how the markets are doing today. I want to keep you guys abreast. Remember yesterday

[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.900]
I looked at that thing after the a bailout bill got beaten the house

[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:52.360]
Yes, that holy crap the Dow is down 600 points the Toronto Stock Exchange dropped 840 points yesterday

[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.500]
oh my god, and of course the

[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.540]
The Dow the biggest single they drop ever dropped 777

[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.480]
Points in one day

[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.820]
Panic panic sitting in

[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.920]
Markovia. Thank God God bailed out by city group. Wacovia watch over your money

[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.640]
So this business of a Howard co-selfing and play by your wrong frank giford who was just horrible

[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.620]
But was an x-jock and used to look pretty good. I was married to that miserable bitch

[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.460]
He did play by play and I use the term very loosely

[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.320]
I'm Monday night football during that era during those days Paul

[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:39.540]
Howard co-cell did not do play by play on the radio on the TV on your xylophone anywhere else

[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.780]
So admit your wrong and quit trying to push a beat a dead horse

[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.560]
Fred says how about your e-thorn for the pool. Yeah, yeah, we could have been on there long with jack buck

[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.980]
You can't put them all on there right? How about honey mnush you can put them all on there

[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.040]
Well, I could put them all on there and you still wouldn't know who any of them were no that's right

[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:07.320]
How about wait hoi and the only reason I voted for Harry Carrey is because I actually spoke to him

[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.200]
You did on the phone several times hooking up interviews and things like that in the olden days

[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.480]
for you

[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.460]
Let's win

[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.720]
On the other hand on their beer

[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.180]
Oh, link how

[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.160]
Neil Rogers is right the cubs

[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:30.580]
sucked now where's the real Harry though? That's that guy who did the and Harry right real Harry hated that guy by the way

[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:36.180]
You know yeah, the in Chicago used to imitate him and sounded just like him and he did all that guy did all those drop-ins for us

[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.560]
Where's the real

[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.720]
That's very good and the cubs suck is also him

[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.180]
No, it's not it is the cubs suck no

[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.480]
Oh, yeah

[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.440]
That was choice drop there

[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.940]
For him not what he did that for us or for somebody right right

[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.640]
Right because he sure wasn't gonna say that on here although he did rip him and ask when they deserved it

[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.020]
Which was most of the time right

[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:14.080]
Fred says how about Gary Thorn for the poll what makes him greatest is ability to generate excitement when calling a wide variety of sports

[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.860]
Baseball hockey football he's done it all yeah, that's true

[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.060]
He's pretty good he could have been on there

[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.540]
But he's not and we're not ending in more names because in one of these days we're gonna be switching the poll over the other one

[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.180]
Whatever the other one is

[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.560]
Wait till you hear this speaking of people with bad taste now actually this is people with good taste. I like Wendy's

[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.420]
Wendy's customers will see new options on the company's frosty and burger heavy menu

[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.440]
Oh, I guess what I had for lunch yesterday Wendy's no Taco Bell no

[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.460]
So I get ahead well you're in your close

[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.860]
Not the food that the girl no mimekees okay

[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.180]
The Amos burger with bacon and she'll that one yeah on the pastry bun

[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.500]
You know what a pastry bun is no

[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.140]
I think that's what they call it

[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.100]
It's really good too bad you guys don't have it and they got lucky to special like I um

[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.360]
Yellow mayonnaise or something like that or some special kind of mouse-turd they put on their mana thing is good and onion

[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.720]
And let us into me to and as usual I ripped the lettuce off around the edges and just

[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.100]
Schmidt-candid too much lettuce

[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.280]
That crappy were giving me the other day, but oh iceberg lettuce. It's great. There's nothing great about lettuce. Let us sucks

[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.480]
Is that what I was saying

[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.720]
Anyway, the new CEO said Monday after was formally taken over by the owner of Arby's Arby's took over Wendy's oh my god

[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.520]
The 2.34 billion deal in the works for years adds Wendy's international of the stable holdings of

[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.520]
Triarch companies incorporated the company controlled by billionaire investor Nelson Peltz

[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.740]
A part-time Palm Beach resident no less

[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.900]
Roland Smith the new chief executive of Wendy's and former CEO of Triarch told the associated press a

[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:57.680]
Plants to rebrand the business the number three hamburger chain behind Mickey D's and Burger King to emphasize the freshness of its burgers

[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.880]
And we'll attempt to reinvigorate the menu with new products

[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.260]
We fully expect to be able to position Wendy's as they oh listen to this

[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:09.880]
We fully expect to be able to fully position Wendy's as the leader in quality food in the hamburger segment fully

[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.900]
As in full of Smith said Wendy's has fallen behind in part because customers have forgotten the chain sells the only hamburger

[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.020]
That's fresh not frozen. He says a new ad campaign will bring that message back to the peoples

[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.420]
I would hope he would start to re-be able to re-educate the consumer in very short order

[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:31.960]
The company plans to also improve its core item menus and offer better fries better buns and better bacon

[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.360]
No

[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:55.880]
When her came Gustaf came to New Orleans you can bet John McCain was there on the scene if I'd not be able to raise his arms up high

[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.320]
But he can shoot down liberals with a gleam in his eyes John

[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.300]
Big

[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:10.420]
There's some that say he might not be Obama might have to leave that task to his hot VP mama one day years

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.860]
So now by his great you can stand and read at the bottom of this grave

[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.820]
Lasawakey little man

[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.660]
He's John

[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.420]
John McKain

[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.300]
McK

[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:39.420]
Insane insane McCain 1033 and 560 WQM how those markets doing baby keep your eye peeled on that because everybody's real nervous man

[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.100]
They're all doing the green apple quickstep now is up 232 points. That's all you need to know

[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.200]
It's not continuing that precipitous slide from yesterday when it went down 770 7

[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.780]
As Eric Reed would say early weekend

[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.260]
So Paul who's a semi his 400th email of the morning already

[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.540]
At least he admitted he's full of crap

[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.160]
This from the American sportscasters Hall of Fame was somebody said we left off race got which I apologize

[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.860]
He belonged on here. He was a drunk

[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.560]
But he was the voice of the green bay packers for 100 years. I also think the Vikings are one maybe once upon a time

[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.040]
But certainly the packers he was a drunk race god

[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.500]
Harry was a drunk to his matter fact. Yeah, well, that's all right. They said a meme drunk really? Yeah

[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:32.020]
During his nearly 40 years in broadcast and late Howard co-sale did more to popularize television sports than any other sportscaster in this century

[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:38.300]
Mr. co-sale is probably best known for his 13 years of expert commentary on ABC's Emmy award winning Monday night football

[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.100]
expert commentary in

[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.380]
1977 he became a commentator on ABC's Monday night baseball

[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.080]
co-sale gained worldwide recognition and famous the voice of boxing including most of

[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.900]
Muhammad Ali's major bouts expert commentary Paul says you are right

[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.120]
I was wrong and I apologize for doubting you for becoming a chronic

[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.740]
Don't do it again Paul damn it

[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.640]
At least he finally you know a lot of and I noticed that for whatever reason

[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.080]
Maybe it's because yesterday was such a pressure day on the markets and everybody having nervous breakdown

[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.980]
But the negative to read people some of them are back today sending me hate like Edward really

[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:16.420]
You know these people who tell me how bad the show sucks, but they're there every day. Not only are they listening

[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.700]
But they're also emailing

[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.120]
Delete delete this I don't even read them as soon as I see who they're from I just delete

[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.760]
Mm-hmm because I know I can smell it right off the amount of the right and smell

[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.560]
Oh, that must be Edward and a couple of other ones and I don't read those on the air because

[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.780]
See the purpose of the show isn't for me to be a masochist right as much abuse and punishment from a holes

[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:44.480]
Hit as I possibly can't know. I know that surprises some of these people. Oh, we're gonna abuse you's you know screw you

[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.080]
So Tom jicka this was sent to me by the beast yesterday. He said not sure if you saw this. No, I did not

[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.160]
This is the Q&A thing I guess from jicka nice without any camp on a week

[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:02.720]
They drives without the acquired taste of Hank Goldberg on WQM have left a dearth of any intellect with and just playing fun on the radio

[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.160]
I guess this show we don't have any intellect with or just playing fun. How do you like that? Right?

[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.400]
DR whoever you are

[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:17.300]
Please tell me lie to me that some AM stations going to play the tariff and pick them up. I'm not forced to talk to my wife. Oh poor baby

[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.680]
Tom says both our personal friends of mine

[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.220]
But as a radio listener I missed them on year two especially ed's fried in that football handicrappers

[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.400]
Alastair's nothing going on with Ed

[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.560]
Hank just had his ESPN contract extended with additional assignments

[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:37.460]
Funny how people at the nation's most successful TV network artist smart as the genius who ran off hang from WQM

[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.940]
Which is now the markets number two sports station. That's what Tom says takes a shot

[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.340]
A little stucco there at your close personal buddy jolly joe fat as bell

[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.720]
Nice going Tommy

[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.180]
How do you like that a rat? Oh

[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.940]
And this article that I was going to read by um

[00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:02.000]
Michael moriast day, but I didn't have time maybe I'll have time today because I'm sure it's all not taking any calls. Oh come on

[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.420]
Yeah, you think I'm going to go through that again

[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.620]
But it's called the ironic ironic repetition. Let's just put this on tape and just keep playing me say

[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.460]
Saying the same thing over and over again

[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.400]
Never again and then every time I try it because all the audience what I like the cold

[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.960]
Yeah, you know something you like vanilla ice cream too. You like butter pecan. I don't really care what they like

[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:29.020]
I've been doing this a long time and I know that the phone is dead. It's finished. It's a it's a useless instrument

[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.100]
It's like a used condom you throw it away. You don't try to use it again

[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.040]
I'm just telling you that's my that's my take

[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.260]
Yesterday did the the Reverend and the boyfriend

[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:47.100]
Passing cell phones back and forth calling on two or three different lines and then of course I'm your friend

[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.920]
I'm your friend and chamba derone morona grunovsky chamba

[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.720]
I'm the chamba guy

[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.380]
And let me say it again management of this radio station has let three or four

[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.780]
certifiably insane people take over the phone and they can have it like I said

[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.240]
I'll be more than happy to give them jolly joe's home number his cell phone number whatever

[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.580]
He gives your information out. Yeah, that's right. He sure as hell does he gave it to him

[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:16.360]
A vocamper my my cell phone number and then he gave this some anonymous list of my damn email my personal email address

[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.600]
Who could ever forget that and then he tries to turn it around and blame me. Oh only a crazy person would be so upset

[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.940]
No only an irresponsible person would be given out people's private information only someone totally

[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.680]
Manifestly irresponsible like fat ass jolly joe bell who has no respect for any of us who work in this damn place none

[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.080]
When the boss has no respect for you then you know you've got real problems

[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.140]
George, but you got your bonus. Yes, I did last mark. George got his bonus. All right

[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:53.660]
It's about time we had some good news boy. It is dank and murky here today. It's not looking good

[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:59.280]
It's fishy here today to rain overnight. It looks really murky. You know what I mean by murky right

[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.860]
gray and

[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:01.940]

I like it a lot.

[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.440]
I don't know if the markets were just going to collapse all around the world.

[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.640]
So they told us that pay a lot yesterday and that what they said.

[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.640]
Here comes the bunny and there goes your money.

[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.680]
See, I don't have any sympathy for people who invest in the stock market because I already

[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.060]
did that.

[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.840]
It was a bad, bad mistake and I will never do it again.

[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.520]
Burn me once.

[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.460]
I'm a schmuck.

[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.340]
Burn me twice.

[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.320]
I deserve to be dead.

[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.140]
Which some of the emails this morning that would make them very happy.

[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:47.940]
We're tired.

[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.540]
What are you going to do then, Eddie?

[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:50.280]
We're tired.

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.340]
And then this Paul Tuchus or whatever his name is, Tuchus.

[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.240]
This guy keeps sending me the same thing.

[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.320]
Joe, Joe Tuchus.

[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.840]
I guess he expects that if he sends it 100 times, I'll read it.

[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.720]
I'm not going to read it.

[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:08.900]
His treatise on who's to blame for the economic meltdown and the bailout bill and all

[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.480]
this other crap.

[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:10.960]
Here's the poll again.

[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:11.640]
Let's see.

[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:12.820]
Ray, who's chronic.

[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.300]
Ray says Moe was terrible under radio.

[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.980]
He said when he called football for Westwood 1.

[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.620]
He was excellent on Monday Night Football on radio.

[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.280]
He was a one trick pony but nevertheless.

[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.540]
Why can't you give credit?

[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.620]
Okay, we don't like him.

[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.780]
We hate a white boy.

[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.560]

[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.640]

[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.640]

[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.640]

[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.860]
We hate a white boy.

[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.000]
We hate a white boy.

[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.100]
We hate a white boy.

[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:30.580]
We hate a white boy.

We hate a white boy.

[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.500]
He wrote a vocal level thing.

[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:48.800]
No.

[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.200]
He had a great voice for play by play.

[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:52.960]
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.300]
And he sounded good but I was like,

[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.740]
after I started listening to him do the dolphins

[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.120]
and seeing how much he screwed up.

[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.600]
Like with like the wrong players and stuff like that.

[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.940]
I was wondering, did he do the same thing on Monday Night Football?

[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.060]
I just didn't realize that he didn't have the players.

[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.340]
No, he was great.

[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.200]
I used to listen to him all the time on Monday Night Football on the radio.

[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.400]
So then what were you wondering?

[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.760]
But I was like listening to the radio.

[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.160]
So I'm not actually watching where I was watching the dolphins.

[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.460]
I'd watch the game and listen to him.

[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.600]
And like I'd see one guy make a tackle and he would call somebody else.

[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.560]
Was he doing the same thing on the other on the Monday Night radio?

[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.540]
And I just didn't know that because I didn't know the other teams or not.

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.940]
Some other words you don't want to give him any credit.

[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.380]
No, he sounded great.

[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.540]
And I had no problem with him until I saw that he was like, you know,

[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.940]
calling the wrong players with dolphins.

[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.400]
Let me ask you this question.

[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.220]
What turns is it, Mike?

[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.020]
Who cares?

[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.220]
Well, I mean, if you're listening to play by play, you kind of want to know.

[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.660]
Who cares?

[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.500]
The actual alley.

[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:47.700]
Who gives a crack?

[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.160]
I care.

[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.300]
The Josh Mitz on the sideline and Van Patrik says,

[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.580]
and it's a great tackle by Joe Shmid.

[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.900]
He's not even on the field.

[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:54.500]
Exactly.

[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.180]
Every tackle at the line's defense made was made by Joe Shmid.

[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.160]
If he listen to Van Patrik, maybe he had a Joe Shmid blow up now.

[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:01.540]
I don't know.

[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.580]
Joe is a really ugly guy.

[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:02.980]
I don't know.

[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:04.640]
And then again, so is Van Patrik.

[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.520]
He was a big, big fat guy.

[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.160]
Now he's dead.

[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.620]
That's what happens to big fat guys.

[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.080]
They die.

[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.280]
In fact, as we go down this list on the pool,

[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.180]
I'll tell you the big fat guys and the drunks.

[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.480]
Right now, why did you put race God on there?

[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.580]
I told you no additions.

[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.520]
Oh, I thought I thought I'd take it off.

[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.680]
It's wrong with you.

[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.980]
No, don't take it off.

[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.620]
Just leave it there.

[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.380]
It's got a zero.

[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.500]
Oh, who is or was the greatest play by play sports guys

[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.120]
through of all time?

[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.360]
And isn't it sad that you have to, in South Florida,

[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.720]
such a bastion of sports expertise,

[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.040]
you have to explain to the public what a play by play announcer is?

[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.460]
God, I just never heard of such a thing.

[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.140]
All the time when we take these polls,

[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.440]
they answer the question they want.

[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.200]
They never understand it unless it's something really simple.

[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.540]
And even then, your kids recall this now in conversations.

[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.080]
All they even remember everything.

[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:54.980]
Oh, my God.

[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.280]
Where's some play by play?

[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.760]
Go out here and commercial break on air.

[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.340]
Here's a better look at it here.

[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.500]
No chance for Costco.

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.980]
A perfect deflection by white right into the post and in

[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.520]
to get the blue is a nice going.

[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.220]
Ian stuck it in his own net.

[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.060]
Nice going, baby.

[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:10.480]
You're done.

[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.380]
He's OK, Ian White.

[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.360]
He looks pretty good to me.

[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.980]
Who is or was the greatest play by play sportscaster all time?

[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.160]
Keith Jackson is winning.

[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.480]
That in and of itself is enough to make me want to jump right off the balcony.

[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.840]
I just can't deal with it.

[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.480]
Keith Jackson 105 votes.

[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.540]
Al Michael's 85.

[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.340]
It's not even close.

[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.420]
Kurt Gaudi 71.

[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.260]
Harry Carey 69.

[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.080]
That's just.

[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.620]
I mean, Keith Jackson way above Harry Carey.

[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.620]
I just I wonder.

[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.400]
That really flashed my ass a little bit.

[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.580]
I don't blame you.

[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.800]
Mel Allen 62.

[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.700]
Vince Cully 61.

[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:47.860]
Marv Albert 51.

[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.240]
Rick Weaver 37.

[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.200]
And of course, I've been remiss.

[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:57.960]
The fans beginning to blew the blow the who the place election.

[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.680]
Pat Summer all 36 Bob prints 25.

[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.960]
Oh, yeah, somebody sends me an email.

[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.160]
Who was the guy who did the Pirates games?

[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.360]
Who was the guy who did the Pirates games?

[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.340]
Is that pathetic or what?

[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.840]
Bob prints 25 red, Barbara 20.

[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.520]
The old red head overrated.

[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.280]
Dan Cully 16.

[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.800]
Skip Carey 14.

[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.660]
Ernie Harwell 12.

[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.960]
He should have a lot more than that.

[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.280]
Foster Huat 11.

[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.900]
Johnny Mostten, Dickenberg 9.

[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:27.900]
Danny Galavan 8.

[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.000]
With this cannonating shot and assimilating save and his other BS.

[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:32.980]
Frog.

[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.880]
Joe Bowen 4.

[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.600]
John Miller 4.

[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.480]
Van Patrick 4.

[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.220]
Rick Jenner, Red Only 3.

[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.680]
Oh, what you people know about play by play sports cashews.

[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.360]
I could put in a thimble and have room for Joyce and jolly Joe's ass in there.

[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.320]
There's Jack Quillin.

[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.420]
All of a sudden got three votes.

[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.720]
I guess that's because I the sympathy vote because I see he got killed by a car he did.

[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:53.860]
Fred Q.

[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.100]
So two Van Miller to bill.

[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:58.300]
He would do Bob Cole one and Ray Scott's got the big drunk.

[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.280]
Oh, I forgot to mention the fat people on list.

[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:02.900]
What turns does it make?

[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.280]
Right.

[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.840]
And you know something when you come right down to it, who knows how fat they were when they died?

[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.340]
Am I right?

[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.780]
Skip Kerry was fat.

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.720]
Van Patrick was humongous, huge.

[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.360]
Rick Jenner, right used to be juggernaut.

[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.060]
He lost a lot of weight.

[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.200]
He still was about 800 pounds.

[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:24.860]
He's great.

[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:25.560]
Rick Jenner, right.

[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.660]
He's got three votes on the pool.

[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.800]
Oh, we know our sports in South Florida.

[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.580]
Yeah, right.

[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.540]
Give me a break.

[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.720]
Just a wasteland, just a vast wasteland, even the alligators have moved out.

[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:38.460]
Unbelievable.

[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.340]
Michael says the video of your appearance with Gilbert cackling in the background is fantastic.

[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.380]
Do you have any other video clips of you doing a live show?

[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:47.940]
No.

[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.120]
Could you please tape any other upcoming events for those of us who can't make it to your live appearance?

[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:52.980]
I will take them all.

[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.820]
OK, OK.

[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.360]
We'll tape them all.

[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.220]
All none of them.

[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.480]
Oh, yeah.

[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.680]
What a joke.

[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.040]
By the way, everybody should check that out though, I would think.

[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:04.580]
Wouldn't you?

[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:05.480]
Yeah.

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.620]
If they're a fan, sure.

[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.980]
Here's one from all over the mean of fan.

[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.060]
They today they all hate.

[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:12.860]
I see.

[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.400]
Some of them like you, but they still hate me.

[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.800]
They were tired.

[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.480]
Yeah, I used to be good 100 years ago.

[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:24.220]
They said, but you know, but I'm still showing up here every day because I can use the money.

[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.040]
I might just actually put on my clothes and go off to a blind again today and give them back the

[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.760]
2,300 I won last night.

[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.400]
I don't think so though.

[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:31.860]
I'm on a roll.

[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:32.360]
Good.

[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.220]
Hit that three grand on Friday, 2,300 last night.

[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.540]
I'm always almost got some real money in my wallet.

[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.360]
How do you like that?

[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:40.080]
Wow.

[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.680]
Not too many people can say that these days.

[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:48.460]
Now that the sky is falling on Rochars Shawnee, you see the Lord works in mysterious ways.

[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.400]
And you notice yesterday was aero for a show.

[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.720]
Now it didn't happen until sundown last night.

[00:41:53.380 --> 00:42:00.580]
And so the goyum dragged the market down, even though Barney Fag was their bellyic and protesting and screaming and yelling and curing on.

[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.020]
He was good.

[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:08.180]
And now that the sundown came, now you notice the markets have gone back up because the Lord God involved again.

[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.580]
The Lord God.

[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.300]
Good Lord.

[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.460]
Steve says I recently watched the following movies I hadn't viewed in years.

[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.460]
Glenn Curie, Glenn Ross, Jan Justice for all and network.

[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.380]
Aside from the Godfather, of course, these are three of the greatest movies of all time.

[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.260]
I would agree with that network.

[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.220]
A movie made 30 years ago.

[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.140]
Not 30, man.

[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.580]
And perfectly this grabs the situation today about television news in the mainstream media.

[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.020]
It resonates louder and sounds to her today than it did when the movie was made.

[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.080]
I would agree with that.

[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.560]
He says, how can George not like this movie?

[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:39.840]
I was mad at him.

[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.360]
I was mad at him.

[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.760]
I don't think there's any more.

[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.960]
He says, how can George not like this movie?

[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.100]
But I love you anyways, George.

[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.340]
We can't be right on everything.

[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.560]
He's got me confused with Josh Cordes, obviously.

[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.640]
Listen to me.

[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.520]
Television is not the truth.

[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.060]
So turn off your television sets.

[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.180]
Turn them off right in the middle of the city.

[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.140]
Howard Veele is God says, Steve.

[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.820]
Let's make a deal and get the chalk lines from the other ones.

[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.980]
Um, of course, classics.

[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.420]
They don't make films like these no more.

[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.360]
So who said this?

[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.800]
Steve, some, uh, emailer.

[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.440]
Like, I know who this is.

[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.940]
This is some anonymous emailer.

[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:16.220]
Okay.

[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.820]
You get enough tight about it?

[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:17.900]
Yep.

[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.880]
Got my nickers in his wisdom.

[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.220]
How can you not like network?

[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.440]
Whoever said I didn't like network?

[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.560]
Oh, would you stop it?

[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.420]
Some guy with an email here.

[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:27.740]
Okay.

[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.160]
I know.

[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.800]
It's been a lot of time writing two long paragraphs.

[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.540]
As far as the debate last week, I love how McCain was name dropping.

[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.600]
Every chance he got during the foreign policy part of it,

[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.100]
regarding all the countries he's been to and leaders he's met.

[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.500]
It's amazing how someone so traveled doesn't have a diplomatic bone in his body.

[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.700]
These countries realize that the, uh, something is in.

[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:50.800]
I can't, it's chopped off the fix.

[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.080]
I'm just guessing that.

[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:55.580]
Maybe that's what it says.

[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.520]
Well, I will continue to go into countries make more when we feel like it,

[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.360]
regardless of the intelligence of information that is gathered or lack their own.

[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.760]
There will be no toxic diplomacy within same McCain,

[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.360]
much like he wouldn't even look at or borderline acknowledge that Obama was a few people from among states.

[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.880]
So another four years at last date, this time ran,

[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.000]
waits as if people are stupid enough to vote for this wrong choice again.

[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.240]
I'm a maverick.

[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:15.880]
I'm the insider.

[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.520]
What's the difference?

[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:16.800]
None.

[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:17.840]
Same old crap.

[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.640]
Love your show, Neil.

[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.200]
So Steve,

[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.740]
well, Steve is happy as opposed to.

[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:23.560]
RETIRE!

[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.440]
RETIRE!

[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:25.180]
Ah.

[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.100]
Just a wasteland,

[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.520]
a some pump and out, uh, just a gigantic outdoor septic tank that is called South Florida.

[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.540]
And when people send me emails or any kind of correspondence and they say,

[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:44.700]
they got out, you can smell the happiness on the page.

[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:45.860]
You can smell it.

[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.520]
Is that what I'm smelling?

[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.280]
Well, you smell something.

[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.040]
Glenn says, go to suncentral.com and do entertainment news.

[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:54.780]
I didn't find it.

[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.920]
Title is Glenn Beckback on WID,

[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:57.880]
footy shown the door.

[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.240]
Happy Jew years is Glenn.

[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.740]
Happy Jew year to you, Glenn.

[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:01.860]
I think he's a goi.

[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.140]
Glenn Beck is back on, oh yeah,

[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.960]
another all right wing all day on IOD.

[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.140]
All ultra right wing.

[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.940]
And Glenn Beck, of course, certifiably crazy.

[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.300]
Crazy person.

[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.080]
Another Tampa, another, uh,

[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.840]
Tampa reject.

[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.480]
Just amazing, but nevertheless, just keep plotting right along.

[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:22.960]
You know what I mean?

[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:23.640]
What do you think?

[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.980]
In a shadowing new interview,

[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.100]
Steven Spoonamore goes into harrowing detail about the Bush regime's election fraud past present and

[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.380]
if we don't spread the word right now to come.

[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.880]
Since he's the only whistleblower out there who knows the perps themselves and knows how they operate,

[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.860]
we have to send this piece far and wide that says here Spoon tells us that McBush's team,

[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:51.260]
Carl Rove and his henchpersons have the plan in place to steal this next election by 51.2% of the popular vote and three electoral votes.

[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.180]
He also talks about the major role played by the Christianist far right and the electronic rigging of the vote.

[00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.260]
And it defines our electronic voting system as a major threat to US national security,

[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.620]
calling for it to be junked as soon as possible.

[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.780]
And favor of a hand-coded paper ballot.

[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.820]
Since Spoon is a Republican, an erstrom McCain supporter, as well as a noted specialist in nosing out computer fraud,

[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.280]
his testimony is essential.

[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.980]
Not only for its expertise, but no less for the impact that his views will surely have on those Republicans

[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.360]
who've been lowered to see what Bush and Company has done to our election system.

[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.200]
The big name.

[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.320]
The best talent.

[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.640]
You're new projects.

[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.980]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.760]
The fourth leader.

[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.040]
The biggest name is the best talent.

[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:31.680]
Are you sure?

[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.880]
You're listening to sports Radio 560 WQAM.

[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.120]
I am a Ford Latter-day.

[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.960]
New Rogers.

[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.200]
This is your brain.

[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.420]
P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p.

[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.120]
Any questions?

[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.300]
It's the best kept secret and fast food.

[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.380]
And David Caruso must protect it.

[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:53.720]
CSI.

[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:54.980]
KFC.

[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:56.460]
What do we got?

[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.940]
Well, Horatio, the Colonel has trusted us with a secret recipe.

[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:05.720]
I hope no one steals them. I'll just have to be sure there's no foul play

[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:11.640]
David Caruso does you can write on CSI KFC

[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:17.480]
Good news or ratio the guys who tried to steal the recipe are now facing the electric chair

[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:22.940]
I guess the only question now is original or extra crispy

[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.740]
It's drama by the bucket tonight on CSI KFC

[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:32.280]
I can't wait that David Caruso. He really does it for me. No

[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.440]
That's another example of somebody who's extraordinarily popular and I just can't figure it out

[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.700]
Can you tell me what his appeal is? No although

[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.180]
I

[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:46.120]
Look good. He's not as good as he thinks he is because as soon as he went off that show and tried to pursue you know like a movie career

[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.740]
Yeah, he flammed. Yeah, flapo. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, and guess what talk about being a bunch of sadist to see it in

[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.140]
Guess who was on before Wolflet's Creek finally showed up. I don't know Rick Sanchez. Yes

[00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:02.360]
Oh, here the world the market is dropping precipitously. He's a market expert. You know, oh, yeah

[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:08.800]
And there's the hysterical hyperventilating Ricky Tiki Sanchez on there on CNN yesterday afternoon. I just couldn't believe it

[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.260]
The cows up to 145

[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.960]
Down here into the canyons of Wall Street

[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.340]
I talked with one mother and her

[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.040]
Russia shine your daughter. She wanted to show her youngster

[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.900]
Richard of law after what happened and it's certainly already you're gonna burn in hell today. We'll have an impact on her daughter too

[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.080]
To wish boy like Richard Roth working on Russia's show. I mean I'm working on Russia's show about I'm gonna burn in hell anyway

[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.460]
So what terms is that's right?

[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.360]
Plus you want me to be here today unless you want to do the rest of the show. No, thank you

[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.760]
I could go to woodbuying right enough for doing that show on your cloudy day. I don't think I'm going today

[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.620]
All right, I'll let the fat Christ aside for me think about really

[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:46.820]
what?

[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.940]
Oh, I'm easy, you know, you like a magic eight ball shake him and see what it says what cracks me up about life

[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.480]
Those people I got an email the other day which had anymore waste my time reading on here

[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.780]
Please tell us what an and I've had these before

[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.540]
Tell me what an average day is like for you

[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.360]
Yeah

[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.580]
I'd like to get up to you brush your teeth first right take a big dump a joy

[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:14.820]
So well, you know, please take them through it in detail would you post a blog about it an average day?

[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.980]
Yeah, an average day for me is whatever the hell I wanted to be that this is what I know

[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.700]
That's what single men without families that that's exactly what it is right now

[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.220]
You're thinking you go. I wonder what I'll do today

[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:30.700]
And it'll be a special entirely a schedule when I only work to this week. Wow. It is sensational

[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.120]
Gee, you all sleep in this bed right maybe I'll walk over it

[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.640]
I get up early to go to work on which your fat the Chris doesn't like it

[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.460]
But nevertheless whatever I said to you alarm for like 4 30 or 5 in the morning and then when it goes off

[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:49.600]
Either I get up and go or maybe I push it ahead another hour. Maybe I just go back to sleep whatever I want

[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:51.420]
Freedom

[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:59.180]
Freedom is a beautiful thing. Remember we used to have freedom in America. No Fred and Boca really pisses me off

[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:01.420]
He said Howard Kosell was a bald headed fart

[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:08.500]
Yeah, and I mean I don't doubt that and of course, you know Dave Johnson hated him like oh

[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.180]
I know what's that about the other say the other say what that was all about why that

[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.640]
Just hated him. He was a nasty miserable person

[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.820]
It's like asking why did we hate Moe? You know, it's the same kind of thing

[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:25.040]
But by the same token professionally Howard Kosell was way ahead of his time

[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.600]
He actually opened up a mountain-send things that other people were scared schmittless to say

[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:33.880]
And when he talked about the jocque accuracy and about these dumb jokes taken over sports and sports casting

[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.760]
He was right on target and look what it's degenerated into today

[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.980]
Everybody who ever wore a joc strap is a broadcast air they're in the booth. They're in the booth

[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.280]
We got an 80-man booth

[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.780]
Shirley booth John Wilkes booth

[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:53.180]
So you can knock Howard Kosell all you want he was you know, he was what he was

[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.400]
Don't forget when we get to a May if we live that long when Dave Johnson calls in for the Derby

[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:02.580]
Well, I have a conversation about Howard Kosell. He gets wild when I bring that name up

[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:09.860]
He was always working on those telecasts for the Derby, you know on ABC Howard Kosell. He's dead

[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.280]
He had a nasty hair piece

[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.040]
I'm trying to think of what they were I don't know which one it was but there was one year when the hair piece nearly flew off

[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.420]
It was a windy day at the track and

[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.940]
His hair piece was like like side-settle. You know, I mean we'd like slip down on the side of his head kind of yeah

[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:33.820]
A lot of I bet you in the truck. They were laughing their ass off a lot of crazy kid stuff

[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:39.640]
Now speaking of ice cream which I didn't have any ice I had a good day yesterday good

[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.780]
I really did good

[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:49.400]
I had all though I did it now I will say this I do eat that pastry bun when I go to Mickey D's and get that burger

[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.000]
All right, the ainess burger with the

[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:58.080]
Bacon and I'm a big fan of bread so I can understand that pastry bun. That sounds incredible

[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.760]
I want really is I want to write me down

[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:04.340]
You get all the burgers and Mickey D's it's a it's like a

[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:08.920]
I call it a pastry. I'm out of the scrap. I'm polishing for Russia Sean. I want a pastry bun right near

[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:14.680]
Trayff so bacon with cheddar are you can be trayff right and

[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:21.380]
Bacon yeah, oh my god. That's great. I'm gonna have a lot of you look at it. I'll fuck you to nasty some lobster

[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:26.300]
God who's kidding whom

[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.940]
Neil have you or George tried fried apples ice cream

[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.720]
No heard of it sounds compelling sounds interesting it says it's very good

[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.380]
I love it the fried bits of apples make it very interesting like you said try it you might like it

[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.360]
Thanks for the great show Neil you and George are the man

[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.960]
That's great we demand you and me

[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.520]
By the way Neil did you hack my computer ever since the last picture of me?

[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.400]
I sent you haven't been able to send you anymore just kidding

[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:02.980]
Windows live mail program doesn't work right now since I installed an internet explorer 8 beta 2. I don't know please

[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:09.380]
It says I might have to wait for the final version of internet explorer 8 to be released to get that problem fixed or just

[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:12.920]
Uninstall internet explorer beta 2 right now. That's what I'll try good luck to me

[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.960]
Oh, why do we care about all your technical computer problems?

[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:21.760]
I mean, I don't want to sound insensitive, but do we care? No, no and then somebody says how about Mel Allen?

[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:26.820]
How about that? How about Mel? He's on there. He ought to be a lot higher on the list, but he was

[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.720]
Neil guy. No, he was gay. Yeah, well same difference

[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:31.860]
How's Mel doing?

[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.600]
Let me take a look. We got 765 vote Mel's got he's in a fifth place right? I'm Harry Carey's ass

[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:48.180]
He's got 66 votes and Keith Jackson continues to lead what is wrong with you people Keith Jackson with that cornpoll and accent that oh my god

[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:50.680]
Keith freaking Jackson

[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.960]
Now I'm sure we've got some bits in here some Keith Jackson stuff. Don't we?

[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:59.760]
No, we do we have to I don't know what it's under though

[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.300]
No, I've got some recent here, but I don't want to hear I don't want to hear Keith Jackson

[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:13.640]
Dennis says have you heard about this ad which is being snail mailed here in Florida as well as other states?

[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:19.740]
It seems to be a combination Republican and Zionist joint effort to elect McCain by scaring the public about terrorism

[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.280]
Oh my god, that obsession thing

[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:32.020]
Well, we'll get to it. Okay. This is about an ad campaign to win list citizens to take action against what they're calling Islamic fundamentalist

[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:37.060]
Yes, but surely points to a more sinister goal. They're using the same methods as Fox TV to manipulate the public

[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:42.420]
Yeah, it's that the DVD they keep putting in a papers including the Harold and the Sun sent all by the right shame on you

[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:48.860]
Shame on you putting a bunch of ultra right wing propaganda in there. Right one newspaper in North Carolina refused to put that stuff in their rag

[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:54.960]
Well good for them. Yeah, they deserve it award. I received this a few days ago. Dennis is here in Seminole, Florida next to St. Pete

[00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:01.160]
I followed up on Google and found several websites associated with this it appears the focus is to unless grassroots it's called obsession

[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.820]
Which he doesn't have in here. That's what it's called the clearing fund which it seems to be nonpartisan

[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:12.460]
But they just happen to endorse McCain right it's just it says this was a shocking thing to receive in the mail

[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:17.040]
I feel felt like I was being solicited by the KKK and I'm Jewish so the whole thing is quite uncomfortable

[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.380]
The ad is a highly sophisticated graphically based fold out with the DVD

[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:25.200]
They also wanted to donate money to help them organize against their fear campaign

[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:30.240]
There are several places online that are behind this one one is the clearing fund. Yeah, I've been talked about that at length

[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.220]
Lister since the early 80s, but when I moved out of the area lost you luckily

[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.980]
I hooked you up looking up on the web and have been able to listen online last six months

[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.860]
I'd download the archive of the day when I can't well, then that same goofball in New Orleans is belly

[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.120]
The last hour was not there again

[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:54.780]
The giri in New Orleans that guy gives me he gives me Roy's bed in my back. Oh God. I can't stand it

[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:59.380]
No matter how much I talk about him bugging off. He just won't do it

[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.000]
I mean at least that Paul guy when he made a mistake about Howard Coacel

[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.480]
He resv- and they very seldom do that when they make a mistake. They just vanish

[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.160]
Remember how it used to be with the facts in the same crap

[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:13.220]
And you'd have him right by the short hairs. You know you're wrong. You're full of crap

[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:17.920]
Oh, no, you know what you're talking about and then after you'd prove it you'd read something like out of

[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.660]
Wikipedia or something to prove that theater what they were talking about and then they would just disappear as opposed to having

[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:28.460]
At least have a little bit of class like Paul what a guy's name was that chronic who said yeah, you're right

[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:32.440]
No more on Howard Coacel was not a play-by-play guy. He was a blow-by-blow guy

[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:38.940]
That's boxing down goes phrasia down goes phrasia. He was he was great at that

[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:39.780]
He was very good

[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.080]
So that guy that friend and boca was he was a boy. He say a bald head at old fart

[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.360]
I'm a bald head old fart too. And how do you like that friend boca?

[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.720]
Moe Howard David in the

[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:57.980]
Voice of the jets was a bald head old fart. I wonder how he did that what how his work was with the jets

[00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.580]
Evidently I guess not all that good

[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.700]
His name the base of the result

[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.860]
Fourth leader

[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.580]
So big name that talent

[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:16.300]
It's that's the end Joe wait nights for me to live in here on

[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:23.120]
Sports radio 560 2 am the sports leader grab my junior honey

[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:30.940]
This is keep Jackson on special assignment trying to get a word with New York Yankee Jason

[00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:35.500]
Jambi while the team sucked Jason seems to be back to old form

[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.700]
Is it because it's his contract year?

[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:43.820]
Is he trying to suck more money out of a team and then arrive and be horrible like he was for most of the time

[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:50.100]
It is with the Yankees here comes Jason. Jambi. Hey Jason to what do you attribute your amazing come back this year?

[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.960]
I'm just isn't because you're back on the juice

[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:58.900]
No, I think you mean to grow a mustache or did the hair simply grow because of all the substances

[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:04.980]
You've been pouring into your body Jason Jambi answer this question if you didn't have the mustache

[00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:09.300]
Do you think you'd be able to hit the ball? It's I know you saved the mustache Jason

[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:13.780]
I know that's what you were going to say but what I'm talking about is while you had the mustache you were on an awesome

[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:17.240]
Tear do you think it had anything to do with the hair on the your lip?

[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.420]
Jason do you grow other hair all over your body uncontrollably?

[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.280]
Please answer a question. I'm not sure why you're stuttering is it because you're nervous?

[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:33.280]
Maybe are you intimidated by the man in the golden century 21 Blazer who's more than twice your age?

[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:39.020]
asking you the tough questions. I'm one of that's what I thought Jason if you can't answer the tough questions

[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.540]
You can't play for the New York Yankees can you?

[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:47.540]
You waited you think the New York Yankees would be so horrible this year. I guess this keeps Jackson

[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:53.540]
You heard it right from the mouth and the former hairy lip of New York Yankees. Jason Jambi

[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:58.060]
Oh, Keith Jackson. Oh brother. It's just I don't know. I don't understand it

[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:02.440]
I mean I'm not saying I don't like Keith Jackson, but the greatest sportscaster of all time

[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:06.580]
The greatest blow by a blow play by play

[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.260]
Now somebody says

[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:12.520]
Your list is missing Lindsay Nelson and not by accident either Lindsay Nelson was awful

[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.660]
He also had a lot of flashy sport coats, you know like Bob Prince only he wasn't no Bob Prince or Don Jerry

[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.300]
Lindsay Nelson sucked

[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:25.180]
Also, it says it's about time for you to make another trip to Las Vegas is Craig in Palm Beach. No Craig. Sorry

[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.600]
Don't you love people what they tell me how to run my life and where to go?

[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.600]
I mean, you know some people love to tell us where to go and one day we probably will

[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:39.580]
Yeah, I'm going to eat her who is a fellow candidate what Academy alum

[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:43.060]
But not for my class though obviously Peter

[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.980]
Probably younger because everybody you know one thing about when you get old like me everybody's younger

[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.200]
Unless you're in South Florida when they no matter how old you are everybody ever

[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.100]
See and let me just give you a little piece of information

[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.980]
For you young whipper snappers under a hundred

[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.580]
And that is when you get unless you've got like physical infirmities. You know you have a tough time walking or you've got

[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.940]
You know hearing problem or whatever you don't you don't feel like you're like an old man

[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:16.700]
You know what I mean right you don't feel like an old goat. I feel like about I don't know 45. Okay, you know what I mean?

[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.800]
Good, I'd like to feel something keep walking I do good

[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:28.520]
In fact just just from the machine what I do is I put my jacket on the back of the they don't have the cups anymore because there are no coins

[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.480]
You used to put the cup on the chair to save your machine

[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.200]
So I put my jacket on a back of machine

[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.860]
I make sure I have a couple of quid it's left in a machine and then I go walk to the tearum

[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.660]
Which is a long long walk and then of course you got to walk back and

[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.960]
Then walking to the parking lot and back that may not sound like a lot

[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.620]
But it's more walking in one trip to Woodland that I would do in a year and so forth

[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:52.600]
I'd be dead already I'd be dead probably one 90 on the scale this morning

[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.260]
Now that's not great, but it's also not so bad

[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.100]
It's better than the 240 are we lugging around at IOD Wow

[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.540]
Like in that video is that what you wait

[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.220]
That particular video. I don't know. I don't think that's this

[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:09.540]
Fatter than your torso fat neck. Yes, I like Walt no neck Williams

[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.540]
Had a big oh, I was a thick neck. Yeah, I wouldn't say no neck. You had done nothing but neck all

[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:24.220]
Neck mm-hmm, but not red, but just eyes on top of it no red neck and a neck with eyes. That's good

[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.600]
That's like an ass with eyes then at least you can see where you're when you're sitting down

[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.300]
You wouldn't be sitting on no monger

[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.760]
Don't use it pass right by yeah, yeah eyes not wanting to hear it

[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.100]
Peter from a candidate where Academy says probably two way a late to add the list

[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.500]
But as a kid I used to listen to Chuck Thompson doing orio games from WBAL my still my all-time favorite and let me tell you

[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.180]
Oh, Pete and Tampa and let me tell you Pete and Tampa Chuck Thompson was not only a great broadcaster

[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.680]
He was a good guy too when I worked at

[01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:01.120]
What was it JNO in Palm Beach 1975? Well of course back in those days the

[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:07.860]
Was it the Orioles? I don't know who the hell it was well anyway the Braves played the exhibition games in West Palm

[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:15.200]
And he was there to broadcast one of those games. I guess maybe for the Orioles and I met him in the at the stadium

[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.780]
And he was just a great guy sat and talked and talked and talked I met him in the freebie food lounge whatever they call that

[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.120]
What do they call that?

[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.100]
They could they have the free the for the broadcast the hospitality tent. Yeah, I like that and

[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.280]
He was a really good guy Chuck Thompson

[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.200]
I'll tell you who else I met and was a really good guy even though everybody in a business hated him and he could have been on

[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.540]
List too is Milo Hamilton

[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.620]
Boy when he was with the white socks and Harry was there they hated each other like poison is what everybody is said

[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:50.400]
I've read it. I'd be reading it hated each other Milo Milo was good

[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.760]
He did the braves he did the white socks Milo was really the broadcaster and a good guy

[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.180]
Didn't interview with him on JNO boy those were the days man. That was quite a year 1975

[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:03.240]
I weighed 168 pounds then I had lost a hundred pounds in a year

[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:08.900]
And then you know what happened he died I found it. Oh, okay

[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.440]
I don't know if Milo Hamilton is dead or alive. I don't know

[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:12.820]
Harry's still dead

[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.260]
Tim and Miami says I don't know how you did it when you called a hurricane baseball games

[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:21.700]
But play by playing ounces and football often rely on spotters to identify the players of all to a certain play

[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:22.380]
That's correct

[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.740]
We don't have spotters in baseball if you need spotters to do a baseball game

[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.300]
You got a real tourists your blind is a bad

[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.760]
Maybe Moe had bad spotters

[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.100]
Or the earpiece in his hairpiece were fighting with one another

[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.620]
That might have been it

[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.580]
The earpiece get falling out of the hair piece. I don't know only Moe know

[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.840]
He says good point Tim excellent

[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.920]
Well the emails are really pouring in today and

[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.200]
You trying to give me to take calls again today shame on you shame on you

[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.720]
Please take some call on me if I listen to you shame on me they like the calls if you listen to me

[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.200]
If you well, we don't have any calls at the moment

[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.380]
What nothing then I just I don't know when you make stuff up

[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.340]
You should send me a script and why you like network? What did you have against that movie? Oh?

[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.900]
It's just awful. I thought that's right after this

[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:16.540]
Steve God needs to email me a script too so I can say the things he thinks I said oh

[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.060]
You always this is your same routine all the time

[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.000]
You do it continuously

[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.680]
I never put a lie like a some bitch you say the opposite of everything that I said he said I'm a son of a bitch

[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.320]
Yes a lying skeething and Chris is agreeing with you. Yeah, he knows he hears it

[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:42.740]
That was pretty weak that the Keith Jackson bit and the bit was all right except the Keith Jackson voice was very weak

[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.640]
I'm sure we have one another thing somewhere there

[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.740]

[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.600]

[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.880]
As in the fable the ugly duckling grew into a swan

[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.860]
Well, what did that mean yeah, wow jackpot?

[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:14.940]

[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.940]
Deputy QA and there you go, okay reach over and shut it off

[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.960]
When you wanted to call that's right. That's what I wanted that was

[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:34.420]
They missed the calls they want the calls they like to hear you interacting

[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:41.320]
I don't wow I don't want I ain't gonna

[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:47.660]
Here's the way to pull is setting up right now now how you all would get a thousand votes on this easy my right Chris

[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.320]
Yeah, thanks, sir because generally the barometer is if we get over 800 by noon

[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:57.740]
Then we can get those thousand vote if we're not at least over 800. We got seven seventy four already

[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:03.940]
And so I love in 24 and there's old McCain seven ninety four that are energy efficient and are not dependent on the car

[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:10.800]
Yeah, almost 800. It's not even thirty that's our goal and my friends we can talk good anybody possibly even look at him and say

[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.800]
This man is gonna be our next president with that bimbo. He found in a shopping mall somewhere

[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.100]
As vice president a heartbeat away from this dying old man

[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:24.800]
Who wants to bomb the Russians and the Iranians and the North Koreans and Canada and everybody?

[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.660]
Hey, did you get that email essentially?

[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.820]
About what about the Glenn Beck article? Oh?

[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.860]
It's not much really to it, so

[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.720]
Well, why do I need article? Am I not the guy who told everybody? What is it under? What where did you send it to?

[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.160]
Oh Yahoo. Oh, I'm not gonna be you think I'm gonna be looking at that

[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:51.340]
I got all these important emails on here. I'm gonna be looking at Yahoo. Let me just tell you something about Yahoo Yahoo email sucks

[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.000]
I get the same spam with these dams

[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.240]
Soft sea Alice and soft biagra and hard penis and all this other stuff from the same idiots over it

[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:08.300]
Here's one right now from Boykin gross. It's pretty gross and you click on spam and it doesn't they don't filter it out

[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.240]
They don't filter it out

[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.840]
So where's the article Chris?

[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.360]
It's a link. Yeah, it's a link

[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:22.280]
That really stink when you know it's a footy gets the boot. It's Tom jicke. It's a good article. Thank you very much

[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.200]
fat Chris you make quick and print it out I

[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.740]
Can't believe that Tom jicke actually discovered something that's going on

[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:35.040]
I shouldn't say that there was a nice shot. He took a Joe Bell. I was good time didn't mention his name

[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.180]
He didn't have to rip him an ass

[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.920]
And how can Bill he would be tied for last place with Van Miller Frank, Houston Bob Cole on our poll?

[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.900]
You people have no soul

[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.360]
My god

[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.520]
That's because most of these people are like Yahoo's they never got out they never were anywhere

[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.940]
What happened all the people from the North and the amid West?

[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.080]
Jim Gordon should have been on her too. He was a great arranger's announcer on the in New York

[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.860]
And what about Sam Rosen?

[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.900]
Who I say let's start it all over again

[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:13.380]
Good plan. We better do the break though. And then we can read about the footy got canned

[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.360]
He got the cans

[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:24.280]
Fort like you're five sixty QAM the fourth leader the biggest name the best talent

[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.440]

Sports radio five sixty QAM

Yeah, the sports leader

[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:41.160]
New God. Hi, I'm NAC and I'm Barack. My renting made is the governor of the giant state of Alaska

[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:48.000]
My running mate is a senator of the small state of Delaware. My VP choice likes to shoot moose

[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.500]
Well, mine likes to shoot off his mouth. My renting mate is a smoking hot former beauty queen named Sarah

[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:59.260]
My running mate is an old white guy with hair plugs named Joe

[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.980]
Ha ha I win. Oh

[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.800]
Boy, I'm not having time to up print all these great things out and Tom jicca the responses to the article. What's the best?

[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.120]
About footsie. Oh really is our people upset? No

[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:23.920]
Well a couple of more I wouldn't be surprised if he sent him in okay. Let me let me get to it

[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.340]
This email thing boy just a lot of work too much like work as opposed to sitting back and punching up those lines

[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.020]
And

[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.240]
If you give me that crap again about the public wants to call

[01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.060]
800 tree votes on our pool

[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.340]
Let's see Milo Hamilton is still doing the Houston Astro games

[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.500]
He and skip carry an Ernie Johnson

[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.540]
Were what made the braves into America's team on channel 17 on WTBS Ernie Johnson sucked

[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:59.080]
And he kept retiring and retiring and then they would bring him back

[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.460]
And he would be on some other oh

[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.000]
Says no more America's team braves their left with a bunch of

[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.260]
Brub abroad casters is that a shot at the the booster chip is no chip off the a carry block chip carry

[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.600]
Says Fred and queer water

[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.420]
Nothing wrong with chip carry

[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:17.860]
He's no skip and he's certainly no hairy but then again who is

[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.380]
Larry says thanks for setting us straight about Howard co-sale

[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.980]
I'm not a sports fan but when I was little whipper snapper that's what I thought he did on football night

[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.500]
No, that's not what he did on football night. He sat and commentated

[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:37.480]
And he interacted with dandy Don turn out the lights the parties. Oh, and of course frank yufford who was semi-literate at best

[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:43.240]
Another classic exam that that must have just really pained co-sale have it to work with gifford

[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.460]
Who was so inarticulate and did the play by play he was just a dullard

[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:51.920]
He was too up Monday night football. What Kimba Bo camper is to the world a dullard

[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:57.440]
Tom jikas says footy gets the boot the footy show is no more

[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.060]
Wio D has reverted the decision of a year ago Glenn Beck is back in the nine-aimed anew in spot

[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.780]
He occupied to last September when he was replaced by the return of john footy cross to daily radio

[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.160]
And what are footies cross about do you think

[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:17.880]
That's bad footy one of the good guys in the business had been retired after 32 years this morning host on why 100 may of 2006

[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:24.340]
The demise of the footy show and unfocused mishmash of humor current events and interviews with local boring newsmakers

[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.120]
Marks that up now. That's his word

[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.400]
jikas puts that with local boring newsmakers

[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.600]
Marks the departure of the last locally hosted program on wio D

[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.660]
syndicated open up a pot and put something cheap and crappy on the same right wing nonsense

[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.960]
Wio D program director crin Charles who put footy on said he rooted for the show

[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.280]
footy is a true pro and he gave it his best but the ratings just weren't there

[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.980]
And if you think they're going to be there now with syndicated Glenn direct your dreaming

[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.940]
Ken Charles who are you kidding man you're so full of crap oh

[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:57.160]
Neil is the a gold standard of park radio yeah right

[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.720]
I told you they wouldn't put me on here and now just before the election five weeks before the election to the day

[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.820]
You notice they're loading up with the right wing propaganda because that's teeth channel

[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:08.680]
I

[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.420]
Elsewhere I look for radio power 96 is extended the contract of its popular morning DJ

[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.460]
Las Mendes through august

[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.420]
2010 DJ last ice call and DJ last whoever you are. Do I ever meet him?

[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:23.220]
I don't think so maybe he's a very good guy. Yep

[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.180]
Is it look good the pimple of the lip you would you wouldn't think so

[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:34.400]
Oh, well, I'm not asking what I think so I'm just just asking an objective answer that's all he's not my type either

[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:41.720]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha but I bet your clerics has got the odds for no I don't think he plays games. Hey Clarence you fairy

[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.420]
Oh DJ last correct

[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:44.660]
Now

[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:50.760]
There's eight million comments should I read some of these so we're kind of funny. I'm glad Glenn is back

[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.000]
I don't agree with footy politically. Oh, I see that's right. If footy was that that's why they took him off the year

[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.320]
He was to the left of a till of a hunt

[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:03.660]
Tom I'm not surprised you're about to demise of footy your show wasn't interesting his vocal talent wasn't very good

[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:08.500]
After listening to him for a few weeks. I knew it would be a matter of time same goes for Jim DeFeedy at WFTL

[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.920]
Hurrah back to boring redundant conservative drug addicts. Can you say satellite radio because South Florida radio stinks says Olga

[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.540]
Posted by uncle Neil just went himself with laughter. It says

[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.240]
If anyone has not noticed it was not that footy is bad at all

[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.040]
WIOD 610 and WINZ 940 remember the same company in clowns

[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.720]
They've slowly but surely replaced all the independent thinkers last two months

[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.080]
Gunner Alexa Dave Lamont and Nathan Nicole Sandler who are both far and away better than the racist

[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.540]
I'mest and the wacko Beck

[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.480]
It seems to me since the election is coming closer and closer

[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:44.880]
The polshire Obama head that either this programmer can Charles's ignorant or racist or just a follower to do what he's told

[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.380]
Without standing up for the good of the people good of the people give me a break

[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.680]
Here's one. I wish that all you liberals were just piped down

[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:58.280]
In fact is that footy was boring nobody was listening besides Beck was on too late and 610 was probably losing audience to 1290

[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.360]
Which had Beckon from nine to noon. Oh, yeah

[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.600]
1290 they're getting a big audience not

[01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:09.980]
Here's one that says good riddance. I was horrified last year when I turned on WIOD to find that Glenn Beck had been sent to the nine PM hour

[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.080]
Footy might have been okay if he would have stuck to local issues like he said he would

[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:19.540]
But when he started with politics the true socialists came out had to turn it off glad to have Glenn Beck back signed eight-all Hitler

[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:28.120]
And it goes on about his liberals to the air all the right wing i.o. D. Croud. Oh, I'm sure glad that Glenn Beck is back

[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:32.200]
Now just put Sean Hannity back three to six and I'll listen to i.o. D. from nine to six PM

[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.340]
All these right wingers man all these Nazis you can you can hear the goose stepping already

[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.660]
Here's one from don't list as I emailed Ken Charles from months saying footy was horrible

[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:45.240]
And I quit listening to 610 start listening to 1290

[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.260]
I think it has nothing to do with politics

[01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:51.960]
I think a three-hour show asking the same laying question like what's your favorite burger gets old

[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.880]
He was annoying by taking calls

[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.400]
But before letting anyone get a word in it. Why is he cut him off my hang up on it?

[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.960]
It got so annoying I turned the channel every time I heard one of his lame promos

[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.620]
Tom says that meat market bit was a loss of waiting to happen

[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:13.420]
The oracle says footy always reminded me of some guy who hangs out and crummy new Jersey clubs

[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.000]
Justin says hey footy was my bud

[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.600]
He screwed himself though. We should have stayed a while 100 a couple of words between commercials

[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.220]
That's where he belongs or he can do like sunny fox remember sunny. He's on satellite radio getting done

[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:32.340]
I guess uncle Neil will probably be next they've boned him pardon that and neutered even the great near-riders now can't do a show

[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:36.420]
Oh well as long as the page that continues to clear he and George don't care poor George

[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.700]
Hope he's saving money once Neil goes he's done

[01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:42.360]
No one will hire him since in this day and age one company owns everything which is ridiculous

[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:49.160]
Neil God and by footy maybe Kim a boat can't hold him a job as a greeter like Walmart as it knew as a new sports bar implantation

[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.460]
How do you like that?

[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:54.040]
They wish a good luck. Oh, thank you

[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.300]
Here's what about Nancy Pelosi Pelosi this and Pelosi another illiterate right-winger

[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.400]
Dave Roberts is to heck with them all get rick and suds

[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.660]
They're just a zillion of these on here a lot of comment most of it negative

[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:12.580]
Although footy seemed like a decent person listening him was like being stuck at a bar with an obnoxious nobidol

[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:19.900]
Who's often wrong but never unsure? I tried to listen to the show but always ended up turning it off from either boredom or discussed at her his verbose stupidity

[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:20.820]
wow

[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:25.920]
Ron says the guy they have now sucks balls footy was better

[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.060]
He had a meat market deal with crazy women going on dates. It was funny

[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:34.660]
He also talked about lots of stuff this guy all he talks about is the market market bailout bailout that boring crap now

[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.840]
They have people going back to boring meal Rogers he has no balls anymore

[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.360]
He does what some lawyer tells him to do the FCC says it's okay to do fart noises

[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.800]
But since the lawyer says no he doesn't use the fart noises

[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.380]
He's a paper tiger. He show his boring. It used to be funny with all those songs and jokes

[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:56.340]
But now we can't use them hey w. Why would he put some fun people on the radio to listen to funny stuff and forget all the crap that's going on says Ron as in more on

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.580]

You don't remember Kurt Gaudi. Yes, I know the name. I probably heard that Kurt Gaudi and I OD he's dead now

[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.960]
He was a nice guy. I never was a big guy. I mean he was okay. I mean didn't dislike him

[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.620]
But he turned out to be a really nice guy

[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.700]
He was out with me for one night and I met him in the studio

[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:38.380]
Why would I have been there in the at that time of day?

[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.500]
I don't know. I don't either. Maybe we had a meeting or something

[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:47.980]

[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:04.460]
I'm a victim of recession

[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.100]
Buying from his

[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.780]
Stores and I don't know if I'll get through it

[01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:15.890]

[01:19:51.930 --> 01:19:56.590]
It's the softy kind of me. I'm saving nickels and corners

[01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:04.130]
I'm cutting coupons because I'm a victim of recession

[01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:07.970]
Buying from this

[01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.870]
Long me $50 wow

[01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:13.730]
Whoever put that in there really stuck the joint out you know, yeah

[01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:16.350]
Who did put this stuff in here way back when?

[01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:21.290]
It was a joint venture, but a lot of part timers were involved. Joe Castello helped

[01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:26.750]
For the most part so it was me and him and then we've had lots of flunkies as a put stuff in there

[01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:33.010]
Wow if there's no trip tone on it it's someone else someone else did it. Oh somebody else did that one

[01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:35.150]
Weighted weighted

[01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:35.510]
Mm-hmm

[01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:41.330]
Here's the poll 813 votes in fact Chris is bouncing up and down like a little baby boy

[01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:42.190]
You know it

[01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:44.270]
You can feel the tremors all the way here

[01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:48.630]
Who is or was the greatest played by a place sportscaster all time somebody

[01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:51.950]
Kevin says your list is missing a Maryland legend check Thompson

[01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:54.730]
And we just talk about Chuck Thompson and I said I met him and what a good guy

[01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:58.130]
He was and he was a great broadcaster, but we left him off. Okay, so sue me

[01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:03.650]
His signature on your exclamation ain't to be her cold and go to war misdiagnas are still famous in Baltimore

[01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:08.990]
He was the best thanks Kevin. He was great. Well, we left him off of there, but he wasn't the best of all time

[01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:13.170]
And neither are a lot of these people on this list here, but you know, you got to have a list

[01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:18.390]
And the the result of this list is such a revealing

[01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:24.810]
I mean, it's like opening up a gigantic scab and seeing the puss and ooze inside. Oh my

[01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:27.250]
A festering scab

[01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.290]
Like on your ass. I'm

[01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:34.670]
The greatest play by play sportscaster all time. I'm surprised nobody voted for Joseph Gackie

[01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:42.310]
That's the soft Florida mentality Jimmy syphilis Joseph Gackie and Dave Ann boring the marlins when the world series

[01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.970]
God

[01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:47.110]
He needs a goose

[01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:54.310]
In fact, maybe a good foot up his crack them asked would do it no more Marlon games. I guess for wildhawk Chris

[01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:58.190]
Nope, no more Yankee games no more meds games nope

[01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:02.530]
Oh, and somebody actually somebody with a great sense of humor. I guess suggested the scooter

[01:22:03.730 --> 01:22:12.150]
Phil Rosuto the money store Phil Rosuto one of the all time only cow only cow the worst the absolute worst

[01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:13.790]
Here it is

[01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:20.490]
Ralph, oh, this is chronic Ralph. He's usually pretty good emailer, but he's just lost it today

[01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:27.470]
He says hey all you dumbasses play by play a self explanatory in the same for commentators while some of these people are a little bit slow

[01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:34.970]
Ralph Kiner and Lindsay Nelson how about Phil the money store Rosuto only cow yeah, I put them all in the same category

[01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:36.690]
No, that's that's a shot of Lindsay Nelson

[01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:41.810]
At least Lindsay was articulate he was boring. I think he was from Alabama or somewhere like that

[01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:48.210]
But Ralph Kiner and the worst thing about Ralph Kiner is he had a bad stroke and and he kept working

[01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:51.370]
They kept putting him on the air. Yeah, I don't know if he's still working

[01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:56.130]
Hey, like you know a stroke where like the one side of your mouth rules down

[01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:59.030]
He's like McCain. He was drooling all the time

[01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:02.810]
Of course McCain was drooling because he kept checking out Sarah's ass

[01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:09.090]
Greatest play by play sports catcher all time the astute south photo audience who knows nothing about sports keep Jackson

[01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.510]

I was never a big Vin Scully fan

[01:23:27.650 --> 01:23:30.930]
But once in a while if I'm channel surfing on the baseball package

[01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:37.070]
Yeah, I hear Vin Scully's voice. Oh, thank god. It's somebody actually doing mind hearing. You know what I mean? What he did

[01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:44.050]
In other words, he really belongs there. He's a real broadcaster as opposed to the Lenny martesis of the world

[01:23:44.050 --> 01:23:48.950]
Which are all over the place all these illiterate dumb jocks and it's just frequent went to program

[01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:53.030]
There you go. You a choice. That's Q. I. M. for you right there. That's the swill

[01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:56.110]
That's the garbage that the management puts on here on a station

[01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:59.830]
And I bet you'll let me once wore a jock strap

[01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:10.770]
In fact, I understand that these they should have meetings in Greg's office. Yeah, scruan and Roy and Lenny martesis and Troy

[01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:12.910]
Well, then he's like a personal trainer

[01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:19.230]
You know, yeah, and they all wore a jock strap. I got your crow bodice right here home boy. Where would they wear them the crow?

[01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:22.790]

Rick Jenner retts got three votes. Do you have any idea how secular religious that is?

[01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:43.270]

[01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:48.730]
Or here's Joe Dodge. Yola's got a poll suggestion. Yeah, I'm surprised nobody voted for Joe garage Yola

[01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:52.630]
You did check and put the car in the garage Yola

[01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.750]

[01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:03.050]
Jim says Rick Jenner retts fantastic

[01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:08.310]
Absolutely for those of you don't know he does play my play broad cash for the Buffalo Sabers

[01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:12.810]
If you go to YouTube you can address him with his famous game calls including mayday mayday

[01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:13.990]
Goal go

[01:26:14.770 --> 01:26:15.430]

[01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:20.370]
Something on any fight that occurs our grade give that guy listen and what about

[01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:30.730]
Also Marv Albert is a sick bastard. We're not when I ask him who's the nicest guy who dresses up nice and Marv Albert's a sick bastard

[01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:34.570]
Maybe it's commentary when something like this one he assaulted that woman in a hotel room pews back

[01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:36.650]
Yes, full of sunshine by the air

[01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:42.450]
Something about Marv Albert wants me to take a shower see Jim unfortunately and gets to New York is too busy

[01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:47.650]
We're about the private lives of these guys if you find out about the private lives of most people you'd say oh my god

[01:26:47.650 --> 01:26:51.250]
There's sleazy and slimeball. Oh my god. That's right am I right? Yep

[01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:56.850]
Drunks and degenerates as it's a drug ease and right if they're not that's right

[01:26:56.850 --> 01:27:01.910]
I wonder what Jim and gets full is doing yeah right wants to take a shower with who Jim huh who do you want to take the shower with?

[01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:03.250]
Probably Marv Albert

[01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:09.210]
One thing I will say the sad part about Marv Albert is they gave us that kid that Kenny Albert with a mush mouth

[01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:13.750]
I'm telling you who else I don't like Chris is that Harlan what's the name Kevin Harlan

[01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:18.150]
That's okay. I guess no he sounds he sounds a little bit like

[01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:21.770]
Kenny Albert he sounds like he's got some of the elephant dung left over from the pile

[01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:23.310]
Got much much more

[01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:28.050]
Most know 40 hour. I don't like people to sound like they've got a mouthful of a mong

[01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:33.430]
Like Kenny Albert if Kenny Albert weren't Marv Albert son. He wouldn't he couldn't get a job at

[01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:36.010]
WGV engine even in New York

[01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:39.050]
Assuming it's still on here, which I doubt

[01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:46.190]
That's a good poll questions like she and what was your favorite radio station that no longer exists?

[01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:50.010]
Good one not just in the South Florida market, but like anywhere, you know

[01:27:50.650 --> 01:27:59.270]
Did they were they still she when they were doing the the progressive music right on the verge of playing some good new music before they changed it into like the plan and or something like that?

[01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:02.230]
You're asking me yeah asking you

[01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:06.150]
Well she went to the no she went to the coast she is not the planet

[01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:09.870]
No, it's 3.5 correct coast is

[01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:11.750]
7.3 right

[01:28:13.150 --> 01:28:16.610]
That used to be TTR. Oh, that's what the yeah

[01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:24.470]
It was GTR which wasn't a bad station then they turned the coast slush just a good rock and roll station not the best of the world

[01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:29.790]
But right yeah, and who is on GTR who are those guys out in the morning patty Murray herman and McBean

[01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:33.070]
And McQueen that's right patty Murray she died. Yes, she did

[01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:40.590]
Wow, they you know they put that plaque on the van remember that they made the daddy Murray Memorial van a month later

[01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:44.590]
They changed the the station sold the van, you know scrapped everything

[01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:53.650]
See here's another guy bill who doesn't understand what this pulls about I just had a chance to put the radio on

[01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:55.970]
This is Mark Morgan. It's the 12 to one hour on Q a M

[01:29:55.970 --> 01:30:03.430]
From the comedic mind of Matt Damon comes Disney's hilarious new film that's fun for the whole family

[01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:09.810]
White house hockey mom starring Terry Gar is Sarah Palin. Hey, rap that's off side

[01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:18.090]
Just like Vladimir Putin's expansion into the former Soviet plot. I tell you that's found on thin ice and Charles

[01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:19.950]
Roden as first husband Todd

[01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:24.470]
Hey honey. I just built a new practice or ain't got back

[01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:29.330]
Please tell me you didn't put it in the road garden

[01:30:30.010 --> 01:30:30.450]
Uh-oh

[01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:41.130]
They're the first family of funny Disney's White House hockey mom coming soon, but not too soon if yes, John McCain

[01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:44.130]
Oh, look at that the doll is up 300 points

[01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:44.530]
Oh

[01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:49.230]
I wrote it down it was 291 and then as soon as I wrote it down it switched

[01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:51.510]
It was they put the bushes push on the TV

[01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:55.170]
From that boring speech you're this morning about how the sky is falling

[01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:59.170]
Certain thank God. It's not his fault. You know it. He had nothing to do with it

[01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:06.270]
That was up 300 points and as they accept about 73 and the S&P the stedidon poor is up 41

[01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:11.010]
Super beef is a seasonal hamburger offered by McDonald's in Russia

[01:31:11.690 --> 01:31:14.350]
Available from February 6th to April 1st

[01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:17.870]
This year, so I guess it's a maybe no mole

[01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:20.530]
And it sounds to me like the anise burger

[01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:27.070]
The sandwich consists of a hundred percent beef fatty sauteed onions ice burger lettuce slice it tomato spicy tomato sauce

[01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:30.290]
garlic mayonnaise and aged cheddar cheese on a chia bata bun

[01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:36.650]
The price of these sandwiches 88 rubles the super beef is also offered with bacon at 98 rubles

[01:31:39.210 --> 01:31:43.810]
And in New Zealand they got a thing called the keybie burger at Mickey D's sounds like crap

[01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:44.770]
sure does

[01:31:45.370 --> 01:31:51.570]
It's an all-beef patty egg tomato lettuce cheese onion kick cooked beetroot sauce and now it's turned in a toasted bun

[01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:53.290]
The egg is fried in a round shape

[01:31:53.910 --> 01:32:01.610]
It was also sold in Australia under the name mcaz however did not include the egg the mcaz has been discontinued and then replaced by the McFeeze deluxe

[01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:03.350]
I know

[01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.910]
beetroot

[01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:12.950]
Sounds awful, and that sounds awful like kaka yes like oh for kaka push push your listeners here's Jason

[01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:19.290]
When are you going to change this poll who cares this poll sucks your listeners are not jocks nippers

[01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:22.810]
And then he's got in big caps change the effing poll

[01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:26.030]
No, I'll change it when I feel like it

[01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:28.330]
In fact just just because you were a moron

[01:32:28.330 --> 01:32:30.350]
I'm going to leave it up there to leave it to a thousand votes

[01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:33.290]
Then I'll change it I could change it right now, but I don't want to

[01:32:34.530 --> 01:32:36.070]
Our listeners are not jocks nippers

[01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:42.150]
And that's something in other words in order to be in order to have an opinion on great sports casters

[01:32:42.150 --> 01:32:46.470]
You must be a jocks nipper you must be in that ponderous sports crap

[01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:49.390]
You know what I mean I do

[01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:51.910]
You see the game you see the game?

[01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:57.330]
Oh, I'll say what did I miss mike lang was a bad omission. I think we ought to start that one over again

[01:32:57.330 --> 01:32:59.870]
Just in honor of Jason start to hold pull over

[01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:02.270]
Mike Langdon have any votes out of 831

[01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:05.470]
It's got to be a while before we get to a thousand Jason. Sorry

[01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:09.330]
Well, what what is the poll have to do with anything when you come right down to it

[01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:14.890]
See you could criticize no matter what you do. Oh, and you read the poll results too much

[01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:17.710]
You're sending it in you're mailing in the numbers from the poll okay

[01:33:17.710 --> 01:33:22.190]
And then if you don't oh, I'll change it. I don't like it change it. This is uh this sucks

[01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:25.570]
You follow what I'm saying? Yep

[01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:28.850]
Sean you know Sean from Hollywood the poll guy Sean right

[01:33:28.850 --> 01:33:33.330]
It says forgive me if the email below is stale, but here it is

[01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:39.530]
Remember the congressman psychologist in Fahrenheit 9-11 who said you can make people do anything when they were afraid remember that yep

[01:33:40.110 --> 01:33:47.650]
According to NBC news there's a clause in the bailout proposal that says the treasury secretary's decisions cannot be appealed or amended by any court or legislative body

[01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:53.490]
It's useful to be called a Hitler was awarded addicted to real powers by a multi-party lawfully elected legislature

[01:33:53.490 --> 01:33:57.890]
Who then dissolve themselves by majority vote the bailout is the fiscal 9-11

[01:33:58.430 --> 01:34:02.670]
It's a money grab note the rush to make a decision and money going directly to the banks and investment firms

[01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:06.730]
Imagine you have a company and your guaranteed have seen profits no matter how badly you fail

[01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:10.250]
It's simplicity itself just take the money and the government will replace it

[01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:17.330]
If defaulting mortgages were really the problem could we not issue mortgage vouchers directly to homeowners to bridge the gap between the income and the mortgage payment

[01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:21.710]
This way the homeowner keeps his home the banker gets paid well nearly the same cost of the taxpayer

[01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:26.150]
By the way, I can explain those black eyes on Maria Bartolombo

[01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:28.010]
She gets punched in the face a lot this morning

[01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:32.050]
She repeats on talking point that oil prices are the result of supply despite

[01:34:32.710 --> 01:34:36.890]
Recent proof that rampant speculation in the option market is the real cause. This is old

[01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:44.630]
But still relevant and then incredibly she said investors should stay the course and have diversified investments in stocks and real estate

[01:34:44.630 --> 01:34:49.550]
I'm surprised. She didn't recommend N. Ron Polaroid or our white the stars steamship lines

[01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:52.710]
I understand they have written one sinkable ship sailing out of Southampton

[01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:57.010]
She needs to get a job that's more socially responsible like clubbing baby seals

[01:34:57.790 --> 01:35:01.650]
And Sean says I am but flots him on the foaming surf of horror

[01:35:04.530 --> 01:35:05.050]
Wow

[01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:10.470]
Talk about emotional huh change the pool change on how come gene hearts not on there

[01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:20.190]
Says Friedrich voice of the filth at off your flyers gene heart spelled G-E-N-E not J-E-N like John like a frog gene heart was Jewish not French

[01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:24.890]
God he's dead by the way gene heart he was fat now. He's dead

[01:35:26.850 --> 01:35:27.570]
He was good

[01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:34.370]
But too many tasty cakes put him over there. That was the sponsor and when the fires would score a goal. He'd say another taste of tasty cake

[01:35:37.050 --> 01:35:42.450]
Yeah, and he tasted cake was the sponsor obviously he ate up all the profits because he was big and fat and he died

[01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:44.970]
He choked on tasty cake no doubt. He was good

[01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:47.230]
Gene heart

[01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.830]
He's

[01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:50.550]
Here's one from Chuck

[01:35:51.930 --> 01:35:56.930]
After Neil yesterday mentioned the band bread David gates George played some songs from bread and David gates

[01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:58.490]
I went to the website YouTube

[01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:03.730]
Cube to listen to some bread songs and found a video of David gates playing a medley of his hits

[01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:07.370]
He's playing with only guitar on the show top of the pops

[01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:12.130]
It's from 2000 to what amazes me his voice is still the same even though

[01:36:12.970 --> 01:36:16.350]
He is in the video and is early in in the early 60s

[01:36:16.350 --> 01:36:20.770]
What oh he's actually 60s. I don't know what they you may want to check it out. No

[01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:22.090]
says Chuck

[01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:23.810]
I don't want to

[01:36:24.490 --> 01:36:29.150]
We had enough of David gates yesterday last night. I'm a beautiful voice wonderful voice ugly

[01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:31.790]
Ugly look like david gravy line

[01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.790]
Ugly

[01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:37.870]
Sorry, David, but you're ugly and so am I but at least I admit it

[01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:40.150]
Trevor says oh

[01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:41.110]
Trevor

[01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:46.510]
Here is maybe the silliest email since we said what is it like tomorrow be three weeks we've been doing the emails

[01:36:47.370 --> 01:36:49.250]
Okay, I think it's been pretty good

[01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:51.750]
Of course we could take some calls you know

[01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:53.590]
We could

[01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:59.450]
By a certain name oh here's here's another look at this

[01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:02.150]
This is just

[01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:07.990]
Sad more asking palm metal ray. I don't like askisses

[01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:12.790]
This is just like the one we had yesterday. Oh quit being so humble. How come you're not on the list

[01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:16.170]
And this one I'll print it out

[01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:22.770]
Great dead radio stations hands down franken St. Pete says ckl w

[01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:26.250]
How do you like that? All right

[01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:40.050]
Yeah, let's play some jingos man

[01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:45.910]
So anyway this a palm metal races the radio guys who came up before tv took over were the best red barbers

[01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:51.510]
My personal favorite he can make a rain to lay interesting and why isn't Neil Rogers the sports announcer on list? What up with that

[01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:57.410]
What up with that is that Neil Rogers isn't the best play by play sports announcer whoever lived and I'm not interested in like

[01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:59.050]
You know patting myself on the back

[01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:00.310]
God

[01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:06.350]
Mr. Ego palm metal ray take it easy. I'm Lindsay Nelson when you spoke with Chuck Thompson reminded me of a similar afternoon

[01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:11.170]
I spent chatting about sports broadcasting with Nelson L. Langfield he should get credit alone for carrying Ralph

[01:38:11.170 --> 01:38:12.270]
Kinder for almost two decades

[01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:18.430]
Ralph Kiner in articulate that best and then stroked out at worst and Lindsay Nelson was pathetic

[01:38:19.110 --> 01:38:22.630]
Going going going going he was bad going going

[01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:29.270]
That's what you were doing this morning, isn't it yep going going sure a lot of joysing

[01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:34.390]
Ckl w grade station but wk and r and d tour was much better keener 13

[01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:37.590]
How about Bob yuker the voice of uh

[01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:39.410]
michigan a classic

[01:38:40.890 --> 01:38:44.810]
Only it says bob ufer uf-e-r. I don't know who that is

[01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:51.150]
I thought he meant bob yuker who wasn't the voice of michigan bob yuker did the braves games when they were Milwaukee

[01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:55.770]
Bob yuker terrible former uh media yuker catcher

[01:38:56.310 --> 01:39:00.550]
Another x-jock all the x-jocks all the time yeah, like you said the

[01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:01.830]
Name an announcer

[01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:09.210]
As opposed to answering the real question they make up their own poll question right which really pisses us off by the way

[01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:15.530]
The poll question isn't isn't just name an announcer who did play by play the question is who's the greatest

[01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:21.570]
What you're wrong that's how many announcers can you name how many names do you know that's the question their answer?

[01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:23.050]
Well, here's Trevor who's an idiot

[01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:25.770]
He says please add ron franklin

[01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:28.790]

But on the coffee honey, I'm gonna be home any minute

[01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:21.870]
To leave the games early sometime because he was so disinterested in the old and the people I can see that

[01:40:22.650 --> 01:40:26.750]
One being just interested in the game wanting to go home. Yeah, the scooter

[01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:28.890]
He would scoot on home

[01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:31.090]

[01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:53.010]
Fake email from joe bill

[01:40:54.170 --> 01:40:56.090]
While he was sending me an email on that thing

[01:40:59.730 --> 01:41:01.390]
You think it's from him nope

[01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:07.970]
Why not because I don't I think he's got some plans for us all right. I think it includes a gun

[01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:21.170]
The biggest name the best talent is the mad dog

[01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:28.910]
Man, the afternoon's quarter seven sports radio five sixty two a.m. These sports leaders Neil Rodden

[01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:38.710]
Here's the announcement man

[01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:41.750]
Who do you think McCain is gonna pick his feet

[01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:53.510]
Like a right

[01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:58.130]
No, I'm gonna vote for you

[01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:02.350]
That's a risk. Oh, you just can't wait for election day

[01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:07.190]
I think of all the other than you could have been

[01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:11.070]
So I'll be love with it. I don't like your shit

[01:42:14.490 --> 01:42:17.310]
But the game of the game of the game

[01:42:21.190 --> 01:42:21.790]
I'm

[01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.830]
Looks like it's

[01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:33.150]
Okay, we're gonna add Johnny mattress. I just put the new pole up there

[01:42:33.150 --> 01:42:37.790]
And I didn't change the pool because of that jackass Jason. I changed it because it's so disheartening

[01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:40.030]
Looking at the results. Okay

[01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:46.050]
It's like asking a bunch of Eskimo's about some tan. You know, it's just pointless

[01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:51.490]
But the people that always win these are it's a name recognition thing the most famous person always wins whatever it is

[01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:52.350]
I see

[01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:54.770]
Keith Jackson haven't you noticed that?

[01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:12.710]
And I think we only got two votes new poll men up. Oh now we got another starting to trickle in we got five

[01:45:13.570 --> 01:45:14.370]
Here's the list

[01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:20.870]
Karen Carpenter see I wouldn't say Karen Carpenter had a beautiful voice. She had a great voice. It was distinct

[01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:26.330]
Is there's the pulsae who had the most distinct voice? No

[01:45:28.290 --> 01:45:32.390]
She had a manly voice. It was he had a deep voice right

[01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:34.850]
The long ago

[01:45:35.610 --> 01:45:36.970]
Played by a little Karen Carpenter

[01:45:38.850 --> 01:45:44.690]
She'll probably win and I loved the Carpenter. Don't get me wrong. Mm-hmm being Neil Queen that I am I can admit it

[01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:48.610]
But she had a great voice, but it wasn't beautiful

[01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:57.190]
You can you follow what I'm saying to this thing that I do I don't hear any Carpenter. Oh, sorry. I don't even hear a Jewish Carpenter

[01:45:57.190 --> 01:45:58.050]

[01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:03.750]
Which I guess Bill Marth thought that was very funny. Oh a Jewish Carpenter. Ha ha ha ha

[01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:09.730]
That nothing about Bill Mar he's another one of those guys who lasted him everything he says he's laughing. He's yucking it up

[01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:17.630]
No one ever kid if I should leave

[01:46:18.970 --> 01:46:20.210]
Now take it back

[01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:24.590]
That's it

[01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:28.790]
But if you play like for all we know

[01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:32.070]

[01:46:32.770 --> 01:46:33.190]

[01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:18.030]
So Richard was talking about the the one solo album she tried to make and she never had a released mm-hmm

[01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:09.790]
And then it starts out

[01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:10.350]
Hitler

[01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:11.790]
Yeah, obviously that's not Gilbert

[01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:13.910]
How do you know that?

[01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:15.290]
Because Gilbert knows who I am

[01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.570]
And he knows that I wasn't there

[01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:17.390]
Therefore

[01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:20.570]
Oh

[01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:23.630]
Gilbert knows what I look like

[01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:24.330]
Very well

[01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:26.030]
By the way Tony the UPS man in Connecticut

[01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:27.090]
Don't go away, man

[01:55:27.090 --> 01:55:27.850]
Just go away

[01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:28.690]
Go away

[01:55:28.690 --> 01:55:30.190]
When I blocked you on my space

[01:55:30.190 --> 01:55:31.110]
There was a reason for it

[01:55:31.110 --> 01:55:31.730]
Because you were a noodnik

[01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:32.690]
You bugged me

[01:55:32.690 --> 01:55:33.190]
You were an idiot

[01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:36.190]
Now you shouldn't that be enough of a message

[01:55:36.190 --> 01:55:37.170]
When you blocked somebody

[01:55:37.170 --> 01:55:38.390]
I shouldn't get a message

[01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:40.030]
Listen, it's not about what you want, Daddy O

[01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:41.650]
Oh, I forgot

[01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:43.230]
Go away

[01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:45.430]
Freddie Mercury is winning, that was your choice

[01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:46.450]
Yes it was, I don't know

[01:55:46.450 --> 01:55:48.230]
If I could change my vote I'd vote for Sarah Brightman

[01:55:48.230 --> 01:55:49.250]
Who's going to be doing well

[01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:50.670]
You she?

[01:55:51.090 --> 01:55:51.310]
Yes

[01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:54.010]
Beautiful lady with a beautiful voice

[01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:54.990]
She's got one?

[01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:57.230]
She's a beautiful lady with a beautiful voice

[01:55:57.230 --> 01:55:57.950]
I see

[01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:01.450]
Ralph, who I was doing well with these emails

[01:56:01.450 --> 01:56:04.610]
But now, how about Doris Day for your beautiful voice?

[01:56:04.730 --> 01:56:06.970]
Well I say no way Doris Day

[01:56:06.970 --> 01:56:08.570]
You talked about her the other day

[01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:09.250]
Yes we did

[01:56:09.250 --> 01:56:11.110]
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

[01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:13.850]
Case or eyes or round?

[01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:17.610]
Fat man after dark who's also chronic

[01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:18.930]
Really chronic?

[01:56:20.170 --> 01:56:22.230]
Please put John McCray on your poll

[01:56:22.230 --> 01:56:23.730]
He's leasing or the band Cake

[01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:29.270]
No I like Cake a lot

[01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:30.470]
But me too

[01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:31.490]
Beautiful voice?

[01:56:31.770 --> 01:56:32.890]
We don't have all their albums

[01:56:32.890 --> 01:56:34.010]
I don't mean the music

[01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:34.770]
I'm talking about Cake

[01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:36.750]
Like Michael and Godfather 3

[01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:37.270]
Cake?

[01:56:37.630 --> 01:56:38.490]
Dittly crouched

[01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:39.770]
If you talk about this guy

[01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:41.410]
Engines big fan

[01:56:41.410 --> 01:56:42.490]
Not a beautiful voice

[01:56:42.490 --> 01:56:44.190]
The green light flashes

[01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:45.430]
The flags go up

[01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:46.850]
Churning and burning

[01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:48.130]
They yarn for the cup

[01:56:48.130 --> 01:56:49.570]
They definitely maneuver

[01:56:49.570 --> 01:56:49.990]
Okay

[01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.650]
And so for right

[01:56:50.650 --> 01:56:51.190]
Okay

[01:56:52.630 --> 01:56:54.110]
Get some health fat man

[01:56:54.110 --> 01:56:57.790]
I think the fat's cutting off your circulation at the neck just like Fat Christopher

[01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:01.150]
Here's some exciting radio news

[01:57:01.150 --> 01:57:03.430]
WG and American cable channel will broadcast

[01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:05.810]
Daily highlights of the Bob and Tom shows

[01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:09.130]
Indicated Morning Radio program beginning November turd

[01:57:09.130 --> 01:57:10.230]
The Bob and Tom show ears

[01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:12.330]
I'm more than 150 radio stations nationwide

[01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:14.570]
I'll meet the mornings from studios in Indianapolis

[01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:17.270]
Bob Kavoyan and Tom Griswold host a mix of

[01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:19.430]
Talking comedy from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern time

[01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:22.150]
Used to be great just like some other shows I can think of

[01:57:22.150 --> 01:57:22.890]
Like...

[01:57:22.890 --> 01:57:23.530]
They'll cut

[01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:24.870]
But then they got debauled

[01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:29.430]
You know, and Justin and Justin Tinkerbell and Janet Jackson took care of the whole industry

[01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:30.690]
Along with certain others

[01:57:32.530 --> 01:57:34.170]
So even though I don't hear them

[01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:35.830]
I just... everybody gives me spy reports

[01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:38.390]
The show is a shadow of what it used to be

[01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:39.330]
You know what I mean?

[01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:40.130]
Yep

[01:57:40.130 --> 01:57:43.830]
Highlights of the show where they're each not at midnight Eastern time on WG and America

[01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:47.070]
And at 11 p.m. on Indianapolis TV station WTTV

[01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:53.850]
WG and senior vice president Sean Compton says Kavoyan and Griswold produce one of the most entertaining shows on radio

[01:57:53.850 --> 01:57:54.670]
They sure did

[01:57:56.090 --> 01:57:59.590]
Kavoyan says he thinks viewers will enjoy a peak behind our radio curtain

[01:57:59.590 --> 01:58:02.350]
We got a whole bunch of their stuff in here all the most of it we can't play anymore

[01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:04.210]
Like head shampoo for example

[01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:05.010]
Oh yeah

[01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:06.270]
BASS and play that

[01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:07.290]
No no

[01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:10.410]
I mean nobody speaks English anymore

[01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:12.290]
They say I love his taboo

[01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:14.250]
Oh and prison bitch we do not be playing that

[01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:16.150]
Why not?

[01:58:16.530 --> 01:58:16.850]
I don't know

[01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:18.730]
I think it might be clean

[01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:23.070]
But it's four minutes long it'll take a while to audition it to make sure that it is

[01:58:23.790 --> 01:58:24.230]
Clean

[01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:24.630]
It's not

[01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:30.890]
I'm pretty sure that was one of those that this somebody arbitrarily said

[01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:32.570]
Oh you can't don't play prison bitch

[01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.870]
You know

[01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:35.010]
Arbitrary is right

[01:58:35.010 --> 01:58:35.630]
Yeah

[01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:37.730]
Like Bob Green came in and I would he

[01:58:37.730 --> 01:58:39.090]
Oh don't play trouser trout

[01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:41.110]
Remember that?

[01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:41.730]
Mm-hmm

[01:58:41.730 --> 01:58:45.990]
That was a steep, nickel thing by the way

[01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:47.070]
Was it really?

[01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:47.510]
Yep

[01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:48.590]
How do you know that?

[01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:50.290]
I have a good memory for these things

[01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:52.870]
Oh here's a good one

[01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:55.030]
So sorry if I missed this

[01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:56.890]
But how about Marvin Gaye for the pool

[01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:59.250]
Yeah he had a beautiful voice

[01:59:00.250 --> 01:59:00.810]
No

[01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.630]
Sure

[01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:05.470]
Would you sound a little bit unsure?

[01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:07.670]
I was thinking about it I was mulling it over you know

[01:59:07.670 --> 01:59:07.950]
Yeah

[01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:09.290]
Giving it a fair of thought

[01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:09.650]
Yeah

[01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:11.050]
And why not?

[01:59:11.170 --> 01:59:11.910]
Yeah stick him on there

[01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:13.250]
Freddie Mercury 13

[01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:15.150]
Karen Carpenter 10th Serob right men 9

[01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:16.330]
Roy Orbison 9

[01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:17.490]
Johnny Matrice 5

[01:59:17.490 --> 01:59:19.150]
Linda Rohnstead 5

[01:59:19.150 --> 01:59:20.230]
Jim Morrison 3

[01:59:20.230 --> 01:59:22.090]
John Anderson of Yes 3

[01:59:22.090 --> 01:59:23.170]
Jay Blackton

[01:59:23.170 --> 01:59:24.470]
Luis Miguel's only got 3

[01:59:26.610 --> 01:59:28.390]
Too many crackers out there man

[01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:30.110]
That's the problem too many freaking crackers

[01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:32.770]
Grab with it

[01:59:32.770 --> 01:59:33.870]
You don't have to give it a try

[01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:36.630]
4.560 QAM

[01:59:36.630 --> 01:59:38.270]
4th leader

[01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.970]
Neil God

[01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:47.710]
Your key 10 keys

[01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:51.210]
You can't say no

[01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:54.330]
It started when

[01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:57.970]
You were an embryo

[01:59:57.970 --> 02:00:02.690]
That night you strayed

[02:00:02.690 --> 02:00:05.890]
In the hotel room

[02:00:05.890 --> 02:00:09.030]
Was decided when

[02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:13.090]
You were in the womb

[02:00:13.090 --> 02:00:16.750]
The lander in

[02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:18.930]
Isn't your DNA

[02:00:20.090 --> 02:00:22.090]
Because I was cheating

[02:00:22.930 --> 02:00:26.530]
I want to make you play

[02:00:26.530 --> 02:00:30.350]
So don't walk his tail

[02:00:30.930 --> 02:00:34.190]
It's a scientific excuse

[02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:36.130]
It's cheating

[02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:40.930]
I want to make him lose

[02:00:41.530 --> 02:00:45.270]
It seems like him tastes

[02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:47.770]
That strange couples

[02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:52.170]
Yes straight men that's why Freddie Mercury is winning

[02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.490]
Yeah

[02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:57.030]
Is that what you said about Luis Miguel?

[02:00:57.630 --> 02:00:59.210]
What? No I didn't say that he was gay

[02:00:59.210 --> 02:00:59.870]
No

[02:00:59.870 --> 02:01:01.270]
I told him this was gay old women

[02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:04.750]
Old women and gay men like him

[02:01:07.710 --> 02:01:09.310]
I think is what I said

[02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:13.190]
Whereas Freddie Mercury has universal appeal

[02:01:17.290 --> 02:01:18.770]
I don't know who sent it

[02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:19.550]
Because it was just a number

[02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:21.370]
Typical

[02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:23.070]
How about none of the above

[02:01:23.070 --> 02:01:24.550]
Says some jackass

[02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:25.630]
None of the above

[02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:30.370]
As opposed to coming up with one himself or itself

[02:01:30.370 --> 02:01:32.530]
How about none of the above

[02:01:32.530 --> 02:01:36.790]
We always get those always somebody wants that

[02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:39.070]
Yeah, none of the above

[02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:41.970]
Somebody wants George Michael Pam from the facts

[02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:42.570]
No

[02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:45.710]
Voice is beautiful she says

[02:01:45.710 --> 02:01:48.150]
Well okay his ass is beautiful

[02:01:49.230 --> 02:01:50.650]
And lots of folks know it

[02:01:50.650 --> 02:01:52.330]
Gene and Steven says Aaron Neville

[02:01:52.330 --> 02:01:53.770]
Oh Gene

[02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:56.730]
You buying that?

[02:01:57.490 --> 02:01:58.270]
Why not

[02:01:58.270 --> 02:02:00.090]
I mean it's not going to be my brother

[02:02:00.090 --> 02:02:00.730]
I'm all on there

[02:02:00.730 --> 02:02:02.470]
Let's have your names on the list

[02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:03.710]
Just think how much time that will kill

[02:02:03.710 --> 02:02:05.350]
All the beautiful voices all the time

[02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:07.110]
I'll read the full twice it will be two o'clock

[02:02:07.110 --> 02:02:08.530]
Time for the big oh

[02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:11.050]
Here's one that says Ann Murray

[02:02:11.050 --> 02:02:12.470]
Now that is ridiculous

[02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:13.190]
Wow

[02:02:13.190 --> 02:02:14.370]
Man Murray

[02:02:14.370 --> 02:02:15.250]
That's the reach

[02:02:15.250 --> 02:02:17.850]
Talk about deep yeah

[02:02:17.850 --> 02:02:19.850]
And low mighty low

[02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:21.910]
Ann Murray

[02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:24.250]
Wow

[02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:25.550]
No, I don't think so

[02:02:27.150 --> 02:02:29.150]
Mark from Marty from point and B to

[02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:31.230]
Follows up on the first paragraph here

[02:02:31.230 --> 02:02:33.410]
With that joke about the bear in the rabbit in the woods

[02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:35.970]
It's older than you are Marty

[02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:38.390]
Oh stop with the jokes

[02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:41.710]
Marty says have been listed since 1981

[02:02:41.710 --> 02:02:43.810]
I had the pleasure of speaking with you in a few occasions

[02:02:43.810 --> 02:02:46.150]
You made a lasting impression on me from the beginning

[02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:47.910]
I can remember the places I spoke with you

[02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:49.350]
Michelle's video on Pine Island

[02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:50.290]
Pompato Harness track

[02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:52.430]
And my favorite your studio at WINZ

[02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:53.930]
When you were still doing eight to midnight

[02:02:54.610 --> 02:02:57.010]
My cousin Stanley J brought me to the studio

[02:02:57.010 --> 02:02:58.930]
And some isolated part of southern Broward County

[02:02:58.930 --> 02:03:01.490]
I can't remember if it was off flamingo or some other road

[02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:03.010]
Anyway, thanks for years of entertainment

[02:03:03.010 --> 02:03:05.170]
Some isolated part of Broward like Carroll City

[02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:09.010]
You know where I and Z used to be

[02:03:09.650 --> 02:03:11.010]
Which I'm sure they're not there anymore

[02:03:11.010 --> 02:03:13.670]
But out there in the middle of the like field

[02:03:14.610 --> 02:03:15.510]
Yeah, kind of

[02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.730]
Yeah

[02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:19.150]
And then of course the doesn't tower sitting in the back

[02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:22.030]
And when I would leave it night at midnight

[02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:23.070]
To go home

[02:03:23.730 --> 02:03:24.950]
When I was doing eight to midnight

[02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:27.210]
And I would drive about a half mile up the road

[02:03:27.210 --> 02:03:27.790]
And I couldn't hear it

[02:03:27.790 --> 02:03:28.670]
I could see all the towers

[02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:29.770]
I couldn't hear the station

[02:03:29.770 --> 02:03:30.850]
That's how directional we were

[02:03:32.370 --> 02:03:33.050]
Not good

[02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:36.010]
This has got to

[02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:37.390]

Tony the UPS man in Connecticut

[02:03:39.130 --> 02:03:41.610]
Just to show you what an ass this man is

[02:03:41.610 --> 02:03:43.010]
How about Janice Joplin

[02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:46.830]
And today is my eighth wedding anniversary

[02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:48.730]

[02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:51.650]

[02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.730]

[02:03:56.650 --> 02:03:59.110]
That's life man or some people who just don't get the message

[02:04:02.010 --> 02:04:02.430]
Yeah

[02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.810]
Yeah

[02:04:04.710 --> 02:04:05.610]
Here's what you want

[02:04:05.610 --> 02:04:07.390]
What? It's not about what you want

[02:04:08.810 --> 02:04:11.110]
No it's about them and posing them so that's right

[02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:11.630]
That's right

[02:04:11.630 --> 02:04:14.470]
Stay off of my ass Tony go away

[02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:15.230]

Johnny Ola says what about the voice

[02:04:22.890 --> 02:04:23.830]
Barbara Streisand

[02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:25.690]
Put her on there only she'll get a bunch of votes

[02:04:25.690 --> 02:04:26.890]
Yes you will

[02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.750]
People

Speaking of old women then she'll get all the old women votes

[02:04:31.570 --> 02:04:32.910]
All the old Jewish women votes

[02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:34.230]
On Rush your Shiny you can't

Now let me ask you can you go to the computer

[02:04:35.670 --> 02:04:36.910]
I guess not on your kipper

[02:04:36.910 --> 02:04:38.470]
Rush your Shiny it's okay

[02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.470]
Only it's for pleasure

[02:04:40.970 --> 02:04:43.790]
On Rush your Shiny it's only you only burn for a little while

[02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:46.210]
But if you go to the user computer on your kipper

[02:04:46.210 --> 02:04:47.670]
You're going to burn in hell for eternity

[02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:50.090]
Yeah here it is how about none of the above

[02:04:50.090 --> 02:04:52.270]
How about a good swift foot up your ass

You idiot how about none of the above

[02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:55.170]

So many negative people so many sour sour people

[02:05:02.010 --> 02:05:03.970]
The only thing I like sour is like pickles

[02:05:03.970 --> 02:05:06.950]
Good sour good sour good cold sour people

[02:05:07.970 --> 02:05:11.870]

I wouldn't say Robert plant's got a beautiful voice

[02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:53.270]
Good good voice but not beautiful

[02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:54.910]

He had his own TV show back in the 50s

[02:06:47.370 --> 02:06:51.270]

Steve Perry number two but as much as I hate country western bluegrass

[02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:37.810]

[02:07:41.190 --> 02:07:42.730]

[02:07:59.090 --> 02:08:00.290]
He doesn't know your email address

[02:08:00.290 --> 02:08:02.090]
He doesn't know your email address

[02:08:02.090 --> 02:08:03.370]
He doesn't know where I get this then

[02:08:04.370 --> 02:08:05.430]
Where did I get this?

[02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:09.430]

[02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:21.450]
Brad Paisley is he can't do waterpays with it

[02:08:21.450 --> 02:08:22.370]

Yeah, they kiss it

[02:08:40.810 --> 02:08:41.570]
It's all good

[02:08:43.230 --> 02:08:46.710]
Well it's a good thing we changed the poll because they sure didn't know nothing about sports gasses

[02:08:46.710 --> 02:08:48.590]
And they sure don't know too much about beautiful voices

[02:08:48.590 --> 02:08:50.510]
Here's one from Tracy says

[02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:53.070]
It's hard to separate a beautiful voice from a voice you like

[02:08:53.070 --> 02:08:53.690]
Good point

[02:08:53.690 --> 02:08:55.910]
I'd like to nominate James Taylor

[02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:56.470]
Oh

I apologize for yesterday's blender Eric Reed

[02:08:59.510 --> 02:09:00.470]

[02:09:12.150 --> 02:09:13.550]
You know who reminds me of

Shame kind of Schmidt

[02:09:18.590 --> 02:09:20.290]
You got to be careful when you talk like that

[02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:22.730]
Here's one from somebody

[02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:25.350]

[02:09:59.710 --> 02:10:03.810]

[02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:15.210]
Have you disagree on any of those?

[02:10:15.630 --> 02:10:19.710]
No, Dolly Parton's got a beautiful voice. She's got big noses but no

[02:10:19.710 --> 02:10:21.930]
And Patsy Klein

[02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:26.370]
I go out walking after midnight I'm just crazy

[02:10:26.370 --> 02:10:28.330]
Yeah, I don't think so

[02:10:28.330 --> 02:10:30.210]
And Celine Dion oh my god

[02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:31.930]
She ought to be banned

[02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:35.570]
And also can you how can you forget Shirley Bassy

[02:10:37.110 --> 02:10:39.650]
And gold's a stink finger remember that?

[02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:41.710]
Yep, gold stink finger

[02:10:43.130 --> 02:10:44.170]
Carolyn Picard

[02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:46.330]
Did we add Elvis yet or what?

[02:10:47.050 --> 02:10:48.730]
Yep, who's Carolyn Picard?

[02:10:48.930 --> 02:10:49.450]
Oh that's who's seven

[02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:51.530]
Sorry Carolyn

[02:10:53.090 --> 02:10:53.610]
Elvis

[02:10:54.290 --> 02:10:55.470]
You didn't put it on it?

[02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:56.210]
Oh it's on it?

[02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:57.010]
Stink finger

[02:10:59.230 --> 02:11:00.890]
From the movie of the same aroma

[02:11:03.130 --> 02:11:03.770]
Shirley Bassy

[02:11:04.670 --> 02:11:06.470]
That's when she weighed 280 pounds

[02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:10.210]
Oh yeah, that's beautiful. I'll think I

[02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:13.630]
No, she did not have a beautiful voice

[02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.810]
No, I mean that goes

[02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:16.410]
Let's put off a little bit on the wall. We're at it

[02:11:16.410 --> 02:11:19.870]
Andy Williams was originally on Sean's pool. I crossed it out

[02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:24.990]
Andy Williams had a soothing pleasant voice but not beautiful

[02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:28.310]
God, Paul Rogers from free

[02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:31.770]
And now little lady if you'll kindly step up to the parapet

[02:11:31.770 --> 02:11:33.950]
I'll come back to on these awesome voices somebody

[02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:34.510]
Paul Rogers

[02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:36.430]
We'll get three votes

[02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:39.550]
But it says awesome voice that's not the full question

[02:11:39.550 --> 02:11:40.990]
I can do better

[02:11:41.670 --> 02:11:42.570]
Who is that?

[02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:43.850]
I'm a woman, your favorite

[02:11:45.210 --> 02:11:47.430]
But she wasn't wailing like she usually does

[02:11:48.370 --> 02:11:50.590]
Anything you can do, I can do better

[02:11:51.230 --> 02:11:52.790]
She was always screaming and waving

[02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:55.930]
Oh, Paul Rogers has an awesome voice

[02:11:55.930 --> 02:11:56.630]
I'm a dream

[02:11:57.110 --> 02:11:57.990]
Oh, see what I mean?

[02:11:59.490 --> 02:12:00.350]
Okay, that's enough

[02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:00.890]
Yeah, I'll say

[02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:04.510]
Somebody out of the age of 300 members Ethel Merman except you, you're obsessed with Ethel Freaking Merman

[02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:05.150]
She's my favorite

[02:12:05.730 --> 02:12:09.930]
Would you play that Gordon Lightfoot spoof all the songs were like the record of the Emanuel Fitzgeralds

[02:12:09.930 --> 02:12:11.990]
There's Cliff and Kendall who's beyond chronic

[02:12:12.590 --> 02:12:14.150]
The poll question is

[02:12:14.150 --> 02:12:17.170]
Which singer has the most beautiful voice?

[02:12:17.170 --> 02:12:18.890]
Not awesome voice

[02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:20.350]
Not powerful voice

[02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:22.150]
Not great, I like it a lot of voice

[02:12:22.150 --> 02:12:23.830]
The most beautiful voice

[02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:26.870]
Which sounds really kind of gay if you ask me

[02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:27.110]
But

[02:12:29.210 --> 02:12:30.550]
Now, what does this mean?

[02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:32.530]
Can you believe I just went to

[02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:34.030]
BJK

[02:12:37.610 --> 02:12:38.850]
What does that mean?

[02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:39.490]
I don't know

[02:12:40.530 --> 02:12:42.090]
Oh, subject Burger King

[02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:44.070]
So, what does that mean?

[02:12:44.070 --> 02:12:45.070]
I don't know

[02:12:45.070 --> 02:12:46.690]
Can I believe it? Yeah, I believe it

[02:12:46.690 --> 02:12:47.450]
And I don't care

[02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:50.010]
Please add Marvin Gay to the poll

[02:12:50.010 --> 02:12:52.010]
Great voice rate lyrics is head and four lot of it

[02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:53.510]
Didn't we get Marvin on there?

[02:12:53.890 --> 02:12:54.650]
Mm-hmm

[02:12:54.650 --> 02:12:56.650]
We would have put Marvin on he was a little bit too gay

[02:12:56.650 --> 02:12:57.290]
Sam Cook

[02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:58.770]
Sam Cook's a good choice

[02:12:58.770 --> 02:12:59.670]
Just played him yesterday

[02:12:59.670 --> 02:13:00.110]
Sure

[02:13:00.110 --> 02:13:02.150]
Don't know much about history

[02:13:02.150 --> 02:13:03.390]
Barry Manlow

[02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:05.570]
Oh no, I'm sorry

[02:13:07.110 --> 02:13:09.430]
Barry Marcus is the name of the guy who sent Sam Cook

[02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:10.450]
Sorry, Barry

[02:13:12.690 --> 02:13:15.470]
Julie Andrews had the most beautiful voice for 60 years

[02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:17.730]
Just for this 9-year-old in 1965

[02:13:17.730 --> 02:13:20.930]
She certainly fulfilled the whole Madonna Horthand

[02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:22.810]
Says Joel and Four Myers

[02:13:22.810 --> 02:13:23.870]
What does that mean?

[02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:26.490]
You know the Madonna Horthand is

[02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:29.890]
That thing that men have were women or either one or the other

[02:13:29.890 --> 02:13:34.930]
They categorize women as either a Madonna or a whore

[02:13:34.930 --> 02:13:36.350]
Mm-hmm

[02:13:37.570 --> 02:13:38.830]
So she's both

[02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:39.930]
See that's one of those things

[02:13:39.930 --> 02:13:42.630]
When you have a really really innocent woman that goes all

[02:13:42.630 --> 02:13:43.490]
Hori and dirty

[02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.870]
That's hot

[02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:46.390]
That's an exciting thing to a lot of guys

[02:13:47.890 --> 02:13:48.770]
Julie Andrews

[02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:49.050]
Yeah

[02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:51.670]
Because she showed her boobs eventually

[02:13:51.670 --> 02:13:53.210]
This year really? She did

[02:13:53.210 --> 02:13:55.170]
I can't believe she had it a couple times

[02:13:55.170 --> 02:13:55.770]
The other one

[02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:57.730]
The best talent

[02:13:57.730 --> 02:13:59.050]
You're missing your Roger

[02:13:59.050 --> 02:14:01.470]
Sporting your 560 QAM

[02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:03.290]
The fourth leader

[02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:05.150]
The biggest name

[02:14:05.150 --> 02:14:06.710]
The best talent

[02:14:06.710 --> 02:14:12.390]
You're listening to sports Radio 560 WQAM

[02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:14.790]
Miami for the Latter-day

[02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:16.950]
It's the one to do our

[02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:25.890]
You

[02:14:25.890 --> 02:14:27.530]
I'm John McCain

[02:14:27.530 --> 02:14:31.570]
You may have heard that I invented the Blackberry

[02:14:31.570 --> 02:14:33.510]
Well my friends it's true

[02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:35.870]
And I'm going to tell you how I did it

[02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:39.290]
My tribe and I were camping in the hills of Kentucky

[02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:41.670]
But we didn't call it that back then

[02:14:41.670 --> 02:14:44.030]
Anyway, I was messing around

[02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:45.810]
And I crushed a blueberry

[02:14:45.810 --> 02:14:46.850]
With a poison

[02:14:46.850 --> 02:14:46.930]
And I was messing around

[02:14:46.930 --> 02:14:46.930]

[02:14:46.930 --> 02:14:46.930]

[02:14:46.930 --> 02:14:49.050]
And the next thing you know

[02:14:49.050 --> 02:14:50.470]
I got a Blackberry

[02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:53.190]
Oh what's that?

[02:14:53.410 --> 02:14:55.710]
It's coming from this little box

[02:14:55.710 --> 02:14:56.290]
Hello

[02:14:56.930 --> 02:14:59.070]
John, it's Sarah Paylon

[02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:00.030]
Sarah?

[02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:04.230]
How did you get it to this funny little box my friend?

[02:15:04.450 --> 02:15:06.450]
John, it's a blackberry

[02:15:06.450 --> 02:15:07.670]
It's a phone

[02:15:07.670 --> 02:15:10.510]
Oh, did I invent this?

[02:15:10.650 --> 02:15:11.790]
Not really

[02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:13.350]
But that's okay

[02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:15.550]
It's time for your nap

[02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:18.110]
Just let Sarah take care of this

[02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:21.730]
Just like I'll take care of everything when we're in the White House

[02:15:21.730 --> 02:15:22.110]
Hey?

[02:15:22.130 --> 02:15:23.190]
Okay, doke

[02:15:26.010 --> 02:15:27.850]
I'm Governor Sarah Paylon

[02:15:27.850 --> 02:15:29.750]
And I approved this message

[02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:33.810]
I'll approve anything that gets me in the White House with this

[02:15:33.810 --> 02:15:34.950]
Ancient Geaser

[02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:37.090]
How's it going, eh?

[02:15:37.630 --> 02:15:40.790]
102, she probably picked that up across the Canadian and the Laskin border

[02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:43.990]
I know, because she's aware that Russia is over there on the one side

[02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:46.230]
And Canada is over here on the other side

[02:15:46.230 --> 02:15:48.430]
She gets her binoculars pointed in the right direction

[02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.390]
Wow

[02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:55.470]
My late mother, this is from, I don't know who this is

[02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:59.130]
My late mother would sue in a period of homo and Linda Ronstadt before she passed

[02:15:59.530 --> 02:16:00.950]
Kristie Ali on the meat scale

[02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:02.290]
Well, what does that mean?

[02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:05.110]
Oh, I see before she passed Kristie Ali on the meat scale

[02:16:05.110 --> 02:16:05.790]
Linda Ronstadt

[02:16:06.230 --> 02:16:07.750]
She's on the pole by the way Linda

[02:16:09.170 --> 02:16:12.210]
But Otis Reading gets my vote, especially since he died a couple of days before

[02:16:12.210 --> 02:16:14.790]
Sitting on the dock hit the area, he never got to his own voice on the radio

[02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:17.650]
Oh, in other words, that's the barometer by which we're choosing now

[02:16:17.650 --> 02:16:19.070]
I think the poor question ought to be

[02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:20.590]
Name somebody who sang a song

[02:16:20.590 --> 02:16:24.410]
That's always the case, remember? Like the sportscaster thing you were talking about

[02:16:24.410 --> 02:16:26.970]
Give us a name and something to name once was on a list

[02:16:26.970 --> 02:16:30.330]
Stay saying even in the shower of what's right on the pole

[02:16:30.330 --> 02:16:34.030]
How about me? I sometimes sing in the shower and since they want to kiss my fat pimple, yes

[02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:37.090]
Oh, how about you, Neil, when did you end baseball?

[02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:39.470]
I sing every morning before the show I should rotate

[02:16:39.470 --> 02:16:42.930]
You know something it leaves me weak, it leaves me just limp

[02:16:42.930 --> 02:16:45.970]
Sitting in the morning, so...

[02:16:45.970 --> 02:16:48.290]
I mean, that's not a beautiful voice, it's a good voice

[02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:50.450]
Right, nice voice distinct voice, nice character

[02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:51.030]
Not beautiful

[02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.870]
Nora Jones

[02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:55.710]
Somebody says

[02:16:57.530 --> 02:16:57.970]
Okay

[02:16:57.970 --> 02:16:58.570]
No

[02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:02.130]
Not for me, but if they want that out there, sure

[02:17:02.130 --> 02:17:05.510]
Would you, well, if they want to send other words, anything they send in here, you're gonna say sure?

[02:17:05.890 --> 02:17:07.530]
I will, yeah, sure, I'll say yes, sure

[02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:10.130]
Y'all sure, oh, y'all

[02:17:11.550 --> 02:17:13.290]
That was up to an 65 point

[02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:16.790]
You tell me if Nora deserves to be on the list, all right?

[02:17:17.250 --> 02:17:17.530]
What?

[02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:22.130]
You tell me if Nora deserves to be on the list, does that?

[02:17:23.050 --> 02:17:23.690]
Sounds right

[02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:26.510]
No, no

[02:17:26.930 --> 02:17:28.490]
Hope you didn't put it on there, Frantzo

[02:17:29.370 --> 02:17:30.010]
You know?

[02:17:30.010 --> 02:17:30.450]
You didn't put it on there?

[02:17:30.730 --> 02:17:31.550]
Nope, good

[02:17:32.370 --> 02:17:36.930]
Now is that your vote that you didn't want to put it on or just, you had a premonition?

[02:17:37.330 --> 02:17:39.490]
It was still kind of up in the air, so I waited

[02:17:40.010 --> 02:17:40.470]
No, good

[02:17:41.270 --> 02:17:43.770]
Allison Kraus is probably most recently recognized as Wolf

[02:17:43.770 --> 02:17:46.190]
for doing the duet album CD with Robert Plants

[02:17:48.610 --> 02:17:49.650]
I ain't got that

[02:17:50.050 --> 02:17:50.870]
You ain't got what?

[02:17:51.470 --> 02:17:53.690]
I ain't got the duet album with Robert Wright and Allison

[02:17:55.010 --> 02:17:55.590]
You're what?

[02:17:55.590 --> 02:17:59.790]
Lisa says Raul Mallow, former lead singer of the Mavers, has made some great solo records

[02:17:59.790 --> 02:18:02.050]
His voice is amazing, says Lisa

[02:18:02.050 --> 02:18:04.090]
Do you know who that is? Raul Mallow?

[02:18:04.290 --> 02:18:04.830]
Never heard of him

[02:18:04.830 --> 02:18:07.010]
I hear he's really Mue Mallow

[02:18:07.010 --> 02:18:08.390]
I like his brother Mui

[02:18:09.710 --> 02:18:10.450]
Mune Mallow

[02:18:11.610 --> 02:18:12.410]
Mune Mallow

[02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:15.810]
Mune Unic? Why do you like Marshmallows? Well, I haven't had those in a long time

[02:18:15.810 --> 02:18:16.030]
Good

[02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:20.610]
Roasted on the campfire, some Marshmallows and Wienies

[02:18:20.610 --> 02:18:21.050]
Mmm

[02:18:22.390 --> 02:18:25.610]
And Marshmallows got to be like a little burnt on the outside and like a real

[02:18:26.130 --> 02:18:27.170]
Mushi on the inside

[02:18:28.270 --> 02:18:29.750]
Louis nominates Charlotte

[02:18:30.570 --> 02:18:32.050]
Charlotte Church Opera

[02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:34.810]
You know who that is? She's an opera-checking

[02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:36.190]
Charlotte Church Big cans

[02:18:37.410 --> 02:18:38.210]
She's a great singer

[02:18:38.210 --> 02:18:40.330]
She's got a beautiful voice

[02:18:40.330 --> 02:18:41.870]
And Allison, everything

[02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:42.970]
She got a beautiful ass

[02:18:43.670 --> 02:18:45.330]
She's got beautiful boobies too

[02:18:45.330 --> 02:18:48.450]
Oh, it was Victor Victoria by the way, somebody emailed in

[02:18:49.310 --> 02:18:51.570]
Julie Andrews showed her boobies in Victor Victoria

[02:18:51.570 --> 02:18:53.710]
Okay, she had Mallow, I don't think so

[02:18:54.130 --> 02:18:55.250]
What? I don't think so

[02:18:55.250 --> 02:18:56.310]
Well, that's what the guy said

[02:18:56.310 --> 02:18:57.090]
He's a baby movie, he's wrong

[02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:58.210]
Oh

[02:19:00.350 --> 02:19:02.330]
So what, where did she show her boobies?

[02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:04.190]
Oh, what was it in that movie?

[02:19:05.390 --> 02:19:06.610]
No, I got to look it up

[02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:07.890]
Did he go to the train?

[02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:10.710]
Yeah, that's it

[02:19:12.670 --> 02:19:14.130]
The devil in Miss Pailin

[02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:16.250]
I got to go on IMDb

[02:19:16.250 --> 02:19:18.070]
Somebody says, Pa Mcartney

[02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:20.830]
This is Paulian Titusville, O'Polly won't see him no more

[02:19:23.390 --> 02:19:25.630]
And Annie Lennox, somebody says

[02:19:25.630 --> 02:19:27.850]
I'm a big fan, but I don't think she's got a beautiful voice

[02:19:27.850 --> 02:19:29.090]
Not a beautiful voice now

[02:19:29.090 --> 02:19:32.350]
It's like Janice Chaplin, not a beautiful voice

[02:19:33.770 --> 02:19:35.870]
And just so you know, Freddie Mercury

[02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:37.730]
It was from Zanzibar, not Pakistan

[02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:40.830]
Oh, Steve says, still according to summits all the same

[02:19:40.830 --> 02:19:41.510]
Sure

[02:19:42.210 --> 02:19:44.470]
And it does make a difference because he's still dead

[02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:46.430]
Got it?

[02:19:46.610 --> 02:19:47.690]
Got it

[02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:50.370]
Oh, somebody else said, this must have printed out twice

[02:19:50.370 --> 02:19:51.770]
Maybe I printed some of these out twice?

[02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:54.750]
Yes, I did

[02:19:55.390 --> 02:19:56.650]
Norah Jones, the answer is

[02:19:56.650 --> 02:19:57.730]
No, no, no chance

[02:19:58.810 --> 02:20:00.450]
Well, I get an a million names in here

[02:20:00.450 --> 02:20:01.650]
That's really a sitillating

[02:20:01.650 --> 02:20:03.610]
It's captivating radio, I'll tell you that

[02:20:03.610 --> 02:20:05.770]
And for the guy that before was giving me a song at dance

[02:20:05.770 --> 02:20:08.470]
That Jason guy, oh, change the F and pole

[02:20:08.470 --> 02:20:09.930]
I like the other pole better

[02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:12.650]
Because this is just a bunch of names

[02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:13.870]
I mean, the sports casters

[02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:16.110]
There was something that you know, a secure teethen knew

[02:20:16.570 --> 02:20:18.170]
There was some meat on the bone

[02:20:18.170 --> 02:20:20.870]
S-O-B of every single American

[02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:21.710]
S-O-B-1

[02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:23.950]
That's where Julie under the shutter boobies

[02:20:23.950 --> 02:20:25.570]
And also there was a lesbian movie she made

[02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:28.390]
But now is the moment for us to come together

[02:20:28.390 --> 02:20:29.690]
And put the fire out

[02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:32.270]
I mean, think about it

[02:20:33.130 --> 02:20:33.970]
Think about it

[02:20:33.970 --> 02:20:35.850]
If your neighbor's house is burning

[02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:40.630]
You're not going to spend a whole lot of time saying, well, that guy was always irresponsible

[02:20:41.290 --> 02:20:42.990]
He always left the stove on

[02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:45.230]
He always was smoking in bed

[02:20:46.350 --> 02:20:48.110]
All those things made me true

[02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:53.150]
But his house could end up affecting your house

[02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:56.450]
And that's the situation we're in right now

[02:20:57.310 --> 02:20:59.930]
We've got to make sure that we put the fire out

[02:20:59.930 --> 02:21:05.830]
And then we'll start making sure that these folks stop leaving the stove on

[02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:08.890]
Okay, now you're supposed to play Burn Baby Burn or

[02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:13.410]
Disco in Furnow or Burning Love by Elvis

[02:21:14.470 --> 02:21:15.450]
Wouldn't that be a great segue?

[02:21:16.450 --> 02:21:18.490]
Right? I'll be like, I'll choose this one for now

[02:21:18.490 --> 02:21:20.070]
And that really just was just a joke

[02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:21.010]
It was just a little joke

[02:21:21.010 --> 02:21:22.390]
Your neighbor's house is on fire

[02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:27.230]
Oh, yeah

[02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:31.910]
Okay, now I'm going to tell you something about old, old material

[02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:33.530]
When you hear this, you're going to just

[02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:35.090]
You're going to give up, okay?

[02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:36.430]
You're going to gasp

[02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:39.810]
From Biscayne, David Cooperman

[02:21:40.830 --> 02:21:43.030]
From Biscayne Electric, okay, now we're nervous

[02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:44.550]
I don't read people's last names on here

[02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:48.370]
But I will hear it because David should be punished for sending this

[02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:49.930]
And Miami Gardens no less

[02:21:50.690 --> 02:21:53.990]
Hey Neil, if Karen Carpenter read, Mama Cass is sandwiched

[02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:55.010]
They both still be laughing

[02:21:55.010 --> 02:21:57.610]
Oh, that is older than the Hill

[02:21:57.610 --> 02:21:59.090]
Old and Abelinkin's beard

[02:21:59.090 --> 02:22:00.570]
Older than the printing press

[02:22:00.570 --> 02:22:02.070]
Older than Mathuis Luz Ass

[02:22:05.230 --> 02:22:07.810]
Oh, somebody says it was SOB but you being in the punch

[02:22:07.810 --> 02:22:10.030]
Yes, now did you get that email also?

[02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:11.950]
No, no, just remember that

[02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:12.850]
I've heard it from my suggestion

[02:22:13.430 --> 02:22:15.830]
Here's a good suggestion for the poll, Syruvon

[02:22:16.850 --> 02:22:19.750]
It's one of my favorite all-time songs on Mercury Records

[02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:21.610]
Broken Heart Emility by Syruvon

[02:22:21.610 --> 02:22:23.450]
You got it? Broken Heart Emility

[02:22:23.450 --> 02:22:25.310]
You got it? Look at the movie

[02:22:25.310 --> 02:22:27.190]
Oh, it's good, she was great

[02:22:28.450 --> 02:22:28.890]
Syruvon

[02:22:30.730 --> 02:22:32.370]
Doors are weirdin' from the cranberries

[02:22:33.130 --> 02:22:34.650]
Big fan, I don't think so, though

[02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:36.610]
Not a beautiful voice

[02:22:36.610 --> 02:22:38.730]
Oh, I can't believe you got it

[02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:41.750]
Wow, if I don't have it, I'll get it

[02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:42.370]
How's that better?

[02:22:42.490 --> 02:22:43.630]
You're still alive

[02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:45.190]
Woo!

[02:22:46.050 --> 02:22:49.010]
Oh, I can never know the truth

[02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:50.270]
Oh, rock

[02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:56.270]
Won't you have some of you?

[02:22:58.310 --> 02:22:59.790]
It's not the only thing I've heard

[02:22:59.790 --> 02:23:03.190]
Okay, that's enough, we don't want to get carried away because you know, it's old

[02:23:05.610 --> 02:23:06.330]
What is that?

[02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:07.110]
Horse, Syruvon

[02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:08.590]
Really? Yeah

[02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:12.050]
You get the name this tune? I have no idea

[02:23:13.090 --> 02:23:14.250]
Never heard it

[02:23:14.250 --> 02:23:16.770]
So much on

[02:23:16.770 --> 02:23:18.630]
Really, I never heard it or sing a tune

[02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:20.690]
And the living is queasy

[02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:23.130]
Never living is easy

[02:23:23.130 --> 02:23:25.910]
Oh my gosh, she sounds so manly there

[02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:28.730]
Now, why did you have to play that in the sportlet?

[02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:30.790]
You racist bastard

[02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:32.230]
Oh, I roll, that's the racist

[02:23:32.770 --> 02:23:34.170]
The first black

[02:23:34.170 --> 02:23:35.250]
Is he a Roger?

[02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:37.690]
I never did

[02:23:37.690 --> 02:23:39.490]
The sports leader

[02:23:39.490 --> 02:23:41.650]
The sports leader

[02:23:41.650 --> 02:23:43.270]
Who's gonna give Ricky a blow?

[02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:45.630]
The investment bank filed for bankruptcy

[02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:48.910]
A shocking ending to a weekend of frantic negotiations

[02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:51.570]
This time the Fed said, you're on your roll

[02:23:51.570 --> 02:23:53.410]
I was freaking with our workers

[02:23:53.410 --> 02:23:55.930]
What happened to roll the bank?

[02:23:56.450 --> 02:23:58.930]
Customers are worried about the safety of their deposit

[02:23:58.930 --> 02:23:59.970]
It's my money

[02:23:59.970 --> 02:24:01.930]
It's in the one and Fed

[02:24:01.930 --> 02:24:03.870]
Close my door, oh and K

[02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:05.590]
It's a sad day in America

[02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:07.790]
It's reminiscent of the Depression

[02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:10.590]
The odds market tells us there were people

[02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:11.910]
We've all fed we were

[02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:13.170]
You're fired

[02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:15.690]
Well, this has been fired

[02:24:15.690 --> 02:24:17.710]
It's another great depression

[02:24:17.710 --> 02:24:20.070]
And the wind out doesn't even care

[02:24:20.590 --> 02:24:22.790]
And I like to fish

[02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:25.770]
They pay 2000 euro wait

[02:24:25.770 --> 02:24:28.370]
But he tell me, can you spare a dime

[02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:31.490]
Not so fast partner, you owe me some money

[02:24:31.490 --> 02:24:36.850]
So tonight we're going to borrow like it's 19, 20 times

[02:24:36.850 --> 02:24:39.030]
What do you recommend, it's a beard depression

[02:24:40.090 --> 02:24:42.570]
Not to steal the money, not to borrow the money

[02:24:42.570 --> 02:24:44.810]
Not to steal the money in California

[02:24:45.530 --> 02:24:47.710]
You know the fact that he is a governor of California

[02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:49.530]
Didn't I tell you that a long time ago?

[02:24:50.470 --> 02:24:51.070]
You did

[02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:53.230]
Next to the Toyota right there and then and there

[02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:54.070]
That we're all finished

[02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:55.650]
That's the end of the world

[02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:58.590]
California, he can't even say it

[02:24:59.310 --> 02:25:01.170]
He can't even pronounce it

[02:25:02.990 --> 02:25:04.110]
He's a goofball

[02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:05.710]
He's the terminator

[02:25:05.710 --> 02:25:06.850]
He's a silly person

[02:25:06.850 --> 02:25:08.950]
But then again so was Ronnie Raygun

[02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:13.330]
From soap net somebody forwards me

[02:25:13.330 --> 02:25:14.490]
This breathless news

[02:25:14.490 --> 02:25:15.750]
Galen Gearing, Luis

[02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:18.430]
And Eric Marzov, Ethan, formerly of passions

[02:25:18.430 --> 02:25:20.270]
Have been picked up by day of our lives

[02:25:20.270 --> 02:25:21.550]
There will to be appearing shortly

[02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:22.810]
Not exciting?

[02:25:23.310 --> 02:25:23.790]
Yep

[02:25:23.790 --> 02:25:25.450]
When the passions is done

[02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:28.710]
It's finished

[02:25:29.570 --> 02:25:30.050]
Finito

[02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:32.110]
158 votes on our

[02:25:32.610 --> 02:25:34.650]
Which singer has got the most beautiful voice pool?

[02:25:36.270 --> 02:25:39.070]
Karen Carpenter 23 and Freddie Mercury 22

[02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:40.930]
Ever seen him together? Same person

[02:25:43.370 --> 02:25:44.350]
Karen Carpenter 21

[02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:46.050]
We got a good battle going on our hands there

[02:25:46.050 --> 02:25:47.150]
You know what?

[02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:49.850]
Knack and knack knows to knows

[02:25:51.050 --> 02:25:53.950]
Well I would love to see them do a like a duet album

[02:25:55.310 --> 02:25:56.410]
Like Frank Snottra

[02:25:56.410 --> 02:25:58.310]
Remember Frank Snottra? What about Frank Snottra?

[02:25:58.470 --> 02:25:58.830]
There you go

[02:25:58.830 --> 02:26:02.070]
I mean I hated him and I still do but beautiful voice

[02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:04.630]
Strangers and then I

[02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.950]
Huh?

[02:26:05.730 --> 02:26:06.190]
Yep

[02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:08.230]
I think you believe it

[02:26:08.230 --> 02:26:11.030]
I ain't no band leader, yeah I heard that story

[02:26:11.730 --> 02:26:15.310]
Roy Orbison 13, Sarah Brightman 11, Linda Ronstead 10

[02:26:15.310 --> 02:26:17.890]
She's great, Johnny Mattress 9, the African Queen

[02:26:17.890 --> 02:26:21.870]
Luis Miguel 7, he should have 100 votes Luis Miguel

[02:26:21.870 --> 02:26:25.150]
He has got the most, his voice is like a symphony orchestra

[02:26:27.170 --> 02:26:27.550]
Beautiful

[02:26:29.250 --> 02:26:31.230]
Jim Morrison 6, Gladys 9, 6

[02:26:31.230 --> 02:26:33.050]
You don't have any Luis Miguel in your mouth?

[02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:35.310]
I just might have a lot

[02:26:35.310 --> 02:26:36.490]
Well really?

[02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:40.750]
Or nearly because all my Luis Miguel stuff is down there in the room where you're sitting now

[02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:42.970]
You're holding on to it

[02:26:44.570 --> 02:26:46.230]
Gladys 9, I have everything

[02:26:46.650 --> 02:26:47.150]
Do you?

[02:26:47.230 --> 02:26:49.050]
But he ever recorded, they miss you any song

[02:26:49.050 --> 02:26:50.550]
They miss you, swania

[02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:54.550]
Don't have it, do you?

[02:26:55.310 --> 02:26:57.990]
Ah, dude I got a giant recording list over here

[02:26:57.990 --> 02:27:01.130]
This is a good example of what we're talking about beautiful voice

[02:27:01.970 --> 02:27:03.270]
Like butter, smell

[02:27:18.450 --> 02:27:19.270]
Oh my god

[02:27:45.290 --> 02:27:48.770]
Luis Miguel 7, he's just dynamite, fantastical

[02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:52.330]
Jim Morrison 6, he ought to also be doing better

[02:27:52.330 --> 02:27:54.330]
When you agree, Jim Morrison, I do agree
