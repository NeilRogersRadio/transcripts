[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]
The music expressed on the music was the most beautiful

[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.300]
and the most beautiful in that too.

[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.260]
And do not reflect those of the Beasy Broadcast group.

[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.720]
It's staffed, advertisers, and many.

[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.580]
Happy Boxing Day.

[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.160]
The biggest names.

[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.540]
The best quality of shopping.

[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.980]
You're listening to Boxing Day.

[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.720]
It's Radio 560.

[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.280]
It's WQAM.

[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.460]
I am A.

[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.680]
Stopping with it.

[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.260]
Sluttering and shopping.

[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.140]
Boxing Day.

[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.760]
The big 70.

[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.620]
Are you having it?

[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.920]
And it's probably the most beautiful.

[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.240]
Monk?

[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.600]
Oh.

[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.320]
560.

[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.140]
WQAM presents the Neil Rodgers Show.

[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.340]
Declang to Neil.

[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.340]
Darryl 560.

[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.620]
560 in day and row.

[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.100]
In other counties, cold toll free.

[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.800]
87775.

[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.480]
Neil.

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.120]
Or pound 560 on your AT&T.

[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360]
And Verizon Wireless Funds.

[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.840]
The appellans expressed by Neil.

[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.460]
His guests or his colleagues.

[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.480]
Do not represent those of WQAM management.

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.920]
No.

[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.840]
Responses.

[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.660]
Now the Neil Rodgers Show.

[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.220]
On 560 WQAM.

[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.380]
It's Friday, you first, dude.

[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.020]
Hey, where you going?

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.840]
Come here.

[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.940]
Oh, man.

[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.880]
Don't you ever take a bath.

[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.280]
What?

[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.920]
Where you going?

[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.360]
Where you going?

[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.720]
Where you going?

[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.720]

[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.720]

[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.760]
He's a walking roller-sau.

[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.920]
Hey, check it out.

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.540]
I can blow bubble out of my nose.

[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.740]
I have a foxes that produce her dough.

[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.500]
I hate doing it, but I know it.

[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.880]
His hair ears are losing their joy.

[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.920]
His name is like pets.

[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.540]
And in fact, that's where we'll make you.

[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.140]
You think this is just for funny.

[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.600]
Turn around by dance.

[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.360]
Now without my shoes getting fixed.

[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.680]
But everyone's disgusted and scared.

[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.420]
Walks through hallway sideways.

[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.900]
And he's covered with gorilla hair.

[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.720]
Mama says he's okay.

[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.980]
He's a genius.

[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.880]
A young man has beaten him along.

[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.040]
We're not too sure what's going on there.

[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.600]
Stay away from me.

[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.400]
Josh Reid knows.

[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.920]
I feel things seems money, but he's now standing.

[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.320]
I'm funny, isn't he?

[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.080]
Don't come near me.

[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.640]
Josh Reid knows.

[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.160]
He looks like he's the skis that I'm selling.

[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.840]
And he's selling the pound.

[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.020]
He's dead.

[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.040]
Got so bad his guns exploded.

[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.400]
Stewing wretched by all over the world.

[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.560]
There's staples up and down his.

[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.720]
Just to hold in all that greasy old food.

[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.400]
Stay away from me.

[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.040]
Josh Reid knows.

[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.460]
He thinks I care if Chris Moore don't like me.

[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.780]
I think he does.

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.320]
Don't come near me.

[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.380]
Josh Reid knows.

[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.240]
Come here, come here.

[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.240]
Don't like me.

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.820]
Don't like you wrote a news.

[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.720]
There's a thing when someone calls you an asshole.

[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.480]
Oh, what?

[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.840]
I got the last two letters of that.

[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.080]
That's good.

[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.900]
He said, ass.

[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.080]
Where?

[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.120]
Yeah.

[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.020]
It was all right.

[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.680]
So the reason I played that is because we got some big radio news right after Christmas, baby.

[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.820]
Hope everybody had a wonderful Christmas and Santa dropped all the good crap down to your chimney.

[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.860]
Of course most people don't have a chimney, but especially in Florida.

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.720]
You got a chimney?

[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.800]
Nope.

[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.860]
No need to do why.

[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.440]
Well, Santa bounces up on your roof and he looks around.

[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.000]
No chimney moves on to the next house.

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.920]
You're screwed.

[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.980]
Boy, Barry Jackass is just all over the place.

[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.360]
Good thing I got him this morning.

[00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.160]
Nobody else on there.

[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.300]
And of course it's boxing day.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.700]
Canada, England, most of Europe.

[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.060]
Not in the USA.

[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.680]
That's because nobody's got money left to buy anything anyhow.

[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.540]
The coming of Christmas day left radio with one less major market smooth jazz outlet.

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.140]
Major market smooth jazz.

[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.220]
Oh, good.

[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.660]
God.

[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.000]
As clear channels WLV love 94, Miami.

[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.300]
Returns from all holiday programming at 10 a.m. with a new format.

[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.720]
rhythmic AC.

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.600]
Like we reported to you the other day.

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.840]
Member?

[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.460]
Somebody else?

[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.840]
I mean that.

[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.760]
And it was correct.

[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.420]
They kind of slipped up on it.

[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.340]
Okay, the word got out on their website.

[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.000]
93.9 FM MIA.

[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.840]
Move to the music.

[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.380]
Move to the music.

[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.020]
Oh, yeah.

[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.520]
The station's launching commercial free with core artists, the BGs.

[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.560]
Madonna, Prince Justin Tinkerbell and Jennifer Lopez.

[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.560]
Oh, when I hear Justin Tinkerbell on my radio, you know what I think?

[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.540]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.800]
Immediately if not sooner.

[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.940]
You know you love him.

[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.920]
I can't stand that creep.

[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.700]
If you can sing and dance to it, probably play it.

[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.560]
It's a tea channel.

[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.720]
Miami president, market manager, Brian Olson.

[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.820]
I wonder if he's kidding.

[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.440]
Jimmy Olson.

[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.000]
You're fairy.

[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.140]
There's a tremendous passion across South Florida for this format.

[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.260]
How about let's hear it out.

[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.140]
There's a tremendous passion.

[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.120]
They just put it on the air this morning.

[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.240]
It's going on now, I guess.

[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.760]
Two and over to 93.9.

[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.640]
Let us know if you like it.

[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.580]
That's our not a pull question, but just our general question.

[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.340]
I like it.

[00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.560]
Yeah.

[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.860]
We are thrilled to bring this exciting and upbeat programming to listeners.

[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.960]
WLV East former smooth jazz programming will soon be available on 93.9.

[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.440]
HD2 subchannel Olson said which nobody can pick up because nobody's got that kind of a receiver, but nevertheless.

[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.740]
In the past year, major market flips away from smooth jazz have included Lincoln financials move of KJCD Denver to sports.

[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:54.180]
MSN's flip of WQCD, New York to AAA as WRXP and Citadel's decision to move WJZW Washington to all these.

[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.040]
Let's play oldies.

[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.040]
What do you say in all year?

[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.060]
No, thank you.

[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.500]
Well, it's your last regular day on the show in my last day till the new year.

[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.700]
Well, I'm on next week too.

[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.340]
Oh, that's right.

[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.880]
Last day hanging out with you.

[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.160]
Last day with me.

[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.840]
Well, until the next time until Georgia's on vacation or what?

[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.040]
No.

[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.020]
Mm-hmm.

[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.060]
I would assume.

[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.860]
But you never know around here.

[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.980]
You never know.

[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.180]
We don't know what's going on.

[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.020]
And I'm quite frankly the way this business is going.

[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.280]
I told you a long time ago, I'm the one who gave you the honest advice about what to do with your radio.

[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.960]
Take it and flush it down the toilet.

[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.220]
That's what you should do with your radio.

[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.500]
Everybody, take your radio and either that or get a ball-peen hammer and smash it to little bits.

[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.000]
Because the people are running these stations.

[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.920]
I understand we're in any pressure and everybody's got to make big cutbacks and all this other crap.

[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.360]
But my God, put something on here somebody we want to listen to.

[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.660]
Jesus, God.

[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.320]
And very also sends me this crap from his column today around the dial.

[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.300]
790, the ticket continued tinkering with its lineup.

[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.280]
This is just you talk about capitulation throwing in the towel, naming Josh Friedman.

[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.620]
As host on the 7 to 10 p.m. program of nights without Panthers or Marlins games.

[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.340]
Friedman will host a Marlins intensive baseball show from 7 to 9 p.m.

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.080]
Once Dolphin season is over and a general talk show from 9 to 10 p.m.

[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.780]
Oh, good.

[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.360]
God, Josh Friedman.

[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.280]
Everybody's worst nightmare.

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.500]
Jonathan Zazlow, who had been hosting in the 7 to 10 p.m.

[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.860]
slot, is moving 10 a.m. to noon to replace Kevin Rogers who was fired Monday.

[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.500]
And there's a line in here.

[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.460]
You talk about Barry having his head up their ass.

[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.220]
They got this incestuous relationship between the herald and the ticket ticket ticket.

[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.660]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.080]
We'll get to it.

[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.960]
The ticket dropped at the local dosa Migos late night talks to her featuring Larry Million and Alan Strauss.

[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.500]
And we'll replace it with Tony Bruno's and actually syndicated program from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. beginning Monday.

[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.440]
Here's the line.

[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.760]
Okay.

[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.900]
It's a move that will save the station money in a tough economy.

[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.860]
Oh, talk about having your head way up Howard Davis's ass.

[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.200]
Barry, my God.

[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.540]
Is that pathetic?

[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.420]
If we make cutbacks or oh well, but if we put a move, but about me, but it's a move that will save the money.

[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.000]
In other words, they're looking to cut cost is what it is.

[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.180]
Just like everybody else's.

[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.740]
The ticket dropped me, Leon, but we've gained Strauss for weekend and fill in work.

[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.940]
What kind of a name is Alan Strauss for a dosa Migos show? What does that mean?

[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.580]
Put out.

[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.720]
You know, I'm saying you think he would be his family.

[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.400]
Something Alan Strauss don't sound like no, uh, Julio to me.

[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.400]
But anyway, that's uh, Barry's news today.

[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.040]
Oh, wow.

[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.020]
Got a couple of dead people before we get into yesterday's pool.

[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.000]
Also, how about some aspiring ports on the great job?

[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.260]
Jesse Agluda yesterday and what's his name?

[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.300]
Spector.

[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.520]
Phil Spector.

[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.940]
That's actually what uh, George put on his birthday envelope or Christmas envelope gift.

[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.160]
What?

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.600]
Phil Spector.

[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.400]
Yeah.

[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.480]
He couldn't, I guess he probably couldn't remember the Brian parts.

[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.460]
We just called them Phil Spector.

[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.900]
Or maybe he was trying to be funny.

[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.040]
Did that ever dawn on you?

[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.720]
Well, that too, but you know, I think it went over the head of Spector when I gave it to him.

[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.180]
So well, from what you're telling me anything would go over his head quite possibly.

[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.360]
After all the nasty things you said about him.

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.120]
Really?

[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:10.980]
Yeah.

[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.860]
What do you ever do to you?

[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.500]
You trashed him unmercifully before.

[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.240]
Oh, totally.

[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.480]
You did.

[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.360]
Uh-huh.

[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.520]
You said he's a lung kid.

[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.600]
And you say that Jesse Agluda, what do you say?

[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.980]
That he hasn't got a clue what's going on.

[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.100]
Something like that.

[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.020]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:27.980]
So what's wrong with that?

[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:28.940]
Riff him an ass, man.

[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.340]
If he deserves it, rip him an ass.

[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.720]
This isn't like a pansy radio, even with me here.

[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.040]
This is like not one.

[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.620]
By the way, I got to go to a pretty neat Christmas party.

[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.640]
Wednesday night with Paco and the whole family and friends and a whole bunch of people.

[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.000]
Better than you thought it was going to be.

[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.420]
Yeah, it was good food.

[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.340]
And we had a pretty good time.

[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.960]
And guess what?

[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920]
I walk in the door of this friend's house.

[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.180]
And they've got all the food.

[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.420]
What a spread enough food to feed a Chinese army.

[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.620]
And the music is playing.

[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.400]
Guess who was singing?

[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.680]
Well, you wouldn't know because you don't care.

[00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.300]
Luis Miguel.

[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.720]
Did you start swooning?

[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.780]
No, but I know who it was.

[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.980]
And they were very impressed because the guy, the host of the party,

[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.460]
he claims to be Luis Miguel's number one fan.

[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.940]
And I said, oh, that's Luis Miguel.

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.400]
And Paco said, oh, my God.

[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.620]
Anyway, man, he did.

[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.200]
That's what he said.

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.000]
And I said, absolutely.

[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.980]
Okay, which dead person you want first, the civic,

[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.540]
giant and dead county, Alva Chappen or Eartha Kit?

[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.540]
Let's go with Eartha.

[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.300]
Oh, come on.

[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.120]
Eartha to Eartha Kit.

[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.020]
She was strange.

[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.640]
Really?

[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.140]
She dies in anyone little out there when I was on the keyboard.

[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:37.580]
Oh, I guess today.

[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.620]
I'm trying to think of who she once been on the lip.

[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.540]
She bit somebody famous on the lip.

[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.020]
She was being treated for colon cancer and died in New York.

[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.280]
Her daughter, Kit Shapiro, was, that also doesn't sound like a black name.

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:51.840]
Shapiro.

[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.420]
Her daughter, her recording of Sauncey Christmas Song, Santa Baby

[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.900]
was certified gold last week.

[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.460]
Oh, thank God, before she croaked.

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.640]
She made a name for herself as Catwoman in the Batman TV series.

[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.440]
Remember Catwoman?

[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.320]
No, you don't.

[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.700]
Absolutely.

[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.320]
Singer when actress Eartha Kit is died, her publicist Patty Freeman told CNN yesterday.

[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.220]
On Christmas Day, no less.

[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.140]
Oh, boy.

[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.340]
What a bitch.

[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.680]
Her daughter, Kit Shapiro, was by her side.

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.320]
She was performing almost until the end, taping a PBS special six week ago, weeks ago, in Chicago,

[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.800]
the show was set to wear in February.

[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.660]
She's well known for her distinctive voice and made a name for herself in her portrayal

[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.940]
of Catwoman in the TV series, Batman, the role-produced Kit's recognisably Salt-Tweet Cat-Growl.

[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.080]
We don't have the growl.

[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.940]
I think the closest thing we got to a growl would be...

[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:40.920]
Like that.

[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:42.800]
Orlando.

[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.160]
You don't remember him.

[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.000]
That's before your time.

[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.020]
That's at Iodino less.

[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.180]
Yeah, not at all.

[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.400]
I remember him.

[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.100]
Hmm.

[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.020]
But nevertheless, he disappeared.

[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.300]
Like a lot of other people in there.

[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.440]
What's that gone?

[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.280]
They're gone, you know?

[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.760]
They don't keep in touch.

[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.880]
They don't communicate with you.

[00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.860]
Even though we've got that great email thing, NeilAtNearRodges.com.

[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.760]
So anybody out there can drop us a note and say, hey, how you doing?

[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.600]
It's been a long time in Balean, screw you, and whatever.

[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.220]
Yeah, it was something.

[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:07.900]
No.

[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.400]
No.

[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.840]
Alva Chapman, Jr., Third Generation newspaper, newspaper man,

[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.560]
and former Harold President and CEO in a real far-bison,

[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.880]
won a South Florida's most influential corporate and civic leader, says the Harold,

[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.660]
whose business acumen and quiet passion upmold, not just the Harold, but modern Miami, has died in 87.

[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.480]
He was part of the non-group.

[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.460]
He was one of the movers and shakers.

[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.220]
He was shaking it.

[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.840]
Chapman spent a traditional family Christmas eve at his coconut grove home reading the Bible with his wife Betty,

[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.460]
their two daughters and several grandchildren, then succumbed to pneumonia on Christmas Day.

[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.760]
He was reading the Bible with his wife and kids.

[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.620]
He was afflicted with Parkinson's disease, suffered strokes in recent years, and broke a hip in March.

[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.360]
He brought his family to Miami in 1960.

[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.140]
He evolved into a devoted energetic champion of his adopted hometown, Miami,

[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.740]
and became the unifying force behind scores and civic endeavors from housing to the homeless,

[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.480]
disgusting downtown Miami's contemporary appearance to leading.

[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.060]
We will rebuild after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.

[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.780]
Long before his death, Chapman had become a civic legend, exceeded perhaps only by pioneer Henry Flagler,

[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.380]
another corporate titan whose leadership surpassed that of any elected official.

[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.520]
But a beat, but a boop, but a boop.

[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.620]
Chapman was the person president and poppers turned to what something needed to be done in South Florida.

[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.160]
Now, he's dead.

[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440]
The biggest name.

[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.880]
The number you're going to get, no projects.

[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.180]
Fortress of your five sixty QAM.

[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.020]
The fourth leader.

[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.180]
No portion of this program may be reproduced without the express written permission of WQAM.

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.620]
The very apt titan can't be taken, take a pill.

[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.080]
It's Friday, you were, Steve.

[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.360]
Oh, what's the problem officer?

[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.520]
Deploy from the vehicle.

[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.980]
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.180]
If you're caught driving without a seatbelt, you will be removed from your car and shot.

[00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.640]
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2.

[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.700]
The new laws in effect now, so click it or be shot.

[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.800]
Officers don't like doing this. They are only following orders.

[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.820]
It's for your own protection in the never-ending fight against terrorism.

[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.160]
Terrorist acts such as mouth noise.

[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.340]
Perpping and fighting.

[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:24.340]
But being knowing you others, so under Patriot Act 2, eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants.

[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.240]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot.

[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.580]
It's the law.

[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:39.080]
We like saying that the law, the law, the law, the law.

[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.440]
It's the law.

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.400]
It'd be the law at 10, 18, at 5, 60, WQAAM.

[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.100]
It's Friday, Boxing Day.

[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.900]
I don't know what else to call it, day after Chris Mouse.

[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.280]
We got the big O-Dolphin Camp at 2.

[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.980]
He is really rock solid.

[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.680]
I think he killed us now last trend, by the way.

[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.460]
I could be wrong with.

[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.980]
Linda and Kennell at Boat Campers from 4 to 7.

[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.740]
Boy, we got some swill on or what?

[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.440]
Dolphin the night 7 to wait and then Greg don't like us from 8 to 10.

[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.280]
Now is he also belong around here or not?

[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.100]
Yeah, he's a pretty good one.

[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.660]
He's a good one.

[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.480]
He's a good one.

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.480]

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.480]

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.480]

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.480]

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.480]

[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.900]
He's a good one.

[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:15.900]

[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.260]
He's a good one.

[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:16.380]
He's a good one.

[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:16.400]
He's a good one.

[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.240]
He's a good one.

[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:17.580]
He's a good one.

[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.200]
He's a good one.

[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]
He's a good one.

[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.060]
Now we're making movies about the crucifixion.

[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.120]
People in the theaters are bound to act.

[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.160]
It was okay but wasn't as good as mad Max.

[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.040]
Jesus Christ, movie star, Rex Rear and the pope

That was the wrong number.

[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.480]
You can't take calls all four hours.

[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.620]
I could take calls for 30 hours if we had them.

[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:05.920]
Right?

[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.020]

Mark Hein, whose subject, please put on a good one today.

[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.240]
And he starts out by saying, well, I haven't tuned into the show.

[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.600]
He hasn't even listened to anybody.

[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.520]
So I don't know if it's a good one or not.

[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.740]
However, I like to say something.

[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.280]
Is it a good one? I think it's okay.

[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.540]
It's not great. It's not going to win any awards.

[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.460]
It's okay. The call's stuck and the emails like this one are really.

[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.760]
The emailers are not complaining.

[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.380]
It's human nature to point out the flaws and something until it achieves perfection.

[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.000]
I got news for you, Mark.

[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.780]
You're not perfect neither of mine, either as a show ever going to be idiot.

[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.020]
I suppose you don't believe in this. No, I don't. Nothing is perfect.

[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.680]
Especially radio shows, especially for Beasley Broadcasting.

[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.460]
If we didn't notice any kind of flaws, can you imagine how bad off we'd be?

[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.500]
So please next time a listener complains about something you should say,

[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.020]
thank you for having them take the time to critique your show.

[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.460]
Now we're not doing critiques and complaints and instructions, Mark.

[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.900]
This was deleted, but I just couldn't resist.

[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.740]
Remember, Neil, we only want a great show. Was that too much to ask?

[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:21.140]
Is that too much to ask? Like an emotional cripple, like an overgrown child, Mark.

[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:23.640]
God.

[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.120]
Is that too much to ask? What do you think of that?

[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.480]
What's your take? Huh? Just kind of sad.

[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.520]
Sad isn't the word for it. This guy, he's not even listening.

[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.700]
I don't know if it's a good show or not. It's a radio show. That's all it is.

[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.280]
What the hell do you think this is? Like some great painting? Like a sculpture?

[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.900]
Oh, let's critique it. Oh, look at that. He's got armpit here, that chick.

[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:52.680]
You know, what are you talking about? This is somebody obviously who's got a real obsession, just obsession.

[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.900]
Here's one for the poll, which how could we have not put this on?

[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:03.260]
Or, oh, Jay says Fernando. Thanks for an endo. Oh, Jay. Got it.

[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.720]
Adding it now. Good. Oh, he'll go zooming up there.

[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.400]
He'll pass John McCame like he's laid out flat and he ought to be.

[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.540]
WQYM. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, I just want to wish you a happy holiday.

[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:22.520]
Happy New Year. And to Ken Maldon. Just like we love him out here and he got screwed over.

[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.520]
Yeah. So have a nice day. And back to you. Thank you.

[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.380]
Yeah, right at holidays time, how do you like that?

[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.820]
A whole bunch of people getting screwed and fired and all kinds of businesses.

[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.040]
Not just in radio and TV and the print journalism. Everybody's getting canned now just in taffy holidays.

[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.020]
Happy holidays. Have a great one. And by the way, your fire did it.

[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.780]
Two hundred and fifty six votes on the poll. What's our goal today?

[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:50.940]
Oh, 600. 600. Yeah, why not? You're a crazy person. Okay, 550.

[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.980]
Whatever you say, Lee's got an option for the poll.

[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:02.300]
Yeah, the American people. Why is that? We got rid of Bush. We voted him out.

[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.960]
We got Obama in there. Why the American people? Come on, flea. Quit being so damn negative.

[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.980]
You work for a really positive guy, Jolly Joe Bell, Clarence Joyce.

[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:15.180]
You work for a real positive organization. Get with it, flea. What's he doing there today?

[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.560]
He's actually working. Well, what's he doing there working today on this day?

[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.720]
I wouldn't take too many other people. The office isn't close today. Why not?

[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.900]
I don't know. You got to ask Joe Bell. Is Joe Bell there today? I haven't seen him. Yeah.

[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.160]
Asked Flea. Is Jolly Joe there today?

[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:38.220]
He hasn't answered. He's not here. What do you mean he's not there?

[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.500]
He came in to tell us the thing and he walked out.

[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.500]
Too negative. Quit being negative the day after Christmas day. Wait till the new year to start the negativity again.

[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.220]
Let's pretend we're all. Here is one that says Neil. I was on Lincoln Road last night.

[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.620]
It was packed at certain points. I was worried I'd be crushed by all the people there.

[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.760]
Lincoln Road has got some very good restaurants, but also some bad overpriced places.

[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.920]
But even the worst headlines yesterday, this whole bad economy thing is a myth.

[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.100]
Although I did hear you can go bowling down the Vegas strip. Yeah, that Vegas is off-sourish, man.

[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.800]
See, I don't understand that. There were a lot. There were hundreds of people there.

[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.740]
And why did this guy send that twice? Was it that important? Yes. Send them only once.

[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.720]
Okay. There's my complaint. Send them once. He's in North Carolina.

[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.360]
Good place for him.

[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:26.340]
Without a question of it out, the biggest loser in 2008 says this emailer was Plexico Burris,

[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.080]
who both literally and figuratively shot himself in the foot.

[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.680]
A real royal screw up and a big time loser if there ever was one.

[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.780]
Police these weapons from Burris's home. Here's that story as if we haven't already seen this.

[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.900]
From a couple days ago, would you see it? I think so.

[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.780]
Police have seized weapons and ammunition from the New Jersey home of Johns receiver.

[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.260]
Plexiglass Burris, who was charged with illegal weapons possession after accidentally shooting himself

[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.780]
while at Manhattan nightclub last month. He's got a real problem. He's got a gun problem.

[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:59.140]
But then again, most people are obsessed with guns. They got a problem all right. It's called life.

[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.080]
This guy with the Lincoln road thing. He sent it twice. Why? Because it was that important.

[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.940]
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, everybody's supposed to be out of work and nobody's got any money in the...

[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.600]
In fact, I got the retail sales plummet right here in my little pile.

[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.440]
I made a little pile for today. Just in case I wanted to do like a real show and I just mail it in.

[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.080]
I don't know. That email from Mark Hein, though, leaves me. I'm just not sure.

[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.680]
Oh, yeah, everybody wants to create no critiques. Okay. If you like it, find a price is right. Here's the show.

[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.840]
I'll do it the way I want to do it. I've been doing it for a hundred years. Okay.

[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.300]
What time is your show on, Mr. Hein? Huh? You jackass. You fool.

[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.640]
Retail sales plummet. Price-lashing failed to rescue a bleak holiday season for beleaguered retailers

[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.460]
as sales plunged across most categories on shrinking consumer spending.

[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.500]
According to new data released yesterday.

[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.560]
Despite a flurry of last minute choppers lured by deep discounts,

[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.460]
total retail sales excluding automobiles fell over the year earlier,

[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.000]
period by five and a half percent in November, eight percent in December through Christmas Eve.

[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:09.060]
When gasoline sales are excluded, the fall and overall retail sales is more modest.

[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.460]
The two and a half percent drop in November, a four percent decline in December,

[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.380]
a forty percent drop in gas prices over the year earlier period contributed to the sharp decline in total sales.

[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:25.000]
But, Mary Delk, director in the retail practice at consulting firm of Deloitte Tushia LLP,

[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.000]
says this will go down as one of the worst holiday seasons on record.

[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.460]
Retailers went from ho ho to a ho to a ho to a ho no.

[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:35.940]
Isn't that clever? They went from ho ho to a ho to a ho to a ho no.

[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.320]
Very clever. That's really creative, man. Crazy bitch.

[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.680]
WQAM, hello.

[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.560]
On your plane. I said, yeah, go away. Go to hell. Drop dead.

[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.280]
Do us a favor of the New Year and die. Okay.

[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.040]
Take some poison pills. Take some arsenic without the old lace.

[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.560]
Take a handful of stuff.

[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.600]
QAM, hello.

[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.660]
Okay. That's it. I bet you don't dare take calls the whole four hours.

[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.260]
I doubled area to you. Well, where are they?

[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.320]
Where are they?

[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.620]
Remember that song by Roberta Flack and Donnie Hathaway? Where is the love?

[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.000]
No.

[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.060]
Where is the love? 94 and where are the calls? I don't see any.

[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.140]
Do you see any calls on that board?

[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.840]
Not anymore. If I got them, I'm taking them.

[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.340]
If not, back to the rack.

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.880]
Day after Christmas in this guy, oh, we want a great show every day.

[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.740]
We want a great show. Well, you do it.

[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.360]
You do it, Michael.

[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.700]
And it's funny part of it is these people who send those kind of email.

[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.900]
They couldn't do two minutes.

[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.980]
They couldn't talk for two minutes in case you haven't noticed the calls.

[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.160]
Any other chance you can do a pull on what was Voka Brian's best bit of 2008?

[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.300]
Of course, the list would have to be composed by him himself.

[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.280]
Nobody can remember all of them. I don't know.

[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.680]
Do you want to do that?

[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.000]
Not really.

[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:45.520]
No.

[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.940]
I mean, we've done polls on what's his best bit of all time, you know.

[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.160]
But his best bit of 2008?

[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.220]
Come on, people.

[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.860]
Oh, here's one also that I got more instructions.

[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.040]
Why not just pray, Santa?

[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.140]
At least if you're bad hill only with hold of toy.

[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.360]
God will murder in torture you. Praise be to Santa.

[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.160]
Ah, adaboy, Don.

[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.220]
Pretty humorous.

[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.700]
Listen to a tremendous chuckle from me.

[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:14.440]
Not.

[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.520]
And then here's one of the, here's one from Marx.

[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.840]
Great investment advice.

[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.940]
It's just a silly silly stuff.

[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.140]
W.C.Y.M. Hello.

[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.100]
Any other go?

[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:26.740]
Okay.

[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.460]
She's got back from a crew.

[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:30.680]
Yeah.

[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.640]
In Mexico, don't ever go to Mexico.

[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.640]
I'm never going.

[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:35.580]
Don't ever go.

[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.740]
It was like South Florida, but poorer and more dirty.

[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:41.600]
It was terrible.

[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.980]
And filled with Mexicans.

[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.020]
And filled with Mexicans.

[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.520]
She'd be here though.

[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.180]
So that was good.

[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.260]
Great show.

[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.140]
Have a good day.

[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:49.740]
Love you.

[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:50.280]
I'm back to you.

[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.580]
See. Don't go to Mexico.

[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.420]
He said, I'm not going.

[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.000]
I already had the Christmas with the whole bunch of Mexicans.

[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.140]
So what's the problem with that?

[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:57.800]
I need to go there.

[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:58.600]
Right?

[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.920]
How about the Q.A.M. Hello?

[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:02.060]

[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:02.820]
Yes?

[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.680]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.260]
Okay.

[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:05.900]
How are you?

[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.040]
Oh, good.

[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:08.020]
How was your Christmas?

[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.740]
Just wonderful for an old, you atheist.

[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:11.380]
It was great.

[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.020]
Oh, did you get to spend the dreidel?

[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:17.580]
Neil?

[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.020]
Well, when did they let you out?

[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.480]
What day did they leave you out?

[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.620]
They let me out a long time ago.

[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.780]
Well, they're looking at it.

[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.860]
They're sticking your ass back in as what they ought to do.

[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.020]
WQ.A.M. Hello?

[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.220]
Sir, this is a radio show.

[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.400]
Oh, not him.

[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.120]
Not Mario.

[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.180]
Not crazy, Mario.

[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.560]
Sir, sir.

[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.100]
One thing about him, though, it's always that the tip off is right

[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.100]
the first word always.

[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.260]
So you can get it rid of or get out of the way real fast.

[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.400]
Sir, this is supposed to be a radio show.

[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.680]
Sir, there's a hurricane coming.

[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.080]
Sir, sir, sir.

[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.760]
I know the unmentionable one, sir.

[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.520]
Here's a prediction from one of our e-mailers with the increasing drop-off and ad revenues,

[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.800]
the already oversaturated sports talk market will implode with most finding employment

[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.460]
and lawn maintenance or prison guards.

[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.020]
Manders will retire to the keys, thus giving our ears a rest.

[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.560]
Jimmy Superfluous will start doing books on tape for insomniacs.

[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.040]
Neil will remove the Windsor and take over a CKLW management and also management of Hazel Park.

[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.360]
George will continue to broadcast messages of hope and resistance from a hidden herb farm.

[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:22.860]
Hmm.

[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:23.820]
What do you think?

[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.400]
I think it really stinks.

[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.140]
The biggest name.

[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.280]
The best talent.

[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.560]
He's the Neil Rogers.

[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.920]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.720]
The fourth leader.

[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.640]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.120]
That was up 39 points.

[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:39.500]
Hallelujah.

[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.420]
This is your brain.

[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:41.920]
And a serious trust bank.

[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.400]
Any questions?

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.320]
She's the president.

[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.020]
She'll candidate.

[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.720]
Dog kids go crazy for.

[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.080]
Tickle me Hillary.

[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.360]
Yes, tickle me Hillary.

[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.760]
Just rubber belly and watch her go.

[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.620]
I want to have a conversation.

[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.160]
That's cool.

[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.860]
I'll make sure every American has affordable quality health care.

[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.000]
You and your kids will have hours of fun with tickle me Hillary.

[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.240]
I'm not a lesbian.

[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:15.820]
Yeah, right.

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.200]
That's a great answer.

[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.400]
Wanna trade?

[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.440]
Mommy, I'm not sure I like Hillary.

[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.480]
That's right.

[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.060]
You'll need their love or hate.

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.060]
Tickle me Hillary.

[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.020]
Coming soon to a primary near you.

[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.940]
1101 at 560 WQM.

[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.260]
Happy holidays to you.

[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.440]
With no more Merry Christmas and happy Hanukkah.

[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.760]
Although Hanukkah ain't over yet.

[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.060]
Is it?

[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.000]
No.

[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.020]
I think it goes for come with this.

[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.440]
Hanukkah started last weekend.

[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.720]
So it's obviously it's eight days.

[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.500]
So it's going to be over yet.

[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.240]
You better get with your juice stuff, Mr.

[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.200]
Let me tell you right now.

[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:49.860]
I'm sorry.

[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.320]
You sure don't know your Jew crap and the Lord is going to.

[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.200]
He's going to smoke.

[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.320]
Smite, smite you.

[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.280]
369 votes on the poll.

[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.140]
Who is the biggest loser of 2008?

[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.240]
John McCain 103.

[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.720]
Bernie made off $50 billion Ponzi scamer 70.

[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.780]
The almost perfect season Patriots 38.

[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.500]
Wall Street investment banks 30 and also.

[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.460]
For the big three auto companies.

[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.100]
Hillary Clinton 25 governor.

[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.600]
Black oil of it's 22 Jason Jackson jerks 12.

[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.000]
Joe fineberg nine last season's Miami heat.

[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.220]
8 Tom Brady first the Super Bowl.

[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.340]
Then the 08 season eight.

[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.120]
He's still doing okay.

[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.780]
I think you think he's doing all right.

[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:28.520]
Sure.

[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.100]
He's still getting lots of money and lots of ass and lots of.

[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.100]
Whatever tension.

[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.760]
Oh, J Simpson six.

[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.480]
He's a late addition.

[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.360]
He's zooming up.

[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.020]
He's creeping up.

[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.380]
He's creepy big brown tonight.

[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:41.960]
The crippled triple crown six.

[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.000]
I keep saying cripple crown.

[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.020]
I think that's Freudian.

[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:44.340]
Don't you?

[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:45.700]
The Freudian slip.

[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.160]
Something really fishy with that horse.

[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.160]
In fact, all the great news is for you horse race lovers.

[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.720]
Was there any in this audience?

[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.360]
Except that neurotic Dan from Maryland.

[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.500]
Oh, speaking of him.

[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:58.880]
Not Nick Nolte.

[00:45:59.080 --> 00:45:59.600]
Dan Nolte.

[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.460]
Listen, that.

[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.060]
And here's golden doc a in the black cap coming.

[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.840]
Smoky on the grandstand side.

[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:11.580]
So over the weekend, I get an invitation to join him on Yahoo.

[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:17.600]
He wants to be an email partner on your same crazy person who is allegedly in the Philippines with the love of his life.

[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:17.800]
Yeah.

[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:22.460]
But it's down to lovely island golden doc a run of 16 to go.

[00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:25.460]
Golden doc a very new down in the engine.

[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.540]
Golden doc a son of golden doc a is one of the last version of lovely island.

[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.240]
Very game.

[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.520]
So I was going to say it's great that because there was no racing yesterday and none yet so far today.

[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:42.140]
So the racing network that I got here, HP I they've been showing the best harness and thoroughbred races of the last year.

[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.420]
I mean, you talk about dying and going to heaven.

[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.300]
You're just hanging out watching the whole day, weren't you?

[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.360]
No, not all day.

[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.020]
I told you I was at woodbind for a part of the day and I want to came home.

[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.020]
I did watch a lot of that.

[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.100]
I love it.

[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.480]
Anyway, let's see a Tom Brady.

[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.400]
I said he's getting laid.

[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.600]
OJ a six big brown six in the Tampa Bay raised to that shouldn't be on there.

[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.720]
That's his jealousy just like all the Patriots stuff just jealousy.

[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.580]
All you sports fans.

[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.440]
Oh, you guys suck you guys.

[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.360]
Yeah.

[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.700]
We'll see what happens on Sunday, won't we?

[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.300]
In fact, where's the emails telling me that I should root for the dolphins? Wait till you hear this.

[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.840]
Neil, this should be a good reason for you to root for the dolphins this week.

[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:26.840]
No, it will not happen.

[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:37.260]
Word is when he's in the sale of majority interest to Steven Ross, he's in the will keep 5% should be finalized December 30th if the dolphins miss the playoffs and after the playoffs otherwise.

[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:45.680]
Waiting until January would cost he's in the $20 million and more additional taxes, but he must accept that timetable if Miami makes the playoffs unless both men change the contract.

[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.960]
And he's made the way for you to do that.

[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.000]
According to this, I don't care what the, you know, he's not going to miss any meals.

[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:51.640]
Okay.

[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:58.380]
I'm not worried about his finances. Okay. I'm worried about my finances. I'm worried about fat Chris's finances, which there aren't any.

[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:00.840]
You can't have any finances when you don't have any money.

[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:02.900]
Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.020]
I said I said crank line.

[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.640]
He's back. He's back to line 9 again.

[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.060]
Now, what would be the point in that?

[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.500]
What was the point? You're asking what's the point with him?

[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.000]
No, that's true. Good point.

[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.740]
That's the point.

[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.780]
No, I'm not rooting for him. In fact, I hope the jets win like about 97 to three would be good.

[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.200]
That wouldn't be high enough, but you know, let's give realistic like that game in Jacksonville.

[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.160]
Where the hell did that game get played?

[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:28.980]
Jacksonville.

[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.520]
It wasn't Jacksonville, but they lost 73 to 60, whatever.

[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:32.860]
62 to 70.

[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:33.880]
62 to 70.

[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.400]
I thought it was 148 to 7.

[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.340]
That would make me happy.

[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:43.740]
Even though I hate the jets like poison and their fans and the whole ambiance and Brett Farb, I despise them.

[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.380]
But I hope they win 600 to 3.

[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.220]
See, I'm giving you the 3.

[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.100]
Like a chip shot field goal, you know.

[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.340]
That's it. You still kind.

[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.840]
Well, I'm not going to pretend they make believe.

[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.020]
They turned me off, man. They made me sour with that organization.

[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.540]
They're like a bunch of good stoppo up there in the press box.

[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.440]
For you, that's like garbage.

[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.260]
And then of course, the fans when I spend all that money to go to all those games for years and man.

[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.540]
What a bunch of goofballs.

[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:12.380]
Oh, come on.

[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.020]
It's a new regime.

[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.680]
Get back on the new regime.

[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:15.580]
My ass.

[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.520]
Same bunch of winers and losers.

[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.300]
Oh, gee, what a big turn around.

[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:20.800]
Yeah, okay.

[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.840]
We'll see. We'll see when they start playing some real teams.

[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.440]
What happens?

[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.860]
Who's the last real team they played?

[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.480]
Our almost real team was the Patriots.

[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:31.120]
And what was the final score of that second Patriots game? 175 to nothing?

[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.580]
Are we forgetting the first Patriots game?

[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:33.700]
Or were we just wiping that out of the game?

[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.060]
The second Patriots game.

[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.160]
That's ancient history of the first Patriots game.

[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:36.440]
Okay.

[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.920]
We're talking the most recent, recent history.

[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.840]
Because you didn't hear the part that I said when's the last almost real team they played.

[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.920]
And they got walloped.

[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:45.920]
They got wampth.

[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.140]
And then Jimmy with that great call.

[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.600]
Oh, it's another touchdown for the Patriots.

[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.920]
That was that was almost as bad as the one you played the other day.

[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.060]
The one you played about number 19.

[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.140]
How can that be?

[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.320]
How is it possible that this exists?

[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.220]
You know what I mean?

[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.060]
What do you mean?

[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.740]
It's it's like it's like having a really nasty ball movement and asking yourself,

[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.560]
how is it possible that this is part of my life?

[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.080]
And the same thing with that call that he made.

[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.340]
How can he be doing those games?

[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.360]
How is this possible?

[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.740]
Who is he servicing to be to be on those games?

[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.720]
That's what I would like to know.

[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.640]
Don't you wonder that?

[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.300]
I've never wondered that.

[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:24.400]
Well, aren't you going to start wondering it now?

[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.000]
No, because I don't want to know.

[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.980]
You're going to spend the whole between now and new years wondering,

[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.880]
who is Jimmy Syphilitic servicing to get that job?

[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:32.600]
Definitely not.

[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.460]
You'll be thinking about it 24-7.

[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.700]
Round the clock.

[00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.680]
Rhymes with sock.

[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.560]
Adam Kirschner, the fake Adam, I'm sure.

[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.500]
I don't know if it I don't know anymore.

[00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.320]
Are you going to tune to 92.9 on Friday here, Jimmy Syphilis and Stereo?

[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:49.780]
Well, guess what?

[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.440]
Adam's surprise.

[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.600]
It's not Jimmy Syphilis.

[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.420]
We headed on Wednesday.

[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.120]
We had the story.

[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.540]
It's a new music format.

[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.440]
Another piece of crap.

[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.340]
Same old garbage.

[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.400]
It's more really going to 790.

[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:00.160]
Don't look like it.

[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.860]
And then the fake Adam says he's not really bad if he'd loosen up a little bit.

[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.040]
But when he first came to town, he took himself too seriously.

[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.200]
When he first came to town, what about when he left?

[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:12.440]
He made for an uncomfortable tension on the air in the games with Mandage.

[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.040]
I would still vote for him to take over for Jimmy on the dolphin games.

[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.000]
Yeah, I agree with that.

[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:17.940]
And I said that the other day.

[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:18.860]
Toot toot toot toot.

[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.040]
Lowest 4,000 times the sports guy.

[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.340]
Because he's a broadcaster.

[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.880]
Maybe not the best, but at least he's a brand once upon a time was damn good.

[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.040]
When he was doing those Monday night games for Westwood one,

[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.300]
he was one of my favorites.

[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:32.620]
He was good before I knew him and what an A-hole he is.

[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.980]
And then this goes on.

[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:39.840]
It says from what I've heard all that the Bubba loves bunch does is have Hulk Hogan on every five minutes.

[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.280]
And when he isn't talking about Hogan, he's talking crap about Todd Schmidt,

[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.040]
the Yahoo's in Tampa seemed to love him.

[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]
Well, happy holidays, Adam.

[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.400]
Real or imaginary.

[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.360]
Whoever you are.

[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.080]
See, that's the thing with the emails.

[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.580]
You don't know who you're talking to.

[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.600]
And the emails in the calls.

[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.440]
We've discussed this off there.

[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.440]
It's pretty much the same people.

[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.740]
And I don't want to sound like an old crabby cynic at the age of 66.

[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:06.640]
But I will tell you this, what I've discovered is I've gone through life is that most people are morons.

[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.540]
Even a lot of the nice ones are dumb.

[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:11.640]
You know what I mean?

[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:12.540]
Mm-hmm.

[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:15.120]
Being a moron doesn't necessarily make you a bad person.

[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.080]
It just makes you dumb.

[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.680]
Now, would you agree with me that there are a lot more dumb people than there are like smart, like Frado?

[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.820]
More dumb than smart.

[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.020]
Nowadays, yes.

[00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:24.800]
As opposed to when?

[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.200]
Well, I mean, I don't know what it was like when you were my age,

[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:32.060]
but it seems like as I'm getting older, the people are getting dumber.

[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:33.660]
Yeah.

[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:34.800]
Like when I was a kid.

[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:35.600]
It was the dumbing of America.

[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:38.700]
Yeah, when I was a kid, you know, you had more smart calls.

[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:39.720]
Look at the emails.

[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.120]
Listen to, I'm your friend.

[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.400]
Listen to what we get on the phone.

[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.260]
That's a reflection.

[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:45.820]
It's like a mirror of what's out there.

[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.000]
It's not just one or two goofballs.

[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.000]
It's a mirror of what's going on on the outside.

[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:50.900]
These people are loose.

[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:52.960]
Q-A-M. Hello.

[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:53.960]
And it's real.

[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:54.800]
See what I mean?

[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:55.660]
Q-A-M. Hello.

[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.640]
Q-A-M. Hello.

[00:52:59.640 --> 00:52:59.640]

[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.000]
How are you doing today?

[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.100]
Okay. How are you doing?

[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:02.940]
Wonderful.

[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:03.960]
Here, I have a question.

[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:04.920]
They're all joking aside.

[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.320]
Whatever happened to Dave Gamer?

[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.720]
What do you mean, all joking aside?

[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.420]
What does that mean?

[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.300]
I don't want to start a prank.

[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.800]
How would I know what happened to Dave Gamer?

[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.340]
I have no idea.

[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.720]
Okay. Thank you.

[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.760]
Maybe he exploded.

[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:18.820]
Okay.

[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.180]
You're welcome.

[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.200]
Wow.

[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:24.780]
There you go.

[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.640]
Isn't that something you're going to do?

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:25.640]

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:25.640]

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:25.640]

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:25.640]

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:25.640]

[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:25.640]

[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.020]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:32.200]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:32.200]

[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:32.200]

[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:32.220]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:32.220]

[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:32.220]

[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:32.240]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:32.340]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:32.340]

[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:32.340]

[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:32.640]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:32.640]

[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.020]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:33.900]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.000]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:34.200]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:35.000]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:36.840]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.040]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:39.480]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.080]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.080]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.200]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:44.740]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:45.720]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.360]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.800]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.520]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:56.540]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:56.720]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:56.720]

[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:56.800]
I'm not sure.

[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.220]
Oh, this is just a pro-sec run fan.

[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.320]
I would have read the last sentence.

[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:01.660]
Oh, love 94.

[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.220]
What is this?

[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.560]
Oh, dear listeners to love 94.

[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.640]
This is from the team channel.

[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.280]
Thank you for your loyalty and support of love 94.

[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.900]
We were very proud in the last 18 years.

[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.740]
And the way we've served our listeners, our advertisers,

[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.680]
and South Florida.

[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.120]
Like all good things, this version of 93.9 is coming to an end.

[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.680]
However, we hope you'll give the new 93.9 a try.

[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.900]
You may find you like the new station as much as you did the format of the former Law 94.

[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:29.120]
If you're still on the list of the many great artists we've featured on Love 94 over the

[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:34.560]
years, we'll be launching the station in the new digital world of HD radio, which nobody

[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.020]
has.

[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.180]
We will have more information on when and how you can listen to Love 94 in digital in the

[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:39.540]
coming weeks.

[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.740]
So, please check back after the holidays until then.

[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.440]
Thank you for your support and we'll be back in HD soon.

[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.500]
Love 94.

[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.380]
Not even a name.

[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:52.600]
Love 94, like the station is anthropomorphic and all that it's a living and breathing thing.

[00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:00.780]
And now somebody sends me from the Sun Centrel, the article about the station changes formats.

[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:01.600]
Like, I don't know this.

[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.800]
And here are the comments.

[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.620]
Somebody says I've been listening to Love 94 for years.

[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:08.160]
It's a huge disappointment for the past few weeks.

[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.060]
They've been playing Christmas songs which brings me back to the days of my childhood.

[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.040]
This afternoon I turned on the radio so my family and I can enjoy the relaxing sounds of

[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:15.580]
the holiday season.

[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:20.700]
Instead, I heard Nelly Wotser face singing one of those songs, why 100 plays two times.

[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.060]
You know, Nelly Wotser face?

[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.800]
I would guess that's Nelly Frittado.

[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:24.700]
Canadian A.

[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.420]
Neil, go see Marley and me the movie you love it.

[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.820]
It's not the kind of movie you think it is.

[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:33.940]
Marley and me is like a Marley and Scrooge.

[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.220]
No, it's about Marley.

[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:42.620]
No, it's Jennifer Aniston and I'm forgetting the Owen Wilson about their relationship and

[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:42.840]
a dog.

[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.760]
Marley is the dog.

[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.220]
Oh, the fake Jim Sarni says my former counterpart Barry left something out of his story this morning

[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:53.320]
while the ticket is adding well-known syndicated host Tony Bruno show at night who laughs like a

[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.100]
hyena by the way.

[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.060]
It was Joe Bell and we had the idea first.

[00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:00.380]
However, after 790 got winded what Joe was up to, they moved in and out negotiated them.

[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.960]
Also my good track buddy Hank tells me that Joe and Clarence told the A. He could continue

[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.500]
to do a show for 50 bucks a show.

[00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.340]
Are they serious?

[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:08.840]
Sign the fake Jim Sarni.

[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.380]
50 bucks a show.

[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.820]
And believe me for those ratings he's getting I think that's a little over price.

[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.600]
The biggest name.

[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.360]
The best.

[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:17.540]
The best.

[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.920]
So my dog is new Roger.

[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.300]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.160]
The fourth leader.

[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.300]
It's Friday you best dude.

[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.640]

[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:39.240]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:57:39.240 --> 00:58:01.860]
You were also five years back in Inverter,

[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:02.400]
you were calling birdc Li Variante,

[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:02.560]
yeah, yeah you were so lucky now that you're home.

[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:02.560]

[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:02.560]

[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:02.560]

[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:02.560]

[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:06.220]
условitlife

[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:37.800]
Oh, you're out of touch, Neil. You don't understand downtown Miami's made this great revitalization

[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.060]
and come back. Buh, buh, buh, buh. Okay, good. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Leave me out.

[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.940]
GrumpyFark says, Neil, it looks like your source about 790 going with syndicated programming

[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:52.160]
was right. They were just off by about 12 hours. It'll be from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. instead

[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:55.960]
of 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. By the way, as soon as the labaster leaves 790, it's history. He's

[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.180]
all they've got. That's correct. He's the only one over there with numbers. The rest

[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.440]
of the day, in my swell, shut the transmitter down and talk about saving some cash.

[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.580]
Come on, Barry. Why don't you suggest that to your good buddy Howard Davis over there

[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:11.760]
since you're in constant touch with him 25.8. Come on, Barry. Shut it down, except the

[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.200]
bastard. Put him on as long as he can handle it every day until he burns out about a week.

[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:20.940]
Fake clearance, by the way, is back with us. Nothing about you. Well, that's good, I think.

[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.940]
If you're left out, not at all. Mr. Heising has sent over Jimmy's knee pads to me today,

[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.700]
says fake clearance. Would you be so kind as to pass along to Jimmy so he can pick up his

[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.460]
knee pads after the beast finishes with them. Thanks. Signed fake clearance. Is

[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:38.760]
clearance there today, by the way, no way? No, not till Monday. Not till Monday? So,

[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:42.300]
flea is running to place. Is that it? Correct. I think flea is doing a bloodless

[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:45.580]
coup. I could be wrong, but I think he's taken over. You better watch your ass, clearance.

[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:51.700]
I think flea is moving your ass out. And I vote for that. Hallelujah. Flea, at least,

[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:54.920]
flea not only is just a friend of this show, but at least he recognizes we're on the

[00:59:54.920 --> 01:00:02.220]
air as opposed to your fake friend, clearance. The last day you're there, if you get another

[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.820]
job somewhere, the last day you're there, once you've gotten the last paycheck, I would

[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.920]
go in there, drop my pants and take a gigantic wild diarrhea dump on clearance's desk.

[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.120]
Okay. Making sure that it runs down in his direction. You know what I'm saying? You

[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:23.100]
want to try and spell Neil? What? I want to try to spell Neil. What is that? Oh, yeah,

[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:29.360]
right. That's a good idea. It's kind of like a Frankie Pentangely. Michael Coyleon says,

[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:36.680]
hello. Remember that? Yep. Send him a message from me. Only in this case it would be very sincere

[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.420]
and very legitimate. Jupiter ducks is Neil absolutely corrects her Americans,

[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:45.600]
dumb as dirt, electing baby Bush again in 2004. It's all you need to know about today's US

[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.560]
citizens. Like that British paper on the bottom of our website is how can 48 million or whatever

[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.060]
was Americans be so stupid? Thank you for all the years of great radio. Keep it up in the

[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.140]
show too. Oh, yeah, but we can't play those bits and we can't do it about about, you know,

[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:06.180]
that crowd man, those people that, just going to drag yourself crazy, living in the past,

[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.600]
wanting to resurrect something that's not coming back. It ain't going to happen. It's

[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.800]
not going to happen. I can live with his logs and get paid twice a month. That's all. I

[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.060]
don't know the circumstances. And look at today. Here it is almost 11, 30 and already. I

[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.640]
still haven't played one segment of bits. Have I? Nope. We've done like a regular show.

[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.580]
Now I can take all those calls like that jerk keeps telling me to do on the emails. The only

[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:37.640]
problem is there aren't any. There aren't any. Here, let me prove it to you. I can go down

[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.440]
all the lines, but that would be, that would be mealing it in. I could punch up line eight,

[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:48.100]
which doesn't work anymore because see that they wanted to save some cash. Q. I. M. Hello.

[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:54.600]
I. My hot lagandie says, above the loves bunches, a typical redneck. His redneck humor is

[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:59.060]
intolerable. For example, he has a famous bit where they attach some kind of wiring to the

[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:04.760]
person's intimate areas and their shocked with electricity. Real great stuff. Not. But

[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.200]
South Florida morning radio is so awful that he'll be successful here. No doubt. And that

[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.940]
email was right about Hulk. And he's practically on every week in the segments revolve around

[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:17.800]
how great Hulk is and his evil ex how evil is ex-wife is for divorcing him. Hulk.

[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.180]
If I ever see him again, it'll be much too soon. Have you seen that the so-called reality show

[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:29.100]
that he's got? Oh, yeah. The whole thing is best. Oh. And I think Brooke has one now by herself.

[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:37.980]
Really? Bad little brook. You mean his daughter broke or his ex-wife? No, his daughter.

[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:43.080]
We've got her. I want the gay son. Is he got one? Not yet. See, those wrestlers,

[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.860]
what I tell you about professional wrestlers. Gay. Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:52.700]
Hey, good morning, Neil. Good morning, sir. I just want to call you. Happy holidays, Neil.

[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.020]
I love your show, man. You look good. Thanks a lot, pal. Have a good one, Neil. And back,

[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:02.740]
back, have a great the 2009. For 101 votes on the poll, would you say our goal was for 100? Let's go home.

[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:07.320]
Later. I can call my cabbie. He can be at the door in five minutes and off to would buy him.

[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:11.520]
Win another 80 billion dollars. Boy, I sure was lucky yesterday. Christmas day. The Lord was

[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.900]
looking down on my fat ass and said, Hey, here's a few bucks for old. Oh, God. That's right.

[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:26.220]
Thanks, God. Oh, my goodness. The world and its religions, all of it, the great religions of

[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:29.140]
the world. There are no great religions. There were one in vent one. Let me know what it is.

[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:40.320]
Q.A.M. Hello. Q.A.M. Hello. You get paid for this, sir? Sir, sir. What do you need? A life

[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:44.300]
transplant, sir? This is what Q.A.M. paid you for. Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:50.140]
Neil, happy new year to you. Back to you, sir. I'd have to say, though, on the

[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.040]
pure talent, Howard Davis is a much better broadcast. Or he's a jerk as a person.

[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.260]
And it would be great to hear his voice on the air again as far as just doing the ball.

[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:04.140]
Better broadcast than Jimmy. I'm sorry. Better broadcast than Jimmy Cifalus.

[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.060]
Oh, much better than Jimmy. Is there any doubt about that? No, but he's all from pure talent.

[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:14.520]
I mean, as far as being able to listen to it and not fall asleep, it's great.

[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:18.000]
And I don't know what's going on with Chris, but I hope you don't lose your job. I think you do a

[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:28.480]
great job. You lost the ball, go. Goodbye. What was that? That was a cheap shot at you.

[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:35.180]
Well, you didn't lose the pool. He won the pool by a million miles by a mile. He had like 140.

[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:42.920]
Let's see the previous pool. What a jerk. 120 votes and Curtis had 40. I mean, none of the above

[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.620]
doesn't count what the hell is that? That's is that like competition? No. You lost the pool, by the way.

[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:53.640]
By another jackass, another sour ass. My god, probably most boyfriend,

[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:58.160]
who surprised me and all sounded like him. Probably the same hair piece. I wonder if the doctor

[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.800]
performed the surgery on this guy's hair piece is the same guy doctor performed the surgery on

[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:09.380]
Jay's feelers. You think what a nasty shot. And just in time for the holidays, take a shot at

[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:18.340]
poor fat Chris. Nice. You're 60 QAM. I have a nice shot.

[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:22.780]
Fourth leader. College football drama unfolds tomorrow.

[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.080]
Check this out. The court is going to run it. That's side. He's got the 10-year-old.

[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.340]
He's got the 10-year-old. He's got the 10-year-old.

[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:32.960]
The court is going to run it. Randy Shannon leaks the Miami hurricanes against the Cal bears

[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.920]
and the Emerald Bulls. The hurricane standay starts at 4 p.m. live from 18th

[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.820]
San Francisco. Kick up his set for 8 p.m. here on sports radio 560 QAM.

[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:55.220]
See, don't rejoin. How about the leader was supposed to attack?

[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:58.760]
It was supposed to start, but it didn't. What? The sports leader was supposed to go.

[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:01.660]
We don't need the sports leader. You can take the sports leader and stick him up.

[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:05.300]
Johnny Joe's fat ass. Okay. No, thank you. My God.

[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.440]
Clarence, I'm telling you. Clarence needs to be horse whipped.

[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.880]
Bakered. Baker acted. Oh, look at this. I closed the pile.

[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.000]
That's okay. It's a holiday anyway. Screw it.

[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.420]
I'm going to get a ride on the beach.

[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:54.440]
I'm going to get a ride on the beach.

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:54.440]

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.500]
I'm going to get a ride on the beach.

[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.000]
I'm going to get a ride on the beach.

[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.240]
I'm going to get a ride on the beach.

[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.640]
I'm going to get a ride on the beach.

[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:01.640]

[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:06.560]
One, next thing we knew, OJ went on a low speed.

[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.640]
Run the ride.

[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:13.180]
Now he's in an L.A. jail charge for double on the side.

[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.740]
And I believe it's first degree.

[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.900]
Murder is guilty of.

[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.140]
It's because.

[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.820]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.580]
For what he's called.

[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:29.440]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:30.200]
Love it.

[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.880]
32. Here comes a great email.

[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.460]
I'm printing it out right now about Miami and how wonderful it is.

[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:35.300]
Let me say it again.

[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.360]
If you're happy there, I'm happy for you.

[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.480]
Okay. Enjoy it.

[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.300]
Soak up the sunshine.

[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.920]
Love it. Live it.

[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.960]
Better you than me. That's all.

[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.060]
I had enough. You know what I mean?

[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:46.500]
What do you mean?

[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:48.340]
I had enough.

[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.500]
Because the same people who make these phone calls and send these emails, those are the ones who live there.

[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.740]
Like I've said, there's nothing wrong with South Florida that couldn't be cured by a people transplant.

[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.360]
It says from hothead, subject, trashing.

[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.460]
You can trash Miami all you want. The fact remains that it remains one of the best places to live.

[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.860]
Here's a sirens coming to take this guy away. You heard it?

[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:11.740]
No.

[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:12.900]
You can't hear him?

[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:13.980]
No, I can't hear him this time.

[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.240]
I'm usually I do, but I can't hear him this time.

[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:21.460]
If you were to take a survey in Miami, Toronto or anywhere in the country asking if family, friends, jobs, and not a consideration, where would you rather live?

[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.140]
The vast majority would say Miami.

[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:29.900]
Your taste for hog city is anything but mainstream, although you obviously have a natural affinity for that region since you were born and raised nearby.

[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.840]
And of course, your listeners are brainwashed by your constant spewing.

[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.960]
I have an affinity for this area because I was born across the lake and Rochester. What's that got to do with Toronto? It's a great city.

[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:44.860]
It's a real world-class city. It's a real metropolis. It's a real place.

[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:51.660]
Not just with three basic ethnic groups who hate each other like poison, but nevertheless.

[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.780]
So in other words, I can't like it here.

[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:01.180]
Misery loves company. I'm supposed to be there and pretend I like it and supposed to be in some place I do like.

[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.840]
Hey, just because it's your life doesn't mean it's for you to enjoy, all right?

[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.860]
That's right. And my affinity for Toronto is anything but mainstream. What does that mean?

[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.540]
Anything but means? Who the hell ever said I wanted to be mainstream in the first place? Is this show ever been mainstream?

[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:19.000]
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Hothead, idiot.

[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:25.500]
And it's people like you who make me not want to be more than a couple days at a time.

[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.960]
I can handle four or five days here and there. Just fine.

[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.260]
But other than that, forget about it. Not my kind of town.

[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:45.660]
Oh, how can you say that you're constantly spewing brain and I'm not brainwashing anybody people know what a place is by their life by their everyday experiences by the people they interact with by the the whole deal.

[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:58.140]
Am I right? Absolutely. It's not the Vatable. If somebody's unhappy in Ojas, it's not because Neorages went on a radio and said Ojas is an outdoor sewer.

[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:17.260]
Q. A. M. Hello. Q. A. M. Hello. You talk about that key. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you ever tried to bossy. Yeah, what do you think? Jam, Jamson killed bossy in your and the phone too.

[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:26.640]
If you would take the calls, Neil, you'll see I'd dare you. There aren't any right now. That was a medley of our two calls right there. Oh, but Miami is wonderful.

[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:37.740]
They are you just aren't interacting with the right people with the plastic a holes on South Beach. That's right. With all the jewelry laden plastic a holes on South Beach. I'm not saying there aren't a few nice people on South Beach. I'm just not sure.

[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:50.720]
Do you think there are? I mean, just by the other side of us, most is the law of averages. There got to be some lots of jewelry, lots of fake lots of posing and that's that's what it's all about.

[01:10:51.460 --> 01:11:00.000]
You're wrong. You'll downtown is good. Sell it to somebody else. Sell it to somebody who might buy it, who hasn't had like 30 years of it.

[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:08.440]
And seeing the way degraded from a once a pretty once upon a time, I really enjoyed it. It was fine. It was fun. It was great.

[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:26.620]
Here's one from Rob who says, Bubba loves bunch makes jazz. McKay sound like Einstein horrible, but he does hate smitten so we can't be all that bad. Whatever happened to the Chris Baker drop smelly bitch. I have no idea. Anyway, good luck to you and Kripp fat Chris in 2000. Thanks, Rob. Have a happy Q. I am. Hello.

[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:20.500]
I don't think it'll be much longer form. I held him alive forever. Old nasty bastards like that. They live forever. You'll see I will. Larry says Dave game is alive and fat in Los Angeles on WCIX TV. Wow. They took the call letters from what used to be channel six in Miami WCIX and they moved to a tie. I probably just for him to get him on the screen.

[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:50.360]

[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.960]
Signal just got better when he actually put it by the radio as opposed to

[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.860]
Like that which I can do that myself. I'll need his help

[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.940]
423 votes on a poll biggest loser of 2008 John McCain 110 burning made off 81

Oh, that's just sour grapes again sour grapes

[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:19.300]
We'll see we'll see what happens on Sunday when those jets and dolphins who hate each other like like poison

[01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:25.840]
Like absolute poison now where's that game is that in the middlelands correct? Oh, no

[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:31.840]
Not in the frozen tundra of the middlelands. Oh, it's not gonna be that bad. It's not gonna snow. I don't think

[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.200]
Gonna be like about yeah, this thing is gonna be a

[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.420]
It's gonna be higher than it was last week. Yeah

[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:45.660]
Meaning what it's not gonna be as cold and fridges as as there wasn't Kansas City. Did you say frigid?

[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.780]
frigid you better call Joyce and see if we can say that

[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.900]
The extra

[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.120]
The fourth leader

[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.380]
The biggest names the best talent if the madard

[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:10.480]
sports radio 560 QAM the sports leader

[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:15.660]

[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:24.620]
She can get on her knees and do what you like

[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:31.380]
She can do you in high heels with six inch high spikes

[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:36.340]
You'd like her to with you what she has underneath

[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:43.540]
Spank a butt like a child cuz she's always a girl girl to me

[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:49.260]
Rectum under covers with style she's a cute

[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:56.000]
She'll take your personal check master card or your visa

[01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:01.940]
She'll call up your wife if you can pay her fee

[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:07.780]
She'll blackmail your blind but she's always a call girl to me

[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:20.900]
Well as you got the cash she will make if you want

[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:25.060]
You'll be first in her line

[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.760]
You'll see always what

[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:39.020]
When you only want in

[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.740]
But she's watching the time

[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:48.540]
She can kill politicians with candid affection

[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.200]
As they say in Chinese you might lose any reaction

[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.740]
While your front page and tabloids she's on her shopping spree

[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:05.500]
Label her first class hooker, but that sounds like a call girl to me

[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:15.260]
Oh

[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.020]
14 to 65 62 and here we are almost two hours didn't play the rack at all yet

[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:31.800]
Although I'm thinking about it look at that phone any calls on here. No, of course. I'm your friend. It's it's his show today

[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.400]
Am I right? He's basically and then of course the old crotchety guy

[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.120]
The guy

[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.000]
And what else anything else memorable no no

[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.900]
Take some calls take the calls all day we challenge you. What were they five six seven oh five sixty

[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.600]
pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

We're all your holiday greetings happy new year to you and the staff at QAM guys and like that, you know

[01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.260]
We had a couple of those

[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:05.900]
In fact, you know what the really scary thing of it is over the whole holiday thing the maybe five or six people

[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.120]
Took the time to send emails saying you know wish you a happy holidays like like that

[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.780]
Not that I celebrate these holidays and they know that but nevertheless

[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.120]
Just out of common, you know extended the gland of friendship nothing

[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.340]
hostile

[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.380]
You're so negative about Miami knew you're so wrong

[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.540]
Here's one from a clearance to follow up. Please forgive me. I forgot to let that

[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:29.760]
A fat blubber ass christineau how much I hate him see him on day fat. So it says the fake clearance

[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.880]
Oh, here's one Marley about Marley

[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.220]
Neil men women teenagers children were openly weeping at the end of Marley and me

[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:40.740]
They were openly weeping much I do at the end of the show just about every day openly we

[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:47.940]
Because it was so good. It's about a dog. I just I I am defeated. It's something about a dog. Yeah, Marley is a dog

[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.300]
QAM hello. Yeah, I'm QAM hello

[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.560]
If you move to Florida and you're not prejudice give yourself one week and you'll be prejudice

[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.360]
I can't do it in the world. Yes

[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.040]
It is it's horrible and

[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.900]
No, I'm just saying it's a horrible place

[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.960]
I agree if the Spanish people do not make you prejudice instantly there's something wrong

[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.980]
I see they're the worst

[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.720]
Okay, well thanks for your bigoted comment

[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:25.960]
Bigot

[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.560]
Thank you, but yeah, I knew that's where he was going

[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.980]
I just wanted to draw it out him at this time of the year when people are so wonderful to each other

[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:37.260]
And goodwill I keep talking about that it doesn't exist in South Florida. It's an intolerable place

[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:39.520]
QAM hello

[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.080]
Hola

[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.960]
QAM hello. I'm glad you're my friend QAM hello

[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:52.600]
Hello hello yes

[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.680]
Yes, is it Neil yes, it is

[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:58.280]
Neil happy holidays and back to you

[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:03.400]
Um, I was hearing a couple of months ago you were talking about arms for dumb

[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.020]
That you didn't like it anymore. I was just wondering why

[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:12.600]
I didn't say I didn't like it anymore. I said it's not what it used to be and there were times of the year when you go there

[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.160]
When they're only the Dutchman there and it's a crappy place

[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.040]
Yeah, why? I think they cleaned up a lot though lately

[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:25.280]
You know, it didn't need cleaning up that the only thing needed cleaning up and get all those rusted drug dealers off the streets

[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.620]
Other than that there's nothing else needed to be cleaned up

[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.340]
Oh, okay, what they're trying what they're trying to do is sanitize it like time square

[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:35.960]
And then that obviously takes away the attraction most people go there because it's wide open and it's fun

[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.140]
And they can screw around to whatever they want that that's why people go there

[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:39.980]
Yeah

[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.600]
Well anyway, listen you have a

[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:49.140]
A customer's new year and same to you take with you later. Toad scenes. Oh, why? Toad scenes. Do we?

[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.640]
What's toad scenes means to deal yes, sir

[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.260]
Hey, I think all these about back to you sir

[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:59.280]
Man, let me tell you what agar with the crap out of me right ahead

[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:05.240]
I'm getting off the saw grass and they want 50 sets. I don't I don't carry a change per surround me

[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:10.000]
Who carries change around these days, man? I mean they need to do something different here like people who drive cars

[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.340]
They have like a little compartment and they put quarters and change and stuff people who drive cars and know that they're going to be driving on a

[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.300]
Full road those are the people who do that

[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:21.580]
People without floors should have a sun pass that that's right if you have your double sun pass

[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.920]
You should have change if you're going to drive on a road where you know that there's going to be a toll

[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.880]
What do you expect them to say oh look go ahead? We don't expect you to have a change purse

[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.720]
Hi, but you get on there and it's 50 cents and you get off in a 70% now like you carry in five quarters around

[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.060]
If you need to do something different like have a change miss you

[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.080]
I would take that that'd be great

[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.660]
But some of these automated ones you can only put quarters in yeah, you don't have enough nice suggestions

[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:51.520]
Don't call on the sawgrass that's a great idea

[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.720]
Good on you too, huh? I know that took a lot of thought but

[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.800]
It's one of those things

[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:03.880]
439 votes on the poll. I'm not reading the result till of the SN. Oh an article from the star

[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:10.540]
Happy holidays to my friend Ken and Tobico, but I don't want any articles from the star or any old articles about the unmentioned

[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.000]
Able one which you know I already know

[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:18.340]
Here's one that says I think the polls are great one, but I have to dispute the choices some of the voters made

[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.200]
I say up front. I voted for the Patriots. I was born and raised in New England

[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.860]
Honestly, feel like they choked big time in the Super Bowl

[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:27.940]
Yeah, the defense just stopped playing with a couple minutes left

[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:34.160]
But as far as mechanis concerned, I think he's been a loser for a lot longer than 2008 and as far as made-offs

[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.600]
This guy's given a rundown on a whole thing

[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:44.400]
I would rank the big three as bigger losers. Oh my god and perhaps the biggest loses of all the taxpayers as Jean and Sabre

[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.380]
Jean have a great new year and just calm down

[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:48.400]
Wow

[01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.920]
On and on and on and on I could read it all, but it would just kill some time. I'd rather play the rack

[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:01.520]
442 votes on your poll. What's it go 550 sounds good to me and that's what I said 600. I'm thinking what

[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.460]
6 on over there

[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:04.860]
600

[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.480]
You'll see you have little faith. We'll see

[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:13.740]
600 on the day after Christmas unboxing day and all that and then anyway everybody's taking crap back to the store

[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:19.720]
Is there all Russian just going nuts? You think it's nuts when they're like going to buy stuff when they go to take it back

[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.940]
That's when it really gets bad

[01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.820]
And we're talking to ourselves today anyway. I'm looking at the aesthetics

[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.100]
On the see this should have been a day off for us

[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:34.180]

[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.880]
I was wondering about

[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:17.220]
Canada's laws on marijuana. I remember so like a year ago

[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:20.440]

[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:25.460]
How they do? No like Toronto or when they get no

[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:28.240]
Oh, I'm a steak. Hi

[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.240]
Thank you. People smoke it openly here. They got more important things to worry about than people smoke

Someday we're gonna have that too Neil

No, you're wrong. All right man. Have a good day. Good luck to you. No, you want you live in the fastest, the USA, sir

[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.200]
We got the pot police and we got the

[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:47.220]
DEA and all the and the medical marijuana medicinal marijuana

[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:51.540]
That's not good either because no matter how many states pass the laws states rights go down the toilet then

[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.400]
Because the federal government sends in the DEA and they bust everybody and you go to jail for a hundred years

[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:03.020]
Because they're the drug police. That's what America's all about the whole of the whole we're on drugs is the biggest waste of money

[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:52.300]
Because all the others put together don't even come close to I'm your friend

[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:02.840]
464 we just had a little chunk. You have a little chunk. Mm-hmm. I guess where I'm going at two o'clock by the way on the day after Christmas

[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:04.980]
Yeah, I like it

[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:10.600]
You know it reminds me of it's like the same thing with Miami. I don't want to live

[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:13.580]
I've got my house there. I come and visit every now and then periodically

[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:19.120]
But I don't want to live there. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in with just the whole ambiance

[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:25.180]
And there is no Miami. They're just a bunch of bedroom towns. I've said that for a zillion years

[01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:27.320]
Just disconnected. They have nothing to do with each other

[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.020]
Pembroke pines and

[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:36.180]
Plantation and Pindle and the Ojas, you know, they just a bunch of unconnected

[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:37.300]
towns

[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.600]
Sweetwater

[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.200]
Right

[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:46.280]
Correct and they have nothing to do with each other moral cables coconut grove

[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:49.520]
Tamarack sunrise sunrise lakes

[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.560]
Uh-huh

[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.780]
Poppano Delray Beach deer field beach it's just a long strip of Akandos

[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.000]
And like I said, there's nothing wrong with the uh the weather is fine

[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.160]
Would I rather be in that weather than than here right now you bet

[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:10.080]
But am I gonna make this sacrifice of giving up living and breathing civilized people here and believe me this ain't no perfection

[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.200]
Just like that jerk uh the hind guy with that email. Oh

[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.480]
We're trying to get you to do a perfect show. You're a perfect idiot

[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.280]
I take back what I said about nothing is perfect. He's a perfect idiot and we speak to many other perfect idiots as well

[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:26.740]
I just don't want the I don't want my

[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.520]
Life to be besmirched by creatures like that

[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:35.120]
You can relate to that can't you well of course you're stuck there. The big money you're making

[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:40.740]
Clarence comes back on Monday. I've achieved. He's got some real exciting news about plans. He's got food

[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.500]
Big plan

[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:49.160]
Big fourth leader

[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:52.540]
It's a

[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:54.320]
Show wing nights for me to

[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.700]
50 bucks in Sean's baby

[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:10.020]
The manager told me yeah that I was right out of my head and then he said feel handry was using a voice instead such life

[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:17.300]
I didn't listen to his jive. I knew all along. He was all wrong and I knew that he thought are you sure?

[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:22.440]
Then I was crazy, but I'm not oh no. Yeah, but wait. Yeah, but wait a second the manager told me

[01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:28.160]
Yeah, then I was a little confused and I said hey Bobby. Yep. I didn't call to get abused this way

[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.500]
I heard a show just the other day. I think you ought to know what he did on his show

[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.360]
I was very up all

[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.960]
That's the reason why call yeah, but let me say something for us. Let me say something

[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:45.240]
This woman named Margaret Paul to show quite a lot and I don't want to listen to that suck up

[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:48.500]
Bulls not I know you think bill is a genius

[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:53.460]
And that it's okay. I can feel that way, but you would I say I didn't think it was a bit funny

[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:56.240]
Especially when he talked about the aborted baby

[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:03.260]
It says with the cock that saw some top. Yeah, but are did you uh? Are you are you sure the manager told me yeah?

[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:07.940]
That I could use some couch time, but I should have made me yep. You'd let me speak my mind

[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:15.900]
You'll find I didn't think it was very kind when baseball was played by the crippled and blind and to make matters worse

[01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:21.620]
Yeah, passion phones with Sunny Hersh. Oh, no. All right. All right. The manager told me yeah

[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:24.280]
Then I was right out of my head and then he said lady

[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:29.400]
Your true easily miss led because you just know feel hand me shows you naked new

[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:34.000]
So why don't you relax and have a value more to because you don't know if you've got

[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:39.100]
To talk to Bobby Green or not and you know three voices are better than one

[01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:45.000]
Oh, but nobody showed up. They didn't show up that night to Bobby Green and the Bob Nile didn't show up

[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.520]
That was kind of a lie there Phil are you sure that's okay? I don't hold the grudges, you know

[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:56.800]
Life is too short told grudges. Don't you agree? Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, it's part all of in this case of Q.A. Am I I will make an exception

[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:04.020]
Every rule has got an exception to it in this case like with Jolly Joe Bell and Clarence and Joyce. I'll make an exception

[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:09.140]
Phil Ladsman that's why I played the drop in says I of course. I don't know if this is really him or not

[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:10.920]
You think it's him probably it is

[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:14.600]
Yeah, what a schmitty effing year was best in oh nine to you in George

[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:16.560]
And you two Phil there's a good guy

[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:18.540]
Phil Ladsman, you know who he is?

[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:23.340]
Yes, you do yep, and I hear him on a NPR NPR

[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.560]
And he's a good guy your last man and a friend of the show and a friend of mine and George and probably you two he left you out

[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.200]
It was an oversight

[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:35.100]
They don't know who the hell you are see you you're on a way to greatness. That's why Clarence

[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:39.880]
That's why Clarence went to Joe Bell and said oh, let's get him off that show before we become as famous and you know

[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.640]
Important then I'll want a big fat raise

[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:44.540]
Right

[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:52.120]
Well, I was hoping for a raise since it's been three years, but you know you got a raise. All right right out the door. Yep. You got a raise through the roof

[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:58.860]
George says that's George with a G Neil and Jorge wishing you both a healthy and happy 2009

[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:03.220]
Thanks for the years of laughter in a world I can use a lot more of it the best wishes George the cop

[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:07.960]
Thanks George George the cop see good cop bad cop. There's a good cop like Dave the cop

[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:09.220]
Right

[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:10.800]
Correct

[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:16.500]
Am I getting a little incoherent now that's all right at all. I'm not I have no attention taking any more calls

[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.800]
Oh, see you can't do well. There aren't none right now

[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.180]
So let me reach over and shut off the monitor so I'm not tempted

[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.080]
You know if they start coming in I'm not tempted. Mm-hmm. There's no point to it

[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.160]
The jolly Joe Bell regime their idea of a they they know nothing about talk radio

[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.440]
Nothing in fact take the word talk out of there. They know nothing about this business. Nothing

[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.780]
All they knew how to do is grind through a lot of spots baby

[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:41.720]
We got spots and what which is where the money comes from you know

[01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.680]
But that's all they know how to do

[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:52.800]
Other than that nothing. I mean the Kenyan blow morning show and jerks and uh and jacks and uh DA. Oh my god

[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.380]
Now do you believe that uh rumor we had before?

[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.300]
No about the offering him why not

[01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:02.100]
I don't know about about DA

[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.200]
50 bucks a show. Yeah, no

[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:09.660]
Why not because I'm sure he could get better somewhere else

[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:12.960]
If that's what they were gonna you don't understand the way they do things though

[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.460]
That that's the way they get you out to do they are they low-ball you and they keep a little like with Hank

[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:22.160]
And with me they couldn't believe I actually he's a resound to deal and you know what thanks the Lord

[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:26.580]
Thank god that I did because now in the time of recession and depression yada yada

[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.460]
Uh, it's not so bad. I'll survive

[01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:34.980]
You think so? Yeah, I'm sure you will. I will survive

[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.940]
They're just this is the way they push people out as opposed to saying well

[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:45.160]
We've decided to go in another direction or we think you show sucks or you have no numbers. You have a point

[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.540]
Whatever you got no

[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:53.320]
And I guess if he agrees to do 50 bucks a show he'll stay and if not bye-bye back to Kansas City

[01:44:54.600 --> 01:45:00.080]
Boy did he make a bad bad mistake? I realized he was unemployed previously, you know Kansas City got canned

[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:04.340]
And I don't know I've heard him on the year a few times. He sounds fine to me

[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:10.040]
There's there's a pause there waiting for you to interject

[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:15.020]
He is good. I mean, he's you know, he's very good. It's very polished. Yeah, he's like a broadcaster

[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:19.700]
He's like somebody really belongs on the air. I don't think he knows a whole lot about the the South Florida sports scene

[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:26.920]
But these things take time. He certainly know the fabulous sports babe or I need to mark. Oh my god x marks the spot

[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:32.240]
You just wait till you see what happens with that. Well, it's gonna materialize. You'll see

[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:40.240]
No, I totally believe you. I know it. It's not that I'm thinking it. I know it. I can smell it. Oh, yeah, the aroma

[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:42.460]
Could put you in a coma

[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:46.840]
Here's one from Michael who says Neil you do have many listeners in South Florida

[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.520]
We're sitting back and letting the nut jobs call in. Oh, I better have a few listeners in South Florida

[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:55.860]
Because that's the only place they hear us all the way do have some people online although not too many today not as many as usual

[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.560]
Because this is like not a real day

[01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:04.940]
Oh, I'll be so glad when this is all over with it just it goes on too long it goes on too effing long man

[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:11.080]
Now you wouldn't agree because you know your goyish your background. You probably enjoy this

[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.460]
Totally, you know it did you have a wonderful Christmas lot of gifts?

[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:18.920]
I had a very nice Christmas. I didn't do I didn't ask for a lot of gifts and I didn't know you know

[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.880]
I got what I asked for so it's fine. I got a nice winter coat from Paco. We're on size. You'll take it back though

[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:31.220]
Nice winter coat beautiful. That's nice very nice of course it was bought with my money, but that that's it thought the counts

[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:35.840]
What it's the thought that counts that's right is a very nice thing. I thought

[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.820]
Anyway, uh Michael says you do have many listeners in South Florida

[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:44.320]
We're sitting back letting the nut jobs call in you are correct sir. Thank you president bush for this recession

[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:52.200]
Just think when he leaves the White House and moves into a $15 million dollar mansion in Dallas. Yeah, that makes you feel all all warm and fuzzy inside not

[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.460]
Hope you and your staff have a great new year and God help us regular people and God help those 4000 dead people in Iraq

[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:00.060]
There was dead 4000 dead Americans too late for them

[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:04.680]
Not to mention all the ones that got butchered up over there and came back without eyes and limbs and stuff

[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.920]
All of these things and of course hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis

[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:14.480]
I'm sure they all want to say a special thank you to well president. They the bushmeister the butcher of Washington

[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.700]
And life just goes on see that it's one thing you people have to understand

[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:22.180]
I mean you can get all whipped up angry and pissed off and and frustrated and

[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:26.560]
Join some organization and signed petitions, but you know people did vote

[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:29.220]
They voted record numbers. They said enough already

[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:32.840]
That's all they could really do and we put a new guy in there who's inheriting a

[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:38.940]
Unnightmare. I mean, I you know, I have great confidence in him. Although. I'm not I'm not pleased with that the Rick Warren crap

[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:44.380]
That was a really stupid move on his on his part and his advisors parts on their parts

[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:46.040]
You know which part?

[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.140]
Brack them that part

[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:51.600]
Rick Warren and it's like I'm fighting David Duke to speak at the inauguration

[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:59.500]
You don't think I don't really know the guy to also then out and out big it a big it

[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:03.080]
Not just a homophil but a big it and a fee to sugar

[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:05.800]
But well, you know, we all have to get together right

[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.300]
Let's see if we can dig Hitler up and bring him back so we can all get together and join hands and yoddy yoddy

[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:13.440]
Not a good idea, but nevertheless

[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:20.400]
Well, let him off the hook for old times sake and we'll see what happens after that. He's inheriting a just a humongous mess of depression

[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:26.120]
A war that's been going on for like it seems a hundred years

[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.760]
And then come to find out those Afghan hounds over there

[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:36.560]
Uh, they're just they're for the pathetic. This is what happens when you go into a part of the world. That's like in the stone age

[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.160]
You know what I mean? What do you mean? Barbarians

[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:45.100]
Afghanistan without what are we doing Afghanistan? We did a hell of a job on the Taliban

[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:51.780]
It's almost embarrassing how oblivious you are says somebody I'll bet that if you actually drove into Miami. I mean beach to get lost

[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:56.680]
But I understand you need to rational. Oh, yeah, keep keep giving me a solid dance

[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.700]
Be honest if I 60 folded in the fan Toronto picked you up with the option of doing the show from anywhere

[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:08.040]
Where would you do the show from from Toronto just like I'm doing it right now

[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:14.080]
See, I'm not complaining. I have no problems with where I am where I live the people here any of this but a lot of you melcontents

[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:17.120]
Misery loves companies. You'll never forget

[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:23.080]
Fort rate you five sixty QAM

[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:31.200]
It's the big O or Landu Elzu Gary after noon two to four

[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:46.660]
So

[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:49.140]
I'm a whosane's a mother f***er

[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.740]
Try to whosane's a mother f***er

[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:55.840]
I rise to crappy little country

[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.360]
Smells like the mustache on a space

[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.820]
Just get rid of that

[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:45.520]
So I got to say happy new year now, right? Yeah, it's rub it in

[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.700]
the week after that and

[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:00.120]
You're giving me crap because I'm taking a week. Oh, well those are weeks vacation

[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:04.500]
I don't like it like 40 50 a week a year. What the hell's wrong with you?

[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:09.520]
Who is the biggest loser of 2,000 a we're approaching 500 votes? We're ever gonna make 600. You're crazy

[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:12.480]
Well, I told you I told you and I say five and a quarter

[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.960]
Who is the biggest loser of 2008 John McCain 122

[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:25.760]
Bernie made off 92 the almost perfect season Patriots 47 that's just an opportunity for a lot of very jealous people to go

[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.800]
You lost the game you well

[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:36.600]
The only team in history to win to go on defeated through a full 16 game season and go 18 and 0

[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.560]
Because when the offense had the perfect season that were only like 14 games on a regular season am I right? Yes?

[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:44.020]
Yes, correct

[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:49.940]
OJ Simpson laid edition 43 OJ's climb in the ladder, baby. He's on John McCain's ass

[01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:56.000]
Why true love to see that the Wall Street investment banks 42 big three auto companies 36

Just Jason Jackson 13 for jerks. What a show that was man

[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.060]
Come on atcha

[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:14.300]
It now is he on across the street like on a weekend or something are they using him or not? I really have no idea

[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:18.800]
Well, why not aren't you monitoring what's going on over there? They think they're obsessed with me

[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.380]
I'll tell you that obsessed well know when they said that I'm going part time. I stopped monitoring anything

[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:25.320]
When they what

[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:30.460]
When they said I'm gonna be a part timer and no longer full time I stopped worrying about your interest

[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:32.360]
You no longer felt like a team player

[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.860]
You felt like you've been relegated to the sideline to the locker room

[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:43.380]
Joel Feinberg 11 if you see Jim Park in locker room by the way, so I'm still interested all I'm sure he's an old man now like I am

[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:49.880]
Last season's by me heat eight they ate it all right Tom Brady first a super bowl then the O8 season eight

[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:54.020]
He's still doing pretty damn good. I think I have a feeling he's doing just fine

[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:59.980]
Big brown deny the triple crown loses the Belmont pulls up at the top of the stretch and like oh

[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:04.340]
Geez what happened to this piece of craft seven? There's something anywhere Rick Dutton was involved

[01:53:04.340 --> 01:53:08.020]
I always wondered just what's going on there, you know a little hanky spanky

[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:13.220]
The Tampa Bay race got two votes and very undeserved in week we continue chastising those people

[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.840]
We voted for Tampa Bay. What an incredible turn around they did huh?

[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:21.180]
Not as incredible as the dolphins though from one and fifteen to what are they like?

[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:21.920]
10-5

[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:27.740]
First he went up 11-11-11-11-11 they win and if they lose the game on Sunday no playoffs no wild card

[01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:29.300]
No nothing oh well still a great year

[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:33.700]
Well, it's the it's the what you call it era

[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:42.840]
Sporano oh look at this we're just was just told the real details on the air 25 an hour until he finds a new gig

[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:49.960]
If you read this on the year don't see it's from me. It's from someone in the building. Okay. It's from somebody in the building

[01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:55.080]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:59.200]
Read to yourself before reading on the year. I'm gonna say who it's from not

[01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:05.640]
Was just told the radio now I can't I can't say from somebody inside the building

[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.000]
25 bucks an hour

[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.360]
Well, that's not 50 bucks a show

[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:17.380]
So another it's till he finds a new gig. So that was there. They're shoving him out the door too nice going jolly joe bell

[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:20.820]
One of you gonna be taking that spot what wonder who will take that spot

[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:23.200]
And he do marks

[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:26.900]
You want to bet you want to make a bet on it right now?

[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:32.480]
I'm having a money bet so a hundred bucks against your next five months five year salary. That's okay

[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:38.880]
Well, there's the same amount I think well no, I think I'd make a little bit more in that five now. That was up 22 points. Oh, yeah, I hope so

[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:44.420]
I hope they take good care of you even though I know that they won't not they won't because you worked on this show and

[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.600]
You really became a part of this show and I don't want to get all teared up and everything like emotional

[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:55.400]
Hey, I'm gonna just it's very sad. So the most fun I've had on a regular basis of this radio station

[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:58.540]
Well, there you go. Of course look who you've worked with in the past

[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:04.860]
Hey, I get to work with cut and Curtis all the time. That's a lot of fun too. Do you? Oh, yeah, he's a good guy very good guy

[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.440]
How come he never got his own show?

[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:12.960]
Right now because he doesn't have his head up clearances ass. That's the answer to that question

[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:18.060]
That's why Curtis never got his own show then I think also right now he kind of likes working with a

[01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.820]
Jim Manichart time so

[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.880]
He'll be it's not working out to be his George that's not working out too good

[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.120]
Is it who knows

[01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:32.300]
Remember it's not ratings that are important at a sports station. Oh, that's right. It's a money

[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.080]
Money money money in ball games and stuff give us the money honey

[01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:39.980]
That's the kind of rationalization people use who don't have any ratings

[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:47.300]
That's the kind of the crappy here from a guy like Jolly Joe Bell who is who has taken this radio station and driven it into virtual oblivion

[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:52.260]
And then they come up with this. Oh, well, we're not we're ratings driven. We care about ball games

[01:55:52.260 --> 01:55:56.180]
They care about balls. I care about balls too, you know, but doesn't make me any money

[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:00.740]
491 votes on the pool and here's a happy new year from

[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:03.900]

I wish you good health good luck and good way during the coming year. Thanks Gene and back at you

[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.220]
What a nice guy Gene and Sebring

[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:18.200]
And Sebring see he's not in South Florida. He's in Sebring

[01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:23.000]
99% of our audience 99.9% of the audiences in South Florida

[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:28.600]
How many of them have taken the time to express in such a glowing and warm terms is nice Gene and Sebring, huh? Good guy

[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:29.800]
right?

[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:31.020]
correct

[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:35.260]
Nice people nice people most of them don't live in South Florida

[01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:41.360]
People live in South Florida try to and quit try to sell me on how great South Florida is like I said if you like it

[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.200]
Great. I'm delighted for you. I'm hysterical for you

[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:52.120]
I'm here by choice nobody coerced me into coming here. Okay Greg read made me a great deal and Norma can't I'll say this for her

[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:58.220]
Negotiated this thing where I can basically do the show from anywhere we built that studio at Amsterdam and of course Bob Vermuth

[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:01.580]
They ran out of there before it worked there properly so that turned it into a bust

[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:04.940]
Plus the apartment was like it in the basement and like with

[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:08.880]
Spiders and cobwebs and totally unsanitary and unbreedable

[01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:12.520]
That kind of called me before the Dutchman about Amsterdam

[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.160]
It's really sad it could be such a wonderful place to live

[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:19.500]
But now they're starting to make it more of prudish. They're gonna chase most of the tourists away

[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:23.600]
Although I do have a good Mickey D's there the one with the rat crawling around

[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:29.400]
Okay, and they got an Albert Hine Express on the dam rack. What more could you want?

[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.860]
If you go to Amsterdam go to that Mandarin restaurant on the

[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.920]
Aroken just south of the dam rack

[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:38.780]
Mandarin restaurant with a big big ass sign you walk upstairs good place

[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:43.220]
If you find a good restaurant in Amsterdam tell a world about it because they're just aren't too many on

[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:46.780]
Aroken you know what Aroken means smoking ah

[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.700]
They're smoking Mahatma Gandhi says you're right about the holidays. I know I am

[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.060]
It's fine when people are acting crazy for a day or two days

[01:57:55.060 --> 01:58:01.940]
But this is a nightmare having two major holidays so close together that is correct three major holidays Hanika Christmas and New Year's

[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:02.580]
Oh brother

[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.560]
By the way, Jo Bel should be thankful you're on the station

[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:10.520]
You should start each day by kissing your ass and ended by nuzzling your taint. Oh taint what I got in mind

[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:15.200]
Whoa, what a thought that is joebel nuzzling my taint. Oh

[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.020]
Wow

[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:23.360]
Here's one that says I would imagine you have less online listeners today because less people are working

[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:28.140]
But more terrestrial listeners than usual because a lot more people are driving around by hello to a happy New Year

[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:31.180]
Audio people driving around with your windows up or down

[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:32.460]
right

[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:33.920]
Mm-hmm

[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:38.460]
498 and a pool wait we can do six hundred I don't know why you're so negative about it

[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:43.860]
I'll learn what if we get like about 5 25 30 by the top of the hour we could do it. Yep, put on a big push

[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:48.140]
We'll fall short, but it'll be fun. You can push the pool all right

[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:54.840]
For all those people to get aggravated all he talks about is the numbers on the pool. Yeah, well screw you and

[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:57.480]
Of course I always ask the question. Well, what do you got to talk about oh?

[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:01.780]
Well, I don't know but anything beside that anything beside that like what? Oh, I don't know anything beside that

[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:07.340]
Anything beside whatever you're talking about Neil. I wonder if they're still doing the year in review on the erasing channel

[01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:11.120]
I could put that on I should have put that on no they're doing a Tampa Bay down

[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:16.100]
Yeah, this was also to be gaining some ground at seven eight hundred mile and continue to show that front what

[01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:20.040]
Looks like a guy Chris Gattas looking for the early half of daily

[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:22.280]
Half the upper half of low-pads

[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:26.660]
Number seven and she spent a lot of time down under she looks like a guy she must be a

[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.740]
really macho dike

[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:35.480]
And let me ask is it unwritten law somewhere. I keep asking why why don't so many dikes were makeup like Rachel Maddo and Ellen

[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.480]
Why do they have to be like pasty?

[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.900]
They like is that the dyke EF in way I guess

[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:45.600]
Brandy a leading curl spring says thanks for keeping me company while through all the old crap out of my fridge

[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:50.840]

he is

[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.240]
not as chronic as that old guy though i love him

[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:09.560]

mark or something like that i've got his name is now mark

[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:16.500]
you always calls he tries to end with like a a funny one-liner

[02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:18.500]
which is not just kind of fall

[02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:21.360]
all right but i'm going to be a nice thing to make break

[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:24.000]
yeah we see that they are in the audiences and got the urge

[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.260]
maybe what joys and stereo and if you could

[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:32.960]
john says

[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:37.280]
is there such a thing as a feminine joys

[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:39.780]
i'm sure i doubted

[02:07:39.780 --> 02:07:42.960]
i doubted i think i think the one thing you can be sure of in this life

[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:44.840]
is that smith is smith

[02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:48.620]
no matter where comes from smith is smith

[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:51.120]
although i would imagine indian smith you know what that curry

[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:53.860]
uh... oh my god can you even begin to imagine

[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:56.960]
i don't want to think about it

[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:57.900]
and indian dump

[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.360]
i can say the cold times i've had curry recently

[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:04.520]
it was a uh...

[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:06.800]
an experience really afterwards yeah

[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:08.300]
oh my god

[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:10.360]
so i can imagine having it every day

[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:14.760]
curry it gets into your skin

[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:15.620]
yes it does

[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:18.520]
and it smells man oh my god

[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:21.800]
and then you start wearing your turban to tight and you start driving a cab

[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:22.340]
in toronto

[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:24.460]
punjab

[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:26.600]
anyway john and like were said

[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.980]
i'm going to tell you something if we ever have an opening

[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:31.660]
for a middle east

[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:34.060]
libanese guy who don't speak the best english

[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:37.100]
my cab driver he is the funniest person in the world

[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:38.800]
seven and a panicked what

[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:40.260]
seven p.m. ten p.m. coming up soon

[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:46.640]
what are you talking about you said if we ever have an opening oh seven and

[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:47.240]
ten p.m.

[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.180]
yeah i guess eight ten after dolphins

[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.540]
once d.a. finds a real gig

[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:55.480]
so in other words they're pushing d.a. out is that what you're trying to tell me

[02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:56.540]
from what it seems like

[02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:59.080]
you're showing a man five seven in the morning so i said good up real early

[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.500]
they're paying them like twenty five bucks an hour

[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:04.200]
and as opposed to just saying hey we wish you the best and good luck and it

[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:07.000]
didn't work out and you were on a night when nobody can hear the signal and

[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.960]
following dead air and etc and so on

[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:11.200]
he seems like a good guy George said he was a good guy

[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:14.680]
now i'm assuming the week after he won't be doing five to seven because

[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:17.680]
we have promos saying that uh...

[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:18.540]
that week is when

[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:20.620]
joe starts six to ten in the morning

[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:24.620]
so with bowl games basically over i guess i'll go back to his uh...

[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:26.300]
eight to ten or back to him city

[02:09:29.460 --> 02:09:29.820]
to

[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:33.180]
that George is there we could play will be her sitting and can the city from his

[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:36.220]
voluminous uh... file of music in there

[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:41.420]
going to can the city can the city outcome but we don't

[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:45.400]
and you know how to go in there and do it but you know how to go in there but i

[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:47.560]
think he changed his password

[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:49.100]
uh... good thinking George

[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:52.460]
don't let uh... this tubby go in there and mess around because that would be a

[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:55.320]
a parting shot you know i've been out of the wrong but i think when they

[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.420]
uh... they just a joke

[02:09:56.420 --> 02:10:00.080]
i'm thinking about it and i think it's a fact people tend to be so uptight

[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:03.500]
well you know i think when they give a new computer to run the audio vault

[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:05.120]
and everything like that he then changed his

[02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:08.360]
computer against it like everybody did that good for him good good thinking

[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:08.760]

although he's still at home right correct he doesn't show to show from the house

[02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:52.310]
kind of a lazy bastard does that besides me and rush and the big oh and paul harvey

[02:14:54.170 --> 02:14:58.110]
i think everybody ought to do the show from the house then they could just shut down the studio

[02:14:58.690 --> 02:15:01.430]
can you imagine all the money they'd say they could sell the equipment

[02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:08.750]
well you still need the producers here no no producers automated baby

[02:15:10.070 --> 02:15:15.890]
automated have like a robot sit there that hits the button for in fact we could you know something

[02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:20.130]
if there was somebody there to load up the audio vault of the start of the show and we assumed

[02:15:20.130 --> 02:15:24.230]
it was going to work which it doesn't always do but if it did there could be a button here and I

[02:15:24.230 --> 02:15:27.710]
compressed the button instead of the cue the cue would automatically trigger the spots

[02:15:30.370 --> 02:15:34.850]
well i think that's what they were that's what they're looking for me yeah that's what they're

[02:15:34.850 --> 02:15:46.590]
looking for automate it all in fact they could even automate me just put it on tape bap bap bap bap bap bap

[02:15:46.590 --> 02:15:52.830]
well that guy is just unbelievable he is what's wrong with south florida that guy plus a lot of these

[02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:58.870]
e-mailers you don't even you don't even realize how much e-mail never gets on the air but you can imagine

[02:15:58.870 --> 02:16:06.030]
i mean just a let's see here's one that says Neil i'm Cuban i've been lived in florida since i was five

[02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:10.610]
this however doesn't stop me from being objective about south florida situation the area has

[02:16:10.610 --> 02:16:16.050]
been complete destroyed by the high volume of immigrants who come in and out they've absolutely no

[02:16:16.050 --> 02:16:19.890]
emotional connection to my army so they come here and destroy it it seconds me to see my own kind

[02:16:19.890 --> 02:16:25.510]
do this but it's the truth any area with high population of immigrants never manages to grow well that's

[02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:30.490]
not the case here we got people from all over the world here we got five million people in the GTA

[02:16:31.770 --> 02:16:37.510]
as in how's it going a and this area grows and grows and they keep building condos every inch of land

[02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:41.370]
they keep building and building although now nobody's got any money so they're not building so much

[02:16:41.930 --> 02:16:47.930]
the ruskies don't get any more money it says any area with a high population of immigrants never

[02:16:47.930 --> 02:16:52.650]
manages to grow that's a fact based on many government studies oh like New York for example with a

[02:16:52.650 --> 02:16:57.250]
high population of immigrants whoever wrote this is just a until the amount of immigration is limited

[02:16:57.250 --> 02:17:02.690]
or stop south florida will never be anything other than a dump that people use and exploit how do you

[02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:10.590]
like that total totally phoning right probably the guy to call before bitching about the

[02:17:10.590 --> 02:17:17.050]

[02:17:37.670 --> 02:17:41.010]
look at all the problems the brits have caused over the years all that imperialistic attitude

[02:17:41.010 --> 02:17:44.970]

[02:18:49.550 --> 02:18:56.790]

[02:19:00.890 --> 02:19:07.810]
an hour boy they they oh what's going on it's a holiday season the screwing and re screwing

[02:19:07.810 --> 02:19:12.790]
and the undoing and just oh my god what they're doing to people what can we do to you to make

[02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:17.210]
to make you miserable enough to leave then that's basically the way they operate and I think the

[02:19:17.210 --> 02:19:21.170]
reason being that otherwise they have to pay people unemployment right they fire I guess yeah

[02:19:21.870 --> 02:19:26.270]
so instead of firing people and paying them unemployment oh well what can we do can we put a

[02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:33.650]
poison snake in your shoe well would that do it can we put like 7000 crazed red ants on your arm

[02:19:33.650 --> 02:19:38.490]
and maybe that'll convince you we don't like you can go away you know never get bitten by red ants

[02:19:38.490 --> 02:19:45.270]
yes of course now there's a god why do we have red ants what purpose do they serve to kill other

[02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:51.730]
pests I don't know you are so full of crap if there is a god why did I just do a nasty

[02:19:51.730 --> 02:19:58.030]
joystering a break huh to cleanse out to cleanse out what what you had earlier

[02:19:59.350 --> 02:20:02.910]
what did I have I didn't have squad I squatted though I'll tell you that

[02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:10.090]
and I and I see I have this strange habit I shouldn't admit this but what I like to do

[02:20:11.730 --> 02:20:17.230]
is take because the toilet paper out in the the roar what do you call that thing

[02:20:18.610 --> 02:20:24.210]
the the holder yeah the whole thing or anything not the paper doesn't come always come out evenly

[02:20:24.210 --> 02:20:28.670]
and it drips off you know so I'll take an extra roll and I'll put it like on the bathtub that's next

[02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:35.770]
to the crap and and so I can like unfold the toilet paper real easy you ever hear that before

[02:20:36.610 --> 02:20:41.410]
no on the edge of the tub well anyway so I was down to the last the ass end so the speak of the

[02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:47.530]
and the the cardboard entered the little cardboard thing that holds the roll fell on the floor

[02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:54.190]
and I I reached for it as I was sitting there I was all I'll done with all my business I reached

[02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:58.210]
for it and like almost fell off the throne and I thought gee if I fall and like break my neck

[02:20:58.210 --> 02:21:01.830]
right now poor fatso is going to be sitting there wondering what will happen that would have

[02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:06.790]
been interesting well let me go back and try it again I'll pretend that that happens no that's

[02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:10.430]
okay we tell too although I got a new roll sitting there so I could I would have to use an awful

[02:21:10.430 --> 02:21:14.530]
lot to get down to that little corn cob or whatever there is on the inside a little little

[02:21:14.530 --> 02:21:18.890]
cardboard thing yeah you think there's a name for that there's a name for everything so probably

[02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:24.650]
