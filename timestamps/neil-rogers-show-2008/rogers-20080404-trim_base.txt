[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580]
Your darker than ground, then your vocal and your mouth round back

[00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.880]
Makes it more upon those raining clouds in bands

[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.500]
Will it hold a pattern, or when you go like it's rigged for bush too

[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.460]
Within a last-nightest time, don't let the ashes

[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.200]
The opans grew as a man

[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.300]
Calm down!

[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.100]
Chaudine bite!

[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.520]
Posit,せかった!

[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.540]
Our wheels and legs還有 four vehicles

[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.940]
The 7th division just passed out

[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.440]
Do you feel ready to eat your meal?

[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.800]
No!

[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.780]
Don't forget about your boy, BA

[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.280]
What is your boy?

[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.340]
Mine is Black

[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.200]
Yeflaul

[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.620]
Don't you know how my F楽 is like?

[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.680]
It looks very similar to Budapest

[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.720]
So what's not to like he's a broadcaster? Yes, he is which for us is a little out of our league

[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.140]
Okay, let's see nighttime sediment night persons 2554

[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.280]
I don't see I asked anywhere look at that of course there's a lot of other crap in there too don't forget

[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.160]
We got that dolphin tune out two hours

[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.760]
And we got that high school crap

[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.260]
I just keep looking here and looking I don't see it okay. I am there. It is on the 85 page a point from a point eight to a point nine

[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.720]
We're doing it. That a boy

[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.720]
Time for 27th and 2554 so you don't I think it's like a one eight

[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.420]
Now let's see a man maybe man sediment I mean 18 plus you think is looking a little bit stronger hope seven in the night

[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.480]
What do you think? I'm looking at it right now you don't know I say you're audio mom be man

[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.200]
No speaking English all them old Julios are listening to the radio and I think they're glue to it

[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.080]
Fidelis dead Fidelis dead

[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.440]
Bapabapapa like that, you know wax. He's got a 3 one at night time for 11

[00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.420]
Scar America's 17th with a two five word House Q a.m. Oh, 1 6 down to a 1 4 in men and nights 7 in the midnight

[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.540]
Many 18 plus that's about where we usually are 1 4 1 6 1 4 not

[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.560]
Not in the ballpark but you keep playing away the 8. You're okay in our book plus. He's all over the place anyway. Yep

[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.860]
Probably the reason that's going up a little bit is the fact that he was doing a jury duty remember that

[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.220]
Like for like two months. What are you eating now? Um, I'm eating howies

[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.640]
You're eating howie? Yeah

[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.420]
And we got to hear about it on the ear that you're eating howie

[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.560]
He let you like that howie 81% in Pulse say the nation has headed in the wrong track to lose like tracks baby

[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.600]
American's are more to satisfy with the country's direction than at any time since New York time

[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.220]
CVS news pole began asking about the subject in the early 1990s according to latest poll

[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.320]
In the poll 81% of respondents said they believe things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track up from

[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.800]
69% year ago and 35% early 2002

[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.880]
Although the public mood's been darkening

[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.320]
Since the early days of the war in Iraq. It's taken a new turn for the worst in the last few months as the economy has seen

[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.240]
The slip into recession. Thank you mr. President for the war and the gas prices in the recession and the dead people and all of these

[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.300]
things

[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.860]
There's now nearly a national consensus that the country faces significant problems as well. That's pretty profana

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.740]
Like us here at WQM we face significant problems

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.440]
multi-problemy

[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.340]
A majority of nearly every demographic and political group Democrats and Republicans men and women residents of cities and rural areas

[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.480]
College graduates and those who only finished high school

[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.480]
Say the US is headed in the wrong direction 78% of respondents said the country was worse off than five years ago

[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.660]
Just four percent said it was better off

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.820]
They're real smart

[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.020]
The dissatisfaction especially striking because public opinion usually hits its low point only in the months and years after an economic turn down

[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.160]
Not at the beginning of one

[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.000]
Today, however, Americans report being deeply worried about the country even though many say their own personal finances are still in fairly good shape

[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.460]
That's because they don't have 400 dependence like I do

[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.020]
Only 21% of respondents said the overall economy was in good condition

[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.100]
The lowest sets number since late 92 when the recession that began in the summer of 90s

[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.880]
Already been over for more than a year and the latest pull two out of three people said they believe the economy is in recession today now

[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.280]
right now, baby

[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.000]
this second

[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.160]
The unhappiness presents clear risk for Republicans in this year's elections given the continued unpopularity of President Bush

[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.380]
28% of respondents said they approved of the job. He was doing 28% of another that barely changed since last summer

[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.420]
But Democrats who control the housing Senate since last year also faced a risk that unhappy voters will punish congressional incumbents

[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.900]
Mr. Bush and leaders of both parties on Capitol Hill have moved in recent weeks to react to the economic slowdown first by passing that

[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.600]
stimulus fiddle that'll send checks up to 12 of our bucks to many couples this spring

[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.800]
They're now negotiating over proposals to overhaul financial regulations

[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.840]
The poll found that Americans blame government officials for the crisis more than banks or home buyers and other borrowers

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.060]
40% of respondents said regulators are mostly to blame while 28% named lenders and 14% named borrowers

[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.560]
Now assessing possible responses to the mortgage crisis Americans displayed a populist streak

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.720]
favoring health for individuals, but not for financial institutions a clear majority said they didn't want the government to lend

[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.380]
I hand the banks even if the measures would help limit the depth of a recession

[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.160]
It won't be bail out the banks bail us out okay bail us out don't bail out the damn banks

[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.640]
All your big your rich friends okay you crooks you thieves you gypsies you bastards man

[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.980]
You lunatics now that's why I was saying something about lunatic. That's when they chopped me off the air before

[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.720]
Not again no

[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.260]
Not yet. Don't do that. I'm waiting for it though

[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.560]
Yeah, oh yeah, it'll happen any second out

[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.020]
This seems to be like a new feature on the show. Let's see how much dead air we can give every day on the show

[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.220]
I'm fixing the problem here with that power supply and I think it'll probably we'll probably fake our way through today

[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.060]
And even if we don't I know how to solve it. I can just plug the stuff that's plugged in there right in the wall

[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.520]
Okay, okay, what it doesn't need to be in the power supplies only there if the power goes out here. Don't you understand? Yeah

[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.400]
It's like a backup deal

[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.720]
And the power's gone out twice in seven years and one of them was that great northeastern blackout when it was out like all day

[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.720]
I

[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.060]
Maybe two or three times because there was one time I was on the phone remember that probably not I do

[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.380]
But when you when you called in did the show from the phone? I remember that yeah

[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.980]
That's what I was doing before when we finally came back when they stepped screwing around in the control room there and and knocking me off the air

[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.560]
These are engineers. This is a radio station. These people are engineers. They have some kind of a broadcast license

[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:56.200]
And my friend Eric up there in Orlando had he has to take care of this thing with the powers of flying walk me through this and even he emailed me where to order it

[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.960]
I wish I did online right here in Toronto and we'll be here today or Monday

[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.200]
Eric did that not the engineer is not anybody connected with QIM

[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.960]
What's wrong with that picture do you see something wrong with it? Um, yeah, I could you know

[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.820]
Is something consistent pattern there a little bit

[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.480]
God the things that really count these people are oh gee he's complaining again

[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.540]
Yeah, oh my god the things that we demand on this show the demands are so just awesome, yeah

[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.860]
Like keep the thing on the air would be good. That would be good for starters

[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.680]
And no jolly Joe I'm not coming back to do my show down there. Okay now was he really serious about that or not?

[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:47.260]
Yeah, I think so because he heard me say joking about that because I had a pretty good weekend down there like we can take you so seriously

[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.080]
Yeah

[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.100]
847 votes on Christmas pull

[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.740]
You should be fairly pleased about that. I think I might change it now

[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:04.400]
Right now yeah right now right now right now right what which word did you understand right F and now what's up with that?

[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.540]
I don't like it

[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.100]
It's too, you know, it's I don't know

[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.180]
It's too hard to read first of all it's got two damn many names and movies and numbers and

[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:24.060]
By the time I get through reading to pull to be two o'clock already. That's bad. It's time for the jerk show. No, that's not bad

[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.240]
Well one handed isn't the other side. It's not I'm I'm getting rid of it

[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.980]
Okay, especially since Eric stuff the new one already up there to load. This is a good one from a shawner. I passed it by yesterday

[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.100]
If I had the time I would learn blank

[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.820]
Another language sign language. He puts sign language under the pacified George

[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.180]
I don't understand that whole thing with George and sign language you can tell me what that's all about

[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.900]
Another way he'll check

[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.040]
No, no seriously. Well, is that what that's all about? I think that's what it's all about. He's picking up deaf chicks

[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.540]
I can understand him pick up blind chicks that I can understand

[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.080]
Easily but deaf

[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.720]
Dief I don't get it

[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.760]
I mean when you're broadcasting on a radio it seems to me that talking about deaf stuff is probably I don't know

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.440]
It just makes no sense to me. But what do I know? What do I know about anything?

[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.100]
I'm voting for

[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.720]
Another language

[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.100]
A lot of good choices on here

[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.360]
I'm casting my vote as we speak

[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.360]
If I had the time I would learn here the choices another language sign language to play an instrument

[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:38.540]
Carpentery scuba diving to play golf to play crafts more about investing to do my own taxes to sing

[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.560]

[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.480]
I'm a very marginal poll. We apologize profusely for it. I will never do it again

[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.360]
Chris apologize as you can do better than that. I apologize just like even the chic knew that

[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.700]
We'll never do it again until two months from now

[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.660]
We're never gonna do that poll again if we do I'm leaving

[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.180]

Pineal you into better net

Yeah, this is some of the crap that they put on here and that was an iod that was Steve Nichol the chic

Oh, he's neil without the droppings. He's neil. Yeah, he was neil. Uh-huh. Do I sound just like that?

[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.700]
At any rate I think he was a gay like you maybe

[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.660]
No

[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.600]
No, that you're confusing him with juicy. Oh no

[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.580]
Jersey drew Michaels that queen

Oh, there's Prince Philip looking old and almost dead on TV. He's in a hospital, baby. Maybe he'll cross

Important to remember miserable Nazi bastard

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.140]
Remember that in the exorcist? Yes

[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:36.260]
Now who the hell was that was that the somebody from the film crew was that the producer? I'm right there whatever he was

[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.480]

I was good then he got his though a lot of people got theirs net movie

[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.780]
A little notice remark in the press is generating heat for John McCain's presidential campaign

[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:58.360]
He keeps delaying when his medical records are going to be released leading some people to question what's he hiding

[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.680]
As is the headline on the liberal blog the Huffington Post

[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:07.640]
On Wednesday McCain's campaign told CNN that the Arizona Senators medical file will be produced May 15

[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:13.780]
Trouble as they previously said they released April 15 and they refused to turn the records over to New York Times on at least three occasions

[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.520]
Mr

[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.340]
McCain has yet to make his full medical records or its positions available to reporters the times veteran medical correspondent dr

[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.000]
Lawrence Altman wrote in March at least three times since March of last year

[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.540]
Campaign officials will tell New York Times that they'd provide the detailed information about his current state health

[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.720]
But they haven't done so

[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.820]
Ah the campaign houses are expressed to release the information in April even say what year though

[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.380]
The CNN report was featured in a blog post on their political ticker Wednesday was not picked up by news agencies

[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:47.920]
Reven the subject of the CNN report the carpet bagger blog however caught the CNN blog post and raised a storm about it

[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.640]
The Times report was the standard line and early March McCain said down for an interview with Scott Pelley on 60 minutes

[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:59.480]
Was asked about his health. He said it's excellent three times. He said that and said his campaign would be doing the medical records thing soon

[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.240]
Carpet bagger Steve Benin wrote Pelley followed up. There's been some criticism that you haven't released your medical records

[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.800]
You're saying in this interview that you're about to do that McCain replied. Oh, yeah, we'll do it in the next month or so. Yeah

[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:10.760]
Yeah

[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.760]
For candidate wise nothing to hide. He's acting like he's got something to hide. He continued later

[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.260]
Steve Benin and given that McCain is ready to be the oldest president of our elected as history of medical problems including melanoma

[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.940]
This is a little unsettling if McCain had history of secrecy. It'd be easier just to talk this up to a character flaw

[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.820]
But his previous disposers actually make the problem worse

[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.720]
He was an open book during his first campaign now can't even explain the delays in releasing his records as I said Steve Benin

[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:45.460]
Confuded there's probably nothing to this but the campaign's conduct on the issue raises questions. Don't it and it do it do

[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:53.340]
Maybe what he's really trying to say is I'm dying on the air like that. I heard Joe say that this morning a little dog said that

[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.700]
Well, he didn't say that he said

[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.880]
I said that

[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.040]
But that's okay. I mean at least we work on the same station as supposed to run an ancient Paul which

[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.500]
Brandon your close personal friend by the way points out that they got 80 million billboards running Paul

[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.180]
Yeah, they really do man. It's it's unbelievable. Yeah, it's called cuz clear channel owns the damn billboards

[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.020]
Don't you understand

[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.980]
But they they got to have like 20 for Paul and Ron

[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.320]
He said that there's two of them almost like right next to each other. They're off. They're everywhere

[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:28.000]
Well, there's my good friend Susan candy Otty and further charges involved one of the only people we like on CNN

[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.300]
I hope she's out of the building when God smites them remember he tried couple weeks ago

[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.940]
I'm running the attorney to win Atlanta

[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:40.700]
And the roof was caving in and CNN god, you know, sometimes he's got bad name. I always tell you that it's true

[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:47.320]
Well, I'm telling I get running nose must be it. It's either my allergies to those ratings that came out or it's the

[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.580]
springtime thing, you know

[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.720]
Let me pull my nose here. Oh, don't hurt yourself

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.280]
Oh my god, there it is

[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.140]
So much better clear it out man clear it out

[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.680]
When it doubt air it out

[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.620]
We got 59 votes on the new poll but I don't want to read the numbers because then I can't get all been out

[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.500]
I think we'll take some calls today too Chris

[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.960]
Okay, not that was a joke. You want to punch one up? Have you got any no?

[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.340]
No, oh, they wouldn't be calling cuz we haven't taken one one's last time we took a call in the show

[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.360]
I can't take any here. Oh, you never know they come on good today

[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.320]
It's Friday you you're voting for calls today. Let's let's take a call

[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.860]
56705 60 pound five 60 under Verizon singular wireless line. Let's put a call or two on a year. We'll see how they go

[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.340]
If they're really great, we might take them all day. You never know. That's what I'm saying

[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.280]
How about those marlins they didn't play us today, right? No

[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:49.100]
They didn't lose again after that 13-something shall lacking the night point now is this a series at home this weekend or what?

[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.340]
I believe so because they're having brought Michael's here

[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.900]
They're having what that's right. Don't you listen to the commercials that run? No, oh

[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.160]
Brett Michaels come on down to see some rock-a-love

[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:06.240]
What what are you talking about? I don't think he knows what that is. I have no idea who that is Brett Michael

[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.100]
He's the server that poison I believe oh, yeah, I remember poison. Well, he's gonna be here

[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.900]
He's gonna be at Marlin stadium like the way most people feel about tomorrow

[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.820]
And they hate him like poison so anyway, they didn't lose last night. That's good

[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:25.040]
And we got that first pitch with Jesse Aggra the Marlon pregame report for 10 minutes of tonight again at 650 with five minutes of spots in there

[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.040]
We're no dummies. We got lots of spots

[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.700]
Now what we just say before that about to cause you got any yeah, well punch one up

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.180]
Qion

[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.840]
If you got the pot open. Yeah, pop it on Josh. That's very hot. I hit the button. Oh my god. I did

[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.120]
Nothing nothing's going down. That was the only one you had one call. No, there's a couple of here. Well, no, I have a trap puncher one

[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.500]
I'll put just hit next buddy. No two way him. Hello

[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.500]
It's dead. There's nothing coming through the phone pod. I got no calls on my thing

[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.860]
Well, I'm punch wound up unless you're a dial tone just to make sure that they work

[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.080]
Yeah, this isn't what I've got to be reset. I guess

[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.400]
Oh

[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.820]
Well we tried

[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.500]
Yeah, hey come on in here engineers

[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.720]
We'll need some more fixing in this room

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.860]
I think we might have lost him. Why'd he kill himself? No, you didn't lose me. I'm broke. I just got my head down counter

[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.000]
It'll be okay

[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.020]
You guys are by the way you talk to me like I'm not doing something right here because I punch up a call

[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.880]
I don't even know who's sitting where okay

[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.500]
Well, and do I hear who is not doing what all I know is we can't even hear the dial tone

[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.820]
So obviously nothing coming through the phone that that is absolutely correct. Right. I mean anybody's done this more than five minutes

[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.860]
Knows how that works

[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.360]
I can't punch him up here because I'm not gonna push you around with that router again. I don't want to lose my internet

[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.060]
But that's got nothing to do with down there, right? Right

[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.820]
So what happens when you punch one up? What are you seeing?

[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:06.700]
Nothing

[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.400]
What does that mean nothing happens? There's an error on the screen

[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:13.800]
Error

[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.260]
Yes

[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:24.820]
For the love of God can I can I read you this fast because this guy sent it like six times? Go ahead my queen with extensive research

[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.540]
I believe you are absolutely correct sir that is Clementsa. Please accept my apology

[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.580]
Your lover oh finally that jackass that was fax me yesterday

[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:39.120]
He's right fine because I ripped him and asked because he didn't read he didn't apologize for Tommy was

[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.320]
Tessio please stop sending the facts. Yeah, stop sending the facts. Okay. We're getting tired of that

[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.080]
We're getting tired of the engineering to they suck

[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.460]
Nothing looks

[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.420]
The

[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.380]
New Roger

[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.520]
The force lead

[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.820]
The last year brackets for hoops hysteria online at wqam.com

[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.220]
Make your picks for the bio

[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.440]
Hoops hysteria long on and play a presentation of sports radio

[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.300]
Now it's your time to get ready

[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.940]
You might as well

[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.700]
Yeah crappy signal

[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.080]
Into out of space

[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.740]
I knew that you missed me

[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.460]
This can tank the rest of you

[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.880]
I knew that you missed me

[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.080]
Oh

[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.760]
I'm trying to do the backup for the noise over here

[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.640]
Lemon 18 and 560 wq. I must take your collar to what are you saying? I did you reset it? Did you reboot it?

[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.540]
Uh, we haven't done yet because we're not sure how to reboot her on that side and though we can't find an engineer right now

[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.040]
It

[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:35.240]
Yeah, okay. Well, I guess maybe that was the Lord's promise. It wasn't such a good idea to try to take any calls.

[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:42.480]
Who ever heard of such a thing? Who in their life ever heard of a place like this?

[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.920]
Engineering eight us. They're busy if they would. I'm not going to go in with.

[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.520]
Come and just slow down and relax. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. Okay.

[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.360]
And of course, their response would probably be, well, he doesn't take calls anyway.

[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.340]
So why should we do any maintenance on the phone system in there?

[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:06.720]
They don't put any calls on here, but like that, you know. Am I right? Yes.

[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:15.060]
Probably they should have had the engineer up here coming here and and we, you know, hook up the thing again to the router.

[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:24.780]
So that I could punch the calls up here. I bet it would work then. Although, you know, something it probably wouldn't work then because if they're coming from, see, they're coming from your phone system down there.

[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:32.460]
You follow what I'm saying? What do you say? Via the internet. So in other words, if they're not working in your studio, they sure as hell wouldn't work here.

[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.040]
Nope. So it's just as well. I didn't worry about trying to read a little with all that stuff.

[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:43.420]
Very jackass has a, and I'm usually useless calm today, but he does have a couple of interesting things. Really?

[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:49.400]
AT&T last week stopped airing ads featuring comedian John Cap, Capa Rona, Caponera.

[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.860]
Impersonating the seat comes in answer. Harry Curie, because they upset his widow, Duchy, according to the Chicago sometime. In fact, I'm sure he's the guy that does all these.

[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:06.700]
Hey, enough with the panthers already. When the hell was the baseball season begin anyway?

[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:16.120]
Yeah, when we did our shows in Chicago there on IOD a few times, I met that guy. Also met Harry, of course, came in two, but not at the same time because Harry hated that guy.

[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:24.160]
That was the Harry Curie impersonator. Anyway, the ads were done poorly. Duchy told the paper after the first time I saw the commercial act at hardly sleep.

[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:30.560]
AT&T apologized during the stop running the spots. I'm Harry, by the way, still dead. Still drunk and still dead. Oh, God, what?

[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:40.740]
You don't have a sense of humor. Like, get over it. This is anything like John Madden doesn't like Frank Caleando's impression of them. You know what I mean? It's ridiculous.

[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:46.220]
Are you disinduching now? I'm, yeah. I'll give it the Dutch evidence.

[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:58.440]
Former WWE QM host and ex-big league are waiting here this time. But you're not familiar with the big news because it's on a station and nobody knows it's on the dial. Is this about the crow? Oh, you already know? No, I don't. But you said former QM or big leagueer.

[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:15.180]
You, but M and M, but Troll, but the me that blah, okay? Former QM host and ex-big leagueer Warren, chromates resurfaced with a top show 1130 AM weekends on WFTL 640. Oh, my God. Not to be confused with WFTL 1400 or WFTL 850. Oh, my God. Wow.

[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:23.140]
How about you, but M and me, but Troll, but the me that blah, okay? Okay, but, but scenario.

[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:33.360]
You're in the locker room and pump pump. Some of the really brilliant stuff from Barry Jack asked this more. That's it. That's it. No, well.

[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:41.600]
Nothing else that even even on the borderline of being interesting. You're set to the most devoted sports nerds that people are running around going like that.

[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:53.260]
Like that. It is most pathetic, most sad. Almost as sad as that last, uh, Leaf home game last night that Ottawa 8 to 2, Ottawa wins last night. Well, they were desperate.

[00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:00.800]
You know what I'm saying? I'm sure you were watching every second of it. Oh, totally not. Why not?

[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:07.440]
Because I thought you're a big hockey fan. I don't have that package thing. Oh, here comes the one. What's racist this?

[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:15.180]
Full field of 10 on the gate for the eight from wood by an eight race of wood by and last night. What? This is part of my performance.

[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:24.360]
I'm facing fastest away from down the center speed McQueen speed McQueen makes early speed for Mark McDonald and just clear by two likes the inside.

[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:36.760]
I tell less. She want to think about thoroughbred racing. I know that neither one of you care about this and I've screamed about it for years is that instead of the owners having silks having colors, the jockeys ought to have their own colors like the drivers doing harness racing.

[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:44.740]
So there's some familiarity. You know instantly, for example, like second of the ass there is a Randy Wapels and Mark McDonald is leading the race. I have because you can see the colors.

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:51.480]
You know what I'm saying? Of the drivers. Each driver's got his own colors. Yeah. Sure. Like Joe Mars Jr. with a gray and a polka dots.

[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:58.620]
But the jockeys they were the colors of the owner so they have to keep changing outfits every race.

[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:05.600]
And you have no idea who the hell is who and who's on first all that. That's just still my thoughts. But what do I know?

[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:16.100]
What do I know? Former Democratic presidential candidate John Edward said yesterday he will not accept the nomination for your vice president as he did four years ago.

[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:24.140]
Well he was really strong four years ago for John Kerry not. Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina,

[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:32.160]
I'm dropped out of the 2008 race that is still being contested by Barack and Swilery. Edwards was picked as running mate with Democratic presidential nominee,

[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:40.360]
John Kerry in 2004, but the two and this is Reuters. This is very very profound. The two were defeated when George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were reelected.

[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.160]
Wow. This is like it's written for kindergarten kids. Do you know what I mean?

[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:55.900]
Yeah. After his keynote speech at CTIA, the annual U.S. wireless industry showcase, Edwards was asked in a question and answer session if he would accept the nomination for VP.

[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.660]
No said Edwards was also declined to say whether we endorse Clinton or Obama. He's a mum. He ain't saying nothing.

[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:09.540]
And you know something, unless he says the better because he is strictly vanilla. He's like tapioca pudding, very bland, like vanilla ice cream, bland.

[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.420]
So tell me about that meatloaf yesterday from Lucille's. Cortus said it was really good. It was really good.

[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.480]
I didn't even need to use the gravy. I just housed it with a little sweet sauce they had on it.

[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.720]
I'm not going to ask that because he was planning on going there last night to see how it was.

[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:35.800]
He was going there last night for freebie. Is that what he was doing? Well, you know, he got Georgia certificates. So he was going to head on down there and see how the place was.

[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.460]
Like I said, he was going there for freebie last night. There's nothing wrong with that. That's what this business is all about.

[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:47.520]
That's what he could hit a week of head. Now let me ask you where I guess we're going to Schmidt-Can that whole idea about taking any calls because the engineers aren't going to show up.

[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.220]
Well, isn't just just wait a couple hours until they fix the phone and then we'll take a call.

[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.340]
Oh, in other words, you really believe that they're going to come in there and fix the phone.

[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.640]
I just have this straight feeling. I'm sure all that's going to be doing is reset.

[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.620]
You tell me that you can't do that. We're not sure how to reset it.

[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.960]
You're really like, you know, Georgia's here and he recessed something over there and then bam, bam, bam. It's up again.

[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.460]
Yeah. Well, we don't know what that is that he resets over there.

[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:20.860]
Come on engineers. Come on in here. We didn't have somebody here asking about it. Who's that? Clarence.

[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:30.280]
Asking about it after what we needed. Yeah. And what did you tell him? Did you tell me we needed a freaking engineer instead of having all the control.

[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.420]
I'm knocking me off the air every few minutes. Maybe they were in the control room. We would have had an engineer.

[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.840]
So they're not in there when I went to look for them. Yeah. Well, maybe after that exhaustive job they did it in a control room.

[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.340]
They're on maybe a two or three hour lunch break.

[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.120]
What's the price?

[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.380]
You're the biggest name. The best talent.

[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.700]
You know, his new projects.

[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.060]
Sportage of 5.60 QAM.

[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.760]
The sports league.

[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.620]
A big shopping spree.

[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.160]
Spins.

[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.720]
A lot of people are in dire.

[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.180]
And now they're a bit.

[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.520]
R-E-B-A-G-E.

[00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.920]
Pump up their economy.

[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.900]
R-E-B-A-G-E.

[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.900]
Go by past B-T-V.

[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.880]
R-E-B-A-G-E.

[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:08.680]
A little rebate.

[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.220]
Yeah. People.

[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.940]
You're tax rebate.

[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.560]
Don't get tired.

[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.400]
Keep on home by and spend on it.

[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.880]
Just don't put it in the bank.

[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.760]
Keep on home by and spend on it.

[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.460]
11.30.205.60.

[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.040]
W-E-Q-M.

[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.200]
Nothing works, baby.

[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.360]
Everything is far blundered. Nothing works.

[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.140]
Yeah, and I want to try to find somebody and talk to Dero.

[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.880]
Not only they're not here, but they're not answering the phones either.

[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.500]
So, government there was like a mega problem.

[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.900]
Like we were off the air or something.

[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.540]
They're not answering the phones.

[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.160]
Nope.

[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.460]
The engineers, none of them are answering the phones.

[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.960]
Is that what you're telling me?

[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.100]
I guess there's like a private engineer meeting going on.

[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.520]
Yeah, in the T-room, no doubt.

[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.060]
Maybe they got that jerk from a Naples over there.

[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.700]
What else is his name? Bob...

[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.440]
Outside that amount, I can't even think of his name anymore.

[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.460]
You mean Bob DeMuth, who doesn't work for...

[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.280]
Does it work for... they's company anymore?

[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.660]
Oh, it hasn't worked for us no more?

[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.360]
Not for a while.

[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.000]
Well, nobody ever told me that good news.

[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:14.860]
Well, I'm telling you that.

[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.900]
Bob DeMuth is long gone.

[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.520]
Well, that's the best news I've heard in a long time.

[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.280]
What a jackass.

[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.940]
Came over there to Amsterdam and scoot everything all up.

[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.100]
And then he left the poor engineer over there holding the bag and got on a plane and ran away.

[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.220]
Did it... hell of a job there, Bob DeMuth.

[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.280]
So he's long gone. What happened with him?

[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.860]
He was removed from his position?

[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.040]
Can.

[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:40.880]
Yes.

[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.580]
Fire did it it it did it it did it did.

[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.300]
Wow.

[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.240]
Well, that's some pretty good news.

[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:46.760]
Yeah.

[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.740]
Well, there's even some more good news.

[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.600]
Bit by bit the walls are closing in on swillery.

[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.460]
By just about every measure including total votes, total delegates and money raised,

[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.440]
she's training Barack Obama and their pitch battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.

[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.700]
And the most important category where she's still ahead, super delegates.

[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.380]
Her lead is shrinking.

[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:07.660]
Oh my god.

[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.740]
It's shrinking, baby.

[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.780]
You ever see it shrink?

[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.660]
Thus far this week, three super delegates, party leaders and elected officials who can support

[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.800]
whomever they want at the August convention have broken for Senator Obama while Senator Clinton and Swillery

[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.380]
hasn't won any.

[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.720]
It is highly unlikely that Clinton can overtake Obama in the Pledge Delegate count, those

[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.500]
one in primaries and caucuses, but it's also impossible for Obama to secure the nomination

[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.680]
just on Pledge Delegates.

[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.500]
Thus the super delegates will decide the nomination.

[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.560]
Green that he spoke of would remain out of reach.

[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.820]
Thursday's stunning announcement that Obama to raise more than $40 million in March

[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.420]
with 218,000 new donors that month dealt another blow to Swillery.

[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.000]
Her campaign has released its own March figure yet.

[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.260]
I think it was about 20 million.

[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.240]
They say it last night.

[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.660]
So can Clinton actually still win the nomination?

[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.380]
It says this is by a Linda Feldman on the Christian Science Monitor.

[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.840]
In theory, yes, Able is safe, but she'd have to win just about every reigning contest

[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.100]
and then persuade enough super delegates that she's got a better chance that Obama beating John McCain.

[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.020]
The easiest way for that to happen would be for a bombshell revelation or major gant by Obama

[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.500]
that would cause delegates and voters as reflected in national polls to abandon him.

[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.900]
Short of that scenario, Clinton and her team are fast running out of options.

[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.040]
The walls are closing in.

[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.840]
I think the walls are closing in on us at QAM, too, if you ask me.

[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.060]
Do the engineers aren't answering their phones?

[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.920]
No, we got Steph in here.

[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.620]
And I think Steph's good because Steph isn't real engineer who usually cares about these things,

[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.180]
but I don't know.

[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.380]
I think they're starting to get in.

[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.980]
But they were in a meeting.

[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.220]
Yeah, a Power 96 meeting.

[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.880]
Power 96 meeting? Well, Hubsay and Dread, okay?

[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.620]
Power 96, my ass.

[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.200]
With all that swirled that they play.

[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.520]
She would pretty well have to run the table after winning Pennsylvania convincingly,

[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:56.100]
says Cal Jyllis and April political scientists at SMU.

[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.840]
So what's the story with the phone era?

[00:34:59.160 --> 00:34:59.680]
Do we know?

[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.100]
No, not yet.

[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.300]
No, not yet.

[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.120]
Convincingly means by double digits, he says,

[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.340]
and Clinton would have to pull off of set North Carolina where she's down by about 20 points.

[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.200]
Our ore gun were also abomas ahead.

[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.660]
Most people looking at the last 10 events are so see a bit of an edge for Clinton,

[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.420]
but with Obama having significant places to look for wins as well, Mr. Jyllis and ads.

[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.800]
For now though, the trend seems to be heading in Obama's direction,

[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.160]
even in Pennsylvania where Polshod Clinton would have lead in the mid to high teens

[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.320]
until very recently, the newest Quinnipiac Polshoser with a nine-point lead in Pennsylvania,

[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.980]
and the rest was in pull only five points ahead in Pennsylvania.

[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.380]
Her lead is shrinking.

[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:42.980]
Pennsylvania's demographics, large populations of working class, older and Roman Catholic voters

[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.860]
played a Clinton's advantage, but a wave of new registrations in the state could spell trouble for her.

[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.820]
As the Obama campaign has worked hard to identify new voters,

[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.620]
Pennsylvania is absolutely critical for her.

[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.120]
Absolutely.

[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.840]
Said Terry Madonna, head of the front van a martial college poll,

[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.460]
I think she wins here, but for the first time I'm thinking he could offset her.

[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.060]
It's a long shot, but it's possible.

[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.400]
It's possibly.

[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.000]
Wouldn't that be something?

[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.020]
Wouldn't that be a kick in the head?

[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.600]
You know what else would be a kick in the head?

[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.120]
What's that?

[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.880]
They'd be taking a call right now because I think we can.

[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.240]
Oh, QA and hello.

[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.340]
My phone went.

[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:14.320]
Yeah, great.

[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.140]
See, there you go.

[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:15.980]
You wanted to cause.

[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:17.700]
Holy crap.

[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.880]
It's about time.

[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:20.060]
Time for what?

[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.200]
The phone's probably working.

[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.580]
Yeah, well, we're a little slow.

[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.300]
What do you got, Palli?

[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.300]
Hey, Oged Neal, all the trends.

[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:33.360]
Can you do all more or less predict or get an idea of what the two to four is going to look like on the up?

[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.460]
No, you can't because it's a 10 to three and three to seven.

[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.760]
You have no idea what the hourly is.

[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.340]
Only when the boy now, what would you think?

[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.700]
What is the two to four going to reflect?

[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:43.580]
0.004.

[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.680]
That's going to be bad, Palli.

[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.200]
Okay, so you.

[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.680]
I guess you don't like that, you know, huh?

[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.060]
Maybe you don't like the heat.

[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.220]
Because if you don't like the heat or the NBA, you're sure it's not going to listen to you.

[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.600]
Unless, unless, uh, I don't know.

[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.240]
Unless you want to hear some of that great comedy.

[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:01.980]
Don't forget the.

[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.920]
Well, that's the heat.

[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.140]
Oh, yeah, that's the log, baby.

[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.360]
That's the stats.

[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.340]
That's the stats of the latest heat loss by 180 points.

[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.460]
All right, that's enough of that crap.

[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.760]
Okay, let's take a look at our poll.

[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.420]
That was refreshing.

[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.940]
We had a nut job there for a second and then we had like a real car who hates jerks.

[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.380]
Here's the poll.

[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.760]
If I had the time, I would do whatever I blank.

[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.860]
Learn another language, 46.

[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.420]
When it hands down, that's what I voted.

[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.800]
And of course some people are probably thinking, oh, let me go on to learn Spanish.

[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.820]
No, I don't.

[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.620]
Or even Italian.

[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.140]
No, I don't know what language you would be.

[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:41.880]
Maybe Swahili.

[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.540]
Maybe French language.

[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.100]
You know a little Italian dog.

[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.720]
Yeah, I know a little Italian.

[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.720]
Probably when Pocito did tell you.

[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.960]
You want more than a lingual.

[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.380]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:54.840]
What do you get it?

[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.260]
Crap.

[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.240]
Cut the crap.

[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.500]
Cut the crap.

[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.560]
You are, you know, you're just impossible lately.

[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.460]
And what got into him?

[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.800]
How do you think there was like a runaway worm got into his body?

[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.800]
Probably entered to the...

[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:07.860]
No.

[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.720]
To play instruments 17, more about investing 10.

[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.020]
Oh yeah, here comes the bunny and there goes your money.

[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.140]
More about investing my ass.

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.120]
Scuba diving 7, more about history 6.

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.620]
Don't know much about it.

[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.360]
I love that song.

[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.180]
Now Sam cooked it the original.

[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.440]
And then our car funco did it, right?

[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.020]
Sure, sure.

[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.780]
Wonderful world.

[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.400]
You don't know that song?

[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.400]
If I heard it, don't know much about history.

[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.280]
You don't know that song?

[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.040]
Oh, no, that's all, yeah.

[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.020]
Yeah, that's a song.

[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:38.300]
Wonderful world.

[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.880]
Sam cooked and then our car funco.

[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.860]
I know my crap, man.

[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.740]
It's good song.

[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.540]
Scuba diving 7.

[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.140]
More about history 6.

[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.260]
More about Jesus 4.

[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.200]
I want to know so much more about Jesus.

[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.760]
Hey Zeus, maybe that's what they're reading it as, hey Zeus.

[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.640]
To manage my anger for how to program my cell phone for,

[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.300]
to write a motorcycle for the Quran 3.

[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.980]
To drive a stick shift 3, Carpentry 3, Sign Language 3,

[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.520]
to a rollerblade 3, see the thing with the learning to drive a stick,

[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.740]
it's like if I had the time I'd learn how to buy a black and white TV.

[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.140]
Wait, what are you talking about?

[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:20.140]
To play crafts, to play golf, to sing or to do my own taxes out of 117.

[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.040]
I'm talking about driving a stick shift is the pass A.

[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.620]
It's either for guys who want to be like hot shots and show off,

[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.100]
or for people who want to live in a stone age.

[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.060]
They invented automatic transmission so that it would make driving much easier.

[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.440]
Oh, I know, I have it on a Mac.

[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.420]
I'm just saying like I know for like sports cars,

[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.860]
you kind of want a stick shift.

[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.720]
No, you definitely do.

[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.260]
I've had Corvettes for 20 years, you think I were on the stick,

[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.260]
or learn how to drive a stick.

[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.760]
You think I have any desire to learn?

[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.480]
Well, you know, you've won Corvettes for years,

[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.340]
but I don't see you being that guy that's like racing up and down the highway.

[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.720]
No, yeah.

[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:55.960]
Not.

[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.020]
Right, so I'm not irresponsible, not an overgrown child.

[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.320]
See, I don't buy cars to impress anybody else.

[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.600]
I don't buy cars, although I will say this,

[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.600]
and I've talked about it on the year, although not in a long time,

[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.520]
because I'm not there driving.

[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.600]
But back in the day, when some punk would pull up next to me

[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.560]
and his, you know, his Mustang GT,

[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.440]
and I'd be at the stoplight there,

[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.960]
I'd leave him in the dust every time.

[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.420]
Good, that's what you need to do.

[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:19.260]
That's right.

[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.240]
Put that punk in his place.

[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.580]
Not because I want to show off anybody,

[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.340]
but just because that punk thinks he's hot,

[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.340]
and he's drag racing me from the stoplight,

[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.200]
and I just leave him in the dust looking to rearview me or laugh my ass off,

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.280]
and think, what a punk, what a punk like that.

[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:30.860]
That's great.

[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.060]
Herman's, Herman's.

[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.400]
Also did that wonderful world.

[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:34.860]
That's correct.

[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.760]
Herman's vermin.

[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.820]
Peter Newton, they said he never showered in the smell-real battle.

[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.600]
Okay, so what biggest name?

[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.760]
The best talent.

[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.000]
He's now Roger.

[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.000]
He's a 430-year-old.

[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:45.940]
He's a 580-year-old.

[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:46.940]
What do you think?

[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.240]
He's a 480-year-old.

[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:48.480]

[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.900]
So that's your brackets for Hoops hysteria online.

[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.080]
Is WQA-F?

[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.940]
It's 60WQ on Happy Friday, too.

[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.420]
Well, we got our phone working out.

[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.360]
What more could you want, right?

[00:40:59.300 --> 00:40:59.700]
Sure.

[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.040]
And what was the pride again?

[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:01.840]
You're doing the same thing.

[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:02.480]
One more time.

[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.060]
One more time, but I'm just going to get up and walk out the door.

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.340]
This way, Phil George comes back on Monday.

[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.880]
I give him a rundown of the kind of behavior that you've been...

[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.860]
And of course, Cordis there.

[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.960]
He's sitting there probably writing a hostel emails to Brandon.

[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.640]
Oh, you know, that's it.

[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:17.680]
Skaving.

[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.940]
He hasn't even dignified you with any further response.

[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.180]
Maybe he's actually working to that.

[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.020]
That would be something.

[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.040]
Would that be something for some of these people to be working?

[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:25.640]
Yes.

[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.540]
So what was the deal with the...

[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.920]
It had to be reset to phone as well.

[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.400]
Yeah, you just reset it and that was it.

[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:31.580]

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.080]
Reset it and forget it.

[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.260]
Like Ron Popeel would say, right?

[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.380]
Reset it and forget it.

[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.940]
Oh, baby, back ribs.

[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.300]
Yeah, that pet guy does the announcing that I have one in commercial.

[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.520]
He just...

[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.680]
He sends me right to the bowl.

[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.240]
Baby, my ribs have like his lips are going to fall off.

[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.100]
Do you ever have that feeling like your lips are going to fall off?

[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:52.280]
Well, not lately.

[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:52.940]
No.

[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.040]
I've had that.

[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.100]
Paul Krugman writes in New York Times today, voodoo health economics.

[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.720]
Elizabeth Edwards has cancer.

[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.300]
John McCain's had cancer in the past.

[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.660]
Last weekend, Mrs. Edwards bluntly put it out.

[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.340]
That neither one of them would be able to get insurance under Mr. McCain's health care plan.

[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:15.820]
It's about time someone said that and more generally made the case that Mr. McCain's approach to health care is based on voodoo economics.

[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.560]
Not the supply side voodoo that claims that cutting taxes increases revenues,

[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.300]
though Mr. McCain says that too.

[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:27.480]
But the equally foolish claim refuted by all available evidence that the magic of the marketplace can produce cheap health care for everybody.

[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:34.880]
As Mrs. Edwards pointed out, the McCain health plan would do nothing to find insurance companies from denying coverage to those like her and Mr. McCain,

[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.740]
who have pre-existing medical conditions.

[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:44.700]
The McCain campaigns response was condescending and dismissive, a statement that Mrs. Edwards doesn't understand the comprehensive nature of the senator's approach,

[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:52.400]
which would harness the power of competition to produce greater coverage for Americans, reducing costs so that even people with pre-existing conditions could afford care.

[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.360]
This is nonsense on multiple levels.

[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.220]
For one thing, even if you buy the premise that competition would reduce health care cost,

[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:05.420]
the idea that could cut costs enough to make insurance affordable for Americans with a history of cancer or other major diseases is sheer fantasy.

[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.060]
Beyond that, there's no reason to believe in these alleged cost reductions.

[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:17.180]
Insurance companies do try to hold down medical losses. The industry's term for what happens when an insurer actually ends up having to honor its promises by paying a client's medical bills,

[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.940]
but they don't do this by promoting cost-effective medical care.

[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:25.540]
Instead, they hold on cost by only covering healthy people, screening out those who really need coverage the most,

[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.760]
which was exactly the point Mrs. Edwards was making.

[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.740]
They also deny as many claims as possible forcing doctors and hospitals to spend large sums fighting to get paid.

[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.160]
And the international evidence on health care cost is overwhelming.

[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:43.340]
The U.S. has the most privatized system of the most market competition, and it also has by far the highest health care cost in the world.

[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.260]
Yet the McCain health care plan, actually has set a bullet points on the campaign's website,

[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.020]
is entirely based on blind faith that competition among private insurers would solve all problems.

[00:43:53.640 --> 00:44:01.400]
I'd like to single out one of those bullet points in particular, the first substantive proposal Mr. McCain offers, the preceding entries are nothing but feel-good boilerplate.

[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:08.920]
As I mentioned in past comms, the veterans of the health administration is one of the few clear American success stories in the struggle to contain health care costs.

[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.260]
Since it was reformed during the Clinton years, the VA has used the fact that it's an integrated system,

[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:19.360]
a system that takes long-term responsibility for its client's health to deliver an impressive combination of high-quality care and low costs.

[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:24.420]
It's also taken lead of use of information technology, which has both saved money and reduced medical errors.

[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:31.860]
Sure enough Mr. McCain wants to privatize and in effect dismantle the VA, naturally this destructive agenda comes wrapped in the flag.

[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:40.860]
America's veterans have fought for our freedom to the McCain website, which should give them freedom to choose to carry their VA dollars to a provider that gives them the timely care at high quality and in the best location.

[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:47.040]
That's a recipe for having healthy veterans drop out of the system, undermining its integrated nature and draining away resources.

[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:57.740]
Mr. McCain then is offering a completely wrong-headed approach to health care, but the way the campaign for the Democratic nomination is unfolded raises questions about how effective his eventual opponent will be in making that point.

[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:06.640]
Indeed while Mrs. Edwards focused her criticism on McCain, she also made it clear that she prefers Hillary Clinton's approach, Senator Clinton's plan is a great plan to Barack Obama's.

[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.680]
The Clinton plan closely resembles the plan for universal coverage that John Edwards laid out more than a year ago.

[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:18.760]
By contrast Mr. Obama offers a water-down plan that falls short of universality and would have higher cost per person covered.

[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:26.220]
Worse yet Mr. Obama attacks his Democratic-wravels health plans using conservative talking points about choice and the evil of having the government tell you what to do.

[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:33.260]
That's going to make it hard if he is the nominee to refute Mr. McCain when he makes similar arguments on behalf of such things as privatizing veterans care.

[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:41.080]
Still have the health care ought to be a major issue in this campaign. I wonder if we will have time to discuss it after we deal with more important subjects like bowling and basketball.

[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:51.720]
You only got 30 or 5 pins in the 7 frames, you see that bowling and he chose him to bowling a bowl off. That's the kind of silly crap.

[00:45:51.720 --> 00:46:03.780]
All these people are dying because any hush to fill up your gas tank, nobody could afford health care. The economy is going to hell in a hand basket and we're worried about what is Obama good-bore and they're a better basketball player.

[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:09.400]
And as sort of we're going to have a bowl off, did you see her last night on the left? No, he did not. I don't want to.

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:15.040]
Do you think I would want to let know you're asking me that with a straight push? Well, I want you just to see what she said.

[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:22.500]
And one thing on there had me yelling at her on the TV. They were talking about what are they going to do about Michigan and Florida?

[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:32.140]
She's like, oh well, he had the chance to be on the Michigan ballot, but he took his name off. They all agreed to take their names off and she's going to go down.

[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:37.060]
And then as I knew it, just like in Florida, they all agreed not to campaign in Florida and she's the only one who showed up.

[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:45.580]
She went, oh well, he just decided not to, you know, be up. It's like no. You all had to be on the same side.

[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:52.980]
The DNC told them not to participate and that they wouldn't come. She's desperate. When you're desperate, you say into all kinds of things.

[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:58.440]
If you had sniper fire coming to you in Bosnium, you'd be saying all kinds of crap too.

[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:06.180]
You were running for the hills. If you were had to duck the sniper fire. Maybe that little girl was on the tarmac. Maybe she was shooting at her.

[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.400]
Oh, she had another little kid story too. I forget where it was, but she was somewhere and she was like walking.

[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.680]
And this little kid was like talking to her so she leaned out because she couldn't hear him. And he's like, you know, my mom is only making minimum wage and thank you for like helping to raise minimum wage.

[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:28.820]
But now they cut her hours and she's like, and it was so, it was so touching. And he's like, well, that's why I want to try and help your mom and everyone like her.

[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.880]
You know, try and help them out if I can become president. I'm thinking, shut up.

[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:41.420]
Here's Ray from Maroney Dodge who's a chronic chronic fracture, chronic, since this facts.

[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:47.020]
And then this, remember yesterday we had that our poll guy, Sean, in fact, I got it right here.

[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:54.320]
Give me a song to dance about slots or second order, your keynote is being the worst thing. He's giving me a song to dance about what games I should play with my money.

[00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:00.280]
And I love Sean and I appreciate all his polls. He's a good guy and he showed up at Gulf Stream and chased those two knuckleheads away.

[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:08.380]
But I really don't take well when people start telling me how to live my life and what to do. I just don't deal well with that kind of crap.

[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:17.920]
I like that Jack has David on the Myspace thing. I blocked his ass. I got so sick and tired of that. All these condescending A-holes, man, who don't even know me, that's the best part.

[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.380]
So here's what Ray says today. Why not become a snowboard and have the best of both worlds?

[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:28.120]
During the Cold Canadian winter, live and do the show from Florida and during the hot sticky Florida summer, live in Canada.

[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:36.640]
And when you're working, do your show from up north, just a thought, but why not? Why not? I don't want to. That's why not. How do you like that? Is that a good reason? I don't want to.

[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:45.280]
If I wanted to be there, they would put a studio in my home. They've already offered to do that. I don't want. I'm here to get you coming back.

[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:53.200]
Yeah, that's what they're spread around the building. Jolly Joe. I had such a good time this last weekend that I'm coming back permanent.

[00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:06.060]
You mean you're not? You know something? If my only choice, this is the truth that I've said it before. If my only choice of being alive was to have to be in South Florida the rest of my life, I would. I'd go on 441.

[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:14.760]
I'd gone and get my brains out. If I absolutely had to be there, I might take you a while to get there because 441 is really backed up with construction.

[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:26.500]
You what I just said? Yeah. That's why Ray, because I don't want to. Why don't you like mind your own business Ray? Okay? I don't want to. I've been here seven and a half years, seven years plus, whatever it is.

[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:34.480]
And I enjoy it. And the winners, you know, it was a brutal winner this way. And you know something that still survived. I still somehow survived.

[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.820]
Whether isn't life, whether isn't everything. If whether where everything nobody would live up North, isn't that true?

[00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:52.020]
Everybody would live like in the sun belt. And guess what? Most people don't. Most people live like in New York and Detroit and Boston and Chicago and places like that.

[00:49:52.140 --> 00:50:04.300]
And Minneapolis places up North. Pittsburgh, Philadelphia. Am I right about that? Yep. I mean there's a lot of people living in LA, but then again, you know, if you want to build your house on the side of a cliff and watch it float away in a mud slide, that's up to you.

[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:11.340]
Or an earthquake. Now the court is leaving or what? I'm here. Okay. When you're just very non-committal now. Okay?

[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:20.460]
Now is that sufficient to say I don't want to? Isn't that enough? Yeah? Well, guess what? You don't want to. You got to.

[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.160]
I don't want to. I don't want to.

[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.680]
You're trying to find 60 QA.

[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:32.680]
If I want you, you would cry to me. No, we're waiting for it.

[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:41.320]
By slowly, probably two or five, 60 WQM. So anyway, here's a for Josh. I knew that Brandon wouldn't leave you out of his thoughts for long.

[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:52.160]
Here's a message that says while I eat grilled chicken sandwich, I'm thumbing over some papers. Big shot quarters with the deep pockets using other people's money is affecting that poor bastard Chris.

[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:59.860]
He was so quiet and stupid what happened to him? Now he's spewing a lot of crap just like quarters. Just not as stupid as some of the things Josh had said.

[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:08.540]
I say put Josh out of his misery. Put Chris with Joe Rose and let's have you, George and Zach, what a trifecta. And he like that, Chris. Now he's taking shots at you even.

[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.860]
Oh well. He's saying that the Josh quarters is rubbing off on your ass.

[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.820]
No, come no.

[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:26.560]
I guess that wasn't the most tactful way of putting it wasn't it? No, no, not really. Well, it was it was cute.

[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:35.900]
It's me. I'm a cute old guy. You know, you used to say that to me all the time. Oh, you're so cute. You said some old bag, you know, really used to say that. Yeah, some big. She liked you.

[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:41.960]
I beg your pardon. She must have liked you. No, not like you're thinking. No, yeah, man. I hope not. You sure?

[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.540]
Wasting your time, honey. I had to forget who it was. Maybe that bull-dike Lynn Samuels. I don't know who said it.

[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:56.000]
Or maybe it was a what's your name from the hero? What's your name? I forget already. Anormous good friend. I wrote that already. Yeah. Oh, I'm putting Neil on the market. What is your name?

[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.840]
I don't remember. I forgot already. And that's good. That's a good thing.

[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:12.200]
Out of sight, out of mind. That old Yanta. This is I remember after he gave her my after I made the bad mistake of giving her my cell phone number. And she started texting me all the time with crap.

[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:27.220]
Oh, a swifty shinlars did. I do remember that one. Swifty. I worked with him for like two years. I never heard anybody call her of shinler swifty. But nevertheless, everybody's got a nickname, you know. Like when I croak, oh, that A-hole, Neil. Or as Bob Eisner would say that F-ing A-hole, Neil.

[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:39.780]
Is he still there? Yeah. I can't believe that. That to me. Is he still got that pasty red hair piece? That's something like guilty there for a second.

[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:56.640]
Oh, you're still eating, are you? No, I'm done. Oh, good. God. But I think Brandon's got a good point. Chris used to be like he knew when to open up a mouth and then generally speaking. But now since you rubbed off on him.

[00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:10.080]
So to speak. He's just blurting out all kinds of inanities. It's just not like him. Oh, man. Why Paul? This is good. I'm writing all this down because I want to do the show for Brandon. You know.

[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:24.540]
What was that? Who want to cater to Brandon's needs? Hey, Lucy likes to be at least give me a sponsor on there. Okay, at least he's there. Yeah, good point. That's right. He's here for me. He wanted me to professor and Brandon. Other than that, the rest of those my space people.

[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:38.420]
I wouldn't wish most of my Hitler. Okay. They're like that. That whole thing. I don't want to keep repeating that. But I don't know what to say about it. What my space? Yeah, come on. You love it. No, I don't. Yeah, you're on there. Okay. You're always on there.

[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.580]
Let's see the online now.

[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:54.240]
Yeah, in other words, you said I'm on there now. I don't know about right now, but no, I'm not on there now. I'm on the pool and I'm going to read the result.

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:02.320]
I guess the whole purpose is just to be as ordinary as you possibly can is that it, which is fine with me. I don't like ask us. You know, I hate that.

[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:09.360]
I can't stand it. I love Zach, but Zach is such a suck up. You know, what are you talking about? He is.

[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:17.240]
Although I do like the fact that he up kind of, he only put his foot down about being the executive producer and trying to get Joe to quit talking about the beast.

[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:26.180]
Well, he is right, man. Nobody wants to hear about the how the beast is going to die. If he wants to die from fat, that's his option, right?

[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:30.680]
Yeah, it's a free cup. I'm all for Dr. Jack, man. Dr. Kavorki and I'll all for him.

[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:39.640]
The people, in fact, I think you guys ought to be feeding him, force feeding him. If he wants to quote from food, he don't have to. He force feeds himself.

[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:50.820]
Well, that's what I'm saying. It's like me. Do I blame anybody else for the fact that I go over there and get tubs of ice cream across the street? I get that leader of scores, briars score ice cream?

[00:54:51.520 --> 00:55:00.460]
No, nobody forces me to do it. Yeah, but you're over there pricking your finger. I mean, you're watching your blood sugar here. What word did you just say? Oh finger. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:10.960]
What does that mean? I'm watching my blood sugar. My blood sugar is horrible. All right. Well, for eight months, at least you're going to see the board.

[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:19.600]
At least you're keeping it right down there for a while. What was that? When you start having the hot dogs and taking your pills? I know I found for a good day or two.

[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:33.160]
Because we were talking about it on the air. So big American potty. Oh my god. You are more than I can handle. And the two of you together. That's more than anybody should have to handle.

[00:55:33.540 --> 00:56:03.140]
Anyway, if I had the time, I would learn blank. This is our new pool. Now you know something. We have a 51. And now we got 171. So what is that? A thousand twenty two over thousands. He doesn't have to do my madness on a Friday. No, right. And Fridays are notoriously the weakest listing day of the week. Can we have a can we have a million votes again? Like I was listening the other day. No. Oh, why? Cause I'm on the show. Oh, was that how we did that? Yeah. Okay. At the end of the show Eric put a million votes on. I'm like two million or something. Yeah.

[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:21.620]
Put two million. Whatever you want. I don't care. Put 50 million. I'm what do I care? In fact, that's what we should have. When the numbers came out, I should have just made them up over that way to 14 share. Oh my god. Like that. And although I think if you add them all together, we might add a 14 share on the day parts. No, just under that.

[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:33.740]
Look, as long as they got spots on the log, although a lot of these are trades. You know, a lot of these are that marketing architects that the trade flow. Yeah. That's right. Why?

[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:47.680]
Talk to your little secret. No, it's not. It's no secret. A lot of these are trade outs. Oh my god. Today, especially. Well, it's Friday. Plus the economy is going to hell in a hand basket. We're into depression. Thank you, Mr. President for the depression.

[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:59.460]
If I had the time, I'd learn another language. 66 65. I've learned German. I'd probably be good at learning that because I know you've issued a little bit.

[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:16.540]
Shia. Is it off the lever? Huckman, Michigan, China. Is that German? Sure. Cox, a hoist. I'd learn to play an instrument if I had the time 28. More about investing 13, scuba diving 10. Well, they want to learn more about investing. Let's go to the gambling channel.

[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.940]
What do you say? Go play. Troub your power lunch.

[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.780]
I think you're going to buy it. Yeah.

[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.360]
Can we both agree to things? One is that the yields that were out there.

[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:38.000]
But a beep. But a beep. Yeah. S&P is up to the hours of down nine. And then I asked up seven and a half point. Go talk with Lenny Dijkstra.

[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:44.380]
What about Lenny Dijkstra? He's like a stock market, maybe. Oh, is he really? Yeah.

[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:49.020]
And Rick Riley. You ever see the two of them together? Same guy. Same mentality.

[00:57:51.060 --> 00:58:05.720]
The T.S. X is up 123.7. The trimmer stock. Wow. What's going on here? And oil is down to 105 dollars and 45 set of barrel. What a bargain. Let's go out and roll out the barrel, baby. I want to see how the loony is doing. The loony and the euro.

[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:11.060]
So that I'm Josh's next trip to Europe. Oh, Zach has been an amateur man. Well, he's got one up on the end. Yeah.

[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:16.720]
Yeah. He was talking about the peeing in the outdoor toilets there. I'm good. Listen. I'm going soon.

[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.160]
I'm a single guy. You better go real soon because they're cleaning it up. Man, they're sanitizing it.

[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:27.920]
Look, just because you can't take magic mushrooms there. Well, excuse me. You can, but they're just illegal now. Doesn't mean that they're cleaning it up.

[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.780]
Let me say it again. They are cleaning it up. They're closing the article on it a few weeks ago.

[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:38.220]
They're closing down big parts of the red light district. Come on. Yes. The red light district are closing it.

[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:42.340]
I said they're closing down major portions of it. What does that mean?

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.680]
And they're sanitizing the city like they didn't cope in a game. Oh, the euro is the Canadian loony's 9915.

[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:54.920]
And the euro is a disaster. It's 15731. Almost about 60. Thank you, Mr. President for destroying the American economy.

[00:58:55.500 --> 00:59:00.120]
Even Mr. Whipple wouldn't wipe his ass with the US dollar. How do you like that? Even if it had alloy in it.

[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:05.900]
By the way, were you aware of the fact that they make a toilet paper with alloy? Yes. You were? Well, yeah.

[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:13.320]
It's in the commercials such a thing. Allo on your ass. Yeah. Well, it's highly recommended by Zach and Chris.

[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.220]
They were peddling that the last two days. Allo toilet paper. Nice and soft.

[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.160]
Mmm.

[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.380]
Not too soft. You don't want that to be all of it. You don't want clean-ons. No, not at all.

[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:37.580]
It disappeared. Yeah. I got clean-ons. All right. Believe me. I know about clean-ons.

[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:43.380]
Anyway, I'm not going to read the rest of the poll because you guys took away my, you know, I had some moments of going away.

[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.080]
It took away the big most. Oh, yeah.

[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:50.640]
It's all right. That's okay. Before you know, it'll be two o'clock and a weekend will be here.

[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:54.760]
We'll have the jerk show it to a clock and hear those. Now, what's that? I want to hear that music again. One more time.

[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:57.960]
Where do you have that? There it is.

[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.560]
Oh.

[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.700]
Today. On the Friday edition.

[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.340]
Are you making fun of jerk's name? No, I was just doing my impression. Yeah.

[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.460]
I like it.

[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:18.880]
I like the addition of a jerk show. Here is the heat stack. They suck, they lose. They blow.

[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.340]
The biggest name. The best town. He's going to do the projects.

[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:52.320]
You're going to be a 5.6.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9.9

[01:00:52.320 --> 01:01:01.480]
Now everything in there is carbohydrates. Right. Can we have something? That's what? Something that's just no car.

[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:13.480]
Besides that beef jerky crap. That stuff is like chewing on cardboard. I don't mind it though. Like I realize I do. I do mind it. I think we need. I think there needs to be a major lawsuit.

[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.900]
And I think whoever would invent some product like that would make a zillion dollars because even though Adkins is dead and his diet isn't what it used to be.

[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:28.720]
And the people that took over the thing just destroyed it. The Actions Foundation, whoever the hell those A-holes were. I'ma said it.

[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:41.200]
That's something that we can't say that anymore. We can't say almost anything. See generally speaking as evolution takes place, we evolve from one place to another.

[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:47.460]
And we become more progressive and open minded and less uptight and less restricted and less censored. And like more, you know, like anything.

[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:58.260]
Not not now. Not inside America, baby. We can't say anything. We can't even fart. We can't even poop our pants without somebody getting all whipped up about it.

[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:06.720]
By the way, I did not check in the tea room at the Hilton hotel to see if my underwear were still there. I'm pretty sure they're probably gone. And what's their gone?

[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:15.020]
You were right though. Chris chanced eyes me. Boy, was it you or was it exactly so I should have taken those and put dispensed of them properly.

[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:26.040]
You put them in. You're right. Well, I just didn't want to touch them. Don't you understand? I just wanted to get them off of my body and throw them in the corner. And that's it. Be done with them. I'm a fan. Do you?

[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:34.860]
You working your right from a mind of the time. So especially with those Thai shoes with laces.

[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:46.740]
Yeah, let me go. Velcro into people everywhere. Velcro are old people. Let me say it again. I'm an old people. Okay. I'm not going to apologize for living the 65. Okay. I'm an old fart.

[01:02:48.160 --> 01:03:00.600]
Would I rather be like 35? You bet. Would I rather be 25? Oh, yeah. But then it could happen. So I were new balance shoes with Velcro instead of with laces. I don't like laces.

[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:29.740]
Okay. Do you have shoes with laces? Like my new balance have laces like the shoes that were to work are just like slip on. Yeah, there you go. Like loafers. No, not a lot of loafers in that building. I'll say, but just comfortable shoes, man. Just regular old black slip on shoes. What do you mean slip on? How do they like? They're like Timberlands. You do, but there's no laces or anything. They're like Tinkerbell. Huh?

[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:58.560]
There's no laces. So they're like loafers then. I get you know, when you say loafers, I think penny loafers. You know what I mean? Like no, not with pennies in their. There are penny loafers that had the penny in which went out with white bucks. Right. That's what I think when I hear loafers. So sorry about that. No loafers are shoes that don't have laces or velcro that they have to be shoes have to be something. Right. Do you know what I'm saying? I got it.

[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:09.680]
And if they fit on your feet and they don't have laces or velcro to hold them on, then they must be some kind of loafers. That's right. I'm just a loafing around here. I'm saying. Yeah, I understand.

[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:20.160]
Josh and I don't need some shoe etiquette training. I never I have to go with it when I think of loafers. I think of like, you know, the dress shoe penny loafers. So yeah, and those are just.

[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:33.020]
Oh, gosh. Yeah, maybe you're thinking of like a little gate like that. Definitely a little gay in the penny loafers. Well, I'll tell you one thing. Paco here, man. He's got more he could. He's got more shoes than most shoes stores.

[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:48.640]
I'm all set. I like my. What that's all about. Is that a gate thing? I guess. Yes. Is it? Yeah. Cause I'm a heteromale and I have three pairs of shoes. Well, I got to be done at. Although most of the ones I got around like old and worn out. You know, I've got. I've basically got two pair.

[01:04:48.640 --> 01:05:00.480]
I got my new brand new new balance and then I got those ones with the laces that I hate. Versus. You know, yeah. Hate them. Well, dress shoes you never wear. I wore my snite to with Chris.

[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:11.100]
Look at you. You got that's cause I get talked into it. Man, I get instructions on some of these things. I have to look human when I go to a fancy place. That's right.

[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:27.340]
I wear a long sleeve dress shirt and I wear those those pants by the way came out great. I know that Chris is very worried about my pantaloon. Well, that's good. Your knickers. No, not mine. Knickers. The ones that had a little accident a couple weeks ago, but listen, we're next time to go in the route. Next time you go to Ruth. Chris, just rock the Velcro.

[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:40.300]
I told him last night to hold the butter. Please. Are you kidding me? No, but no. I mean, are you kidding me? A lot of people do that. No, I'm getting on you. That's what it feels. And I'm not even a fat guy, but how do you do that?

[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:57.540]
How do you do what? How do you hold the butter? Like what do you go there for? You go there to get a filet with sizzling butter? No, no. The steak was sizzling and it was delicious without the butter. Okay, Mr. Hunchun. And a Ruth Christ, a broiler, takes a very high temperatures, which is why they are so juicy and sizzling. Yeah, no, but

[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:03.500]
mmm, and the butter by the way they add after the way they're told me this last night, they add the butter after this through a

[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:12.780]
broiler, but it's the sizzle, man. Yeah, sizzle your ass. Okay, get out of here. I wasn't going to go through that experience again. They're always glad to hold the butter.

[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:19.980]
Hey, but at least now you know where the bathroom is. I know where the bathroom is. Chris is. Yes. No, no, let's not go there again. Okay.

[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.020]
It was the bathroom in the Hilton Hotel. It was already out of the restaurant. Thank God. Can you even imagine? Oh my God.

[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:33.060]
Because they're always happy to see us in there because they're regular customers, but if I would have had that accident inside the

[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:40.480]
joint, they'd say, oh, there's the guy that pooped his pants. Oh my God. Everybody run for the door. You know, like that. They would have thought that I left my

[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:49.080]
bag home or something like that. Carl Rowe, former deputy white house chief of staff says he's always been intimidated by first lady Laura Bush and that he has lived

[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:58.320]
in fear of first while first lady Barbara Bush for 37 years. That old bitch. Laura Bush intimidates me. Rowe tells GQ magazine interview for its

[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:05.160]
May edition. All the Bushers, while most of the Bush men, very incredibly strong women and they all intimidate me. He said to which I would say, you fair. Yeah.

[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:15.600]
I got a rope. Who are you fooling? You screaming queen. But speak of that. Ali Feltzing on CNN. Speaking of screaming queens. Rowe even found the grand

[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:23.420]
not only wife of the previous president, Bush scary. Barbara Bush. I've lived in fear for 37 years. He said he seems less afraid of Clinton. Giving me a very frank

[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:30.280]
assessment of the candidate and her campaign, which he says has been badly managed. Calling swallery, fatally flawed. Rowe said many voters

[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:36.360]
perceive her as a phony. You know, she went through the period where she had the calculated laugh. She went through the period where she had the calculated

[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:43.060]
accents and you build that on top of a person already has a reputation of anything she says is calculating. Rowe said that's what her problem is.

[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:50.080]
It's not a only problem, according to the secret of man. Some say manipulated the media and I was to former see I outed former see I operative

[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:58.200]
Valerie Plane. She also has a sense of entitlement that can annoy people. He said, you know, the sense of this is mine. I deserve it. We're the Clintons. This is ours.

[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.960]
And I think that caused a lot of people to say, you know what? It's not yours. And we want to go back to 90s when I said a lot of respect.

[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:17.140]
Do we want to go back to all that drama for your mama? And this business about we did this and we did that. She was married to the president. That's all. That was her claim. The famous night. She wasn't even a Senate then.

[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:24.640]
And yet we did this and we did that. You didn't do squat. Maybe you did do a little squat or maybe if you would have squatted more, you might have been better off.

[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:32.140]
But the former Republican official lands that Barack Obama is getting off easy in this campaign. I don't think they hold them the same standards, had Rowe.

[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:41.600]
Former Senate Minority Leader Tom Dachelors said, Roves criticism is an indicator of Clinton success. I would take Carl Roves criticism as a badge of honor, Dachelorette, Dachelorette, and Dachelorette in 2007.

[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:50.480]
You're not a good Democrat unless you've been criticized by Carl Rove at least once you said, thank you Carl. Do it again. Screw it again. Carl, you foany, you Nazi.

[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.920]
Thought we were worried about bowling, man. Don't you think that's an important badge of honor? Maybe the Nixon used to have a bowling alley in the White House.

[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:09.140]
Didn't I know that? Yeah. There's not one thing they'll bring it back. Maybe if a swallery wins or maybe if he the one of them win, they can have the bowl off right there in the White House bowling alley. Put it on pay-per-view.

[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:14.480]
Yeah. And of course, a swallery she can bring the balls. They can only stick about that.

[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:27.840]
Now, are you hinted by her as the rest of us are or not, Josh? Well, you know where I stand on politics these days, but yeah, she's nothing special, that's for sure.

[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:35.860]
Devasive, cold, shrill, and annoying. Other than that, I don't like the best out of T-Rex.

[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.980]
He's now the only one who's 40 or 560 QAM.

[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:39.600]
Thanks.

[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:40.860]
Forth, leader.

[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:46.320]
Fill out your brackets for Hoops hysteria online at wqam.com.

[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.280]
Here's the answer!

[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.360]
A bunch of thoughts!

[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.040]
Make your picks for the final four.

[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.220]
Hoops hysteria.

[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.800]
Long on in a flag. A presentation of sports for the un-fives to see.

[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.860]
Think about the only role.

[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.980]
Maybe you think.

[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:12.360]
It's 12.32 at 5.60 WQM. Unlike, was it yesterday? I guess it was yesterday. It showed dragged. I don't know what. I just seemed like I was here for 100 hours.

[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.160]
Remember that, Chris? I thought it would kind of look pretty good yesterday.

[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:20.940]
I'm not saying it didn't go well. I'm just saying it seemed long. Really long. F and Pondress.

[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.960]
Today seems to be a zippin' right along. Provocus Josh's butt's right out. I'm just gonna stay here.

[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:26.700]
Yeah, no doubt. I make it fun for you.

[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:31.200]
Yeah. You make it an event. Brent Padawski in the smirking chip writes,

[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:32.720]
don't blame Howard Dean.

[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:36.760]
He says Howard Dean isn't the tallest tree in the force of national politics,

[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.820]
but it's boasting for political insiders to blame the Democratic mess on him.

[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:46.000]
There is one hard criticism I will have of Dean. He should be speaking far more loudly against the tax that are so destructive.

[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.560]
They clearly helped John McCain.

[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.960]
Howard Dean didn't cause the mess and doesn't have the power to win it,

[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.680]
and many with far more power than Dean have remained weak, silent, and irrelevant.

[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.600]
Week, silent, and irrelevant.

[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:02.020]
Dean doesn't control 300 super delegates who lack the minimum political courage

[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.780]
to even take a stance supporting a candidate and have the presumption pomposity to publicly consider

[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.220]
whether highly unpopular political insiders should squandered the people in primaries and caucuses.

[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.640]
Where is Al Gore who said nothing to see of even minimal import in presidential politics,

[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.320]
through positions himself as a political and moral statesman?

[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.160]
Where is John Edwards with his intramedable invitations to candidates to solicit his support

[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:27.020]
and then his intramedable leaks of these meetings and his intramedable leak commentary

[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.740]
about why this or that candidate is not worthy of his support?

[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:35.360]
The list of suspects who deserve length of the Democratic fiasco is longer than Agatha Christie's list

[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.880]
and murder on the Orient Express.

[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.780]
How would Dean maybe weak, but what's even more pathetic in weak is that those who could have far more influence

[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.680]
have lacked the courage and statute of act while they whisper sweet nothings to the New York Times

[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.640]
blaming Dean for their own lack of courage and common sense.

[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.620]
At a white branch, you go, baby, he's doing it.

[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:53.720]
What is swallowing?

[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:54.820]
Public service.

[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.700]
And even though as originally drafted,

[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.260]
as originally drafted,

[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.240]
or me either,

[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.260]
women and African Americans were left out of America's founding promises.

[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:10.360]
There he goes.

[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:11.340]
So let's vote for Barack.

[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.680]
Maybe he's not what she's about to say.

[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:12.900]

[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.140]
I mean, seems to me, Martin Luther King, Jr.,

[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.260]
40 years ago today he was assassinated.

[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.460]
We're celebrating the memory of all the things he did.

[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.960]
So let's put the black guy in.

[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.940]
Here's what I'm thinking, swallowing.

[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.080]
What do you say to that, bitch?

[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.000]
I mean, honey.

[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.320]
2014 votes on the second poll.

[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.760]
That means we've got a bunch.

[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.660]
8.51 and 2.14 is what?

[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:35.020]
1075.

[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.060]
We are going to have over 1100 down on Friday.

[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.060]
On Friday.

[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.780]
And that's because Josh Cortes is here no matter what Brandon says.

[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.400]
That's right.

[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.480]
I think we'll have like 2 million votes by the end of the show.

[01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:46.640]
I wouldn't be surprised if Eric gets on the stick.

[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:48.800]
Now speaking of the stick,

[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.720]
you guys don't use stick the ornament there.

[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.000]
What do you mean?

[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.680]
What do you spray?

[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.000]
Yeah, spray.

[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.900]
Like right guard to sport this.

[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.820]
What have you been calling it?

[01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.500]
No, that's terrible.

[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.800]
I definitely use a stick.

[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:02.840]
You guys stick it?

[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:03.740]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:06.380]
The stick.

[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.520]
That's smart me, man.

[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.820]
It's like, oh.

[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.260]
I got one.

[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.780]
I got one in the other room, but I never use it.

[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.760]
I got one in the back room.

[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.160]
Sorry.

[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.380]
I'm not sorry.

[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.000]
It's like sticky.

[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.100]
It doesn't feel like, you know, if you use a spray and I just

[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.900]
could spray like right guard, you don't even know it.

[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.640]
You feel good all day.

[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.080]
I'm not sure what the sticks you've tried, but I mean the ones nowadays

[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.380]
don't even know they're on.

[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.900]
What does that mean?

[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:33.640]
You don't know they're on.

[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.320]
You put it on and it dries.

[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.660]
It's not like stickier anything.

[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.500]
Let me just go in the other room.

[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:39.340]
Oh, boy.

[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.400]
It's going to get the spray.

[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:42.100]
Probably.

[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.760]
I was going to get his whatever the stick would be.

[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.280]
Oh, the stick?

[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.020]
Okay, I see.

[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.660]
I got to go with the stick.

[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:51.360]
Yeah, I use the one where it's a white stick, but when it goes on clear.

[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.420]
Oh, I don't like the white.

[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:55.680]
I like the clear, but the spray just don't work.

[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.920]
Yeah, to me, you know what I mean?

[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.760]
You'll have BO by like 3 p.m.

[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:00.840]
You use the spray.

[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.260]
But I guess the other party, when it smells great, I look like crap.

[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.480]
Oh, what is this?

[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:10.240]
Something happened to this stuff.

[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.460]
Oh, oh, no.

[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:15.540]
That's why you don't use it.

[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.160]
It's spinning around.

[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.740]
It's got mung.

[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.760]
It's got mung on it.

[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.760]
I mean, like all the stuff came out on the, it's not supposed to be on top like that, is it?

[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.500]
I don't know.

[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.560]
Oh, oh.

[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:28.200]
God.

[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:29.780]
Let me wipe it off.

[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:30.520]
Oh.

[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.600]
There we go.

[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:38.400]
What do you know how like the stuff rose to the top, you know what I mean?

[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.060]
You know how that works?

[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.560]
I don't even know how the whole list damn thing works.

[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.440]
On the bottom, you just kind of turn it and the goo comes out.

[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.040]
Oh, you're terrible.

[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.720]
Well, the goo was already out and it was getting mooshy, you know.

[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.380]
Because I haven't used this in a long time.

[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.020]
I don't think there's much goo left in there.

[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:54.960]
Maybe that was the problem.

[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:56.800]
There you go.

[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.900]
I'm turning the knob on the bottom and I can see because it's clear.

[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:00.520]
It's right guard.

[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.360]
And I can see there's not much in there.

[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:03.940]
Nothing's happening.

[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:04.940]
Let me, let me smear it though.

[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.240]
There's enough on the top that I can smear it on my pits.

[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.080]
And let's see if I stink by 2 o'clock.

[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.320]
Oh, smells good.

[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.000]
I'd say that smells like a manly smell.

[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:14.780]
That's right.

[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.060]
Fresh right guard's sports.

[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:16.680]
That's right.

[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.300]
It'll stay there.

[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:18.820]
Right guard's sport gel.

[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:20.260]
Okay, I'm putting that thing over there.

[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.060]
And if it's good, I'm going to go out and buy me a new one.

[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.480]
It's not like I'll mung you know.

[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.720]
Did he use the right guard spray as well?

[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.040]
Yes.

[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:26.660]
Okay.

[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.880]
It would have me as well.

[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.620]
That's all I use.

[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:29.460]
I don't use this thing.

[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.380]
If I use this thing, you think all that mung would be on there?

[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.520]
I use old school deodorant.

[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:35.080]
You remember, bitch.

[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.580]
I think we're going to see you use old spice.

[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.300]
If you told me you had old spice, he would...

[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.520]
You heard of Mitchum?

[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:41.620]
Yeah.

[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:42.600]
Yeah, I used that.

[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.740]
In the dark green thing.

[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:45.160]
That's right.

[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:45.980]
Old school, man.

[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.380]
Ancient school, Mitchum.

[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:49.940]
Remember Robert Mitchum?

[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:50.680]
He was a drunkard.

[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.620]
He was in the first Cape Fear and did a really great job.

[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.000]
Robert Mitchum, good actor, a real drunkard and nasty guy.

[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:56.960]
They said a real bastard.

[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.640]
By the way, both of those movies were really good.

[01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.480]
Did you see the new one?

[01:15:59.580 --> 01:15:59.940]
Cape Fear?

[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:00.280]
Yes.

[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.420]
I'm trying to think of who was in the newer one.

[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:03.880]
Did you hear that?

[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:04.700]
The newer one.

[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.240]
I've seen it.

[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.900]
The other first one was much better.

[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.020]
I like Bolton on the lot.

[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:09.800]
Let me say it again.

[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.720]
You asked my opinion.

[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.400]
I'll tell you again.

[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.080]
I thought the first one with Robert Mitchum was much, much better.

[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.440]
Now, who else was in the first one with him?

[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:17.900]
Who played the...

[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:19.800]
What's Jimmy Stewart?

[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:20.720]
I don't know.

[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.520]
Oh, Google it.

[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.200]
Can you Google it?

[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.340]
Can you IMVB it?

[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:27.760]
Cape Fear, the Robert Mitchum one.

[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.940]
I'm trying to think who the guy was.

[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.660]
Gregory Peck.

[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.580]
Gregory Peck.

[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:31.580]

[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:31.840]
See?

[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:32.760]
I said Jimmy Stewart.

[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.620]
Jimmy Stewart was too an ambi-pambi to be in a movie like that.

[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.500]
You know who else is in it?

[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.180]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.180]

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.180]

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.180]

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.180]

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.180]

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.840]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.040]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:48.660]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.160]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:49.220]

[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:50.260]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.260]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:51.780]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:52.000]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.060]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:52.160]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:52.520]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.500]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.020]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:55.640]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:56.420]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.660]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.100]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:58.360]
I'm not sure.

[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.160]
I'm not sure.

[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.220]
I'm not sure.

[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:01.820]
I'm not sure.

[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.200]
I'm not sure.

[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.800]
He's in the st Right St Suit.

[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:11.640]

forty years later martin Luther King still solanced

[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.440]
he says soon after martin Luther King's birthday became a federal holiday

[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.320]
nineteen eighty six

[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:04.920]
i began pride in mainstream needed to cover the dramatic story of kings last year

[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.280]
as he campaigned militantly against us for an economic policy

[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.680]
most of his last speeches were recorded

[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.580]
but year after year corporate networks have refused to wear the tapes

[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:18.940]
last night NBC nightly anchor Brian Williams and I saw it and thused over new color footage of king

[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:22.300]
that adorned its coverage of the forty th anniversary of assassination

[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.420]
report focused on the last phase of king's life but the same old blinders were in place

[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:32.140]
NBC showed young working class whites in Chicago taught in king but there was no

[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.620]
much of how elite media had taught a king in his last year

[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.780]
in nineteen sixty seven eight mainstream media self-reverting a bit like they

[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.240]
now see Reverend Jeremiah Wright

[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:44.120]
back then they denounced king's critical comments today they simply

[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.140]
silence them

[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:49.280]
while noting and passing the king's boat spoke out against the Vietnam war

[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.740]
mainstream reports they rarely acknowledge that he went way beyond Vietnam

[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.800]
to decry US militarism in general

[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.340]

first both clearly the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today my own

[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:05.700]
government

[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:10.780]
in response to these speeches newsweek said king was over his head and wanted a

[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.380]
race conscious minority to dictate US foreign policy

[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:17.860]
life magazine described the Nobel Peace Prize winner as a communist pond

[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:20.100]
who advocated abject surrender in Vietnam

[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.880]
the Washington Post couldn't have been more patronizing king has diminished his

[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.840]
usefulness to his cause to his country and was people they said

[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.060]
when case world voice moved beyond racial discrimination to international issues

[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:35.100]
the New York Times attacked his efforts to like the civil rights and anti-war

[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:35.640]
movements

[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:40.180]
king sermons on Vietnam could get his angry as those of Barack Obama's ex-poster

[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.520]
a pastor god didn't call America to engage in a senseless unjust war we've

[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.580]
committed more or cramsy almost than any other nation in the world he said

[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.740]
in nineteen sixty seven king was also criticizing the economic underpinnings of

[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:55.740]
US foreign policy rating against capitalist of the west investing huge sums

[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.120]
of money in Asia African South America only to take the profits out with no

[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.200]
concern for the social betterment of the countries

[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.460]
today capitalist of the west reef huge profits from their domination of global

[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:05.860]
media

[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:10.000]
thankfully we now have the internet and independent media let's work in slated

[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.820]
later speeches are available for the ages

[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:15.900]
the king has survived the war drums beating for the invasion occupation of a

[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:16.140]
rank

[01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:19.980]
amplified by TV networks and the New York Times front page and Washington Post

[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:23.380]
at a trail page there's little that where he'd stand or how loudly he'd be

[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.000]
speaking out

[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:27.940]
and there's little about how big u.s. media would have reacted on fox news and

[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:28.480]
talk radio

[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.200]
king would have been dixie chicked or reverend right it

[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.380]
in corporate centers outlets he'd have been marginalized rather than fact that

[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.620]
you can say no chomsky

[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:39.060]
once the specs king would be marbling at the rise of Barack Obama the

[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.820]
multiracial movement behind him

[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:44.280]
would be happy with a bomb another democratic leaders who he found less

[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.640]
billions in the biggest military budget in world history

[01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.460]
in nineteen sixty seven king's announced democratic control congress for

[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:53.920]
fighting the Pentagon budget while cutting anti-poverty programs declaring

[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.460]
a nation that continues year after year to spend money on military defense

[01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:01.260]
than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death

[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.380]
out of all the jet show he writes in the craft

[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.740]
makes a hell of a pizza too

[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.820]
how's he doing by the way ponies here we see him lately not

[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.260]
not recently no

[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.300]
course not

[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.900]
i just mentioned that in passing

[01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:17.840]
i don't want to start a whole big thing about ourselves department because

[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.260]
you know what what's the point it's like rehashing old crap over and over again

[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:25.080]
like my mother used to do over it over on what's the point

[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.840]
in my right you bet

[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:31.600]
two hundred thirty four sometimes i feel like i'm talking to myself that's why

[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.860]

[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.640]

[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.880]
did them with our website the qm website

[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.200]
we're talking about

[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.260]
all the roads why wouldn't i do that

[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:59.820]
why would you do what why wouldn't i be here till two

[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:04.140]
in case you want to be a slacker that's all we have a lot of slackers a q amp

[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.860]
and engineers you saw you saw yourself this morning i did

[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:08.060]
you

[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.660]
we needed a sassistence baby we need some assistance and what are we get we got

[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:16.940]
like but a bit better than finally step stuff who's a real engineer by the

[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:17.620]
way's a good guy

[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.700]
i've never met him but George speaks very highly

[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.420]
very good

[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:26.220]
great guy real engineer he knows his crap he cares he gives a crap he actually

[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:28.120]
i think likes to show a little bit probably not

[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.380]
i don't think you know does he

[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:33.200]
he would have really liked to show back when we had the show remember when we

[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:33.700]
had the show

[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.880]
yeah remember when Josh worked on it was like a lot different than it is

[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.600]
today yeah

[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:40.000]
am i right it was so great

[01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:45.340]
everything worked right i'm not talking about engineering wise i'm talking about

[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.260]
the show you smock right

[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.520]
good times man

[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.380]
lot of good times even what's your name ester roll never had good times like

[01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:53.780]
those

[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.980]
although i think we had better times than i would be i know i had much better

[01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:58.840]
times on zeta

[01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:02.400]
on fm like a hundred thousand what signal they didn't go

[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.520]
like that when you're on four forty one

[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:09.920]
we have some signal issues but nevertheless see and that's another thing when

[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.080]
we look at these ratings we see how i look at the cube numbers and i think

[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:13.540]
to myself

[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:16.880]
but what's that long ago when our q used to be like a hundred and thirty thousand

[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:22.180]
how can it can be like sixty one or sixty five thousand i mean that's nothing

[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.700]
but then you stop and you analyze you put your notes to the grindstone you

[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:30.000]
stick it in there and you realize the changing nature of the medium

[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.020]
radio is a shadow i don't care about all these nab and all these executives

[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:37.200]
all radio is as strong as ever bull crap

[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.060]
course it's not

[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.840]
you got your people with your mp three place you got music coming out of your

[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.320]
ass now man they got their radio coming out of every four in their body they

[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.400]
got entertainment

[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.140]
yes am i right yeah

[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.160]
not to mention satellite radio

[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:58.200]
not to mention you know on the actual show itself we can't you know do what we

[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.680]
want of course that's right plus the add on to that the fcc limitations and the

[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.120]
joys limitations and the jolly joe limitations and the clearance limitations

[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:10.120]
and we're we're playing with about a tenth of a day we got about i don't know five

[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:10.620]
cards

[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.760]
speaking of playing cards

[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:18.980]

[01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:20.720]

[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:43.140]

[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:58.420]
you know i don't know if they're giving me instructions don't do the show just

[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.340]
for granted he responded that but i just ignored it

[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:01.760]
i did it

[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:05.300]
i just because i know the two of you guys hate each other like poison and of course

[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:09.620]
i don't think i have a lot of it is man said forbidden love

[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.800]
it's like i said this morning

[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:12.480]

so love hate relationship it's a funny it's a big deal i love and they

[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.340]

[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.220]

dinner i don't see any early bird dinners here

[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.280]

[01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.400]
someplace where they got them but have you have a more sense of their what

[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.720]

[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:43.840]

[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.420]
really good macaroni and cheese

[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:59.240]

[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:14.320]

although you know something i'm that bad not good

[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:21.940]
not as bad and not as grotesque as i thought it would be i mean you're really fat

[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.440]
when you can't stand to see yourself

[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.240]
you know i mean by that what do you mean

[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.740]
when you can't stand to see yourself naked then you know your grove really

[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.820]
grotesque it's like it's like when you can't stand the smell of your own fart

[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.460]
that must be pretty bad it's like the way i smelled when i had that experience

[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.060]
that they hilted a couple weeks ago

[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:43.100]
i'm not exaggerating i'm on it's still luncheon i don't want to get too

[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:46.600]
graphic but i smelled so bad i i couldn't stand it

[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:48.820]
i don't want to get the elevated with myself

[01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:51.720]
but i had no choice

[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.100]
you know the car looking at me i was

[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.560]
huh there's no residual smell of the car or anything

[01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:00.100]
no there is not although paca was very concerned about oh you pooped in my

[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.420]
car but no i did not poop in your car okay

[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:03.480]
shmithead

[01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:10.260]
my life is so complex now you know i mean it's very complicated

[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.460]
but the good thing is i'll get up at 4.35 in the morning tomorrow

[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.640]
i'll hop into Pontiac and i'll head off to it by 30 in the morning

[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.060]
yeah there's nobody there

[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.480]
Jesus because people are like you know sleeping i do well there on the weekends

[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.340]
i've done extraordinarily well and that's because no oh no that's right they're

[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:31.060]
sleeping even the even the late night friday night crowd

[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.740]
or on the Sunday morning the late night saturday night crowd they're gone man by

[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.380]
that time they're tapped out they're passed out they're drunk they're what

[01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:41.060]
and they're in the sack so where you go to the casino with nobody's there

[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.660]
on the weekends yeah i mean like the other night when i went there there whatever

[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:48.540]
time it was there was people there i had a wait for the machine and i got a good

[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:52.420]
machine line and i had enough judgment enough judgment to realize that was the

[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.740]
paying machine i went back to it got the two grand on a line

[01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:59.220]
i mean people that think it's just all blind luck it's your most of it is

[01:27:59.220 --> 01:28:01.940]
but once it arrived i've told you this before if you use a little bit of

[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.980]
observation if you lose a little bit of

[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:07.160]
mentioning when you sneak back out of a machine that's paying that can be the

[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.440]
jackpot machine line and it was for me the other day

[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:13.840]
how do you like that but don't you understand the beauty of going in when there's

bit slow the whole thing was a joke it was a silly silly joke but nevertheless

[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.140]
Charlie's a little slow but welcome back Charlie and you know what you're

[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:41.100]
thinking a sparing person right i just think he has two months off where uh he

[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.060]
can be thinking of all these new polls

[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.840]
look at brats he sleeps with the fishes now let's argue about that again now you

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:10.820]
asked him yesterday to send the facts and apologize why didn't happen here that

[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:15.000]
because he was a hard-ass and he kept insisting oh well here's it's definitely

[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.820]
his attestio look a brats he sleeps with the fishes and he almost had me convinced

[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:23.320]
there for a second he was so damn close and he was such a hard-ass you know

[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.300]
and George and i've already been through this we already checked the dialogue online

[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:30.800]
but you know you can never do it too many times the look of brats he sleeps with the fishes

[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:36.360]
flamenza baby big fat flamenza i love that scene where he's making it he's showing Michael how to

[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.380]
make the sauce you know how to cook for a hundred men first you shove into sausages and

[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:47.700]
the meatballs little wine sugar and so he says cut the crap remember that yeah the look of brats

[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:53.180]
sleeps with the fish cut the crap passengers flying into four-letter deal from Newark New Jersey

[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:58.200]
with any hope of arriving on time should avoid jet blue flight five fifteen says the sun sent

[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:04.820]
on not just like today or any specific day any day the airlines last Friday the day from

[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.340]
Newark internationalized the worst single on time record of any flight in the country a

[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:14.620]
couldn't wait for reports yesterday by the US Department of Transportation the 850 p.m. flight

[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:18.880]
which is scheduled to arrive at 1149 and 4 Lauderdale was late 100% of the time

[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.680]
nothing like being consistent though hey it was late 100% of the time in the month of February

[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:28.600]
proving that there are some things that are perfect the average delay was 69 minutes

[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.680]
officials at 4 Lauderdale Hollywood claimed no responsibility for the feet

[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:37.140]
we have no control over that said Greg we admire spokesman for the airport we can't fly the

[01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:43.260]
plane for them very clever Greg Steve Bellamy the airport's search I wonder if he's came to Brian

[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.440]
Bellamy at Pompe no Park a Brian you know the race starts now okay

[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.040]
God Steve Bellamy the airport's 13-year business development manager said he hasn't

[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:56.200]
recalled airline flying into four-letter deal ever been the recipient of the worst on time record

[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.760]
jet blue is four-letter deal reports number two carrier in terms of passengers spirit airlines

[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:05.920]
is numeral uno jet blue blames a domino effect the airlines warning flight is continued

[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.220]
delayed in Newark and that results in the airplane turning around late in four-letter deal

[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:14.920]
it's the victim that it congested northeast airspace as well as associated whether a

[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:20.420]
newer can florets does at Allison Eshelman spokeswoman for jet blue airways Chicago's

[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:23.720]
oh here international mounted off the top five most frequently delayed flights flights in

[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:28.200]
February claiming the other four spots four-letter deal has made the list since 2005

[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:32.840]
overall on-time performance itself but airports improved in February the four-letter

[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:37.740]
deal airport had on-time arrival 66th at the time compared with 63 and a half percent a year ago

[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:43.120]
probably to international at on-time arrival 66.9 percent compared with 61.4 percent of the

[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:49.640]
previous February only my international got worse who was saying that yesterday oh what well

[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.060]
that's good that's good to hear because I ripped my amy airport all the time on Monday

[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.440]
oh that was you the earlier me and I am yeah both of us were only my international

[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:04.280]
got worse with 62.6 percent on time arrivals down from 66.1 percent from our last year

[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.980]
shocking I don't have a big problem yet like I said the only thing that turned me away from

[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:14.480]
them was that excessive screening that they started doing if you're flying out of the country

[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:18.320]
like what do they do do they put the rubber glove on I mean no they yeah they put the rubber

[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.100]
glove and they stick their foot up like them they put the glove on their toe now what they do

[01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:26.020]
is that if they if your boarding pass says you're going to Toronto or like to this anywhere in

[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:31.260]
Europe or wherever out of the country right they take the boarding pass away from you and the

[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:35.420]
guys that are doing the screening they hold on to it while the stuff is going through the

[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:42.120]
screening process you know okay being x-rayed and you are shuttled off to like a side room

[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.040]
we're like three or four other people or sometime I have it doesn't people and you're like

[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:50.180]
prisoners you know when you're stuck in there and meanwhile you're watching whoever's got the

[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.700]
boarding pass because they're passing it around you know and wiping their ass with it and

[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:57.860]
doing strange things and you want to make sure they don't lose you damn boarding pass because once

[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:04.160]
it's gone you know you're screwed right and then they finally you know they call you over and then

[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.100]
then they do another screening thing even though you've already been through the damn screening then

[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:11.740]
they have another thing they put you through and then you make you sit down take your shoes off

[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:17.800]
and they're like that or they really I want to do that twice and I will never go through that again

[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:23.920]
at Miami International too much too much one thing to be thorough it's one thing to be cautious it's

[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.760]
one thing to be careful it's nothing to be just obnoxious I could put up with the fact that nobody

[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.760]
speaks English there then bother me all that much I don't I don't listen to him anyway

[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:40.240]
I mean when you're flying into Miami or out of it you know you're in a foreign country anyway so

[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:43.840]
what's the difference right what do you expect you expect English and Miami no no I'm in

[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.240]
English I'll keep look at those ratings for Christ's sake that's another thing we left off when I

[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:52.400]
was going down the whole routine about radio being finished and especially in this market because

[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:59.440]
look at the demographics for Christ's sake how can we compete and quite frankly compared to the

[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:04.460]
other AM stations I mean you know the guys across the street are a joke they're a joke

[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:10.720]
they got basically twos they got ones the twos they're like the Lawrence Wall station a one or two

[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.920]
and hopefully a three but I doubt it that's them then they have a three in the afternoon something

[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.140]
mad dog edged them out I'll I'm sure that if you extrapolate just four to seven

[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:28.020]
that he kicks their ass the libassid thing but he's also settled the the breakdown of the hours

[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:32.660]
it's three to seven is actually going to dry so we settle that three to four hour nothing I'm not

[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:36.280]
saying that the jerks is doing like we're settled with a two to three hour from ten to three

[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:42.080]
or he tries to you you know what I'm trying to say I'm trying to say I'm saying I don't

[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.220]
beat around a bush I'm leading right out there for you okay now when the whole book comes out

[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:50.260]
in a month of an hour and a half it is and we see the hour these how can be proven wrong

[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:55.440]
he might be kicking big fat hairy ass but I don't think so

[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:01.520]
now it's only our time pool Obama 46 foot and 43 the brand new pool just came out

[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:06.180]

[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:42.160]
I'm I'm I'm already spending I my money is spent before I even make it oh swallowing by the way

[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.660]
lying as she usually does during a news conference in Burbank a reporter asked swallowing about a

[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:51.720]
reason he did exchange said we've taken place between the senator and New York governor Bill Richardson

[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:56.200]
New Mexico whatever I said governor in which he's alleged to have insisted that her opponent

[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:05.540]
senator Barack Obama could not win the upcoming election now what's this pool February 24th what

[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:14.920]
is that 54 to 38 favorite opinion democrats CBS New York Times pool Obama oh look at that and

[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:20.840]
swallowing has got a higher favorable opinion oh bomb supporter of course chairman of the Senate

[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.800]
and that'll services committee senator thank you very much for joining us I know this is a very

[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:31.220]
busy period for you right here what do you think about the two candidates back and forth

[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:37.360]
constant attack and counter attack on first of all we got elective with the white here and the

[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:43.580]
reports that Hillary and Bill Clinton have been you know telling Bill Richardson and others and

[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:49.660]
others super delegates supposedly that Barack Obama is not electable what is going on behind the

[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.480]
well it's a it's too long a time between primaries that's what's going on I and uh

[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:59.000]
trying to fill the space with something so every nuance every syllable that gets uttered gets

[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.340]
that's right what he's trying to say is that every time somebody fights everybody wants to know

[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:07.260]
what flavor it was what they have for breakfast am I right you bet you know Clinton responds we've

[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:11.000]
been going back and forth in this campaign about who said what to whom I don't talk about private

[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.700]
conversations but I've consistently made the case that I can win because I believe I can win

[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.820]
and you know sometimes people rather confusions what I'm saying somebody else can't win I can win

[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:24.840]
I know I can win that's what I do this every day and that's what my campaign is about I'm

[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:32.480]
into when I intend to do just that that's a no whatever that means I can do this and I can do

[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:37.280]
that's all she talks about she don't talk about him she's qualified John McAnne is qualified

[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:42.440]
about that other fella he ain't you know he ain't qualified and he can't win but she can

[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:50.660]
so yeah she should probably think about when in 2000 no not a 92 when Bill won the primary

[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:55.980]
yeah you know he finally got his you know the full approval or whatever in August or something

[01:43:55.980 --> 01:44:00.300]
like that I'm thinking no or June or whatever I'm like no that was just one of those official but he

[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:05.940]
won it way before that and plus we started two months later they started two months later back then

[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:14.740]
exactly oh here's the nationwide poll with Obama against McCain Barack Obama 47 John McCain 42

[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.480]
have washed them up close I don't mind what's going on right now at this point I think Barack

[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:25.720]
Obama has it right he's not calling for Hillary Clinton to get out of the race she'll make the right

[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.740]
decision at the right time like tomorrow would be good come on so we'll read and do it

[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:34.200]
now who wrote this thing I'm gonna read now John Nichols on the Nation yes

[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.180]
good timing to just right up to the break excellent no side got this down to a science now

[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:44.260]
yeah now you want to take any more of those great calls if we had one guy on there we have

[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:49.500]
out the numbers man what because there's none there's none on the boat right now I'm not talking

[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:53.320]
about right now plus we got the 82nd delay I got we got to do the break I'm talking about like after

[01:44:53.320 --> 01:45:00.300]
the break okay I asked you do you want to take them I would like that yes we would yes can I

[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:03.920]
read this first though sure please do I Nichols in the Nation endorsements and focus

[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:09.400]
eight Obama and Pennsylvania Congressman John Murth of the Pennsylvania Democratic to come on a

[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.160]
Hillary Clinton's most ardent backers in recent days toward reporters of the day that the New York

[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:18.780]
Senator will win a state's April 22 primary by a double digit margin a new Pennsylvania pulled by

[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:25.140]
KDKATV and survey USA has Clinton just 12 points ahead 53 to 41 of Obama who after a dislocated

[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:29.880]
march is now refocused on the race and pouring time and money into the keystone state a

[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:34.880]
Rasmussen report survey from the same time period has it even closer with Clinton 47 Obama 42

[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.580]
the KDKATV which was conducted too early to capture the full impact of popular Pennsylvania Senator

[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:44.840]
Casey's enthusiastic endorsement of Obama the Illinois Senator's campaign and expensive investment

[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:50.480]
TV ads almost certainly suggests too wide a margin the Rasmussen survey has the race of good deal

[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.140]
closer than any experienced observer in Pennsylvania think things stand right now but here's the best

[01:45:55.140 --> 01:46:00.340]
bet at this point Murth will be proven wrong Obama's commitment to fight for Pennsylvania which

[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:05.180]
only came in a serious way last week will make the primary results closer than Clinton's 54 to 44 win

[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:09.900]
in Ohio in fact it could be much closer the Obama campaign has taken a lot of hits in the past

[01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.000]
month but it's also learned a few things the candidate will spend the right amount of time on

[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.980]
the ground on the state his attention that of his campaign will not be divided as it was when the

[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:22.520]
Ohio and Texas primaries fell on the same day and the Illinoisan has a much more prominent backer

[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:26.860]
in Casey than he had in Ohio where the states stopped Democrats either backed Clinton or South

[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:31.520]
the race out indeed while the Rasmussen pulled his two optimistic at this point Clinton's final

[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:36.740]
margin of victory could well be within the five point range and if Obama focuses on economic issues

[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:41.680]
especially trade policy in a smart way he might yet gain the advantage for that to happen however

[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:45.540]
he must win the endorsement of the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers Union and the United

[01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:49.980]
Mineworkers Union that remains a significant force in the state southwestern counties along the West

[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:56.100]
Virginia border there's something really strange about that part of Pennsylvania yeah it's

[01:46:56.100 --> 01:47:01.120]
craggy like West Virginia all the mountains there the Appalachia mountains craggy ever been there

[01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:09.140]
yeah you have yeah do you know were you like a wheeling downs racetrack why that didn't stay

[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:12.240]
there for very long just kind of like drove through it a couple dozen times but yeah

[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:12.360]
yeah

[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:15.960]
you know what we do

[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:20.000]

[01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.220]

[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:36.180]

own taxes none i mean they were talking about a waste of time so you have no idea with that ticket

[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:27.140]
it's subliminal and you know make a lot of people think of the ticket which probably isn't what you

[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:30.960]
want to do if you're smart right want to put like something subliminal either it'll be like

[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:34.880]
the coke running and saying Pepsi Pepsi like that you know i don't think they would do that

[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:41.360]
would they that's not the ticket no so maybe when the book came out maybe that's why they

[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:50.220]
gave us they stuck it stick it and like that i don't know like i said there's there's a diminishing

[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:13.740]
an effing a horror oh well i hope she don't get suspended like Randy there you know

immoral woman two male who engages in sex acts for money or three a vinal or unscrupulous person

[01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:34.740]
Lane ladies and gentlemen John McCain is a big effing a horror says Allison

[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.100]
John McCain is an embarrassment of contradictions he claims to be a man of the people but

[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:44.260]
has fed his life surrounding himself with only the finest pedigrees of elite rich wasps he pretends

[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:49.580]
to be a proponent of political reform when in fact he chronically dips into the lobbyist cookie jar

[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:54.560]
he sold his soul for the fringe right vote once a strict non interventionist conservative

[01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:59.900]
McCain is now leading the campaign for expansionist policies all of these realities blatantly

[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:03.960]
contradict the McCain presented to the public a straight talker who's above the filthy game of politics

[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:09.720]
John McCain is in short a horror mad welch carefully explains in McCain the myth of a

[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:15.860]
maverick how the McCain of yesterday transformed into a lobbyist humping lying horror in 1983 the

[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:18.940]
unconversed been votes against the mission were standard of flamenary aspirants and Lebanon

[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:24.780]
he gave the following speech the fundamental question is what what is the united states interest

[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:29.420]
in Lebanon it is said we're there to keep the peace i ask what peace it said we're there to aid

[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:33.480]
the government i ask what government it said we're there to stabilize the region i asked who can

[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:39.220]
the u.s. who can the u.s. presence stabilize the region i think it means how but nevertheless

[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:43.920]
says what it says what can be expected we withdraw from Lebanon the same as will happen if we stay

[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.580]
i acknowledge at the level of fighting will increase if we leave i regretfully acknowledge

[01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:51.300]
that many instance civilians will be heard but i firmly believe this will happen in any event

[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:55.840]
where was that john McCain when we needed him sadly he's buried beneath campaign contributions

[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:01.400]
and rising lobbyists McCain that is the 2008 horror McCain is more concerned with living

[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:05.960]
the presence of them from winning any kind of consistent message it was very very anti-war

[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:10.520]
until he wasn't meaning until it became clear that war was popular around the time of the first

[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:15.240]
Gulf War then a wolf straight talking horror McCain changes entire life story didn't

[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:19.760]
genomic canas always been for the surge he's always been a military man except when he wasn't but

[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:24.880]
that doesn't matter anymore john McCain is a rich a leadist who never stepped out of his war

[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:29.960]
mongering ancestors shadows he was enabled academy punk who transitioned nicely into a role of

[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:35.020]
pissed off old curmudgeon he's a rich mean man who holds a grudge he was so mean in fact that

[01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:42.480]
his friends nicknamed him mcnasty now what did you expect me oh i'm back to you everything that comes

[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:50.180]
in so you know go and look any income that a US citizen earns world wide is taxable if you win the

[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:53.760]
jackpot and canter any other winnings or any's you're required to report it to the US and pay US

[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:58.560]
taxes on it wrong in addition if you give up your US citizenship so you don't have to pay taxes

[01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:05.560]
you won't be allowed back into the country also wrong whoever heard of such crap in other words

[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.220]
there are people who become citizens of other country and they're not allowed back to the

[02:00:08.220 --> 02:00:15.020]
whoever wrote this is about to be m-o-r-o-n like most says there are no taxes on any jackpot

[02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:22.440]
winnings here no matter where once you come okay period there is nobody there to report to there

[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:26.020]
is nobody there like in Vegas you know how they come around the amphitheater a little form yes

[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:31.040]
that there's no such person there's no such activity going on it doesn't exist here okay

[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:36.620]
so whoever wrote this crap on this unsigned facts with no header on it is it even got a header

[02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:42.340]
right now it's got nothing if you win the jackpot and canter they were no you're not no you were not

[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.540]
idiot moron and if you're and who's giving up their US citizenship who's saying

[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:58.200]
anything about that that guy schmuck Australia's prime minister came under Faradah

[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:02.860]
home Friday over a playful salute he gave to president Bojah to NATO summit meeting which critics

[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:09.500]
said seemed to suggest Australia and subservience to Washington Australian television repeatedly

[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:13.680]
broadcast videos of the gesture yesterday on the sidelines of the book arrest summit and speculated

[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:18.980]
about what it meant while opposition lawmakers said it'd be little Australia we're not the 51st

[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:24.840]
state of the US America and by the way let me just interrupt my story here if you're like Canadian in

[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:28.340]
fact they were on spot for it there's a place they can go to where they get your money back

[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:33.080]
if you're Canadian go to Vegas and they take money out of the jackpot you can get it back when

[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:39.640]
you come back to Canada really yes wow yeah you have to be Canadian citizen or just like living in Canada

[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:45.500]
like you are I don't know well I'm sure I can I'm American citizen if I went to Vegas I still have

[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:51.400]
to pay the same tax but if you're Canadian citizen or if any other country you can get your money back

[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:59.040]
that's pretty cool if any other country that doesn't tax winnings Australian television

[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:02.460]
repeatedly broadcast videos of the gesture yesterday on the sidelines of the book arrest summit

[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:06.200]
and speculated about what it meant while opposition lawmakers said it'd be little Australia

[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:10.960]
we're not the 51st state of the US of America and Mr. Rutsalouk here at a subservient

[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:16.120]
connotation many Australians well like said Bob Brown leader of the minor opposition greens party

[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:21.120]
the salute revive memories of southeast Asian countries including Malaysia

[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:25.120]
accusing Australia and their former Prime Minister John Howard of being too close to Bush

[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:30.300]
and too willing to adopt hawk issue as foreign policy. Rod explained he was just being friendly

[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:33.820]
to a world leader whom he had met for the first time as Prime Minister a week earlier in Washington

[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:36.900]
it was just a joke he said I was just saying hi to the President of the USA

[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.620]
he could have flipped him the burdens at high too how you doing Fred and flipped him a couple of these

[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:48.140]

[02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:59.380]
about yeah everybody's an expert and you know the interesting part of it is that all these experts

[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:04.140]
most have never stood foot outside the country not even the like Guadalajara or something like that

[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:11.920]
