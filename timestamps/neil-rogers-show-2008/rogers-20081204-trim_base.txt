[00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.580]
Music spreads on the previous programs,

[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.700]
or those of the host, Gatlin and Collin,

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.860]
and did not reflect those,

[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.500]
usually broadcasts great hits.

[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.300]
We try to set.

[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.920]
I'm trying to tell you.

[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.580]
The biggest thing, host of this talent.

[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.740]
What's your fan say?

[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.540]
Listening to voices right now.

[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.200]
560 WQAM.

[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.560]
I mean, why do I do own song projects

[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.040]
and do spot-stoolings now?

[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.480]
Huh?

[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.320]
That show is just one wall-to-wall commercial.

[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.280]
There's one that sounds like.

[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.980]
560 WQAM presents.

[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.400]
The Neil Rogers Show.

[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.700]
To the Carpennil,

[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.940]
Diagonist 567,

[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.200]
O560 in Dade and Broward.

[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.280]
In other counties,

[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.420]
called toll-free.

[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.820]
We painted the oven and settled in 5 Neil.

[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.340]
I've got to say,

[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.420]
I went by 60 on your Vantiente and T,

[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.480]
and for a while,

[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.100]
it's fun.

[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.600]
So, yeah?

[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.200]
The opinions expressed by Neil,

[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.840]
his guests,

[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.760]
or his colleagues,

[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.460]
do not reflect those,

[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.720]
or don't use QAM Manacan.

[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.240]
By the way, Joe Bell is a rapper

[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.820]
about now,

[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.020]
as Neil Rogers shows.

[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.560]
I think the news is 60 WQAM.

[00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.200]
Oh, God!

[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.780]
The most talked about film of the year,

[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.640]
is now,

[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.820]
the musical event of the year,

[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.060]
the broke-back mountain soundtrack.

[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.480]
It's Rain Man.

[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.120]
Hallelujah, it's Rain Man.

[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.160]
It's Rain Man.

[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.800]
The songs you love,

[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.860]
from the movie,

[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.700]
you're afraid to admit you love.

[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.300]
Oh, no, no, I...

[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.760]
I will survive,

[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.340]
and long time no how to live.

[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.180]
I know I'll stay alive.

[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.820]
Strap on your leather chaps,

[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.260]
and yell,

[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.300]
write him cowboy.

[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.540]
The broke-back mountain soundtrack.

[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.280]
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.160]
It's fun to stay at the YMCA.

[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.500]
They have everything.

[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.360]
You've freedom.

[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.780]

[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.360]
You enjoy.

[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.540]
You can hang out with all the boys.

[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.580]
Oh, they love more.

[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.240]
It sounds goodies.

[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.960]
I was speaking to Goodie,

[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.040]
so since we left yesterday

[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.560]
to a clock,

[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.760]
I've been scouring the earth for a Joe Jonas.

[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.680]
I can't find him.

[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.400]
Damn it.

[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.880]
Really?

[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.100]
Now, I got some interesting,

[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.320]
couple interesting stories

[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.180]
that happened yesterday,

[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.640]
and I just want to reiterate something I told you before,

[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.100]
and you think I'm joking, I'm sure of it.

[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.400]
By the way, don't forget to go see George Saturday.

[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.100]
It's his birthday,

[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.940]
and he's doing an appearance.

[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.360]
I'll give you all the info.

[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.420]
Get a pencil and paper.

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.320]
Write it on your wrist.

[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.420]
I think the ought to be...

[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.860]
And by the way,

[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.800]
court is, if you're listening,

[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.720]
which you probably aren't,

[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.440]
you're, check his in with George's in the mail.

[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.660]
See how I take care of everybody?

[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.180]
Yep.

[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.020]
But that might end one of these days,

[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.200]
because like I told you,

[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.360]
one day you're going to come in there in the morning,

[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120]
and you're going to have the pot open,

[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.100]
smoking it,

[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.140]
and you're going to be listening for me.

[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.960]
You're going to be listening for the sound of that city

[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.460]
Pulse 24 that you hear every morning,

[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.860]
and you won't hear it.

[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.580]
I don't think you're joking.

[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.640]
Oh, I'm not joking at all.

[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.880]
I'm not saying it is going to happen,

[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.520]
but it's just my,

[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.260]
I'm just alerting the world.

[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.260]
Not that that many people care anymore.

[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.580]
You know, when I got the email yesterday about somebody

[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.040]
where ever the hell they were doing business in this,

[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.980]
and said, you want to have Neil on,

[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.800]
Neil show on the radio in here,

[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.080]
and they said, oh, is he still on the air?

[00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.320]
Yeah.

[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.380]
And that's not the first time we've heard that.

[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.200]
We hear that all the time.

[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.680]
And if Joe Bell were as concerned with, you know,

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]
promoting the radio station,

[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.720]
is with his hissy fit with the guys across the street.

[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.820]
See, this is what it's all he generated into.

[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.180]
It's a hissy fit between this place.

[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.380]
Now, I thought when Drew Rosen,

[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.860]
well, what the guy was a guy's name, Joel Feinberg.

[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.360]
I thought once he left across the street,

[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.300]
maybe it might, you know, book up a little bit,

[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.840]
and it wouldn't be so childish and juvenile,

[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.280]
but when you got jolly Joe Bell with his mean,

[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.620]
spirited nasty temper,

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.500]
and you got a bunch of losers over there

[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.440]
pretending that they were,

[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.940]
they got some claim to fame.

[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.040]
It's just a childish game that never ends.

[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.180]
Am I right?

[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.620]
Yes.

[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.780]
Am I correct?

[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.440]
Absolutely.

[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.380]
Absolutely.

[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.780]
Yes.

[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.800]
I don't care about them.

[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.960]
I don't care about that station.

[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.560]
I don't care about all sports radio.

[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.220]
I don't care about Drew Rosenstein.

[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.860]
I don't care about the Ira Windbag.

[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.500]
I don't care about who's the other one,

[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.460]
that Alex Marvez,

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.640]
on and on and on,

[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.760]
with the same non-indity people all the time.

[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.040]
It reminds me of what's his name on MSNBC?

[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.340]
Chris Mathews.

[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.320]
No, Keith Oberman.

[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.600]
Oh.

[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.500]
I like Oberman a lot, as you know.

[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.400]
I think he's the best, you know, of that breed.

[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.960]
But my God, how many times can you see these same people on there?

[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.060]
Howard Feynman and then the two token black guys,

[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.780]
I don't even know their names anymore.

[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.280]
The one with the skinny face who looks like he needs the sandwich real battery is going to croak.

[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.600]
Good.

[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.280]
God.

[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.300]
Over and over.

[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.860]
And we get people knocking this show.

[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.880]
At least every day we come on with different crap, you know.

[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.740]
And maybe it's different crap.

[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.560]
Maybe crap, but at least it's different crap every single day.

[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.140]
As opposed to people who feed you the same people who have nothing to say.

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.440]
I mean, nothing to say.

[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.280]
Zero.

[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.300]
Zipity Duda.

[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.040]
What's Drew Rosenstein got to say except sucking ass parts.

[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.980]
He's got all of his clients because he's making millions of dollars promoting them.

[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.140]
And what wonderful people they are.

[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.520]
I want a great contribution.

[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.540]
They've made to the human race.

[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.220]
Oh my God.

[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.880]
Are you smitten me or what?

[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.180]
So like I said, just be on alert.

[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.820]
And then of course, then you can have the show.

[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.920]
I'm sure they'll pay you the big buck.

[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.300]
Well, that would be a nice thing to do for you.

[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.920]
You've certainly earned it.

[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.780]
You've earned your wings.

[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.400]
Yeah.

[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.200]
Tell them that.

[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.700]
The Dow is up two points.

[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.440]
Well, the big three are back there in Washington.

[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.660]
And then we're waiting the CEO's testimony again.

[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.160]
I wonder if they flew in in their private corporate jets again.

[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.880]
Probably not.

[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.680]
Yeah, I think they walked this time.

[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.080]
Yeah, this time they rode bicycles.

[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.640]
Yeah.

[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.720]
Pricicles.

[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.700]
So anyway, yesterday here's the first story.

[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.140]
And then I'll get to the Joe Bell email.

[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.400]
This man is just.

[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.180]
I don't know how to describe him.

[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.080]
He's not an adult.

[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.000]
He's not a businessman.

[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.160]
He's not a human being.

[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.300]
He's just a child.

[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.620]
I'm not interested.

[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.000]
He sends me an email last night with audio from Sid Rosencrantz

[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.620]
and where he said,

[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.660]
I know from across the street,

[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.360]
five minutes of nothing,

[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.740]
of absolute nothing.

[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.560]
And of how great they are and about how jealous we are and how we're,

[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.040]
we're, we have an agenda.

[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.740]
Yeah, we, some of us have an agenda here.

[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.380]
We'd like to win.

[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.500]
That's why we show up every day.

[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.540]
We want, we want to compete.

[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.400]
We want to win.

[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.300]
And we want to get paid.

[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.440]
That's the most important part.

[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.100]
But aside from getting paid,

[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.280]
we also believe in winning.

[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.960]
Our Charlie Joe Bell.

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.020]
That's not in his vocabulary.

[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.600]
He just wants to be a child.

[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.500]
He wants to throw a spitballs.

[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.820]
Oh, did you hear what that said?

[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.880]
I don't care what Sid Rosenberg said.

[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.140]
Okay.

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.760]
If I never heard his name again,

[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.620]
it would be too soon.

[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.880]
He has much to do about nothing.

[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.600]
He gets one and two shares,

[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.140]
one point eight, two point three.

[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.460]
He has accomplished nothing in this market,

[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.660]
except alienating a lot of people,

[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.740]
making a lot of people get the he be,

[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.280]
G.B.s.

[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.960]
And as far as Jorge Siddano is concerned,

[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.720]
nice supermarket.

[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.020]
That's about all I can say for you.

[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.980]
He's a wannabe.

[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.440]
And they must have mentioned my name

[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.600]
in that five minute period of time,

[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.900]
a dozen times,

[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.740]
and the fake Barry Jackass.

[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.180]
And Neil Rogers has been saying,

[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.960]
there's something we don't care.

[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.700]
Well, Pekka Siddano,

[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.200]
he said, okay, go to Syria.

[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.080]
Score every one to go.

[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.800]
Go to hell.

[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.140]
I don't care.

[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.680]
I heard him one time in my lifetime.

[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.720]
And yesterday is the first time I ever heard Siddano

[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.180]
in that clip,

[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.020]
and believe me,

[00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.940]
if I never heard him again,

[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.060]
it would be much too soon.

[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.960]
These are people pretending to be broadcasters.

[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.080]
This whole fantasy that goes on,

[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.600]
oh, it's us against the ticket,

[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.720]
ticket, ticket, ticket.

[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:12.880]
And you put the numbers together

[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.800]
and you still got crap.

[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.940]
You still got squat.

[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.440]
And you got that too.

[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.120]
Oh, my God.

[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.720]
So anyway, here's my Woodbuying story.

[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.420]
Besides the fact I lost my ass,

[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.840]
although not as bad as I was losing.

[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.280]
Oh, God, when it looks like you're going to have a disaster

[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.560]
and then you get a whole bunch of it back,

[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.320]
thanks to Quick Hit.

[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.460]
I took a quick shmit after Quick Hit

[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.360]
because, boy,

[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.080]
it was still not a good day.

[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.560]
But that's neither here nor there.

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.340]
You have a good day.

[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.960]
You have bad days.

[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.760]
It's a sucker game.

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.520]
You know, the Schlotz.

[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.560]
Dollar Schlotz, quarter Schlotz.

[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.640]
Don't.

[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.420]
So I go to play the two cent Quick Hit,

[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.020]
which are very tough to get a machine

[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.280]
because there's only like, I think,

[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.340]
ten machines.

[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.760]
You know, there's a Kyrussell,

[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.240]
and there's five on one side, five on the other.

[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.220]
And they're very popular because a lot of these stiffs,

[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.440]
they sit there and play like 20 credits.

[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.980]
You know, 40 cents a play.

[00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.800]
I mean, what is that?

[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.680]
They just have the machine.

[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.000]
But that's what a lot of people do.

[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.800]
And if they don't have any money,

[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.820]
they can sit there and play for a long time.

[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:05.980]
So it's something to get a machine.

[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.680]
So I get a machine,

[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.820]
and I'm sitting there and I'm feeding and feeding,

[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.220]
and it's dead as a door nail.

[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.720]
No bonus games, no nothing.

[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:13.700]
Dead.

[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.260]
And I'm stuck there because, you know,

[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.340]
unless I want to go back and throw my money away

[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:18.960]
and wheel a fortune.

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.300]
Now the guy to my left,

[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.000]
he gets up and leaves, okay?

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:23.820]
Okay.

[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.780]
I've got quite a few credits in my machine,

[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.300]
so I pressed the button to get the ticket.

[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.120]
And I reach over to put the ticket,

[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.240]
ticket, ticket, ticket,

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.260]
and the machine that he's leaving, okay?

[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.000]
You're following this because I want to try a certain machine.

[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:34.920]
Because the one I'm playing,

[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.380]
I know for sure, is dead as a door nail.

[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.920]
And I don't want to keep feeding it all morning.

[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.760]
So I start to slide over to the empty machine.

[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.680]
And as I do,

[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.020]
behind me stands a tall,

[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.120]
middle-aged, nasty looking.

[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.900]
I mean, with a look on her face with glasses,

[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.340]
islands woman.

[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.180]
I don't know if they don't want to say she's Jamaican

[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.700]
or a Trinidad or other islands man, you know?

[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.440]
And what have I always told you about those women?

[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:58.760]
Yes.

[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.260]
Condescending, imperious, obnoxious.

[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.140]
Not all of them, just the ones that I've encountered.

[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.380]
And this woman, no exception.

[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.260]
Oh, I was going to play this machine.

[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.780]
I said, well, here's an open one right here,

[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.580]
the one I'm getting off of.

[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.980]
No, no, you were playing that machine.

[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.200]
You stay there, you play that one.

[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.520]
I said, listen, don't tell me what machine I'm going to play.

[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.960]
I don't want to play that machine anymore.

[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.360]
It's open.

[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.480]
If you want it, there you go.

[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.120]
Have a good time.

[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.560]
And she gives me a real dirty,

[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.260]
surly look like, oh, man, I'm going to get you a man.

[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.400]
I'm going to put an evil, dead chicken on your door.

[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.040]
And so I start sliding over to the other machine.

[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.380]
I've already stuck my ticket in there,

[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.640]
so I got credits in the machine.

[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.040]
And as I start, I'm like half standing, half sitting.

[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.440]
I mean, I'm like sliding over.

[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.060]
As I start to push my ass down further into what I think is the chair,

[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.360]
she pulls, she pulls it about two thirds of the way back.

[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.560]
She pulls the chair away.

[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.980]
Now, luckily, I sat down before she could pull it all the way back

[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.080]
and I wound up sitting on the front edge of the chair.

[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.080]
My cheeks on the front edge of the chair.

[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.960]
Now, she had pulled it a little further right

[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.080]
and sat down a little more slowly.

[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.960]
I wound up taking a fall.

[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.740]
And who knows, maybe, break my neck, break.

[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.540]
Who knows what?

[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.220]
And if you ever encountered anything like that

[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.980]
where somebody tried to pull a chair out from under you?

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.160]
No, not lately, no.

[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.560]
And I looked at her and I said, you crazy bitch.

[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.380]
Wow, making sure to be as loud as,

[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.040]
and oh, you were nasty, man.

[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.920]
You were nasty, man.

[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.120]
I said, you're very crazy.

[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.160]
Nobody pulls a chair out from somebody over a machine.

[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.660]
There's an empty one right there.

[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.660]
She never did play it.

[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.120]
And the one that I got onto was dead as the other one.

[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.180]
And as she walked away, I said, you crazy bitch.

[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.380]
Just to make sure everybody in a hole within hearing distance could hear it.

[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.800]
And she gave me this wound and looked, oh, man, you're such a nasty man, man.

[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.520]
You're such a nasty man.

[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.200]
You're such a nasty man.

[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.140]
Yeah.

[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.940]
Screw you, you nasty bitch.

[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.460]
And let's go back to Trindedad and Tobago,

[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.000]
where the hell you came from, with your condescending suck whole attitude.

[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.720]
What a bitch.

[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:58.480]
God.

[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.360]
Anyway, here's the appell result.

[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.280]
Then after the break, I'll get to the Joe Bell story.

[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.060]
I might spend the whole rest of the day on the Joe Bell story

[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.700]
because it typifies what's wrong with this place.

[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.680]
And boy, there's so much.

[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.240]
Although I do have that one email with S. Quinn.

[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.180]
They're going to help us out.

[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.420]
Oh, Quinn.

[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.340]
Some of you people are really hysterical.

[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.640]
What past features of the NeoRodger show when you like resurrected?

[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.960]
We got 1,250 votes.

[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.620]
That's a lot.

[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.040]
There's Chris Doddy, still left like Jerry Williams, only Chris is still alive.

[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.260]
1,250 votes.

[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.060]
That's pretty good, ain't it?

[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.240]
Funny.

[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.560]
Bits, 344.

[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.720]
We got a whole bunch of them too bad.

[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.020]
We can't play them anymore.

[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.200]
Joyce won't let us.

[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.080]
Fart sounds, 332.

[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.300]
We got a whole variety of those.

[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.060]
Different sounds, different smells.

[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.140]
But we can't play those.

[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.140]
Joyce won't let us.

[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.480]
Cross over talk with subsequent or prior talk host 127.

I'm not telling you.

[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:10.840]

[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:33.620]
Do not, do not, do not, do not, do not, do not, don't, do not, do not, do that, do not

[00:33:37.740 --> 00:34:07.660]
Don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do

[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:31.700]
this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do it, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this, don't do this

[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:38.080]
Why is it that fat ass Joe Bell thinks is this compulsive?

[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.480]
I mean, are we supposed to all is it mandatory that we all have to be as concerned about the

[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.920]
morons across the street as he is?

[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.020]
We don't compete with them, jolly, Joe.

[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.460]
We have nothing to do with them on the show.

[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.120]
This is not a sports show.

[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.560]
And even though they lied about it during that clip, once they go syndicated, oh, and

[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.340]
let me say something to them too, the morons across the street, even though I don't

[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.140]
care about them at all, the fact of the matter is that all these rumors that we put on

[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.520]
the ear, they come from over there.

[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.740]
The rumors about over there come from over there.

[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:07.640]
Come from inside.

[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.260]
You got moles inside your building.

[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.060]
So instead of giving us a bunch of crap, oh gee, they keep putting all these lies on

[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.500]
the ear.

[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.680]
No, we keep putting stuff on the ear that people in your building are putting out there

[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.360]
for the public, for public consumption.

[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.780]
And the thing about them going syndicated beginning of the year from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., that's

[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.420]
a pretty good authority from what we hear.

[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:32.900]
Ain't it?

[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:33.960]
Yep.

[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.220]
But getting back to my question, why does fat ass Joe Bell think that we should be obsessed

[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:39.680]
with them?

[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.880]
First of all, I'm not obsessed with anybody else on the year.

[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.320]
I show up here to do this show every day.

[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.800]
If you like it, the price is right.

[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.340]
Here we are.

[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.540]
And if not, see ya.

[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.060]
Bye-bye.

[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.180]
That's the way it goes.

[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.300]
That's the way it works.

[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:49.640]
Hmm.

[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:50.700]
Yeah.

[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.480]
What a concept.

[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.220]
And twice a month, I expect you get paid.

[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.420]
That's about it.

[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.160]
It's all there is.

[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.420]
There ain't nothing else going on with us.

[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.060]
There ain't no promotion.

[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.080]
There ain't no sales effort.

[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:01.900]
There ain't no nothing.

[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.240]
Nothing.

[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.040]
There ain't no discussion about this show during sales meetings, promotion meetings, any

[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.580]
kind of meetings.

[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.440]
Other than that faggot.

[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.380]
And whatever they call you guys.

[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.100]
Oh, who does?

[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.720]
Brandy and Coral Springs says before I get back to my 6 hour rant on jolly joe Bell.

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.620]
Oh, be funny instead, Neil.

[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:19.960]
Come on.

[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.680]
Try to be funny.

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.380]
I forgot.

[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.300]
Brandy says I like this pool.

[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.580]
Neil, my biggest pet peeve is older men who wear backwards baseball cap.

[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.560]
Do they think that they're a 13-year-old?

[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.880]
Do they think that they're a pro baseball player?

[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.180]
Why do they do that?

[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.480]
Whenever I see a man doing that, I want to go up to him and ask him why.

[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.340]
Just go right up to him and say, and then pull the cheer out from underneath him.

[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.000]
There's nobody commented on that.

[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.420]
In my life, I've never heard of such a thing.

[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.820]
Have you?

[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.260]
No.

[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.120]
Somebody pulling it here out from somebody who's about to sit down, especially a dollar.

[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.180]
I mean, playing like me.

[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.440]
Playing a joke on a friend.

[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:00.480]
You know, we used to be that.

[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.580]
No, no, this wasn't a joke.

[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.660]
I'm talking about the only aim.

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:03.860]
Boring that.

[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.740]
There's a gesture of hostility.

[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.880]
Anyway, she says I want to go up to him and ask him why.

[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.100]
However, I guess that would be rude.

[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.320]
Neil, please ask any of the demotes who actually do this to email or call you and tell you why.

[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.540]
I must have the answers as Brandy and Coral Springs.

[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:19.800]
Well, we put it out there.

[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.980]
Brandy, we'll see if we get a response.

[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:21.640]
Probably not.

[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.780]
Probably get more from that USMC 44.

[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.620]
You a whole FU whatever.

[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.760]
Ranges, ranges.

[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.800]
Yeah, Ranges had to win in a shootout.

[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.420]
I see last night against the penguins, huh?

[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:35.620]
Ranges.

[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.200]
They're kind of like crumbling lately.

[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.700]
They're starting to like rattle, rattle, rattle a little bit.

[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.520]
Bring back the ghost of Eddie Jockeman.

[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.700]
Old time hockey.

[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:45.760]
Give me a break.

[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.960]
That's definitely Nifo.

[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.940]
Well, what else is he going to do?

[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.140]
You know, he's got that morning show on the station at nobody.

[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.240]
Nobody even knows where the hell to find it.

[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.400]
Here's one that says, I have a good idea.

[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:03.500]
How about asking Joe Bell if he would allow you to swap your summer schedule and do it in the winter instead of the summer?

[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.360]
Well, I'll be off tomorrow.

[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.180]
See it.

[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.160]
If you would allow that, then you could go down to Florida for those months and avoid the brutal Canadian winters.

[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.180]
Don't bother me, none.

[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.600]
No snow on the ground yet.

[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.380]
It's cold, but I can handle it.

[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.680]
It's going to be minus six tonight.

[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.500]
What is that minus six Celsius?

[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.140]
Let me look about 20.

[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:28.060]
About 20.

[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.460]
Very good.

[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.740]
Well, good at that.

[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.840]
I'm really good.

[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.980]
I told that to Joey, what's his name?

[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:34.700]
Reynolds.

[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:35.480]
No, Joey.

[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.300]
What are their names?

[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:36.800]
Jonas.

[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:37.360]
Jonas.

[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.180]
See, that's just doesn't, I don't know.

[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:39.800]
Joey Jonas.

[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.660]
That's in Sounder.

[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.280]
Does it?

[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:44.600]
Sound just fine.

[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:49.740]
I didn't realize that Josh Cortis has got the hots for Joey Jonas.

[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.360]
He's got a life of the young guys.

[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:53.880]
I'll tell you that.

[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.180]
Does he?

[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.980]
I can always cancel that check.

[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.120]
You know, I can stop him and on it immediately from the sooner.

[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.500]
Fake Josh Cortis, my aunt says during the two days of week you have to work, you could head across the alligator alley and do the show from Naples.

[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.460]
Or ask manager Alzacquiri if you could use their in-home studios.

[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.740]
Mandage does his show from home?

[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.600]
No, his restaurant down in the Keys, he does it from there sometimes on like a Friday.

[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.040]
But he hasn't been doing that during football season on the thing.

[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.740]
Their boy, they're by avoiding the QM studio saw together.

[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.680]
Of course, it would mean a full schedule during the summer, but it certainly prefer would be in Toronto in the summer than the winter.

[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.400]
Well, guess what?

[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.880]
The reason that they let me do it in the summertime is because the summer book is like, nobody cares about it.

[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.040]
It's a write-off.

[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:33.900]
It's a write-off.

[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.060]
They don't care about the summer book.

[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.140]
Everybody's out of town in the summertime and etc and so on.

[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.260]
Plus, I don't want to do that anyway.

[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:45.440]
Why the hell would I want to give up all my free days during the good weather when they're going to do it in the winter time anyway?

[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:45.780]

[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.720]
They have it backwards.

[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.700]
You got to ask backward.

[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.500]
I'm going to fart real bad here in the second or two and it might just be solid.

[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.020]
Oh, it's from that Joe Bell email.

[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.400]
You might just fart real good.

[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.480]
I did.

[00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.260]
How we did it.

[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:57.440]
All right.

[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.980]
It was nice and medicinal.

[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.560]
That was down seven points.

[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.200]
Up down ten points.

[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.620]
Lister West Palm says, and the last part of this, I don't have any idea what he's talking about.

[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.480]
I'm sure he doesn't either.

[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:10.520]
Michael.

[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.140]
Michael says, Crocs are horrible.

[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.460]
The kind of thing people will ask themselves in ten years, why they wore that.

[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.180]
Media hype.

[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.440]
I don't even know what they are.

[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:18.680]
Croc.

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.120]

[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.560]
What you call them?

[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.660]
Plastic clogs.

[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:22.740]
Plastic clogs.

[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.020]
Yes.

[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.620]
I'll send you a picture.

[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:25.820]
Straight men don't wear them.

[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.480]
No, straight men don't wear them.

[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.140]
Correct.

[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.360]
So it's a fact thing.

[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.700]
Well, you know, like it's a metro-sexual thing.

[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.180]
Oh, metro-sexual mayas.

[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.140]
Don't start with that metro-sexual crap.

[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.640]
You want to know who wears them at the radio session?

[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:40.660]
Who's that?

[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.020]
Beast and Joe Bell.

[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.360]
Oh, a lot of fat people.

[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:45.960]
Man, that was a bad guy.

[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:45.960]

[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:45.960]

[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.220]
Fat guys.

[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.400]
It's where Crocs.

[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.060]
Beast and Joe Bell.

[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.380]
Oh my God.

[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:51.820]
Join it the hip.

[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.320]
I think it's the same person by the way.

[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.320]
One thing nobody talks about with a gemstone.

[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.920]
It goes out about Jeb this and Peanak that and the Audiani.

[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.520]
People ought to remember projects for the New American Century

[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.780]
of which Jeb Bush is a member of that group of Nazis.

[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:05.780]
But they won't.

[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.360]
Oh, he's wildly popular fat ass Jeb Bush.

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:09.660]
Yeah.

[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.360]
And then it says here, the last paragraph.

[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.100]
I don't understand.

[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.380]
Maybe you can interpret this for me.

[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:14.640]
Okay.

[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.400]
I'm a little old and slow and not funny like I used to be.

[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.020]
It says, I agree.

[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.560]
Don't screen calls, but take this city and put them out

[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.260]
whole like before.

[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.960]
It'll take three tards.

[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.400]
It will keep the retards tied up on hold for 10 to 15 minutes

[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.440]
and you cut them right off.

[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.100]
Take the city and put them out whole like before.

[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.320]
Yeah, that's all we ever did.

[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.420]
That's our version of screening and has always ever been.

[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:37.360]
What?

[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.840]
That's all we ever did in the name of screening.

[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.460]
Is take the city.

[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.460]
Oh, I see what it means by today.

[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.480]
I didn't understand what they meant.

[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.100]
It was fine out with city they're calling from.

[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:48.440]
Yeah.

[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.640]
As opposed to Johnny and Lauderdale or what's that guy?

[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:52.420]
That's all we ever do.

[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:52.960]
Yeah, all the time.

[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.720]
Which one?

[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.380]
There's more than one.

[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:57.780]
Stormcat?

[00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:58.740]
Stormcat.

[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.160]
There you go.

[00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.820]
Hey, Stormy.

[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:00.780]
Stormy.

[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.720]
How you doing the ladies, Stormy?

[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.400]
You know, that's the one thing.

[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.520]
It was that way at IOD and that way in the station too.

[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.380]
And that is that there are a lot of people who don't understand that chronic

[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.780]
callers are like the death now.

[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.240]
But it's easy.

[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.180]
It's a crutch, you know.

[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.520]
If you're running to talk to the same half-thousand people every day,

[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.040]
every week, every month, every year, then the same half-thousand people will call you.

[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.820]
Every day, every week, every month, every year.

[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.840]
And the audience will say, oh my God, Stormcat again.

[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.100]
Oh, no.

[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.280]
I sent you an email with a link to the Crocs.

[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.120]
So you can see what they look like.

[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.580]
I don't really care.

[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.500]
I'll just send them all out.

[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:40.900]
I'd rather look at that than listen to five minutes of Sid Rosencrantz in the Jorge Sennano.

[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.060]
Well, they're sure obsessed with me.

[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.640]
I'll tell you that.

[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.000]
And I couldn't give a flying crap less about them.

[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.100]
Any of them over there.

[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.160]
And that evening includes Dan LaBastard.

[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:51.480]
Huh.

[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.600]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.460]
Oh, the Cubans won the World Series.

[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.720]
Not the Marlins.

[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.780]
The Cubans won it.

[00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.680]
Well, we won it.

[00:42:59.820 --> 00:42:59.960]
Yeah.

[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.160]
One of the most disgusting comments ever made in the history of South Florida radio.

[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:05.460]
And he gets off Scott Free.

[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.980]
Like, nobody, I'm the only one even in the made any reference to it.

[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.280]
Because I found it revolting.

[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.560]
How can you turn a sporting event into an ethnic thing, unless maybe the NBA, you know?

[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:19.880]
So what do you think about that bitch that pulled a tear out from under my ass?

[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.420]
I think she's hysterical.

[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.160]
I think if she had achieved it, you would have got more.

[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.700]
The fake Larry Jackass is you plan on playing the clip on the air so we can hear it.

[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.640]
No, I do not.

[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.480]
In addition to which is from there air anyway, we can't play it.

[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.640]
But who the hell would want to?

[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.920]
Here's one from Jacks.

[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.740]
How the hell is Joe Rose allowed to get the left ends on the air?

[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.920]
You can't play something funny like Farts.

[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.440]
Joyce bitch needs to beat religiously.

[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.840]
Needs to beat religiously like fat Chris.

[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.360]
Oh boy, I'm not reading that.

[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.520]
What the hell is wrong with that place?

[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.960]
I'm glad your paychecks keep coming.

[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.540]
You deserve it.

[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.680]
I love you, Neil and George.

[00:43:59.080 --> 00:43:59.440]
I hate you.

[00:43:59.560 --> 00:43:59.860]
Chris.

[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:00.920]
Signed Jacks.

[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:01.580]
Jerks.

[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.780]
That'll be Jerks.

[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.540]
Would you ever do to him?

[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.140]
Nothing.

[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.340]
Got on.

[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:06.560]
Fine.

[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.440]
Here's another one.

[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.820]
I'm not sure if you've talked about this already, but La Bastia has been dropping hints this week

[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.440]
that Sid Rosenberg is leaving for New York.

[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:19.060]
Yesterday, La Bastia was on Sid's show and La Bastia started talking about him leaving for New York soon.

[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.180]
And Sid quickly said, be quiet, man.

[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.160]
You're going to get me in trouble.

[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:23.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.320]
Who cares?

[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.700]
A no-talent New York loser who wants to be back in New York.

[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.840]
Maybe he can get somebody else fired now that he got I'm a scandid first time.

[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.880]
Maybe he can go back to where he can't get him a candy game.

[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.020]
The best talent.

[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.500]
You don't give him a lot of access.

[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.700]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.220]
Think.

[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.400]
Fourth lead.

[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.360]
The biggest name.

[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:45.940]
The best talent.

[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.600]
You're listening to sports Radio 560 WQAM.

[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.340]
My Miami for La D'Aile.

[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.220]
This is the Neil Rogers show.

[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:56.640]
Uh-huh.

[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:57.120]

[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:58.920]
This is your brain.

[00:44:59.120 --> 00:44:59.580]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:01.860]
Any questions?

[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.460]
It's this summer movie giving you that uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach.

[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.620]
You're Harry Potter.

[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.580]
Harry Potter in the order of fries.

[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.540]
Let the feast begin.

[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.960]
Something's going wrong inside me.

[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.480]
Consent right.

[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.080]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.980]
I'm asking this to happen.

[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.540]
I'm telling you.

[00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:31.140]
Harry must use his powers to purge the evil trans fats.

[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.820]
Harry Potter in the order of fries.

[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.040]
At the moment, you've all been waiting for.

[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.660]
That felt good.

[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:39.660]
Everybody.

[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.140]
Just.

[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.960]
Condo.

[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.000]
Trevor.

[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.220]
Waiting PG partial regurgitation required.

[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.140]
Okay, let me tell you one thing about Harry Potter, you know, the kid who plays him,

[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.580]
which I don't know his name and I don't want to know.

[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.400]
Okay.

[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.660]
There's one word to describe.

[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.140]
Okay.

[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:55.920]
Meas.

[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:56.880]
Annoying.

[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.180]
Oh, annoying.

[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.200]
I guess I better read this story because that way it'll stop these 8,000 people from sending it to me.

[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.880]
As if I don't know that Iliana was handed in a hung up twice on Obama.

[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.660]
On and on and on.

[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.740]
Hey, guess what?

[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:13.540]
I put the bedtime stories on our website and this was already on there.

[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:13.940]
I'm sure.

[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.320]
Let me double check and make sure I put it on there.

[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:16.920]
I'm sure I did.

[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.620]
Is it on there?

[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.480]
I'm sure Chris scours those stories religiously all time.

[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:23.500]
You read them?

[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:24.420]
Huh?

[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.180]
Not enough people read them.

[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:26.960]
It's not worth the effort.

[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.120]
Let's see.

[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.260]
Hand-packed Fox owner becoming a, yeah, he's a Rupert Murdoch's making a turn to the left.

[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.980]
Oh, Jake could get 18 years.

[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:35.880]
I'll write her life.

[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.320]
Good.

[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.580]
We'll know soon.

[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.660]
Oh, Jeb Bush considered Senate run.

[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.960]
He ought to run all right fast.

[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.340]
I don't see the thing on there.

[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.120]
Maybe it's not on there.

[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:46.980]
You see it?

[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.240]
Nope.

[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:49.980]
Iliana was Anna.

[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.580]
Dana hangs up twice.

[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.320]
You know?

[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:56.440]
No.

[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:56.680]
No.

[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:58.840]
Well, my bad.

[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.760]
Then I guess I didn't put it on there.

[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.540]
Or maybe Eric, maybe what's his name?

[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.740]
Cortison put it on there.

[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.960]
Well, let me get that check back and deduct half.

[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.760]
He is such a knucklehead, man.

[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.380]
I don't know what the hell do you like about him?

[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.360]
Oh, his hairstyle.

[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.660]
Ditto his Russian girlfriend for a while.

[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.700]
Well, you got no shame at all, man.

[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.760]
I'll tell you one thing about George.

[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.520]
He makes no bones about it.

[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.560]
Yeah.

[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.500]
If he wants something, somehow check.

[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.700]
He just comes right on the air and blurt it right out.

[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.220]
That's right.

[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.040]
Goes and tries to grab it and squeeze it and please it.

[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:29.500]
That's right.

[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.460]
On Wednesday, the Republican Congresswoman, Iliana Rosanna-Danna,

[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.440]
is a little paranoid.

[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.920]
It says got a call from President-elect Barack Obama.

[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.600]
It didn't believe it was him hung up on him twice.

[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.260]
According to Rosalytin's flack, Alex Cruz,

[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.500]
the Congresswoman received the call on her cell phone

[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.240]
from a Chicago-based number and aid informer

[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.560]
that Obama wanted to speak to her.

[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.280]
When he introduced himself, Rosalytin cut him off and said,

[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.680]
I'm sorry, but I think this is a joke

[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.300]
from one of the South Florida radio stations

[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.760]
known for these pranks and she hung up.

[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.140]
Moments later, Obama tried again.

[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.160]
This time through as soon to be chief of staff,

[00:47:59.280 --> 00:47:59.800]
Rahm Emanuel.

[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.380]
Iliana, I can't believe you hung up on the president-elect,

[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.460]
Emanuel said, and then yes, you know what's coming?

[00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.700]
She hung up on Emanuel, saying she didn't believe the call was legit.

[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.540]
A short time later, she received an urgent call from Representative Howard Burman,

[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.040]
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee,

[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.680]
informed that she indeed hung up on Obama.

[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.000]
So, Obama tried again.

[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:16.800]
This time was successful.

[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.080]
It's very funny.

[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.540]
You hung up on me twice, Obama said.

[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.560]
Rosalytin responded by telling Obama that radio stations in South Florida

[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.600]
always make these sort of jokes.

[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.280]
Obama said that similar pranksters reside in Shytown.

[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.340]
You read their very gracious to reach out in such a bipartisan manner

[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.280]
or had run out of folks to call if you're truly calling me

[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.100]
and said in that life, could use a good Obama impersonator like you.

[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.260]
Rosalytin answered, y'all, y'all, y'all.

[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.120]
She then congratulated him on his victory

[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.320]
and pledged to work together on behalf of all Americans

[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.940]
and asked Obama to call Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey

[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.920]
and Representative Albiose C. Ray to discuss Cuba policy.

[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.200]
Oh, God.

[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.480]
Cuba.

[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:51.980]
Cuba.

[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:52.180]
Cuba.

[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:52.440]
K.O.S.

[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:52.820]
Cuban.

[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.560]
The ghost of M.E. Schaefer should infest her ass.

[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.220]
Iliana was probably already has.

[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.840]
The house of 26.

[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:04.360]
Okay.

[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:11.380]
Now, speaking about food, Jeffrey, Jeff from Orlando,

[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.020]
oh, I see they got these places in Orlando.

[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.060]
That's what he's talking about.

[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.380]
See, what's the point of telling me about a place in South Florida

[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.080]
that's out of business?

[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.300]
Right, right.

[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.200]
He says, so I know you were talking about this days ago,

[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.460]
but I finally have some downtime to work to email you about the subject.

[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.340]
Johnny F. and Rockets is good, but there's another burger

[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.240]
placed in Knox, Johnny Rockets on its ass,

[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:35.320]
Cheaper Gritchie burger.

[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.180]
Let's call up a footy.

[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.480]
He's probably got a lot of time on his hands.

[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.420]
We can do a poll on that.

[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.880]
Where can you find the best burger in town?

[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.660]
Their burger simply can't be matched

[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.680]
and their fries and onion rings are some of the best around.

[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.320]
I worked at the Western location in high school

[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.320]
and during semester breaks my first year in college.

[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.540]
Easily the most fun job I've had at this day

[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.940]
and this was back around 2000 to 2003.

[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.080]
Says Jeff.

[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.020]
I recently found out that all South Florida locations have gone under.

[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.000]
They had locations in Pemberg Pines, Weston,

[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.020]
Sawgrass, Mills, Lauderdale,

[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.980]
even the famous one on Los Olos Boulevard.

[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:07.640]
They're all out of business.

[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.760]
I couldn't believe it.

[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.260]
Can anything worth a damn survive in South Florida?

[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.040]
Sonic and out Cheaper Gritchie.

[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.480]
Sincerely, Jeff and Orlando enjoying both Cheaper Gritchie and Sonick and Orlando.

[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.240]
But in South Florida, they're too good.

[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.320]
Now, have you ever eaten it either one of those places?

[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:22.360]
Sonick, yeah.

[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.300]
But not the other one.

[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.060]
Sonick is great.

[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.060]
Is it as good as Johnny F and Rockets?

[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.640]
They're different.

[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:30.200]
How's that?

[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:33.420]
My wife's friends can take it to Sonic for a maybe if I'm lucky.

[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.640]
And what about Cheaper Gritchie?

[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.540]
What about you, Fats?

[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.020]
What's there?

[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.420]
Never get in a cheeseburger and cheeseburger.

[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.460]
And, uh, Edith Sonick's one needs to be down here.

[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:42.440]
And?

[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.320]
It was pretty good.

[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.800]
Like I said, it was more of a different type of food and something like that.

[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.260]
That was pretty good.

[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:48.920]
What does that mean?

[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.200]
A different type of food.

[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.160]
Well, it's a drive up place.

[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.160]
Sounds like double-car.

[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:54.380]
They come out to you.

[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.240]
They come out to your car.

[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.120]
No, I mean, it's good to be right.

[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:57.440]

[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.220]
I mean, it's good to be right.

[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:58.220]

[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:58.800]
That car hops.

[00:50:59.100 --> 00:50:59.460]
Exactly.

[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.720]
And you sit in your car and you say hop on this.

[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.760]
Like you get taillard tots there and then a taillard tots.

[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.120]
Taillard tots.

[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.340]
That's for a goyem, man.

[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.180]
Are you kidding me?

[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:09.900]
Taillard tots?

[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.580]
You could plug those deep into your...

[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:13.980]
Raccoon.

[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:15.320]
And just get up and watch them fall out.

[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.780]
In fact, I wish I had had some taillard tots in my ass yesterday.

[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:18.560]
They were at Woodbuying.

[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.000]
She'd have been in for a big surprise when she pulled that chair away.

[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.440]
And all of a sudden, like...

[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.220]
What much a taillard tots came flying out.

[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.180]
Crazy bitch.

[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.420]
Nobody has responded to that.

[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.560]
Nobody finds that one of the most sub-human stir.

[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:32.160]
It's a true stir.

[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.520]
I couldn't make it up if I wanted to.

[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:36.780]
And I said, you crazy bitch!

[00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.020]
And people are looking like, ooh,

[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.160]
gee, calm down. It's candidate.

[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.620]
Don't get too excited today.

[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.860]
But they're nodding their head like, oh yeah, you're right.

[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:45.860]
She's a crazy bitch.

[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.040]
As if there was any doubt.

[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.740]
Here's one that says this is a follow-up to your question.

[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:54.980]
I haven't listened to Mandage for years.

[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:55.640]
Well, why not?

[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:56.960]
Why the hell not?

[00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:57.600]
All right.

[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.520]
But as I recall, he definitely used to do his show

[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.460]
from his house and the keys.

[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.420]
Sometimes from his restaurant and the keys.

[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.420]
Well, in Miami, he would frequently do his show

[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.160]
from local restaurants.

[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.200]
So it was basically never in the QM studios.

[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:10.100]
Well, if that's true, good move, Mandog.

[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:10.820]
Good move.

[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.760]
Never wants to be in there, huh?

[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:13.940]
Never did it from his house.

[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:15.660]
He would do it from his restaurant down there.

[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.560]
Yeah, see? There's another expert talking crap.

[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:22.180]
And I got your pictures of the clogs, whatever the hell they are.

[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:23.360]
Yeah, Crocs.

[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.400]
Crocs, whatever.

[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.620]
And I don't, uh, you know, the girls, the ones for the guys

[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:28.640]
look really faggy.

[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.360]
Joe says, I'm in my 40s.

[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.740]
I wear my baseball cap almost always went outside.

[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:35.560]
I'll see his sunblock.

[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.220]
And I've had skin cancer in the past.

[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.860]
When the sun is behind me, I wear my baseball cap back.

[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.400]
We're going to block the sun from my neck.

[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.640]
So the person who can't understand the reason for us

[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.020]
noncatchers dressing like one.

[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.500]
I do it for legitimate reason.

[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.740]
So whatever happened to Davey Gravy lines as Joe,

[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.200]
oh, that must be Davey Gravy line.

[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.480]
Here's one that says, I'll vote for Char Hutton.

[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.340]
Thanks again for great show, Best regards Doug.

[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:00.540]
Well, thanks Doug.

[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:01.800]
What about Chieber, Gritieber?

[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.060]
I've never eaten there.

[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:03.860]
No.

[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.100]
It's hard to say it.

[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.080]
Oh, here we go again, picking up right where we left off yesterday.

[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.100]
Brian.

[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.600]
Oh, regarding Prozek, I felt bad for him.

[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.380]
Maybe he's looking for guidance or a friend.

[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.420]
Well, Brian, why don't you go over and be his friend?

[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:17.220]
Be my friend.

[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.480]
Be my friend.

[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.120]
George, if you ever tried to have a conversation with him,

[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.620]
he keeps asking the same things that you keep answering every day.

[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.260]
Sure, this isn't the same email from yesterday.

[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.440]
No, it's the different ones.

[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:27.000]
Just like it.

[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.760]
No. Have you ever tried to have a conversation with Prozek, Ron?

[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.840]
Or ask him to call him once in a while.

[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.000]
No.

[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.200]
Maybe he needs to feel important or a big brother to deal with.

[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.080]
He needs to go away.

[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.600]
Do you guys have pictures of Prozek, Ron and Doran?

[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:37.900]

[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.880]
I think he should help Prozek.

[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:39.680]
Ron, at least he's friendly.

[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.060]
I want to help him off a cliff.

[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.840]
I have to go with his acute-gun in the computer section while he's cute later.

[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:46.540]
Brian.

[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.060]
Yeah, some faggot.

[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:49.060]
Uh-huh.

[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.600]
Some mincing queen.

[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.980]
You can just imagine the faggery going on in that house.

[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.500]
And of course, then that sloppy chick there.

[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.540]
She's the pivot girl.

[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.080]
She's the girlfriend.

[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.100]
You're my girlfriend.

[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.240]
You're my girlfriend.

[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:04.980]
I'm a friend.

[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:10.720]
And the idea that, oh my god, the idea that any of those three that three are like,

[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.120]
intermingling body parts.

[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.260]
Oh, hey, whatever.

[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.200]
Just stop calling.

[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.080]
That's right.

[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:17.660]
Have a good time.

[00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.660]
Do whatever's jumping up high.

[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.200]
Oh, I love it.

[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.260]
Let's go away and leave us the hell alone.

[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.100]
Let us do our show.

[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.460]
Let us do the near-order show.

[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.460]
Not the near-order show.

[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:26.240]
I'll I'll Joe Bell.

[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.220]
The Joe Bell version of the near-order show.

[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.480]
But the real near-order show.

[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.420]
That's what I would like to do.

[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.900]
But of course, we can't do it.

[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:35.720]
I think we ought to take a few calls here today too.

[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.480]
Maybe somebody's got something to say about that bitch that pulled the chair out from under my ass.

[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:40.020]
I would buy.

[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:41.780]
They don't?

[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:42.060]
No.

[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.560]
What's to say about it?

[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:43.900]
Ha-ha.

[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:44.860]
It would have been funny if you'd fallen.

[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.240]
No, then you would have had a story.

[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.900]
You have no idea how close I came to fall on my ass.

[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:54.480]
Now, that don't count.

[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.460]
I think if I mean, I would have fallen on my ass.

[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.600]
I would have waddled myself up and just gone and tackled that bitch.

[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.100]
There you go.

[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.880]
And just beat this snot out of her.

[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:07.000]
Broken nose glasses in her eyes and ground the glass deep into them.

[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.600]
Oh, you're a nasty man.

[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.580]
You're a nasty man.

[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.120]
Get out of here.

[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.300]
Bitch, go play some other machine.

[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.320]
You nasty rotten, hateful bitch.

[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.080]
You sell.

[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.380]
And of course, I'm trying to keep it in perspective.

[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:22.680]
I don't want to become some kind of a racist bastard because she happened to be a island's lady.

[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:27.040]
But I do have a real serious problem with island's ladies.

[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.240]
I've talked about that before.

[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:28.960]
It's not the first time.

[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.420]
And I just don't have any good experience with those people.

[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:38.360]
They always seem to be around and always seem to be very loud and very their behavior is unacceptable.

[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:39.540]
Unacceptable.

[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:40.660]
Got it.

[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:41.420]
Got it.

[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.220]
Eddie says, Crocs are kind of gay.

[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.480]
But if you use them, if you're using them in a wet environment, they're great.

[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:52.440]
Water in and out just as fast with no nasty footstink because they're plastic like George said.

[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.460]
I use them on the boat and went scuba diving.

[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.760]
Obviously not when in the water.

[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:57.780]
Says Eddie.

[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.060]
Well, thanks Eddie.

[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:05.900]
You know, they have those beach shoes and have for years for such purposes, boat shoes, things like that.

[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.180]
I don't like it.

[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:07.680]
They look really gay to me.

[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:08.460]
What the Crocs?

[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:08.500]
Crocs.

[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:09.400]
Yes.

[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:09.780]
Yeah.

[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.240]
What do you say?

[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.460]
Greg hates you.

[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:17.160]
I think so.

[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:17.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.320]
Speaking English.

[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.780]
Speaking English, okay.

[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:22.820]
WDQAAM, hello.

[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:23.860]
Neil.

[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:24.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:28.060]
Yeah, I'm all our way to America to express what I can get laid off.

[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.960]
Okay, well, we hope you get there.

[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:29.240]
Okay.

[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:32.040]
We hope you eventually get there and don't come back.

[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:34.860]
WDQAAM, hello.

[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:38.540]
That is peace where you have colored Crocs.

[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.560]
You know, remember what I said to you before the show today?

[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.440]
Speaking of the guy who's still on the way to the American Express.

[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.040]
Yeah.

[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.900]
Every one of these chronics has got one thing.

[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.920]
And every time they call it, it's the same thing.

[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:52.680]
Right?

[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.020]
You've got the Yovangai.

[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.200]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.340]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.880]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.640]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:01.640]

[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:01.640]

[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:01.640]

[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:01.680]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:02.300]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:02.940]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:03.340]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:03.660]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:04.020]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:04.080]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:04.140]

[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.800]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.000]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.740]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:09.880]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.480]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.740]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.900]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.080]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.300]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.180]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.400]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.460]
You've got the Crocs.

[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:33.240]
North Korea is going to build a bomb.

[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.420]
They laugh at us as they string the UN along.

[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.560]
That's the way it goes.

[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:47.380]
Embargos lived as plutonium slips right underneath our nose.

[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:50.620]
Hey, bombslide.

[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:56.380]
Hey, bombslide.

[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.580]
Smoke and drink as we're all going to die.

[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:01.840]
Absolutely.

[00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.980]
Jimmy Carter thought he was using his head.

[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.920]
Bummer, the guy he went to talk to now is dead.

[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.340]
Ain't life clear.

[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.740]
That's what you get for eating peanuts and drinking Billy beer.

[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.080]
Hey, bombslide.

[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.120]
Hey, bombslide.

[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:37.020]
Smoke and drink as we're all going to die.

[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.960]
Shed it here for bees because we all are going to die.

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.160]
Were you dumb enough to think one day we'd all become allies?

[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:49.400]
No.

[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.920]
1118 at 560 WQAM Happy Thursday to it.

[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.540]
But Thursday already, hallelujah.

[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.580]
Oh, happy day.

[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:03.560]
Don't forget to go see George Saturday at Metro PCS 20350 North Federal Highway 4,

[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:04.440]
a lot of day on 2 to 4.

[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.780]
It's George's birthday on Saturday too.

[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:08.300]
Yep.

[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.140]
So go there and bring him a bag of goodies.

[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.080]
Bring him at least a card.

[00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.780]
You know, nice or just there are a few cards.

[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:13.740]
Old bags.

[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:20.300]
Speaking of old bags like the one I tried to pull the chair off from under my ass and wood by yesterday.

[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.980]
Here's one similar story.

[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.700]
It says you're not going to like this.

[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.460]
Neil, a similar thing happened to my wife at a doctor's office a couple of months ago.

[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.580]
My wife went into a doctor's office and signed in.

[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.100]
She then sat in an empty chair where there were about 10 empty chairs available.

[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.960]
One of George's kind.

[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:37.280]
Uh-huh.

[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.360]
What is that?

[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.680]
That's what my wife was in her seat.

[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.220]
One of your kind.

[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:41.740]
I see.

[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:42.760]
One of your people.

[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.600]
How do you know?

[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.380]
Well, if you'll listen, if you'll let me continue here.

[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:47.840]
No speaking English.

[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:48.240]
So.

[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.800]
Well, in other words, she was Latino.

[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:52.940]
It doesn't mean she was Cuban.

[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:53.280]
It's so.

[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.000]
She had been naked.

[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.740]
I wouldn't.

[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:54.920]
Right.

[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:55.900]
She could have been related to.

[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:56.880]
Is it about a size?

[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:59.240]
I speak English better than whoever wrote that email.

[00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.300]
Can I continue with this?

[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:00.780]
You're going to see.

[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.780]
I told you you wouldn't like it.

[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.700]
My wife responded with.

[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.240]
I've been sitting here for over 30 minutes.

[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]
There are plenty of other chairs.

[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.660]
The lady proceeded to tour out in Spanish,

[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.740]
trying to grab her arm and pull her out of her chair.

[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.220]
I've called the police and had the bitch arrested.

[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.220]
Wish you would have fallen and hurt your ass real bad.

[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.600]
So you could own that bitch in court.

[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.420]
Oh, yeah, I'm sure she was just loaded.

[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.940]
Oh, my God.

[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:23.620]
All that.

[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.040]
Swill.

[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.340]
That hangs out there.

[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.060]
Wonders from my sheen to my sheen.

[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.180]
Looking for a good machine.

[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:32.640]
Mon.

[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:33.900]
Yeah, on her in court.

[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.820]
All 40 cent.

[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.480]
That nice.

[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.440]
Wish you would have fallen.

[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.500]
You're not going to hurt your ass real bad.

[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:38.960]
And that nice.

[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.840]
So I can go to court and collect 50 cent.

[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.060]
And that nice sentiment.

[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:45.780]
Sure.

[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:46.400]
Fitties.

[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:46.680]
Sentiment.

[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.140]
Brandon says cheaper.

[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.220]
Gertie burger was pretty good.

[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:49.920]
It was a lot like fun.

[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:50.260]
Rockers.

[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.780]
You picked the size of burger you want and what you wanted on it.

[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.000]
But I think the best thing about it was the shakes.

[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.100]
You could choose from about 30 different shakes or build your own.

[01:00:59.100 --> 01:00:59.680]
Whatever you wanted.

[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.380]
Me, I would get a shake with Oreos, he says.

[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:05.620]
By the way, what the lady did to you was something of 14.

[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.000]
You were going to do something in school.

[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.520]
Careful with people like that.

[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.860]
Maybe she'll put a hex on you, sis.

[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:10.640]
That's right.

[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.360]
Maybe she's nailing chickens to the door right now.

[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.480]
Don't do to my voodoo.

[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.380]
You're a nasty old man.

[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:22.620]
You're a nasty man.

[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.720]
Whatever the hell she said.

[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.460]
I said, you bitch crazy bitch.

[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.780]
I was just wild.

[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.540]
Oh, here's one about island ladies.

[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.420]
The Walmart trample happened in island neighborhood.

[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.900]
The crowd was mostly women.

[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.240]
You got off easy with the cheer.

[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.500]
It says, yeah, I guess you're right.

[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.960]
At least I'm still alive.

[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.200]
How do you like that?

[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.040]
That was an island's neighborhood man.

[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.640]
What is wrong with you people from the islands, man?

[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:51.200]
Not all of you.

[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.160]
Just the ones I meet.

[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.000]
Behave like a bunch of lunatics.

[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.040]
That that was down seven points.

[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:58.800]
It's very nice.

[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.080]
Somebody says, please tell that crazy ass inexperience kid Chris.

[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.140]
The name of the restaurant is cheaper.

[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.720]
Gertie burger, not cheese burger.

[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.200]
Cheeseburger is that crazy inexperience kid just called it.

[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.360]
How do you like that?

[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.720]
Chris, who cares?

[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:13.360]
Kid.

[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.220]
You kid.

[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.340]
You inexperienced kid.

[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.740]
Well, they don't have one down here.

[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.420]
So I really don't care.

[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.640]
Yeah, what do you mean what you call it when it doesn't exist?

[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.080]
Exactly.

[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.080]
And why is somebody recommending it to me when I can't get it there anyway?

[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:25.740]
Even when I'm there.

[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.580]
I still I'll take a Johnny F and rockets.

[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.480]
In fact, maybe today I'll go over to the one right here.

[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:29.980]
Sure.

[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.880]
Give me a nice thing.

[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.760]
I don't like the running rings though.

[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.840]
They're like, they're like BK on in rings.

[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.780]
They're very, I don't know how to describe it.

[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:43.420]
Mealy.

[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:44.620]
Okay.

[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.860]
I don't recall having them.

[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.160]
Well, don't.

[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.300]
I'll take your word for it.

[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.300]
But my patty melt.

[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.780]
Oh, God, that's a good sandwich.

[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.380]
Maybe I'll get the burger and try it.

[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:55.780]
Okay.

[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:56.540]
The chili burger.

[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.220]
The one you recommend.

[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.180]
I love it.

[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.580]
As long as there's no beans, man, I hate beans.

[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.360]
No, they got the bean.

[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:01.760]
The beans are.

[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.480]
Mushi beans suck.

[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.620]
Rich says the best burger joint around these days hands down is five guys, burgers and fries.

[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.340]
The name almost says it all as they also serve the best hot dog in town.

[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.580]
But I bet you these emails are coming from Foody.

[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.200]
He's the expert.

[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.100]
He's the town expert.

[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.800]
I bet where you get the best weeny, where you get the best burger, etc.

[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.840]
Well, by the way, the game is this Sunday here in Toronto, right?

[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.920]
The dolphins in the bills.

[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:27.260]
Yep.

[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.340]
You hear what the builder trying to do?

[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.300]
What?

[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.020]
Trying to get the roof.

[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:31.980]
Oh, yeah, you already said that.

[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.280]
You're going to start with that again.

[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.240]
Yeah, I got to love it.

[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.860]
So the closest T burger, T burger is West Palm and Bokariton.

[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.920]
The fact that you're starting to tell me again about how groups I forget want the roof open.

[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.460]
There are plenty of them on TV.

[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.360]
Let me say it again.

[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.920]
If the bills wanted to play in the snow in the wintertime, they should have stayed in orchard park in Buffalo.

[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.340]
That's what they should have done.

[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.540]
They moved some of their home games.

[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.660]
They made a deal and they want to play in a dome stadium.

[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:04.840]
Period.

[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.740]
Nobody forced them.

[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.740]
Nobody made them an offer.

[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.420]
They couldn't refuse.

[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.340]
Nobody said, oh gee, you better do this.

[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.040]
The audio, audio, audio.

[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:12.520]
No.

[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.400]
So take it or leave it.

[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.800]
I mean, in this one instance, I have to agree with the fish crowd.

[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.720]
Anyway, it says the regular burger is a double patty outstanding.

[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.560]
We got about two dozen toppings from which to choose.

[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.540]
Their hot dogs are equally remarkable and their fries forget about it.

[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.780]
They basically use a large Styrofoam cup as their fries container,

[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.340]
put in a brown bag and empty the fries, basking in the bag.

[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.940]
There actually are more fries outside the cup than in the cup.

[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:38.700]
It's a great place.

[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.100]
They've been down here for about two years now and more and more of them are opening around town.

[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:42.920]
What is it called?

[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.480]
Something guys, burgers and fries.

[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:52.080]
It says there's one on university and commercial in the public small Atlantic Boulevard in Rock Island Road in Margate.

[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.380]
Absolutely the best.

[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.660]
Georgia's for another type of fine meat.

[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.040]
I'm sorry, I missed the best flesh poll the other day.

[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:02.640]
If you're a Marissa tome fan and after you see this movie, you will be.

[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.100]
You need to check how the movie called before the devil knows you're dead.

[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.480]
You mean the one I sent you like a month ago?

[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.120]
The one we were talking about a great length.

[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.720]
Did I ever talk about how naked she is at the beginning? Yeah.

[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.480]
It's the one that is not the one that like all of a sudden just someone sent it to us.

[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:16.960]
What's it about?

[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.800]
You watched it.

[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.320]
Philip Seymour Hoffman's in it.

[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.480]
The families are going to rip off their own mom and dad.

[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.000]
Oh yeah, that's a good movie.

[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.940]
Halfway through it had the digital effect on the one that was.

[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.480]
Yeah, we got the scene shows here being seriously pounded doogie style by the fat and grotesque pasty.

[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.160]
Philip Seymour Hoffman despite him being in the scene, it's hard to sell.

[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.060]
And the idea, well, we've already seen it and talked about it at great length.

[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.000]
Especially that part of it.

[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.160]
Also, how about a little Elvis Claus is rich yet we can arrange that right after the break.

[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.660]
Here's one says good morning, sir.

[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.920]
The first bitch who pulled the chair away from you is not only a crazy bitch,

[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.920]
but she was doing something extremely dangerous.

[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:03.260]
As someone who's worked in the medical field, you'd be surprised how many people have suffered from serious back injuries

[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.940]
when a chair slowed out from under them.

[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.160]
You could have been seriously injured. Oh boy.

[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.500]
Crazy bitch.

[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.200]
Also, Tiber Gratiba is one of the best burgers I've ever had.

[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.900]
As the previous writer said, it's too bad that it's with so many other good things, they are no longer here.

[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:17.760]
There's nothing.

[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:19.160]
They're gone.

[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.520]
You're not in the best.

[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.540]
Fort like you're 560 QAM.

[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.280]
The fourth lead.

[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.160]
Please enough sucking.

[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.000]
Oh boy, here.

[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.060]
Thank you very much.

[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.860]
This here is the king.

[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.000]
I know I haven't been around for a while,

[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.140]
but I want you all to know that up here in Rock and Roll Heaven,

[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.440]
I'll be thinking of you, but it's Christmas.

[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.860]
I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message.

[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:48.640]
A message of peace.

[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.640]
Like how about a little piece of that time I go home by.

[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:53.280]
Thank you.

[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:53.740]
I'll go home.

[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.520]
Block a whole sin.

[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.860]
Christmas is a time of who?

[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.280]
A time of joy.

[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.640]
A time for love.

[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.600]
And I sure would love it.

[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.200]
Take slides of that feature you got there.

[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.600]
Like it.

[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.220]
What's with life?

[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.760]
No more, what about life?

[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:09.640]
Oh yeah, Christmas.

[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.760]
They're Christmas to me means family.

[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.660]
Family means friends.

[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.720]
The friends means getting together.

[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.620]
And getting together means eating.

[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.960]
I'll pass you that term today, which please.

[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:22.980]
Well, thank you.

[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:23.640]
I'll be right back.

[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.980]
Now just one more slate of you right now.

[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.220]
You know, I may be a big star, maybe too big,

[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.040]
but ain't nobody so big.

[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.420]
You can't reach out a helping hand.

[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.160]
I don't know how to help a hand.

[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.660]
Oh, would you hand me a helping of those

[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:39.720]
my data's over there?

[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.020]
Which I believe is like it.

[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:41.700]
Like I am.

[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.300]
Like I am.

[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.440]
Now like I was saying,

[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.660]
ain't nobody so big, you can't stoop to help a friend of me

[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:48.760]
over the holiday season.

[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.500]
Speaking of season,

[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.060]
you won't pass me that self-sugger when you get the chance.

[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:53.560]
Like it.

[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.500]
Yeah, just, just unscrew the cover.

[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:55.880]
That's right.

[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:56.260]
Like it.

[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:56.760]
I don't know.

[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.540]
So this Christmas, why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.S.

[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.400]
Now I don't need those steak tips right where they are.

[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:04.940]
You know what I mean?

[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.080]
No, appreciate it, thank you.

[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.360]
I want you to remember,

[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.920]
we're all part of God's great big family.

[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.700]
And you know God made men into his own image.

[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.160]
And look in the mirror,

[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.680]
I'd have to say God must be a big, big center of again.

[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.260]
You know what I mean?

[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:19.520]
I like it you.

[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.640]
But especially once y'all remember this one last thing.

[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.540]
When y'all that whomish Christmas stringing that popcorn

[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:27.300]
up on the tree,

[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.620]
save a big, big bowl for the town.

[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.320]
Extra butter to what am I?

[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.640]
I like you dear.

[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:34.380]
I like you.

[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:35.300]
I like your red blood.

[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.600]
Left of 32, he's still dead by the way,

[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.720]
if there's anybody out there who cares.

[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:42.180]
I care about him as much as I care about Sid Rosenberg,

[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:42.620]
Cran Swartzstein,

[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.520]
and as much as I care about Jorge Sedano-Witz.

[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:46.900]
A lot of them.

[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:47.160]

[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:47.780]
Wow.

[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.220]
I don't care.

[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.560]
And it just bugs the hell out of me,

[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.480]
the jolly joe bell,

[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.980]
who is totally oblivious to anything that's going on here

[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:55.800]
between 10 and 2,

[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.140]
and my life and your life,

[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.140]
in fact Chris's life,

[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:01.000]
it feels that I want to waste five minutes of my time

[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.960]
listening to some audio clip of those clowns across the street.

[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.320]
I don't care about across the street.

[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:06.820]
I don't care.

[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.780]
They can get a 90's here,

[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.920]
they can get a zero share,

[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.760]
which is more close to the fact.

[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:13.980]
I don't care.

[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:15.840]
Rhymes with Cher.

[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:16.780]
Yeah.

[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.060]
Rhymes with Cher.

[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.180]
Cher, pull up under my hand.

[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:21.340]
Bitch.

[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.700]
Mike's is, I don't know if you or George has the answer to this,

[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.040]
or maybe that fake Maria Barthoromo bitch might have an idea.

[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:31.220]
I want to know why as the price of gas has come down,

[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:34.780]
the spread between regular premium and super has increased.

[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.420]
I always remember about a 10 cent spread between the different grades.

[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.420]
Now I'm seeing a 20 cent spread between the grades of gas.

[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.460]
For example, I went and filled up yesterday,

[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.460]
a buck 92 for 87,

[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.080]
$2.13 for 89 octane,

[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:51.340]
and $2.30 for 93.

[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.640]
Is this just another way to get raped?

[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:54.440]
Is this legal?

[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:55.580]
Do you already know your risk?

[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.160]
Like I always have an answer.

[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.260]
I'm mad as hell about it,

[01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:57.680]
since Mike.

[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.220]
Great show.

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.240]
Says Mike.

[01:09:59.420 --> 01:09:59.900]
You got an answer?

[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:00.960]
No.

[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:01.980]
But I do want to say,

[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.200]
well, thank you Mike for having a real email there.

[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.480]
Is that the first one today?

[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.660]
Oh, is that the first one today?

[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.920]
Oh, I just couldn't think this any more.

[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:08.360]
Oh!

[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.760]
That's not the first one.

[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:10.700]
We don't have very many.

[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.600]
But we don't have very many anymore.

[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.320]
It's like, oh and a chronic,

[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.760]
I blocked that idiot by the way,

[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:17.740]
who's a range of strangers,

[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.220]
go back to New York and get lost.

[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.040]
Take a said with you.

[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.440]
All you mouth content in New Yorkers,

[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.540]
okay, go back to New York.

[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.540]
Of course, most of the people in South Florida from New York

[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.740]
couldn't make it in New York or they got kicked out of town.

[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:29.460]
You know what I mean?

[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.560]
They got run out on a rail.

[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:35.760]
A lot of really nice New Yorkers and most of them are in New York.

[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.020]
I just just observation.

[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.620]
Oh, Islanders.

[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.060]
It says all Islanders are crazy because they're on an island.

[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.320]
There are certain physical factors.

[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.980]
Well, how come the people from Australia don't act like that?

[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.060]
Although I don't encounter very many Australians.

[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.080]
How about the people from Greenland?

[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.300]
They don't encounter too many Greenlanders.

[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.680]
No, not as much as you used to.

[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.120]
How about Icelanders?

[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:00.440]
No.

[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.480]
It says there are certain physical factors that mess up your brain.

[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.580]
Firstly, there are storms and water and sharks and coconuts falling down on your head.

[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.320]
Secondly, when you get into real trouble in the mainland,

[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.420]
you can ultimately just run into a new place and start over on an island that isn't possible.

[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.660]
So you have to fight, which is why Islanders can also be very dangerous

[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.820]
and why the Frenchmen will run like hell and the English guys will just plan to kick your ass.

[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.580]
The English guy will kiss your ass, not kick your ass.

[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.260]
He'll kiss it and you're asked to.

[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.520]
You can me.

[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.960]
Oh, yeah, those tough Britishers.

[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:32.500]
So you can.

[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.300]
How come it is that the US had a bail amount of every damn war?

[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:40.080]
Except the revolution we couldn't really bail them out of that one.

[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.820]
Brandon says that one place needs to expand his char hut.

[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.000]
They used to have a lot more locations than they do now.

[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.720]
As a matter of fact, they had two on paper fines for while when I go there,

[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.920]
they're booming with business.

[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.680]
We need more char huts by far, one of the best burgers in town and one of our fine sponsors on QAM,

[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.620]
too, by the way.

[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.220]
Used to be one of my fine sponsors, but they don't like it.

[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.260]
Nobody like you anymore.

[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.880]
Well, I love char hut a lot.

[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.540]
I told you I used to when I went to a that quack doctor there in.

[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.200]
What was that?

[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:08.720]
Tamarack.

[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.400]
I used to go to that doctor to get my blood test and stuff.

[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.720]
And of course, you don't eat before you go to get your blood drawn,

[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.280]
but as soon as I'd be on a way back home right now,

[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.000]
Hill, there's a char hut or they at least I think it's still there.

[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:25.840]
I go in there for one of those sausage sausage and cheese and onion.

[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.940]
Oh, man, those are good.

[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.000]
Good. Really good.

[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.680]
I don't want it to start something like the Joe Rochow now where every other word is another

[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:32.960]
plug for somebody.

[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.740]
What's that pizza place he's plugging?

[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.120]
Anthony coal fire pizza.

[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.420]
Kim and Zach.

[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.280]
Bap, bap, bap.

[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.560]
And how does that work in and Zach's diet, by the way, pizza?

[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:43.520]
I don't know.

[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.060]
I eat pizza, but I'm not on a diet.

[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.180]
How does that work out?

[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.280]
He might still be here when we do ask him.

[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:50.720]
No.

[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.260]
Oh, I want you to go ask him.

[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.820]
Jesus, what would be between that and that other stupid thing you said to me a minute ago about the dome?

[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.380]
Oh, you are a, what did that one guy call you?

[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.740]
A kid inexperienced kid inexperienced kid.

[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.640]
Oh, I hear you and Johnny Joe got a lot of experience.

[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.340]
That's what I'm hearing.

[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.440]
No, that's what I hear now in the rear of the building.

[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.880]
Definitely not a lot of experience in the rear.

[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.320]
You and fat ass, Johnny Joe, I can almost envision that.

[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:29.620]
I can almost see that in my mind.

[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.460]
And I think I'm going to be sick.

[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.580]
321 votes on the poll.

[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.200]
What's our goal to the five?

[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:36.920]
Yeah, I think so.

[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.760]
And this was my bad and Eric's bad too, because I already had this new poll.

[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.480]
His new deal is I guess he doesn't change it if I forget to do it.

[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:51.120]
I was too busy listening for five minutes to Sid Rosencrant Schwartz and the other crap that Johnny Joe Bell sent me.

[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.480]
Oh, here's some interesting listening courtesy of Sid Rosenchartz, Grant.

[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.680]
It's not interesting and I don't want it.

[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.340]
I mean, I thought maybe there might be something in revealing something, you know, some scuttle buds, some something.

[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.940]
Nothing, nothing.

[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.240]
I mean, today is the 4th of December.

[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.980]
Now, let me ask you a question.

[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.920]
Can you wait until January the 2nd to find out who's going where I'm going?

[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.320]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:18.880]
Now you're right.

[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:19.460]
I can't either.

[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.480]
We've got to know now, come on, fake Barry Jackass.

[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.460]
Give us the inside poop.

[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.260]
And the fake Greg Budell, we're not interested in coincidence about we are fresh out of money.

[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:29.700]
Yeah.

[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.400]
From Jeremy Coleman and the fake Greg Budell, we're probably the same person.

[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.920]
Maybe Norm is getting goose too by fake Jeremy Coleman.

[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.100]
Jeremy Coleman.

[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.460]
Yeah, pull mine.

[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:44.360]
Jeremy, pull mine.

[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.300]
321 votes.

[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.420]
What should have meant over 35?

[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.060]
Neverware.

[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.340]
Baseball cat backwards.

[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.540]
Aside ways 85.

[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.480]
Spandex bicycle short 62.

[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.740]
High school graduation ring 42.

[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.880]
Hooper dangle earrings 41.

[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.260]
Oh, we got to add the ponytail, by the way.

[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.340]
Somebody said that a long time ago, I forgot to tell you add ponytail.

[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:06.380]
Please.

[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:06.640]

[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.120]
You don't agree?

[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:09.220]
I do.

[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.480]
Oh, ponytail.

[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.700]
Even Jeff Cohen got rid of that.

[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.060]
Mangloss lipstick 34, Crocs 23.

[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.320]
Those hip white sunglasses 13.

[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.520]
Even what's his name?

[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.120]
Mitch Lewis also got rid of his ponytail.

[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:22.940]
Then you tell me?

[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.700]
Yeah, he's practically a skinhead now.

[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:26.300]
Good.

[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.280]
Nice go, Mitch.

[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.360]
Those hip white sunglasses 13.

[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.400]
Muscle shirts 11.

[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.520]
Colored wristbands for different causes 6.

[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.700]
And leather vests 5.

[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:37.860]
Oh, look at that.

[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.540]
Burgers and the boobs.

[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:44.380]
I had an interesting burger at Premantie Brothers and 4 Lauderdale recently says Jimmy.

[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:46.380]
They're a small chain famous in Pittsburgh.

[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:47.460]
They open a couple here.

[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.220]
God knows why.

[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.120]
Anyway, the burger was stacked on Texas toast, topped with fries and coleslaw.

[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:53.960]
It's not the usual burger, but tasty.

[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.520]
It was nice to try something unconventional for once.

[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.960]
Also, I love that opening scene and before the devil knows you dead.

[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.200]
I wish Marissa told me what have done.

[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.600]
It seemed like that in my cousin Vinny days, but better late than ever.

[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:09.860]
I didn't get to see the rest of it because I rewound my DVR, cleaned my pipes and went to sleep.

[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:15.720]
The only downside to watching that was realizing that must be what looks like when my fat discussing body.

[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.020]
Oh, geez, I don't want to read the rest of it.

[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:21.520]
P.S. Syria still blows anything else, Robin?

[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.340]
Ask Jimmy.

[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.880]
Anything else, Robin?

[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:25.880]
And the Dow is down 54.

[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.000]
The biggest name.

[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.160]
The best talent.

[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.380]
He's the new Roger.

[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.800]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.440]
The fourth league.

[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.220]
The biggest name.

[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.660]
The best talent.

[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.720]
He's the mad dog.

[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.200]
A man that's half the news.

[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.180]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.100]
The sports leader.

[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:47.460]
He's a good.

[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.520]
I think that only.

[01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:53.780]
Hey, guys, if you're like me, you spend a lot of money on your car or your house.

[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:56.580]
And to protect your belonging, you spend a little bit more on an alarm system.

[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.360]
Still, you may have left your most important position unprotected.

[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.260]
That's right, I'm talking about your shlaw.

[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.440]
That's why I installed a new Shwan Saber alarm system on my...

[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.780]
When the Shwan Saber is activated, it sets up a security field that will sound an alarm whenever any object gets within three feet of your...

[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.020]
With Shwan Saber, I can get a good night's sleep every night.

[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.600]
No matter what I may have done earlier to piss my girlfriend off.

[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:20.840]
And the great thing about Shwan Saber is, if I ever forget to activate it, and my...

[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:27.000]
...is severed, just one phone call to the police and they will activate the Shwan's tracker to find and return my...

[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:28.320]
...Shwan Saber.

[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.480]
Don't pass out without it.

[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.420]
They're just passed out.

[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.580]
It's 1145, a QAM boy.

[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:35.680]
It's zippin' right along here today.

[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.980]
Let me tell you, we might take some calls this hour, but I doubt it.

[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.840]
Just keep them on their toes, you know?

[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:41.520]
Yep.

[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.400]
Now, here's one from Alisa in... on Cold Long Island.

[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.160]
Godfather question.

[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.500]
Alright, let me go back and play that again.

[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:50.800]
Canoli?

[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:52.740]
Canoli help.

[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:53.720]
Okay.

[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:54.680]
Leave the gun.

[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:56.760]
Take the canoli.

[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.700]
I have a question for you since you're the Godfather, I expert.

[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:06.280]
My boyfriend, who was a nice Italian boy raised in Manhattan, and one of my best friends who was a pastry chef, both want T-shirts for Christmas that say,

[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.520]
Leave the gun, take the canoli.

[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:13.920]
The question I have is, is it leave the gun, take the canoli, or leave the gun, take the canolies?

[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.300]
No S, it's a italiano, it's a tiliani.

[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.120]
Canoli, plural and singular.

[01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.200]
It's like soup, right?

[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:25.640]
Right.

[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:26.760]
Take the soup.

[01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.300]
You could have like ten kinds of soup or one bowl of soup.

[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.480]
Not soups.

[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.100]
Well, if it's more than one kind of soup, what?

[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.300]
Then you'd have to take the soup.

[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.120]
Bring the soups?

[01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:38.820]
No.

[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.760]
That's usually the roleplay.

[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.840]
I found the shirts already, however, find a gun, eBay to make the shirts for me.

[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:44.360]
I want to get it right.

[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.380]
Can you play the sound bite and I can judge?

[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.540]
There you go, Alissa.

[01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:50.340]
She's back on cold, long-gainland.

[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:58.980]
No S, canoli, is plural and is also singular.

[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:06.400]
Wes and Wes Poms says, Neil, your show is staring to sound like the McLaughlin group with George and those other fools talking over you all the time.

[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.820]
What are their fools or those?

[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.640]
All these fools in here, you know?

[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.600]
Inexperienced fat Chris?

[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:12.820]
Gotta be.

[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.460]
He's the kid.

[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.620]
Have you ever listened to George when you're off?

[01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:16.380]
I didn't think so.

[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.540]
I don't listen to the radio when I'm not working, okay?

[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:19.100]
Period.

[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.780]
No matter whether it's George, whether it's anybody, I don't listen to the radio.

[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.520]
Why don't you just let George take over the show and you interrupt him?

[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.140]
Don't get me wrong, George is okay.

[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.000]
Well, maybe not.

[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.860]
He's trying to take over your show.

[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:33.540]
Like the head coach who's assistant plots a hostile takeover.

[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.440]
And then it says, I hear serious as after George.

[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.380]
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.

[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:37.900]
Yeah.

[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:39.420]
Oh, serial.

[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.260]
These people.

[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.020]
That was down 64 points.

[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:44.980]
Oh, don't do that.

[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:49.920]
In fact, I have one stupid one here and I really surprised to us from Todd who usually sends good emails.

[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.060]
But he's out of material.

[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.160]
Uncle Neil, please stop giving out the market numbers as you're causing the market to go down.

[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:55.380]
Yeah.

[01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:01.200]
Did you know that the more you give up financial information, the worse the market or a value of stock becomes.

[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.840]
Maria MSNBC rocks not, says Todd.

[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.780]
Who is a very weak attempted humor, I guess.

[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.260]
Very feeble.

[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.940]
Don't forget to go see George Saturday.

[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:14.380]
I'm going to try to get a gigantic crowd out there for you.

[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:19.240]
It's a Metro PCS 20 350 North Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:19.440]
Right.

[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.780]
This isn't one of those little child somewhere where we're going to drive 100 miles away.

[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:23.360]
Is it in the swamp?

[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.240]
It isn't in Mexico.

[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:24.960]
Right.

[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:25.800]
It's not?

[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:26.660]
It's not.

[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:27.460]
Oh.

[01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:30.540]
345 vote on the poll.

[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.440]
What are we going for?

[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:31.900]
500.

[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:32.600]
I don't know.

[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.260]
Well, we'll take whatever we can get, you know.

[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.280]
Because I'm sure that before the end of the month, I'll have another breathless email from Johnny Joe.

[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:44.740]
Oh, here's some more sound from what they're saying across the street.

[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.880]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.260]
Oh, God.

[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:53.100]
Do you know what it's like to work for somebody who you know is totally incompetent?

[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:53.600]
Yes, I did.

[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:54.340]
Yeah.

[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.040]
Well, it's a rhetorical question.

[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.120]
I'm just asking the audience.

[01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.880]
Because I'm sure many of you out there have the same feeling.

[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.260]
Working for somebody who is totally inept, totally just useless.

[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.580]
Spending all of this time worrying about all these meaningless people across the street.

[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.900]
Why, why doesn't he just hang out across the street?

[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.640]
Orals down to $45.84 of barrel.

[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:18.620]
Wow.

[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.840]
They had to be giving us gas tonight, when you think?

[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:23.900]
If we don't already have it.

[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:25.260]
Well, I've got a lot of gas.

[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.940]
And the loony is under 80 set.

[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.940]
Oh, happy day, 79.40.

[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.400]
79.40.

[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.560]
Oh, hallelujah.

[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.200]
The loony is dropping like a rock.

[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:40.160]
And maybe they're going to have that election here in the hospital takeover the Canadian government.

[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.680]
Get that Stephen Harper out of there, eh?

[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.140]
And they have this bitch they call the governor general, the silly woman.

[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.500]
And she's the representative of the queen.

[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.020]
I don't understand any of that.

[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.780]
I thought this country was like independent now.

[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.720]
And yet the queen keeps sticking her finger in our business here, eh?

[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.280]
I was speaking to that.

[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.380]
Here's one from Demsie, who's a Brit.

[01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:05.860]
D-E-M-S-Y.

[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.980]
When we get to the last word of the pair of the email, you'll understand how I know he's a Brit.

[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:10.440]
Okay.

[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:16.120]
Speaking of gas hoaxes a few years ago when I worked on the fifth floor of a biscane boulevard office building.

[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.040]
The 711 across the street ripped up its parking lot and gas pump area to renovate the gas system.

[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.960]
I wondered why there were other gas stations had three octane grades to choose from.

[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:30.160]
80, 789, 93, 711 had five, 87, 88, 89, 91, 93.

[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:35.460]
I made a point to monitor the progress of this renovation job over time for my vantage point across the street.

[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.380]
Sure enough, they only installed three tanks under the ground, not five.

[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.840]
I went across the street and asked the manager.

[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.060]
He looked at me like I was crazy and didn't answer.

[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:46.280]
I contacted channels six in the Miami Herald.

[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:46.920]
They weren't interested.

[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.940]
Eventually the job was finished and now the three tanks are hidden under the ground.

[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:50.980]
They still have five grades.

[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.960]
They still sell five grades of petrol.

[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.860]
See what I mean about the last word.

[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.720]
Americans don't say petrol.

[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:03.840]
Even conucks don't say petrol.

[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.860]
Even with all the Britishization of this country with all these stupid,

[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:09.280]
verbyage, what?

[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.140]
British-real word?

[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.700]
Say it five times fast.

[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:15.060]
Even with the infestation of Britishization.

[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.360]
There's a lot of things that they say here.

[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.480]
Like color, CLO, you are spelling labor, LAB, OUR.

[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.200]
Do they spell shop with a PPE on the end?

[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:27.840]
No, they do not.

[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:29.620]
No PPE.

[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.060]
Ryan Philippi spells his name over the PPE on the end.

[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.580]
He's got a PPE on the end.

[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:35.300]
Ryan Philippi?

[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:36.000]
Yes.

[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:36.900]
Ryan Philippi.

[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:37.600]
That's correct.

[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.820]
Just a fine, fine gentleman.

[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.680]
Five grades of petrol.

[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.300]
I'll tell you what else has several grades.

[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.360]
I haven't seen one of their stations in a long time.

[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.340]
They're around Sonoco.

[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:50.580]
Yeah.

[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:51.340]
Am I right?

[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.600]
Doesn't Sonoco have about 75 different grades again?

[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:54.940]
I can't remember the last time I was there.

[01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:56.020]
Come on.

[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:56.820]
All right.

[01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.300]
Let's go to Sonoco for lunch.

[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.540]
Sure, what do they got?

[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.440]
I was Godfather's and they still live with the Hessian.

[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.060]
I have no idea.

[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:03.540]
Don't know.

[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.500]
You know the one out there I'm aware of it.

[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:08.700]
They've you wrote extension?

[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.620]
I'm aware of it.

[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.240]
By what you call it?

[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:11.740]
I'm hip.

[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.160]
What's the name of that restaurant?

[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.140]
From Detroit.

[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.540]
Where they got the strawberry pie?

[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:20.800]
Denys.

[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.260]
No, not Denys.

[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:24.420]
Like Denys, but not much better than Denys.

[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:24.860]
Stukies.

[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:26.240]
No, not Stukies.

[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.280]
Stukies is on the turnpike, man.

[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.360]
I'm the 95.

[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.080]
It's on the highways.

[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:33.260]
Yeah.

[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.840]
The Hess gas station there.

[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.460]
And a few other ones.

[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.480]
Remember Godfather's had pizza in...

[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.020]
You know, just like the bastard Robbins and Taco Bell

[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.800]
a lot of martygeather and here it's like Tim Hortons and Bastard Robbins.

[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.580]
Tim Hortons, my God.

[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.940]
Every street corner there's another Tim Hortons or a second cup or a Starbucks.

[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.260]
No wonder people are going to have a wild diarrhea.

[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.480]
Too much coffee, man.

[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.300]
I don't know about you, but it goes through me like an H-bomb.

[01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.220]
Yep.

[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.220]
That's why I think it.

[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:00.660]
I drink coffee.

[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.200]
I really can't.

[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.300]
It's just...

[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:06.160]
I don't know if it's the high concentration of caffeine or what it is.

[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.100]
Yeah, I'm drinking some now.

[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:07.960]
Are you really?

[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:08.500]
Uh-oh.

[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.700]
Well, George is going to be making a run for the runs.

[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.240]
You know the name of that restaurant, Chan, I'm talking about it.

[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:16.960]
I will if I hear it.

[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.280]
I'll go, oh yeah, that's...

[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:18.820]
Somebody will tell.

[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:19.760]
Brandon will tell me.

[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:23.340]
Tracy says, totally disagree with George about Crocs.

[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:24.800]
I have many gay friends.

[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.280]
I've never seen any of them wear Crocs.

[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.140]
And indeed, they probably wouldn't be called dead in them.

[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.820]
Maybe they have good taste, those gay guys.

[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.140]
I've only ever seen white men, chefs, and very small children wearing them.

[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.040]
They are hideous.

[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.580]
Jesus Christ, Tracy says.

[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.680]
Jesus Christ.

[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:41.320]
Also, the men wear the things on the pole at NEH provide a helpful public service,

[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.140]
which benefits me and other people with taste.

[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.240]
They're blatantly evident.

[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.400]
Debaggery makes it easy for me to avoid them.

[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.320]
Another indicator of the guy is not a winner is the presence of a cell phone

[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.480]
and they holster on their belt.

[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:55.300]
Most of these things, I think, don't mention it ever wear at NEH,

[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.340]
so it's kind of difficult to vote.

[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.380]
And going hip white sunglasses, she says.

[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:01.540]
She's voting for that.

[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:05.160]
I'm pretty sure Chase Crawford or Joe Jonas could probably get away with it today.

[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.320]
Joe Jonas could wear everything or nothing and get away with it.

[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.040]
Hey, Joe, eat a sandwich, man.

[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:10.840]
You're a little scrawny.

[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.040]
There are tremendously talented groups of Jonas sisters.

[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:19.300]
Then again, Crawford is probably a douch in real life

[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.980]
and we've already established that Jonas doesn't make the best decisions.

[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:23.280]
Promise Ring, whatever.

[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.740]
No, it's not a promise ring.

[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.360]
It's a ring.

[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.520]
Remember that song by Elvis?

[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.320]
Won't you wear my ring around your thing?

[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.560]
That's Joe Jonas.

[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.380]
He's got a ring around his thing.

[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.820]
Maybe ring around his collar too.

[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.480]
I sure wish you hadn't gotten me involved with another boy band.

[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.520]
I got to love it.

[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.920]
I live for that kind of stuff.

[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:44.720]
To get you involved with the boy band.

[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.640]
Look at Nick Lashayne.

[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.320]
Now, there was a talent.

[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:47.080]
See, I don't understand.

[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:50.640]
The guys that can really sing like 98 degrees, especially him.

[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:53.660]
They like, you know, here did they go out tomorrow.

[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.740]
And this rap garbage, these people who couldn't sing they were out of a paper sack,

[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.680]
they're making the big money, honey.

[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:00.780]
Big money.

[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.940]
So what do we find out about the people on the islands?

[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:03.920]
That's not an excuse.

[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.060]
I'm not buying that.

[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.800]
I'm just not giving an excuse.

[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:12.660]
Yeah, that business about people on islands feel claustrophobic or whatever it is.

[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:13.720]
Oh, yeah, right.

[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.860]
Don't remember that?

[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:17.580]
Nope.

[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.140]
A quite a Wikipedia demographics of Canada are 28% silly British,

[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.800]
23% anxious French, 15% European trash,

[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.720]
2% Amerindian, 2% Asian, 2% African, 2% Europe,

[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.880]
26% mixed.

[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.140]
Have you noticed a huge influx of islanders lately?

[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:35.880]
Yes, I have.

[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.360]
Lots of islanders, man.

[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.200]
Too many.

[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.240]
It says old ponytails are the worst.

[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.220]
When you come back to plantation, there's a chair held on,

[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.360]
stay road 84 in Pyl Island, and the last but not least,

[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.060]
you go to sit down on the machine, you like at the hard rock.

[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.880]
The A-hole sitting next to the machine says,

[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.780]
oh, this is for my husband.

[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:55.260]
He's back.

[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.140]
It sits down.

[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.320]
There's nothing but watches wife.

[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:57.880]
Oh, yeah.

[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.860]
I go right over and tell him you use the machine or get it.

[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.480]
That's right.

[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:02.680]
Play it or I get out of here.

[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.500]
Then I pull out a cigarette and blow it in the space.

[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.880]
Plus there's a fun rocker's in Pine Gardens Mall.

[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:08.480]
Thanks, Larry.

[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:09.320]
Good job.

[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.600]
Excellent work.

[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:14.900]
They sit there and they watch their spouse,

[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.760]
their partner, their partner in death,

[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.260]
sitting in their playing the machine next to them.

[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:20.860]
All they're doing is just taking up their ass on a chair.

[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:21.360]
That's all.

[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:22.640]
Get your ass out of here.

[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.240]
And the rest is two.

[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.720]
You will prove objects.

[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:28.000]
Sport like you're 560 QAM.

[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.760]
The fourth leader.

[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:33.560]
I am Fraau, Iliana, Roselateman.

[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:37.440]
And I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels.

[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.620]
And listening to the near rogey,

[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.640]
Amunista outer.

[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.420]
Cigain!

[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:48.980]
Well, I never thought I'd find the kind of ride that I've been doing around this today.

[01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:54.780]
Now is the classic set of wheels fixed up the way your brother would fly again.

[01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:01.020]
Now is the key to China and the trim is cold and the ties to the mercy.

[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.260]
I've got some kind of liquid cherry, yo.

[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:05.460]
God, baby.

[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:10.060]
Open a good lot of cherry cherry and be baby green.

[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.080]
God, baby.

[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.020]
Chinese middle-ville, little-sales,

[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.260]
Belly, the sheep, the princess, red, the ship.

[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.040]
Now so I've bounced off the road in a bit.

[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.760]
Dad is super-filey.

[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.480]
Now with the authors,

[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:27.580]
Stop the big wheels of the elevator, round the peaks of the brakes.

[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.500]
At 1979, my own boat, Catalina,

[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.220]
Showed looking fine, now is my baby Cadillac.

[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:38.260]
God, baby.

[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.800]
Open a good lot of cherry cherry and be baby green.

[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.740]
God, baby.

[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.920]
Chinese middle-ville, little-sales,

[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:17.640]
Belly, the sheep.

[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:31.520]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.400]
Thanks, my coffee, China, to be a Russian,

[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.120]
They washing it with all the rope.

[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.620]
Don't all be a baby.

[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:41.960]
Open a good lot of cherry cherry and be baby green.

[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.880]
God, baby.

[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:47.500]
My most shopping wheels grow in no-bus-beams.

[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:47.620]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:47.620]

[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:47.620]

[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:07.540]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:07.600]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:07.600]

[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:07.600]

[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:07.600]

[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.680]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.480]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:13.480]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.940]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:21.820]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:21.820]

[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:21.860]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:21.880]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.940]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:32.160]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.440]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.520]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.820]
I'm a taxi-cute find, the shiny grandest, not like mine.

[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:16.800]

boy to that side of the person 동. See the big fat guy boy, he was awesome. background music

[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.420]
do the talk. I'll be right. I'll overpour buddy. Now buddy. Holly is dead. They're both dead.

[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:26.440]
It's like that bitch trying to pull a Peggy suit. Peggy suit. I think this was our choral records.

[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.600]
I knew a Peggy suit.

[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:43.660]
Let me ask you again. What? It could be the end of the line for General Motors shareholders.

[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:47.940]
The company that once produced more than half the cars on US roads, including my beautiful Corvettes.

[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:52.960]
Is considering filing for bankruptcy in exchange for access to bailout funds. Well don't play

[01:33:52.960 --> 01:34:00.120]
me. I sure bought a hell of an odd GM cars. My God. I think all my life 95% of the cars I bought were GM

[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:09.800]
cars. Pontiac, Olds, Conzo Corvettes, Chevy. Lumberg knows we've ported late last month. The incoming

[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:15.480]
Obama administration was discussing a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing for the automakers. Their CEOs

[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:20.540]
are testifying again now. They're begging. I mean, testifying. Restructuring negotiations and

[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:26.000]
protect taxpayers. That was down 67. GM has been an important part of American culture for 100 years.

[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.520]
And most of that time is the world's leading automates. Yeah, well so is Gabby Hayes, but he's dead.

[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.120]
Bankruptcy would allow the company to come up with a plan for restructuring and prevent the firm

[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:39.220]
from running out of cash to pay creditors until the plan is in place. Today the wire reported that

[01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:46.180]
Bocey and Christ are considering filing for chapter 11. Where can we get some donuts? That's what I

[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:51.440]
want to know. Not Tim Horton's donuts, some crispy creams. That's what I want. I think that's

[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.580]
how I'm going to kill myself. I'm just going to get like 10 dozen crispy creams and sit in my

[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:02.460]
living room and just shovel them down my posts. Yeah, that'll do it. While I'm lying in their gagging

[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:07.140]
and choking and dying, there'll be a message from way upstairs, way up on the top floor. I'm busy,

[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:16.440]
I'm busy. There could be a lag on the itty says there could be a lag on the price drop of premium

[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.820]
gas because it doesn't sell as much as regular and therefore remains in the tank longer. As the

[01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:25.380]
gas gets cheaper and stations replenish their supply, they lower the price. For this reason,

[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:29.560]
you'll notice the price of fuel will drop more rapidly at busier stations. However, it could be an

[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:36.500]
opportunity to get over temporarily. But what does that mean? That last sentence makes no sense to

[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:40.680]
me. But oh, Shoneys, by the way, thank you. You ever told me that Shoneys big boy. That's it.

[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.900]
That's out there on David Road extension. The Lums was out there on David Road. I don't know if it's

[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:50.620]
still there anymore. And you know what else used to be out there? What tells that restaurant that

[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:54.460]
used to be a sponsor long time? Put them on the map and then they moved to the applause of where Jeff

[01:35:54.460 --> 01:36:04.100]
Cohen is. Sadies buffet. No, not Sadies buffet. The place with the great stuff, Cranberlay.

[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:11.420]
I'm thinking what? I don't. It's not ringing any bells now. I'll decide out of mind it.

[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.860]
Will as soon as you hear you say, ah, used to be right there on David Road extension. Then they

[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:19.400]
moved into the where right where Sadies buffet used to be as a matter of fact. I don't know if

[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.900]
they're still around. There's a great place. Roger and Don and Pemberpine say the reason for

[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.080]
gas going down is one to spur the sale of cars, obviously, and to have some of that big

[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.100]
something seized biofuels. Another alternative fuel sources is a threat. I know it's

[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:42.380]
chopped off. Keep up the good work. Cain, Suck and Joseph Gaki to it says good observations.

[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:47.680]
Rage says I just want to thank you. The economy sucks. I'm a dead over my head in the company.

[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.940]
I work for is probably going under not a whole lot to smile about these days. But and by the way,

[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:56.720]
all the oldies that I'm playing this start in this month, I'm enjoying them. Even the one you

[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.720]
didn't like yesterday by Jim Skyler. What was it called? Oh, the Lee Fowler one. Yentaman. Yentaman,

[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:11.740]
very good. That's here for George. Faster than a touch-tone phone. He was obsessed with

[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:20.740]
the power than a new man at the owner. Able to side step reality in a single bound.

[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:27.660]
Look, they're on the phone. It's a rabbit moosh. It's a breeding jackass.

[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:35.220]
He's the only reason people know it's Yentaman. Yes, it's Yentaman.

[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.060]
I think it's a cute bit and George hated it. George is getting a little sour in his own.

[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.440]
That's the way it is when you work for Joe Bell and he gives you a 3% raise in the

[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:50.120]
lies right right right looks into your face and lies. We're going to make all these opportunities

[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.380]
for you to make all this extra cash and blah blah blah blah and he cares so much about you and

[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:58.860]
your family and the dog. He couldn't give a crap if your whole family was laying out bleeding

[01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:04.360]
death on the street in Hollywood including you probably not. He'd probably run you right over.

[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:07.680]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that George was sure entertaining. Wasn't he?

[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:13.040]
Ray says I'm in debt over my head. The company I work for is probably going under.

[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.380]
And I'll hold out to smile about these days, but I still managed to find entertainment in the

[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:20.780]
near-order show. Well, thank God for Ray. No complaints from Ray. We're entertaining. We're even

[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:25.340]
amusing. I've listened for years and years. I've always enjoyed your show, but now I actually

[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:30.120]
look forward to it each day. I know I have no life. I have no life. He says by the time your show is

[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.060]
over. I know that in a few more hours. I've made it through another day each day between 10 and

[01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:38.360]
two. You're welcome distraction from all the other BS. There were a lot of idiots out there.

[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:42.860]
Pro-Sec Ron, who do the best to ruin your show? Not to mention Joyce and Jolly Joe, but you've

[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:46.380]
always managed to rise above and continue to do an entertaining radio show. They'll never

[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:50.340]
underestimate how important that is especially when it seems like everything else is crashing down

[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:55.760]
around us. You've got it, Ray. It's crashing down around my fat ass. You are the orchestra on the

[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:01.680]
Titanic. All right. Ray, what a great analogy. Keep up the good work, Neil. George, too. You guys

[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.480]
are appreciated. Thank you. How do you like that, Ray? You're not a good guy. Makes us feel like

[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:12.320]
we're doing something constructive as opposed to you blow bad. You know, all that other crap.

[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:18.340]
And Jolly, Joe, give me a song and an answer about his boyfriend, Sid Rosenstein, over there

[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:22.340]
across the street. Somebody better tell him that Sid Rosen Schwartz is Jewish. Then he won't like

[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:28.500]
him so much. Believe me. If ever I worked for anybody who was virulently anti-Semitic,

[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:34.040]
and he says they use three grades and blend them in the pump to come up with five.

[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.780]
They blend them in the pump. Do you understand what that means?

[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:44.380]
I mean, I know what that means. Why do they do that? I don't understand why.

[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.040]
I would do that. Could you please add ponytail to the poll? I'm sure we did already, didn't we?

[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:53.840]
Yep. We got 386. I don't think you're going to get no 500 votes.

[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.160]
Maybe point tell us got 10 votes. Ponytail already has got 10. I agree with that.

[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:05.100]
Ponytail. Oh, here's one from the fake program director at Sirius satellite radio.

[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:09.300]
Okay, let me print that out. A whole bunch of them coming in today. I think we're making a

[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:14.360]
little bit of a comeback on the emails. Maybe they need a little, let's say you must add to the

[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.720]
list. If anyone looks like a young, furry, melrose, shoot me in the head.

[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:23.760]
I have no cavities. I have no teeth. Johnny Rotten. Well, oh, Mullet. Add Mullet to the list.

[01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:27.460]
You want to add that? Sure. Mullet.

[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:33.340]
The fake reny Sochen asks, what song is Tar Baby Pyridine?

[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:42.980]
Well, what is it? I don't know. Star Baby? Star Baby. That's it by the Guess Who.

[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:49.100]
I love that song, by the way. Is that it? Well, find out. Yeah, of course. That's why it's called

[01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:58.920]
Tar Baby, you idiot. Star Baby. Very good. Did you come up with that? That's what I said. No,

[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:02.500]
that's what I came up with. That's one of the few bits you play where I don't know the original

[01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:07.720]
song. Another is that great haze of oxygen parody song about W. Could you please tell us

[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:13.580]
uninformed listeners which song that one parodies as well? Haze of oxygen? Thank you and have a

[01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:24.320]
sock, fake reny Sochen. Do you know what that is? Nope. Rocky says nothing. It's just that,

[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.760]
oh, the armadillo. Thanks, Rocky. Armadillo Cafe. Don't you feel silly? I never went there.

[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:33.960]
And John says Armadillo Cafe. My favorite restaurant ever. See, these people are useful today.

[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.020]
Is Lee Fowler still on WGNOS? Is the fake Larry King? Does he still shot on the air? Is

[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:44.500]
Yantaman about Mr. Radio? No, the Lee Fowler has been dead for years and Mr. Radio is a jackass

[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:52.220]
and idiot. A real noodnik. Who now is the fake Larry King? We just want to hear Mr. Radio

[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:56.260]
on the air. I'll tell you what, every day when we start the show, remind me to say Mr. Radio, Mr.

[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:59.300]
Radio, Mr. Radio, Mr. Radio, Mr. Radio, Mr. Radio, about 20 times then he'll then he'll have his fill.

[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.280]
Oh, what a name.

[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:08.080]
I am the fourth leader.

[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:14.600]
So, big of a, that talent. It's a D.A. show. We night from day into 11. Here on.

[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.620]
4305. 60. 2.A.

[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:19.080]
And the sports here.

[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:22.160]
Most of them with each other, naked in the street.

[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.700]
I was the night to four Christmas and all through the house.

[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:37.700]
That creature was stern, that even a mouse. I couldn't sleep so I lay there in bed.

[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:42.220]
But 9mm close to my head.

[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:48.880]
I heard an ointment, I jumped up to sleep.

[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:53.180]
What in the hell are racquet could be?

[01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:56.820]
I looked around the corners quite hard to believe.

[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:00.880]
I saw Santa but he did not see me.

[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:10.000]
I stood there silently, I didn't make a sound. He pulled toys from his bag and he spread them all around.

[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:14.360]
He filled my stockings with cartridges and then he sat down.

[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:18.460]
But what I saw next is most sure to us now.

[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:25.340]
He walked to the tree and he tore off a branch.

[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.380]
He reached in his pocket and he pulled out a match.

[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.480]
He scraped up some needles, stuck them in his pipe.

[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.680]
Then he struck the match and he gave it a life.

[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:48.600]
His eyes grew small as cheeks started to blow.

[01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:52.820]
He walked to the tree and he filled another bowl.

[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.360]
I started to hoe but it came out dee.

[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:00.980]
He was the night that Santa Claus caught a bus.

[01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:04.700]
My smoke in my Christmas tree.

[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:11.960]
A second graduation Santa Claus did not know.

[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:16.240]
But you got high.

[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:21.780]
You said how do you think I stand the cold and a wide and rainier fly?

[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.400]
Where on I fit all the cookies and milk if I wasn't high?

[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:36.440]
And that was the night that Santa Claus caught one bus by smoking my Christmas tree.

[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.980]
We haven't heard that in a long time and probably won't again anytime soon.

[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:50.580]
That was down 110 now.

[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.460]
In response to the...

[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:57.800]
In response to the shallow person who thinks the rocks are hideous,

[01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:01.540]
please consider not everyone by shoes clothing and accessories.

[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:08.620]
I'm a 39 year old married heteromail who is not one but two pair of these most comfortable shoes.

[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:10.920]
Great show, Neil. Chris Yusuk.

[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.180]
He has so much to do in his spots and sounds like he's got a mouth full of golf balls.

[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:18.620]
Sign Bob. I don't know Bob. He's got a mouth full.

[01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.640]
Hey Bob, I hope you trip over your ugly crocs.

[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.040]
Come on now. Yusuk.

[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:28.040]
Here's a guy who says three grades go into the pump and they're blended.

[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.260]
Makes with the percentage of each to come up with the five grades.

[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:34.180]
Well who can figure that out? It's rape. It's all about rape.

[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.020]
I just got a fax. I should send Redalantia.

[01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:38.300]
Yes? Roslainen hang it up on Obama twice.

[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.240]
Remember what I was saying earlier? Oh yeah.

[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.360]
Here's one from the FATE program director at Sirius.

[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:58.780]
Neil, we feel you would be great fit here at Sirius. Unfortunately, we've made several attempts to contact your agent but have yet to hear a response.

[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:01.260]
Sorry but we've decided to go in a different direction.

[01:46:01.660 --> 01:46:03.700]
We would like George to headline our new Sirius channel.

[01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.700]
It's called the Deaf Roller skating channel.

[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.840]
Since George possesses a great deal of knowledge on roller skating and sign language, he would be a great fit.

[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:14.000]
Of course, George will have to take a pay cut from his salary at QAM.

[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:16.360]
As you know, our stock is only 17 cents a share.

[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:22.220]
We will contact your agent, Norma Kent, to see if George's interest to do the fact that he's negotiated George's deal at QAM.

[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:26.980]
And we feel might be able to get George an even lower price than the reason we thought.

[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:31.200]
Thank you. The FATE program director at Sirius.

[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:31.700]
Yeah.

[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.220]
They want you, George.

[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:34.900]
Sure.

[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:35.660]
They want us.

[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:36.080]
Oh yeah.

[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:38.160]
I'm packing my bag.

[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:41.500]
400 votes on the FATE crisis pool. I think you got a shot at five.

[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:43.840]
I think that would be really something.

[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.200]
By the way, I'm really amused by USMC.

[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:51.580]
I've blocked you a long time ago and I see that on the deleted items.

[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.300]
He's got them all over the place. I'm not reading them. You're wasting your time.

[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.760]
At least it'll keep you off the street.

[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:57.280]
Block, block, block.

[01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.900]
Why are you blocking me because you're a pain in the ass?

[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:05.600]
The idea of the emails isn't to be annoying. Isn't to abuse me or George or Chris or anybody else.

[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:11.100]
The idea is to communicate, which I realize is way beyond many of your scopes, many of your canoli.

[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:13.740]
400 even votes.

[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:14.640]
Mollets got one.

[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.140]
Ponytails got 11.

[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.340]
But baseball cap backwards the sideways 101.

[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:24.360]
Men over 35 should never do that. You look really gay, like a fruitcake.

[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:29.140]
Unless, of course, you were next jock, in which case you might not live past 35.

[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:33.800]
I noticed an inexperienced Chris was pretty amazed at that stat.

[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:38.740]
Now, I didn't just make that up. They were talking about that on Bob McCowen show on the fan here.

[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:41.960]
I was surprised. I know they don't live very long and stuff like that.

[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:47.700]
NFL players 20 years less life expectancy than you're none NFL player.

[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:55.220]
Like I said, that includes all those big fat guys, those big cow's linemen who are not even close to being athletes.

[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:58.680]
But they just take up a lot of space.

[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.380]
Like the fridge. Remember the refrigerator?

[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.000]
William Perry.

[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:02.880]
William Perry.

[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:03.620]
The fridge.

[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:07.000]
Speaking of jocks, what a good segue.

[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:09.560]
Oh, Jay could get six years, 18 years or life.

[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.300]
Oh, yeah.

[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:16.920]
Former football grade, OJ Simpson convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping deserves leniency and sentencing

[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.100]
as he's the first time offender who showed no criminal intent as attorney says in court papers.

[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.740]
We in the general public, however, believe otherwise.

[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:27.060]
Lock his ass up and throw away the key.

[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:32.380]
Attorney Gabriel Grasso argued that Simpson should receive the minimum sentence six years.

[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:40.000]
Grasso acknowledged in court papers clearly Simpson was not using good judgment during a 2007 hotel room confrontation over sports memorabilia.

[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.540]
Simpson could receive a maximum life sentence from Judge Jackie Glass on Friday tomorrow,

[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:48.960]
a pre-sentencing report recommended 18 year sentence.

[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.800]
Tomorrow is sensing.

[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:53.240]
Oh, my God.

[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.420]
Can you handle the pressure?

[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:59.660]
Oh, but on October 3rd, a jury convicted Simpson 61 and could offend a clearance.

[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:01.040]
CJ Stewart to 12 charges.

[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:04.080]
All the guys he hangs out with have got like CJ and AJ.

[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.040]
Who's the other one?

[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.620]
AC AC.

[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:07.800]

[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:08.260]
That's it.

[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:11.240]
They all got like a lot of initials.

[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.520]
You know, like OJ, including conspiracy to commit a crime robbery, assault and kidnapping with the police.

[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:16.120]
They're the deadly weapon.

[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:18.320]
Their convictions stem from the while we know what they are.

[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.360]
Simpson said he was attempting to recover items that belonged to him right.

[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:25.180]
Foreman charged with Simpson cut deals with the prosecution and testified again.

[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.440]
One testified that Simpson asked him to bring the gun to the encounter.

[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:37.400]
These were not crimes committed on strangers, but were asked stemming from prior relationships with the individuals in the room at the palestation Grasso wrote in the memorandum.

[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:42.980]
There was overwhelming evidence that the trial that Simpson's intent was to recover property that was his and only his lawyer argued.

[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:47.040]
The trial testimony showed Simpson's intent was to return anything it didn't belong to him.

[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:54.620]
He added, however, there's nothing in the record to show that Simpson and evidence to criminal mind or show to represent criminal intent.

[01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:03.980]
Because of that and other factors Grasso wrote, Simpson sent and should fall on the low end of the minimum sentencing range just like he falls on the low end of the human Richter scale.

[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:15.040]
In a sentencing brief Stewart 54 defense attorney, Brent Byron, said his crimes should also be sentenced to six years noting he didn't kill anyone nor did he bind or gag anyone.

[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:18.580]
He had no weapon and no weapon and testified, Mr. Stewart, and other weapons are going to be used.

[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.580]
Both sentencing memorandums note that one of the victims, virtually, didn't even want the case prosecuted.

[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:26.280]
Attorneys for both Simpson and Stewart are filed most and seeking a new trial.

[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:30.900]
Simpson's lawyer cited seven reasons why a new trial should be granted in their brief, but it would be put a boot put above.

[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:37.480]
How do you like that? An addition of which putting them in there forever and could have brought back Ron and Nicole, you know, they should have put that in there.

[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.660]
He killed two people in cold blood, but sticking them back in there now, he could have brought them back.

[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:46.060]
Do you think that would be a good move? If only it could.

[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:52.000]
404 on your point, you're creeping toward that 500. If we don't get the 500, an experienced Chris is going to be replaced.

[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:05.480]
The firefighters remain perched high on these long ladders, hoses in hand.

[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:08.560]
You ferry.

[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.560]
Dead dead dead.

[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:13.840]
Someday you'll be dead.

[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:16.160]
Dead dead dead.

[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.520]
Someday we'll all be dead.

[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:26.160]
The medic were born, we start dying. We die a little more, everything.

[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:32.560]
Younger old Richard, poor, there's nothing we can do to stop it.

[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:38.460]
So look long at that Christmas tree, it may be the last one that you see.

[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:43.400]
Decorate your house in green and red, because someday you'll be dead.

[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:43.960]
Oh!

[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:45.700]
Dead dead dead.

[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.020]
Someday you'll be dead.

[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:52.600]
Someday we'll all be dead.

[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.540]
It might happen in a couple months or 50 years from now.

[01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:06.020]
But no matter when it happens, it will seem too soon to you.

[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:11.860]
So be sure on Christmas Eve when you snuggle into bed.

[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:17.500]
That you thank God for your family, because someday they'll be dead.

[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:19.760]
Dead dead dead.

[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.980]
Someday they'll be dead.

[01:52:21.980 --> 01:52:24.260]
Dead dead dead.

[01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:26.640]
Someday we'll all be dead.

[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:34.320]
Who knows how many Christmas is left in their short life?

[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:39.780]
Nobody knows, that's my point, enjoy the while you can.

[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:45.380]
And so on Christmas morning, let good tidings fill your head.

[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:48.900]
What a festive season.

[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:50.960]
Someday you'll be dead.

[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:53.320]
Dead dead dead.

[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:55.440]
Someday we'll be dead.

[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:57.640]
Dead dead dead.

[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:59.860]
Everyone you will die.

[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:03.360]
A very Merry Christmas to you.

[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:07.500]
Dead dead dead.

[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:15.060]
Merry Christmas everybody!

[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.340]
Call 32 at 5.60 W.Q.

[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:18.820]
And don't forget, go see George Saturday.

[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:20.140]
It's already Thursday, Maynard.

[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.580]
You have a lot of time to make your plans.

[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.460]
Go out there right now and buy a whole big bunch of.

[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.600]
I don't know if they'll find anything they can just bring cash.

[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:29.880]
Oh, makes it easier on everyone.

[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.760]
Go to the bank like I said, withdraw all the cash.

[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:34.860]
And you will come, go to the ATM, empty out all your cards.

[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:39.560]
And go see George this Saturday, 2 to 4 at the 4 Lauderdale Metro PCS,

[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:42.680]
2350 North Federal Highway in Fart Lauderdale.

[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.260]
Well, let's see what we got.

[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:47.840]
Florida pre-suit in Indiana.

[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:50.600]
A lawsuit contents a Roman Catholic priest who once worked in Florida

[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:53.480]
sexually abused and 11-year-old boy more than 10 years ago,

[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:56.720]
or more than 10 years after an Indiana diocese had been warned about

[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:57.920]
his inappropriate behavior.

[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:03.020]
The lawsuit filed yesterday against the Gary Diocese's Richard Emerson,

[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.380]
known to some of his friends as Dick.

[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.220]
While a priest at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in Munster, Indiana,

[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:12.720]
repeatedly molested the boy in a parish during 2003 and 2004

[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:14.680]
and forced him to watch a pornographic video.

[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:17.220]
The suit was filed on behalf of the boy now 15,

[01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.720]
referred to the lawsuit as John Doe of Hobart,

[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.560]
the two lawsuits have already been filed in Florida.

[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.820]
Emerson was defrocked in 2006 and given 20 grand to help him

[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:29.260]
with expenses to get his life in order.

[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:33.400]
So Gary Bishop Dale Melzick, Melzick said yesterday he wouldn't

[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:36.920]
come out on the specifics of the lawsuit because the diocese hadn't received a copy yet.

[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:41.440]
The lawsuit accused the diocese of concealing Emerson's behavior

[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:44.600]
and continuing to allow him unlimited access to one supervised young boy

[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.600]
despite similar complaints of sexual molestation.

[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:52.900]
A 2004 letter from Melzick to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,

[01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:57.200]
now Elle Papa, said the bishop had warned Emerson about taking boys on vacation

[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.160]
and letting them stay in his rectum re.

[01:54:59.260 --> 01:54:59.920]
How do you like that?

[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:02.320]
You let the kid stay in his rectum re.

[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:02.980]
How about that?

[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:08.760]
Wow. Well, maybe they figured there was nothing unusual about it.

[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:11.900]
Just par for the course.

[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:19.040]
Oh, here's one from Jim and Cooper City who says if you like Isabella Cassada,

[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:23.260]
you would love Sasha Andrade, another professional spick bitch,

[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:26.280]
who pronounces his name, Sasha Andrade.

[01:55:26.940 --> 01:55:28.140]
I'm saying I can't say it.

[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:29.640]
I can't roll my arms that good.

[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:31.400]
I'm channel 10.

[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.420]
Also, what's up with the sports facts on SNF?

[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:37.340]
If I heard the word jaws one more time, I'm going to kill some people.

[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.460]
What does that mean, in fact, Chris?

[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.920]
I guess Ron Jaworski, I don't know.

[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:43.460]
So I jaws on it.

[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.160]
J.A.W.

[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.320]
The Dennis.

[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:49.900]
Is that what they call him, jaws?

[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:51.340]
Is that like a channel?

[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:52.180]

[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:53.440]
What else channel?

[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:59.700]
Seriously, it's just mind blowing to think that there are people over the age of five

[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:02.720]
watching this world and even enjoying it, even relating to it.

[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:03.640]
What else channel?

[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:09.200]
I'm a frequent plunger with the hard rock and lose my ass on a regular basis.

[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:12.060]
Jim, been listening since 86 years, show gets better every day,

[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.580]
even with the management's hands around your throat.

[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:15.620]
How do you like that? Thanks, Jim.

[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:19.640]
You hear their drilling again?

[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:20.980]
I was told that that was over with.

[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:22.020]
Yeah, well, they lied.

[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:24.860]
You hear it?

[01:56:25.020 --> 01:56:25.160]
Nope.

[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:27.440]
They're drilling up above.

[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:30.200]
They're drilling in an eight to three.

[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:30.980]
I'll tell you that.

[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:32.760]
That was down 75.

[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:33.540]
Oh, geez.

[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:34.840]
Don't say that.

[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:39.320]
Oh, here's a real rich in Orlando, Republican atheist.

[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.040]
What a joke that is.

[01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:44.680]
Neil, haven't you figured out why your groupies want you on serious?

[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:46.460]
They were spoiled by the good old days.

[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:50.580]
And want to hear you say F and SH and A whole and play the great lead.

[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.340]
Like you used to.

[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:52.640]
Yeah, sure.

[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.940]
Let's face it, the two CDs from 93 were the best ever.

[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.820]
But life still goes on.

[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.160]
George Carlin used to say he did TV because it was a challenge to be funny while being clean.

[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.500]
At least you're still relevant.

[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:07.060]
Can the caller say the same?

[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:08.020]
No, they can't.

[01:57:08.060 --> 01:57:09.260]
They're not relevant and they don't exist.

[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.620]
By the way, I have a way to recover part of the wages to be lost by these smucks in a new contract.

[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:16.680]
Details to come soon.

[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:17.600]
Oh, here's another one.

[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:18.560]
Details to come soon.

[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:21.060]
One other question.

[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:22.420]
Who did Rosanna's a D bag?

[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:24.000]
It was my favorite bit from WIOD.

[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:24.860]
It's his rich in Orlando.

[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.480]
Rosanna's a D bag.

[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:26.980]
Bokeh Bryant.

[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.940]
Oh, chicken neck.

[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:30.920]
The great chicken neck.

[01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.220]
Is that it?

[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:37.600]
That's all my emails.

[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:39.180]
I mean, I have to go.

[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:41.740]
I'm just looking.

[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:43.900]
I've got some bedtime stories here.

[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.120]
But the sure is I don't want that.

[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:49.340]
We only got an hour and 24 minutes to kill.

[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:49.600]
Nothing.

[01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:52.820]
Maybe they like some real nifty calls while the emails are piling up.

[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:55.480]
Let me take a look and see how many emails.

[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:56.380]
That was down 89.

[01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:57.960]
Oh, there's all bunch of them.

[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.320]
But those are the deleted ones.

[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.600]
There's none in this view.

[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:01.220]
None.

[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:02.760]
Zero.

[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:05.160]
They've shot their gigantic bolt.

[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.220]
Four out of 27 votes on the pool.

[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:09.540]
What should men over 35?

[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:12.800]
Never wear baseball cap on backwards.

[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:13.940]
The sideways 105.

[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:16.740]
Spandex bicycle shorts 80.

[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.680]
High school graduation ring 59.

[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.640]
Hooper Dangle earrings 50.

[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.680]
Mangloss lipstick 39.

[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:23.900]
Crocs 31.

[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:26.080]
Those hip white sunglasses 17.

[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.520]
Muscle shirts 14.

[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:29.000]
Ponytail 13.

[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.460]
Comet wristbands are different causes eight.

[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.320]
A leather vest seven and mullet four out of 427.

[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:38.440]
I think you got a real, real solid shot.

[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:41.300]
Real crox solid shot again to 500.

[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:45.660]
And if you do get 500 fact, Chris gets a 10 times raise.

[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:46.280]
All right.

[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:47.960]
Up to 30 cent an hour.

[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:59.240]
Don't maybe we should carry this this committee hearing about the big three automakers domestic automakers without help.

[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:01.360]
The automakers will quickly be in bankruptcy.

[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:07.120]
Resulting in liquidations and hundreds of thousands of layoffs at a time when the broader economy is suffering.

[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:14.100]
Yeah, well, maybe if you had made some cars that somebody wanted to buy some fuel efficient cars that somebody with a brain wanted to buy, maybe you wouldn't be as messed right.

[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:14.940]
You had a car.

[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.800]
Big gas guzzling what?

[01:59:17.580 --> 01:59:18.540]
Remember, they killed the electric car.

[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.540]
They were making them and then they stopped and then took them all away and crushed them.

[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:22.120]
Right.

[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:24.540]
They'd be selling those like hot to us.

[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.140]
Take the CEOs away and crush them.

[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:26.480]
Ooh.

[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:27.960]
I'm shopping CEOs.

[01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:36.400]
I could do that, but even I can't do it because I don't even like those bits.

[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:37.020]
The Mickey bits.

[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.100]
Do you?

[01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:40.220]
Honestly, no.

[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:47.240]
I mean, there were some funny parts of some of them, but they're way too long, but the audience loves them.

[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:48.420]
They can't get enough of them.

[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:49.820]
They get even out of their own kind of.

[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:50.060]
Right.

[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:52.540]
Oh, Mickey and Eisner.

[01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:54.240]
And then there's a Chris Matthews one.

[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:57.220]
What I like about them best is probably the same thing that you like about them.

[01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.060]
And then it is that they're really long and you get to go to the bathroom.

[01:59:59.100 --> 01:59:59.800]
A lot of good time.

[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:01.320]
Yeah, I might go do a little joy.

[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.380]
Now I'm feeling a little rumble.

[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:05.420]
A little bit of a rumble.

[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:06.980]
That was around 65 points.

[02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:10.220]
If we all would get a bicycle, man, look how much better shape we'd be in.

[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:14.240]
But I'm going to bike it over to Woodbine this afternoon.

[02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:15.780]
I don't know how I'm going to go or not.

[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:16.940]
Maybe that bitch will be there again.

[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:21.360]
I can take the chair that she tried to pull out from under my ass and just smash her head with it.

[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:21.860]
Would be good.

[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:25.960]
Maybe I'm the only one who encounters this.

[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:27.180]
I've been talking about it for years.

[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:32.960]
This condescending hostile nasty attitude of islands women.

[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:37.480]
And even in the way they speak, man, it's just a whole thing.

[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:39.660]
And maybe the island's men are a bunch of horses, you know.

[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:40.580]
Could be.

[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:44.720]
Maybe they ought to like beat the crap out of these broads and like, you know, and straighten their ass out.

[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:46.420]
When it doubts, straighten their ass out.

[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:47.140]
Come on.

[02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:48.280]
What's the biggest name?

[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.380]
The best house.

[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:50.720]
You know, it's your own projects.

[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:53.060]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:54.900]
The fourth leader.

[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:55.840]
The old Roger's God.

[02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:57.700]
Okay, I, you're my little brother.

[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.600]
So I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.

[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.100]
This is called a trade-o.

[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:02.780]
You spin it and see where it lands.

[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:04.020]
And you sing this song.

[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.600]
I have a little trade-o.

[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.000]
I made it out of clay.

[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:11.200]
And when it's dry and ready, with trade-o, I shall play.

[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:13.020]
Oh, trade-o, trade-o, trade-o.

[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:14.480]
I made you out of clay.

[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:17.660]
Trade-o, trade-o, trade-o, with trade-o, I shall play.

[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:19.520]
Now you try, Ike.

[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:21.380]
Just spin it with your fingers like this.

[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:28.460]
Hey, K-K-K-L-O-P-U.

[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:32.040]
This song, like, all the way.

[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:36.520]
K-K-L-O-P-U-P-U-P-U.

[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.140]
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:39.400]
Oh, hey, Carmen.

[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:40.360]
We're playing trade-o.

[02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:40.960]
You want to try?

[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:41.880]
Sure.

[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:46.380]
Here's a little trade-o that's not in made of clay.

[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.600]
But I'm not gonna play with it cause trade-o's a f**k in game.

[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:51.120]
Hey, shut your mouth, fat ass.

[02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:51.620]
Two.

[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:53.600]
Play stupid games.

[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:54.820]

[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:02.400]
Trade-o, trade-o, trade-o, with trade-o, I shall play.

[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:03.460]
That's why there's little trade-o.

[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:04.060]
What's going on?

[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:05.940]
Oh, it's that Monica thing.

[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:07.840]
It's so amazing.

[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:10.100]
You spin this thing on the ground and it goes,

[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:12.400]
Man, I could watch it the day.

[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:13.600]
Let me try it.

[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:16.900]
I'll try to make it spin.

[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:19.980]
It's bell, I'll try again.

[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:23.300]

Joe Bell gets sucked right into it and sends me that garbage last night

[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:05.820]
George the Donald set on the show the reason you've been talking about 790 so much which I haven't is because you're washed up

[02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:11.160]
And have nothing to say the only reason I talked about them and always because Joe Bell sent me that stupid audio clip last night

[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:15.400]
He also said that WQM tried to replace you with La Bastard and when he declined

[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:20.600]
They tried to replace you with Sedano. He said it was only after a huge pay cut that WQM decided to bring you back

[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:25.420]
Well guess what Jorge guess who's making the cash okay the big bucks even after the big pay cut

They mentioned my name about 600 times and the fake Barry Jack ass and this and that everything they talked about basically stem from this show

[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:24.880]
In addition to which let me say it again if there are any ugly rumors about this one leaving or this one going there or whatever

Just about last week's poll I saw a little input on why

[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:32.940]
Terrific bands like the associations in Chicago or not in the rock and roll hall fame is because none of them died of a drug overdose and that's who

[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:36.800]
I'm having a tear a cat blew his brain. Yeah, that was a bad thing. That's a good start

[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:40.780]

You are I mean you know I said a couple emails about the Rangers like the Rangers

[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:50.940]
Oh, you're the one that keeps sending me the scoop and let me ask you a question

[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:53.860]
Why is it that everybody has to like the teams that you like?

[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:58.580]
That's not that. It's just that there are a case for where they came from absolutely nothing a couple years ago

[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:03.380]
I don't like the team. I don't like the organization. I don't like the nearer. I don't like New York

[02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:06.760]
New York teams as a Toronto is much better much better

[02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:11.580]
That's the team I've followed for 50 years so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna jump to your team because you like him

[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.120]
You're a jackass man. You're an idiot

[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:19.400]
See a an old fart too. I shouldn't know that's why I can't get the damn message on his on his phone

[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:24.520]
He doesn't know where to stick it. I'll tell you where to stick it. Take your Rangers and stuff. I'm okay

[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:33.460]
Starting with that long quest. Oh, and they're leaves are much better. Then this is like another overgrown child my team is better than your team

[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:40.440]
Believe suck, but at least I admit it okay the Maple Leaf stink

[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:43.680]
The Rangers

[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:49.120]
Rhoarts card filter and in their commercial break. I thought we're gonna get a little least hockey here

[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:50.800]

Am I entitled or do I have to agree with you to be a human being you have to agree with them simple thing go back to New York

[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:21.540]
Get on a subway and maybe somebody will stab you. I would say shoot you, but that would be a waste of a bullet

[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.660]
What an obnoxious piece of turd

Q a M hello no

[02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:02.700]
You know something this this thing with him

[02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:07.800]
Now you were saying the other day about supervision and about somebody needs to take him and put a butterfly

[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:10.300]
That around him right and put him in a rubber room somewhere. Uh-huh

[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:15.020]
This is Joe Bell's idea of what collars are on the Neil Rogers show

[02:18:15.660 --> 02:18:22.960]
Is pro-zac Ron over and over and over and over millions and millions and millions of times

[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:28.940]
And we've got Doron Grinovsky. There is nobody else with that name in all South Florida. Great look it up

[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:31.540]
It's right there Doron Grinovsky in Miami

[02:18:32.220 --> 02:18:33.940]
You find him and you got this one

[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:37.680]
But this radio station in this company will make absolutely no effort

[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.780]
And I'm not gonna sit here and put him on 100 times a day. It's just pointless

[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:46.480]
This is a crazy person and this radio station sits back and I all will if you'd screen a cold

[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.000]
But I don't want to screen a cause

[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:51.040]
That's hey that takes away the whole concept of the way I do the phones

[02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:56.760]
But then again you wouldn't know that jolly Joe because you know what squad about this show or what it's all about or how I do it

[02:18:57.900 --> 02:19:01.920]
You jolly Joe he's not the problem jolly Joe is the problem and Joyce

[02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:07.380]
Oh, if we talk to 14 other program directors that talk state remember that?

[02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:07.960]
Mm-hmm

[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:09.020]
Yeah

[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:18.140]
You are an idiot and whoever is in charge of this simpleton of this creature this thing needs to take a hold of it like by a leash

[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:20.080]
Sure and get it out of our face

[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:22.900]
Q.A.M. Hello

No, yes, sir

[02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:29.920]
I think McCain could have did a lot better if he picked Susan Gray instead of Sarah. Yeah. Yeah

[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:33.580]
There he goes the Susan Gray guy against you, what I mean one no Charlie's

[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:38.700]
Hundred years Susan Gray he wants to see her answer something like that whoever whoever that is

[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:42.980]
Q.A.M. Hello. I'm can you how are you?

[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:47.400]
Yes, sir, so thank goodness not another one of those. I don't even want to say to phrase

[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:55.160]

I

[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:38.320]
Remember we are on in your behalf of the Dele our fear is leader

[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:38.740]
Behavior

[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:41.660]
I'm looking for the inspecity, the one who can make me part of the family.

[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:43.880]
No, Ellie, I'm those I'm with, or eat, and stay with.

[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:47.560]
I'm dust, who, George, who, George, easy in it, Middelltown.

[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:50.880]
The drugs is up to fear with the browns,

[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:53.440]
It's filled with rats running under the ground.

[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:57.400]
Who, George, who, George, easy in it, Middelltown.

[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:02.140]
No one is scaring us, time for a deep momma.

[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:04.500]
That is because most people have a life of fear,

[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:07.420]
and don't have the luxury of dying to make fools of themselves,

[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:08.820]
like the wolves in the arms.

[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:10.820]
Don't they know I am Ellie on?

[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:11.860]
Ask a new Joseph.

[02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:14.900]
Or listen, George, I am Ellie on the baby's knees.

[02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:16.480]
Look up, Harry.

[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:20.260]
No, George, no, George, is not Ellie on the town.

[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:23.140]
The drugs is up and me am me is down.

[02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:25.980]
No streaming, children's running around.

[02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:30.280]
No, George, no, George, is not Ellie on the town.

[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:35.120]
Genoaing on our fearless leader, Bidano is indicated here.

[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:37.900]
We've seen, he has told me much about George.

[02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:40.300]
He went where he flew, I'll take you for a condition,

[02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:42.000]
and then he got better brown.

[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:42.800]
Grashy, it's Papa.

[02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:44.320]
Or including one favor, Papa.

[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:47.460]
He went up with that voice for almost 30 years old.

[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.840]
No, thanks, Papa. I throw this kill with me.

[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:52.740]
Who, George, who, George, easy in Middelltown.

[02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:55.740]
The drugs is up and me am me is down.

[02:26:56.260 --> 02:26:58.700]
We live here, we be home by now.

[02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:03.420]
Who, George, who, George, easy in Middelltown.

[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:06.400]
Hi.

[02:27:06.840 --> 02:27:08.760]
118 at 560 WQAM.

[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:10.920]
Oh, look at line nine was the ring, but we missed it.

[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:12.160]
Oh, damn it.

[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:13.760]
I'm sure it was either right.

[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:15.700]
I'm your friend or the Ranger fan again.

[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:20.100]
Who obviously is very, very ill and needs serious medication.

[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:24.940]
Larry says about the Armadillo Beach Cafe happened to be going

[02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:25.800]
to the restaurant tonight.

[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.680]
I remember when you used to advertise on your show back in the

[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:31.240]
days, Larry, looking forward to eating the black and white soup

[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:33.400]
crab cakes and cram burlée for dessert.

[02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:35.900]
I probably will have a glass of wine too.

[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:37.020]
Can I call someone a debag?

[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:38.300]
I didn't think so, Mrs. Larry.

[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:39.320]
No, you can't.

[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:40.340]
We can't even say the word.

[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.900]
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the AT&T and for rise and wireless line.

[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:48.960]
One thing about inexperienced Chris, though, he's going to have

[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:49.840]
500 votes on a poll.

[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:51.260]
495 already.

[02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:55.020]
Your kicking some serious ass.

[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:01.200]
Brandon says out of all the guys, Neil thinks it's hot.

[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:03.160]
Who do you think is actually pretty good looking?

[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:09.240]
Now, he puts the Jonas Brothers on there.

[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.080]
No, that's not good.

[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:14.780]
What do you think?

[02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:19.320]
I'm trying to understand this question.

[02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:23.020]
We're supposed to vote on which guys we think are good looking.

[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:26.860]
Is that what I'm, or I'm the guy's that I think are good looking?

[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:27.880]
Yeah.

[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:30.460]
Which ones do you folks think?

[02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:31.660]
I don't know.

[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:32.480]
It's a thought.

[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:33.220]
Another gay poll.

[02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:34.760]
It's what?

[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.180]
It's a gay poll, in other words.

[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:36.860]
You're right.

[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:39.000]
What even gays have polls?

[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:39.580]
Sure.

[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.820]
That's what I heard from you.

[02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:44.540]
I told you a voice of experience.

[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:47.060]
Well, here comes one about Jamaican's one.

[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:48.380]
I didn't say Jamaican.

[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:48.660]
I don't know.

[02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:50.960]
I didn't ask this woman this bitch where she was from.

[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:53.080]
I should have though.

[02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:53.920]
I know she's from hunger.

[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:56.260]
You're a nasty man.

[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:00.040]
I'll show you a nasty, honey.

[02:29:00.700 --> 02:29:02.400]
Come on over here and let me stick my foot up here.

[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:03.140]
Rectome ass.

[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:08.340]
It says you've talked about island women, or at least Jamaican women being obnoxious.

[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:11.120]
Remember that uncensored video that you're making a woman who called when you were upset

[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:13.040]
about the traffic connected to the soccer game?

[02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:17.180]
The one who told you to show a baseball bat up your ass and you're right about them.

[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:21.960]
Worked customer service at the now-to-funct lens express where the highest call told

[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:26.120]
belonged to a Jamaican woman who basically told the caller when the call was over.

[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:30.600]
The rest of us would have the customer call back and have to finish up their business with us

[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:33.100]
after a long-died trip about her.

[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:37.640]
Problem was the management only looked at her statistics so they considered her the best worker.

[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.780]
Some companies should just go out of business, says.

[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.400]
Please tell Georgia I hope you found the uncensored Gordon Ramsay Hellskissing videos on YouTube.

[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:47.700]
If not, say so and I'll send them a word.

[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:48.720]
I have a great day, Kathy.

[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:49.220]
You did?

[02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:50.340]
Got him, yeah.

[02:29:50.740 --> 02:29:51.660]
He got him. Thanks, Kathy.

[02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:54.440]
You been on him.

[02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:57.660]
Find me a good machine, man. Where are the good machines, man?

[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:02.480]
498 on your poll, Mr. Inexperience.

[02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:03.560]
Cool.

[02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:05.040]
WQAAM, hello.

[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:06.160]
Hello, NU.

[02:30:06.300 --> 02:30:07.280]
Thanks for taking my call.

[02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:09.320]
Okay, thank you so much for making a crank, boy.

[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:10.300]
It's bad, bad one, too.

[02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:11.320]
Real bad one.

[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:12.060]
They're always bad.

[02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:13.540]
I beg your pardon?

[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:14.940]
He's always bad.

[02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:15.860]
Yes, he is.

[02:30:18.180 --> 02:30:21.940]
567-0560, pound 567 on the Verizon ATT, wherever it's lying.

[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:24.400]
WQAAM, hello.

[02:30:25.360 --> 02:30:25.720]
Okay.

[02:30:26.100 --> 02:30:26.500]
One to go.

[02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:28.940]
QAAM.

[02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:33.240]
Yeah, that boy's been a deathly out of control with you.

[02:30:33.340 --> 02:30:34.480]
I don't know what to do with him.

[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:36.780]
What do you think I can do?

[02:30:37.660 --> 02:30:37.980]
Dine?

[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:39.680]
Can you help me with the boyfriend?

[02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:41.640]
How about cro-crowkin would be good?

[02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:43.140]
The board print is seriously...

[02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:44.600]
How about crokin would be really good?

[02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:46.440]
How about dying a wicked death would be great?

[02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:47.340]
The board print is...

[02:30:47.340 --> 02:30:48.860]
How about impaling your rectum with...

[02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:50.560]
Reckum, a sharp-s...

[02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:51.900]
of burning pole would be good.

[02:30:53.480 --> 02:30:54.600]
That was down 36.

[02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:56.620]
You care?

[02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:58.380]
No. I don't either.

[02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:01.660]
Don't forget, Goesee, George Saturday, 2-4 Metro PCS,

[02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:03.900]
20-50 North Federal Highway 4 Lauderdale.

[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:06.520]
I wish you my happy birthday and bring them a bunch of crap.

[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:08.060]
QAAM, hello.

[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:09.720]
Well, see you Friday, control.

[02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:10.980]
QAAM, hello.

[02:31:11.440 --> 02:31:12.480]
Happy birthday, George.

[02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:14.120]
Okay, there they are together again.

[02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:15.720]
DeRong, Gwyneth, Oskion, Prozac, Ron.

[02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:17.380]
There they are right there together again.

[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:18.640]
Easy-sitting target.

[02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:21.880]
But beastly broadcasting in Jolly Jobelle,

[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:22.980]
enjoys bitch and Norma Ken.

[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:25.500]
Oh, we didn't know what to tell you, Neil.

[02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:26.240]
I...

[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:29.100]
And I don't care.

[02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:31.000]
And you know something?

[02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:33.840]
I'll be more than happy to put them on a thousand times a day,

[02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:36.500]
every day all day, because I don't care.

[02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:37.880]
If they don't care, why should we care?

[02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:38.660]
That's George's attitude.

[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:39.260]
Right?

[02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:40.560]
Don't care more than them.

[02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:41.280]
You'll go nuts.

[02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:42.320]
That's right.

[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:43.300]
And they don't care at all.

[02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:46.340]
Oh, let's put another sports you on there

[02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:47.800]
and get this faggot off the air.

[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:48.500]
Come on, guys.

[02:31:48.660 --> 02:31:49.980]
Let's put a sports you on there.

[02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:52.660]
Jesus, he's ruining the sanctity of our sports.

[02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:56.020]
Yeah, we can put Drew Rosenhouse on again.

[02:31:56.020 --> 02:31:58.200]
And we can get him in the Alex Marvezon

[02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:59.200]
next to time each day.

[02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:00.400]
And also Iroh Windbag.

[02:32:01.420 --> 02:32:01.820]
And...

[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:04.060]
WQAM, hello.

[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:05.620]
That was good, Austin.

[02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:07.500]
About two or three weeks ago,

[02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:09.020]
you were talking about under-interactors

[02:32:09.580 --> 02:32:10.500]
from the Godfather movie.

[02:32:11.380 --> 02:32:13.480]
You know, either your phone is bad

[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:15.180]
or you've got 40 pounds of mushroom in your mouth.

[02:32:15.300 --> 02:32:16.880]
I can't understand, Bill, the award you're saying.

[02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:19.220]
Yeah, can you remember now?

[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:20.080]
Bad.

[02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:22.020]
Call back.

[02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:22.840]
Okay.

[02:32:25.500 --> 02:32:26.060]
Okay.

[02:32:28.860 --> 02:32:29.420]
WQAM.

[02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:31.960]
QAM, hello.

[02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:34.420]
Hi.

[02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:35.560]

[02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:36.320]
Hi.

[02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:38.820]
Yeah.

[02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:41.820]
I'll ask you a question.

[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:43.340]
Have you heard?

[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:44.400]
I didn't hear it.

[02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:49.180]
Who is that 10-12-2?

[02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:50.040]
Okay.

[02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:52.000]
Take that phone, stick it in your back,

[02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:52.820]
go wash it off a little bit.

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:52.820]

[02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:54.220]
Then call us back.

[02:32:55.880 --> 02:32:56.520]
WQAM, hello.

[02:32:57.020 --> 02:32:57.640]
Hey, Neil.

[02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:00.220]
Earlier today, that lady called you

[02:33:00.220 --> 02:33:02.400]
about some bit about a gun, the gun bit.

[02:33:02.900 --> 02:33:03.820]
Did you guys ever play that?

[02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:06.700]
What bit are you talking about?

[02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:09.240]
Well, a lady earlier,

[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:10.660]
you read an email or something

[02:33:10.660 --> 02:33:12.560]
and she wanted you to play some...

[02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:13.840]
And what did I say?

[02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:15.940]
I said, I haven't got any idea what it is.

[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:16.380]
Right.

[02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:18.980]
It's that one just by handguns.

[02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:19.600]
Remember that one?

[02:33:20.180 --> 02:33:21.660]
A lot of handguns.

[02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:22.000]
Yeah.

[02:33:22.180 --> 02:33:23.620]
Well, the convenience store.

[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:24.760]
That's the one she's talking about.

[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:27.140]
So I just wanted to remind you,

[02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:28.360]
in case you forgot, that's all.

[02:33:28.580 --> 02:33:29.520]
I know, I don't want to play it.

[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:30.860]
All right, I love your show, Neil.

[02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:31.780]
See you.

[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:34.120]
I didn't want to remind me in case I forgot.

[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:36.620]
Because I'm getting old and seen out.

[02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:37.060]
You know me.

[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:37.740]
Hey, don't forget.

[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:39.900]
504 votes on Chris's pool.

[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:40.720]
I didn't forget that.

[02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:43.300]
He's got it going, man.

[02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:46.120]
WQAM, hello.

[02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:47.580]
Hello.

[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:49.320]
And he, and he, and he, and he.

[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:50.060]
QAM, hello.

[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:51.200]
Hello, Neil.

[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:52.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:54.820]
Hey, sir, you talk about Jenny Rockets, though.

[02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:57.560]
The first, my first job was there when I was a kid.

[02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:00.160]
Just don't order anything with mushrooms or tuna.

[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:02.700]
Those things, people don't really order them too much.

[02:34:02.860 --> 02:34:04.540]
So you could be eating about seven-day old tuna

[02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:07.280]
and rancid mushrooms that they just cover up in water, so.

[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:09.320]
Okay, dump that.

[02:34:11.140 --> 02:34:12.260]
You probably would be better.

[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:12.680]
Huh?

[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:13.260]
Right.

[02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:15.820]
Probably works with the competition.

[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:24.220]
Did anybody ever talk about the, again, I got no response on the emails about the Godfathers,

[02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:26.320]
if it's still in the, a Hestation, anywhere.

[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:28.560]
Right.

[02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:32.100]
That just seemed like an untoward combination to me.

[02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:32.620]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:33.700]
Mm-hmm.

[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:35.200]
Gas and Godfather.

[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:35.760]
All over the feed.

[02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:36.880]
No, I know you never had a pizza.

[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:38.660]
You probably get some good gas, but I don't know.

[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:41.280]
It just seemed like a strange combination.

[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:42.660]
Yes.

[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:44.020]
QAM, hello.

[02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:45.520]
Joe paid me to call you.

[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:46.880]
Yeah, I believe that.

[02:34:47.540 --> 02:34:48.120]
I believe that.

[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:49.340]
You hear that?

[02:34:49.660 --> 02:34:50.220]
Mm-hmm.

[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:53.820]
Joe pays Prozac Ron to calls.

[02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:54.540]
I believe him.

[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:56.080]
By the word.

[02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:57.480]
The best talent.

[02:34:57.660 --> 02:34:59.160]
Hey, Joe, I'm your friend.

[02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:01.140]
4.60 QAM.

[02:35:01.340 --> 02:35:02.880]
The fourth leader.

[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:04.660]
So take your name.

[02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:05.900]
The best talent.

[02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:07.360]
It's a D.A. Joe.

[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:08.720]
Wing Knights, from the Indian Tournament.

[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:09.120]
Iran.

[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:11.380]
4.305.60 QAM.

[02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:13.780]
The Sports Theater.

[02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:15.360]
Neil God.

[02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:28.460]
Strange things in my box.

[02:35:29.300 --> 02:35:33.680]
They're crawling around here chewing on my bulls.

[02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:36.320]
This is revenge here.

[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:46.140]
Yes, I should have been a nicer guy on earth.

[02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:49.100]
Nibbling at my brain.

[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:51.160]
Art, tiny tritters.

[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:53.920]
I know this for sure.

[02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:56.680]
This place is a sh**er.

[02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:59.460]
I've done better dives than this.

[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:03.040]
Could someone turn on the f**king lights?

[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:09.720]
Yes, strange things I have done.

[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:14.200]
Or should I say that I have ordered it to be done?

[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:19.480]
Like cooling round with people's kneecaps with a gun.

[02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:22.280]
Busting goes for fun.

[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:25.000]
Hey, it passed the time away.

[02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:27.780]
But look, it's time to pass away.

[02:36:28.140 --> 02:36:32.280]
So though I may be gone, I'm not forgotten.

[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:37.640]
I'll just keep em' blows and smell kind of rotten.

[02:36:38.220 --> 02:36:40.620]
I'm just real worm food.

[02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:44.720]
For strange things in this box.

[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:49.860]
Hey, close the lid for Christ's sake, Richard.

[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:52.060]
You're getting ducked.

[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.980]
What happened to that, long time?

[02:36:55.180 --> 02:36:56.520]
That was my request on the facts.

[02:36:56.660 --> 02:36:57.740]
I'll be like that on Emia.

[02:36:58.180 --> 02:36:58.980]
And whatever that thing is.

[02:36:59.300 --> 02:36:59.600]
All right.

[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:00.880]
I'm confused.

[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:01.960]
I'm old and confused.

[02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.100]
I'm your friend, though.

[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:04.300]
I'm your friend.

[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:05.280]
You know something?

[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:06.240]
I do not care.

[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:10.400]
As of today, he can call 6,000 times a day.

[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:11.040]
I don't care.

[02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:12.580]
And his boyfriend.

[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:13.640]
I run.

[02:37:13.940 --> 02:37:15.320]
He can call 40,000 times a day.

[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:15.900]
I don't care.

[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:19.780]
I mean, this is the most bogus crap in the world.

[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.200]
We've got the name, the address.

[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:28.440]
We've got the shoe size and the brain size, which is 0.0.

[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:29.660]
Like the numbers across the street.

[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:32.220]
And they still don't want to do nothing.

[02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:32.960]
So guess what?

[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.480]
That's an Earage show.

[02:37:34.740 --> 02:37:36.400]
Oh, let's have another sports show instead.

[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:40.220]
I got a good idea.

[02:37:40.380 --> 02:37:43.080]
Let's have that moron call in and talk about the ranges all day.

[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:46.860]
Pedro says, I know of two Hess stations that have a godfathers.

[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:49.900]
One on Northwest 41st, reading the hundredth-seventh ab.

[02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:52.220]
Another one on Bird Road near Tropical Park.

[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:53.680]
Haven't been there in a while.

[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:55.440]
I prefer Frankie's and or Sir Pizza.

[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:58.140]
Also discovered a new place called Andiamo's Pizza.

[02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:01.540]
Fresh ingredients crispy dough and a sauce that is not too heavy on the spices.

[02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:02.460]
Andiamo.

[02:38:04.620 --> 02:38:05.300]
Well, that nice.

[02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:06.140]
I like godfathers.

[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:07.420]
Just fine.

[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:08.600]
Remember they brought us in the pizza?

[02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:09.700]
It was a QAA, wasn't it?

[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:09.960]
Yep.

[02:38:10.440 --> 02:38:14.020]
That was back in the days before we had anybody so persnickety about people bringing food in.

[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:18.500]
Just another example of the kind of dullard we're dealing with.

[02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:19.160]
Oh, no.

[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:20.380]
We don't want no food in there.

[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:20.700]
Oh.

[02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:23.720]
This is amazing.

[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:25.300]
This is scandalous.

[02:38:26.420 --> 02:38:31.720]
Here's an email that says W.I.O.D. is having a pool about the most fascinating person.

[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:34.720]
And Jimmy Cifilis said he voted for Rush Limbaugh.

[02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:36.320]
God.

[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:40.840]
I thought Phil Henry was bad sucking right wing ass before Jimmy Cifilis.

[02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:41.200]
Wow.

[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:43.800]
Across from what I hear.

[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:45.940]
Hey, Jimmy.

[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:47.420]
You, you fairy.

[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:49.780]
How's that wine business coming for Jimmy?

[02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:56.960]
I eat it says as far as the police concerned, you can add corn rolls and braids.

[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.480]
I can't stand that crap on older men.

[02:38:58.660 --> 02:38:59.880]
Corn rolls and braids.

[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:00.420]
Corn rolls.

[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:02.760]
Well, she's got corn rolls.

[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:03.260]
Okay.

[02:39:03.480 --> 02:39:04.240]
We'll excuse her.

[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:06.520]
Corn rolls.

[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:10.720]
I mean, I affect that ordering lunch right now, getting some lobster ravioli.

[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:11.580]
Get a corn dog.

[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:12.860]
Do you ever have lobster ravioli?

[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:15.020]
I don't think so.

[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:17.440]
Oh, my god.

[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:22.560]
Anyway, I found this new restaurant called Brimstone Woodfire Grill in Pemberton, Pines

[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:23.100]
is Aida.

[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:24.840]
I-75 in Pines Boulevard.

[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:26.800]
It says clobby, not Kobe.

[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:28.520]
Cobby beef sliders that were incredible.

[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:31.400]
Aida is like a little, you know, illiterate, but she means well.

[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:34.400]
And by the way, I frequent the hard rock.

[02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:36.520]
It's great, but the Wheel of Fortune machines don't pay Schmidt.

[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:37.040]
That's correct.

[02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:39.820]
And they've only got like three real ones in the rest of the moral air zots.

[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:40.760]
They're all make believe.

[02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:43.360]
That's my only knock on the hard rock.

[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:46.380]
Bad Wheel of Fortune machines.

[02:39:46.380 --> 02:39:49.500]
They've got all those make believe ones and ones where you got to get three, three

[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:50.580]
different things to get a spin.

[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:53.220]
Wheel of Fortune, you know, like in three different wheels.

[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:53.740]
Stupid.

[02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:54.060]

[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:59.020]
And then they got the ones the quarter and the 50 cent and the dollar and 80 billion

[02:39:59.020 --> 02:40:02.460]
dollar ones with like 19 lines times 600 credits.

[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:04.740]
Oh, just silly.

[02:40:05.340 --> 02:40:07.240]
PS George, what do you have against Puerto Rican women?

[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:08.200]
Be careful, shorty.

[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:09.700]
She says nothing.

[02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:10.700]
Oh, it's Aida.

[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.780]
She says she pronounced it wrong last time.

[02:40:13.780 --> 02:40:14.360]
I email email.

[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:14.940]
Do you thank you?

[02:40:14.940 --> 02:40:15.660]
Sorry, Aida.

[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:17.540]
It's the only one that keeps saying that Aida.

[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:18.920]
What?

[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:20.240]
Do you have a thing against you like that?

[02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:21.900]
You like to have a thing against Puerto Rican women.

[02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:22.020]
Right.

[02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:22.300]
Me.

[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:24.640]
I can't tell you what thing, but you can imagine.

[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:24.980]
I can't.

[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:25.800]
Oh, yeah.

[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:28.140]
Mike and Ford.

[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:31.080]
Myer says, oh, he's the one that requested strange things in my box.

[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:32.300]
Haven't played.

[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:36.060]
Well, we've got a couple of guitar man bits on today that we can actually play and we haven't

[02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:37.480]
played in a long, long time.

[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:40.980]
Mike says these calls are ponderous.

[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:41.760]
Just an idea.

[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:45.240]
Why not make that Chris actually do some work and screen calls like the old days?

[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:46.320]
I don't want to.

[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:46.620]
Okay.

[02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:48.120]
I don't want to.

[02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:52.140]
I've been doing screenless for years and years on our DN here and it worked just great.

[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:52.960]
It was a lot of fun.

[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:55.700]
And these people of course, they don't.

[02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:56.620]
So that's it.

[02:40:56.700 --> 02:40:58.320]
I'm not going to keep repeating it over and over again.

[02:40:58.440 --> 02:40:59.140]
It is what it is.

[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:01.460]
It is what it is.

[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:05.920]
And if we get a one share and eight share, the only thing is the bonus money, which we might

[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:06.760]
as well forget about anyway.

[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:07.420]
Right.

[02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:10.980]
Other than that, there's there's nothing to work for here because they don't care.

[02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:11.800]
They don't want to compete.

[02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:15.140]
All they want to do is make Google eyes at the guys across the street.

[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:16.340]
Oh, you hear what this one said?

[02:41:16.460 --> 02:41:16.980]
You hear what that one is?

[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:17.540]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:20.460]
That's jolly joebell making Google eyes.

[02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:23.760]
It's the kid and Jorge Sedano and this one who cares?

[02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:25.660]
Little league, baby.

[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:26.720]
Talk about sports.

[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:27.620]
Little league.

[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:28.340]
Bush league.

[02:41:28.420 --> 02:41:29.980]
They don't even own the damn station over there.

[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:36.940]
It's a it's a lease deal with freaking Dennis Collins, my god of the snooze funeral days.

[02:41:38.300 --> 02:41:40.900]
And they're talking a lot of crap and this guy's paying attention to it.

[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:43.200]
I wonder where he got the audio clip, by the way.

[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:44.960]
I'm sure they sent it to him.

[02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:47.360]
Yeah, well, why would they do that?

[02:41:48.300 --> 02:41:49.840]
They're all part of the same fraternity, aren't they?

[02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:50.980]
Oh, I forgot.

[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:53.120]
Yeah, that's a good question.

[02:41:53.300 --> 02:41:54.120]
Where the hell did he get that?

[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:56.060]
And why is he wasting my time sending it to me?

[02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:59.140]
Don't send me any more stupid audio clips, jolly joe.

[02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:00.200]
You fat ass fool.

[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:08.240]
Now, here's one from Gruber Tuchas or somebody with eight million subject sunshine.

[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:14.480]
And guess what just popped up on my monitor here?

[02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:15.300]
I don't know.

[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:17.220]
You and a blue speed up my PC.

[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:18.380]
Where does that stuff come from?

[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:18.900]
A pop-up?

[02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:19.860]
Yeah.

[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:22.040]
Where the hell did that come from?

[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:22.400]
From the internet?

[02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:23.940]
How about your partner?

[02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:24.880]
They come from the internet?

[02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:26.840]
What do you mean by that?

[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:28.500]
You have a browser open?

[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:29.660]
Yes.

[02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:30.100]
Yes?

[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:32.960]
Well, I have my outlook express open.

[02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:35.140]
You have a browser open?

[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:35.880]
No.

[02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:36.740]
Yes?

[02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:38.200]
I would look express.

[02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:39.900]
You have a browser open?

[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:40.880]
You have Firefox open?

[02:42:40.980 --> 02:42:41.420]
That's a browser.

[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:42.140]
Yes, that's correct.

[02:42:42.300 --> 02:42:42.800]
I know that.

[02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:45.720]
I said yes, you didn't like that answer, so I gave you another one.

[02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:47.340]
Jesus God.

[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:50.900]
No wonder his wife was using a Croco wicket death.

[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.780]
When it popped up, were you switching web-nade?

[02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:56.540]
No, I was just sitting here talking and I looked over and there it was.

[02:42:56.900 --> 02:42:57.720]
It's not a big deal.

[02:42:57.720 --> 02:42:58.220]
It's gone.

[02:42:58.220 --> 02:42:59.780]
Once it's gone, it's gone.

[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:02.700]
Jesus, you guys are so hyper.

[02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:04.000]
Just relax like me.

[02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:06.620]
Here's one from Nick.

[02:43:06.780 --> 02:43:08.680]
You should just let Jerome and Ron have their own show.

[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:11.820]
I guess it's the radio equivalent of cutting off your nose despite your face.

[02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:12.740]
What do you care?

[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:16.440]
The beastlies have taken away your bits and inundated you with chronics.

[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:20.640]
So why don't you let those a-holes just talk for four hours while you read a magazine or watch TV?

[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:23.660]
I can watch a Jonas Brothers concert.

[02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:28.620]
George can look up porn and steal music and you can leave it to Chris the to man the dump

[02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:28.920]
button.

[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:31.420]
The show needs an animus as Nick.

[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:33.620]
Amen Nick needs a big animal.

[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:36.400]
Yes, Neil.

[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:40.600]
All Hess stations have got from this pizza just like mobiles have blimpies.

[02:43:40.860 --> 02:43:43.080]
You can get gas two ways, is Larry?

[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:43.820]
No, they don't.

[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:44.320]
No, they don't.

[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:44.500]
Huh?

[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:46.180]
All Hess stations do not have them.

[02:43:47.140 --> 02:43:48.240]
Well, that's what he says.

[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:48.880]
He's an idiot.

[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:49.860]
You lie, Larry.

[02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:51.260]
Oh, Tony, you West Kendall.

[02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:52.700]
Neil, a 104 PM.

[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:56.360]
I was driving back to the yard to the work and the quarter Schlotz guy called you.

[02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:00.220]
You called him Antonio for something.

[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:01.840]
Tony, West Kendall.

[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:03.940]
Believe me, I'm not the quarter Schlotz guy.

[02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:06.080]
Anyway, I'm glad you didn't get hurt with a chair trick.

[02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:10.440]
That was done to me many years ago and I was in pain for months is the quarter Schlotz

[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:11.680]
guy celebrity or an entertainer?

[02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:12.560]
No, he's an a-hole.

[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:16.960]
Anyway, you have a great show and enjoyed very much regards to you, George and Mr.

[02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:17.980]
Chris, Tony West Kendall.

[02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:18.920]
Well, guess what, Tony?

[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:20.680]
I'm going to tell you that quick-telling us who to put on the ear.

[02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:22.180]
Okay, Tony?

[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:23.800]
Or just go the hell away.

[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.920]
Chris played fair and booking, saying Pete Church for wedding.

[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:30.000]
Here's a story about a little lady.

[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:33.140]
Oh, my God.

[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:35.100]
Like we care about this Queen's wedding.

[02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:36.440]
Is there anybody out there?

[02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:38.240]
Hey, Charlie, you fairy.

[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:39.340]
Oh, my God.

[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:40.680]
Get a life, please.

[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:41.480]
Please.

[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:41.900]
Please.

[02:44:41.900 --> 02:44:43.080]
You're going to get a life.

[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:43.580]
Get a life.

[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:45.300]
Get a life.

[02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:46.420]
I have no life.

[02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:47.540]
I have no life.

[02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:48.380]
I have no life.

[02:44:48.380 --> 02:45:05.480]
I have no life.

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:18.340]

[02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:22.300]
Just like the works I used to know.

[02:45:22.620 --> 02:45:29.440]
Yes, Kendall Wax Music presents Elmer Fudz, Christmas Quasix, and this 24-record set is

[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:30.900]
truly incredible.

[02:45:31.280 --> 02:45:35.420]
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

[02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:39.580]
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sway.

[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.380]
Oh, what fun you'll have, hearing these timeless quasics performed by America's most

[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:47.020]
beloved hunter of wabbits.

[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:49.320]
We'll go up the where nose-way dear.

[02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:51.740]
Have a very shiny nose.

[02:45:52.620 --> 02:45:56.780]
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it well.

[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:02.340]
Elmer Fudz, Christmas Quasix, not available in stores, and when you receive your set

[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:03.920]
in the mail, you'll know why.

[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:04.720]
Hello, everybody.

[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:07.680]
I sure hope you like my Christmas Quasix.

[02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:10.000]
So call toll-free.

[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:11.500]
One 800.

[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:12.220]
Fun.

[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:14.640]
But, operators are standing by.

[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:18.340]
Santa Claus is coming to town.

[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:20.280]
QAM Hello.

[02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:21.400]
Hey, Nicole.

[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:22.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:23.460]
How are you, buddy?

[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:24.180]
Good.

[02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:26.960]
I'm like a pure, pure listener.

[02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:28.300]
What?

[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000]
Like a pure listener.

[02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:32.860]
That was a good one.

[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:35.380]
That was 20 when I started listening to you.

[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:36.000]
Yeah.

[02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:38.460]
Neil, two, a couple things.

[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:40.020]
I went to see Luis Miguel.

[02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:44.460]
Again, I know you used the kind of leg to where you think.

[02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:45.240]
Yeah.

[02:46:45.380 --> 02:46:46.200]
He spoke in English.

[02:46:46.520 --> 02:46:47.700]
I said, oh, Neil was here.

[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:48.660]
He would have enjoyed that.

[02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:49.400]
Uh-huh.

[02:46:49.980 --> 02:46:50.380]
Okay.

[02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:55.600]
Last thing I wish, uh, you'd think kind of leave us trying to get a job shining Obama shoes.

[02:46:56.460 --> 02:46:56.860]
Okay.

[02:46:56.980 --> 02:46:59.400]
Here's the one from Jim and Getsville who's beyond chronic.

[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:01.240]
He said did someone say chronic?

[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:04.440]
Now I want you to listen to this and see if you can understand it.

[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:04.660]
Okay.

[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:05.300]
I'm sure you can't.

[02:47:05.380 --> 02:47:06.440]
I mean, turn the monitor up.

[02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:07.900]
Did someone say chronic?

[02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:12.140]
And then he says the Jonas Brothers appear to be as queer as a football bat, but those kids

[02:47:12.140 --> 02:47:13.800]
are caching in, I guess that's all that comes.

[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:15.280]
That's a good line.

[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:16.760]
First of all, what is a football bat?

[02:47:17.180 --> 02:47:17.840]
That's just it.

[02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:20.280]
Like a $3 bill.

[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:21.380]
Oh.

[02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:26.780]
And believe me, I know all about gay and I'm looking at them and I don't see anything

[02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:29.400]
that they're just, you know, I don't think so.

[02:47:29.460 --> 02:47:32.840]
I think it sounds like swishful thinking on your part, Jim, and Getsville.

[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:35.260]
That's what happens when you don't get out of the house very much and you live near

[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:35.580]
Buffalo.

[02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:37.260]
That's what happens.

[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:38.640]
How about that game, this Sunday?

[02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:42.260]
You guys coming up for the Adolfing Game against the bills in the Roger Center and Ted

[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:46.080]
Rogers just croaked to you coming up?

[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:46.800]
Yeah, I'll be there.

[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:48.420]
What about you, George?

[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:49.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:50.740]
We love the dolphins.

[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:52.060]
They lose a lot.

[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:52.540]
Come on.

[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:53.260]
Let's hear it.

[02:47:53.320 --> 02:47:54.340]
We're taking the QAM plane.

[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:56.200]
Good thinking.

[02:47:57.180 --> 02:47:57.840]
Bring Johnny Joe.

[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:01.040]
And by the way, when you get about halfway up, when you get to like, oh, I don't know North

[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:03.080]
Carolina, drop his ass off back in Raleigh.

[02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:05.380]
Just open up the door and drop him off.

[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:08.340]
531 votes on your poll.

[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:09.560]
Pretty good work today, I would say.

[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:10.440]
Well, thank you very much.

[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:13.240]
QAM chronic line.

[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:13.500]
Hello.

[02:48:13.900 --> 02:48:15.000]
Make the mistake, Neil.

[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:16.480]
It's only one QAM.

[02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:16.700]
Hello.

[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:18.400]
I'm your fan.

[02:48:19.620 --> 02:48:20.300]
I'm your friend.

[02:48:20.700 --> 02:48:21.080]
Yeah.

[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:22.620]
I have no life, but I'm your friend.

[02:48:22.980 --> 02:48:23.200]
Yeah.

[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:26.100]
And the road's my friend and we use local butter.

[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:28.560]
And then we use cream on our restrooms.

[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:29.120]
Oh, yeah.

[02:48:29.180 --> 02:48:29.680]
We know that.

[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:30.240]
Bracket.

[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:32.300]
Trust me, that everybody in town knows that.

[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:33.500]
We can smell it all the way up here.

[02:48:36.380 --> 02:48:41.260]
Maybe actually if we gave him a little bit more latitude, maybe he might regale us with

[02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:42.280]
some interesting information.

[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:43.300]
No, I tried that.

[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:43.960]
You're welcome to.

[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:45.720]
You tried it?

[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:46.260]
Sure.

[02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:47.920]
You tried having a little chance.

[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:49.160]
I tried it on more than one occasion.

[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:49.660]
Absolutely.

[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:50.240]
On end.

[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:51.000]
Crazy person.

[02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:51.580]
Go for it.

[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:52.560]
Give it a shot.

[02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:53.060]
You'll see.

[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:56.500]
Anyway, here's Brandon sent me the whole menu from Johnny F. and Rockets.

[02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:56.960]
Excellent.

[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:01.340]
And you know something maybe later on, I wonder are they openly?

[02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:02.860]
How late are they open?

[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:07.320]
I don't know how late they're open up there.

[02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:08.240]
I'll talk about the one here.

[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:11.900]
The one here is like in a very highly trafficked area, Dundas Square.

[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:15.440]
I mean, like by the eating center, you know, you do a lot of eating by the eating center.

[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:17.960]
Rockets single.

[02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:19.100]
Rockets double.

[02:49:19.340 --> 02:49:22.060]
What I rockets double, you've got to have a big mouth to put around that baby.

[02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:22.900]
Let me tell you.

[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:28.960]
The original number 12 cheddar cheese fresh lettuce, onion, slice, pickle mayonnaise,

[02:49:29.100 --> 02:49:31.980]
and our tangy red red sauce on a scale of one to ten.

[02:49:32.020 --> 02:49:32.440]
It's a 12.

[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:36.900]
It says root 66 Swiss cheese grilled mushrooms, grill onions, and mayo.

[02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:39.940]
What was that kid saying before about the shrooms?

[02:49:41.820 --> 02:49:43.280]
Oh, the one that I dumped.

[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:43.880]
Yeah.

[02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:45.720]
But if you were listening online, you heard it.

[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:49.480]
I mean, these people that complain, it's just amazing to me.

[02:49:49.700 --> 02:49:50.720]
Remember yesterday we get some.

[02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:50.880]
Yep.

[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:53.620]
Shmuck complaining, you heard something we had a dump.

[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:54.080]
Yep.

[02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:54.760]
And it got on.

[02:49:54.820 --> 02:49:55.460]
He heard it online.

[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:56.480]
That's like a bonus.

[02:49:57.580 --> 02:49:59.560]
That's like a bonus, no extra charge.

[02:50:01.020 --> 02:50:04.140]
It's almost like we went to a serious, you know what I mean without going bankrupt.

[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:07.420]
Oh, he took a big pay cut to stay there.

[02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:07.740]
You know what?

[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:11.680]
I'm still making a big bucks and you lose his over there still trying to eat out a living.

[02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:12.040]
Okay.

[02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:15.620]
And still wondering just when that whole operation is going to go bust.

[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:18.460]
Big and cheddar double, that looks good.

[02:50:18.460 --> 02:50:21.160]
But also again, got to have a big push to put around that thing.

[02:50:21.920 --> 02:50:22.440]
Paddy melt.

[02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:25.600]
There's my favorite grilled onions and American and cheddar cheeses on grilled

[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:26.000]
rye bread.

[02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:28.160]
Anybody who don't like a patty melt is comedy style.

[02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:28.940]
Take that right now.

[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:29.960]
Good.

[02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:32.440]
God, ever see patty melt just this morning.

[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:34.680]

[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:39.540]
Mm-hmm.

[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:40.240]
Chili size.

[02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:40.640]
Yep.

[02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:41.640]
Don't they also have that at that?

[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:43.960]
Is that place still around the chili?

[02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:46.480]
What with the skyline chili?

[02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:47.480]
Don't know.

[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:49.200]
See you around a ton.

[02:50:49.260 --> 02:50:50.420]
I think so it is.

[02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:50.800]
Is it?

[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:53.120]
I think I drove by once or twice.

[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:56.740]
They have the pasta with the chili, you know, and the cheddar cheese grated.

[02:50:57.900 --> 02:50:58.460]
It's great.

[02:50:59.420 --> 02:51:00.880]
You don't know from skyline chili?

[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:01.560]
I don't.

[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:03.100]
Yeah, you do.

[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:03.860]
They came in one ton.

[02:51:03.860 --> 02:51:04.720]
I don't.

[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:05.840]
Well, you got a bad memory.

[02:51:06.500 --> 02:51:08.660]

[02:51:18.980 --> 02:51:19.340]

[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:21.600]
They got the bokeh burger at Johnny F and Rockets.

[02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:22.580]
How do you have like that?

[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:23.220]
Wow.

[02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:25.940]
Smokehouse single, smokehouse double.

[02:51:27.220 --> 02:51:29.620]
But you know something, I don't see any Nathan's hot dogs on here.

[02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:30.280]
I think they lied.

[02:51:30.420 --> 02:51:32.860]
Whoever's, I didn't see any on the menu either when I went there.

[02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:36.500]
Somebody's full of crap.

[02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:36.880]
Okay.

[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:39.040]
Oh, they all, all of them have the Nathan's on.

[02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:39.760]
I know they don't.

[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:41.200]
You're full of it.

[02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:47.300]
So many liars and game players and cheaters and miscreants and malcontents and lunatics.

[02:51:49.640 --> 02:51:51.280]
Toronto game could be blacked out.

[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:52.380]
It says hot dog.

[02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:54.060]
Nathan's famous Albe hot dog.

[02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:55.620]
See, I told you they got it.

[02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:56.660]
There was twist of deli style.

[02:51:56.780 --> 02:51:56.980]
Muffin.

[02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:57.540]
You bet you.

[02:51:57.780 --> 02:51:59.480]
The best at Johnny F and Rockets.

[02:51:59.940 --> 02:52:04.440]
According to ticket masters website, non VIP seats to Sunday's game range in price from

[02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:07.500]
105 to 350 bucks Canadian with such deep prices.

[02:52:07.500 --> 02:52:10.220]
Many bills fans have decided to stay in Buffalo Sunday afternoon.

[02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:14.880]
As of yesterday, organizers in Toronto were still hustling to avoid the TV blackout.

[02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:17.080]
The NFL post on games that don't sell out.

[02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:22.460]
They're confident that the remaining thousand so tickets would be sold by today's 4 p.m.

[02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:22.880]
deadline.

[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:26.960]
We're extremely close to a sell out and fully fully expecting him to be on television

[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:29.680]
on Sunday said Rogers communications, Adenon Montgomery.

[02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:34.680]
If the game is not sold out and time will be blacked out in the Buffalo and Toronto areas,

[02:52:34.880 --> 02:52:35.600]
how do you like that?

[02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:35.640]
You can't.

[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:37.960]
You folks will be able to see it.

[02:52:40.900 --> 02:52:47.000]
Charging ridiculous on godly prices to see the bills and the dolphins to desperate, desperate

[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000]
teams beginning to dig.

[02:52:49.140 --> 02:52:50.080]
Did you run get fired yet or what?

[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:50.480]
Not yet.

[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:52.360]
They're pushing for a big time.

[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:56.800]
I'm asking fact Chris, because you wouldn't know what you would know, Dick.

[02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:57.280]
Jaron.

[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:58.040]
No, you're right.

[02:52:58.300 --> 02:52:59.940]
He looks on the sidelines like a dead man.

[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:00.560]
He's got that.

[02:53:01.060 --> 02:53:02.840]
The look of death on his face.

[02:53:02.840 --> 02:53:06.660]
Yeah, he does look really like skinny and skinny and like dying like that.

[02:53:06.680 --> 02:53:09.120]
One kid in that group.

[02:53:10.840 --> 02:53:11.940]
The Jonas Brothers.

[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:12.680]
What's the a Nick?

[02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:16.280]
He looks like he weighs about four pounds soaking wet.

[02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:20.860]
Now Joe on the other hand, he looks a little bit more right.

[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:24.460]
But all of it definitely is gay as a football bat.

[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:28.360]
Jim and gets fill all I have one.

[02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:30.120]
I have two words to say to you, Jim.

[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:31.340]
You ferry.

[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:31.900]

[02:53:31.900 --> 02:53:32.900]

[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:33.700]
You ferry.

[02:53:33.960 --> 02:53:35.740]
Five thirty five and you pull to the effect Chris.

[02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:38.520]
I bet you get a gold star in a purple jelly bean on the way out.

[02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:39.520]
All right.

[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:40.060]
