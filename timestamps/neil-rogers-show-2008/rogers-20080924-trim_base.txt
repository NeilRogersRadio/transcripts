[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580]
There you go. We got it all worked out. They were out of time. It's almost 10 o'clock.

[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.780]
Neil Rogers is coming up next. We'll do it again. We'll see you tomorrow.

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:14.220]
I got your crott bodice right here, homeboy. Excuse me. Excuse me. Could you please move your

[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.260]
leg off the armrest? Move my leg. Don't you know who I am? I don't care who you are. Just move your leg.

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:32.380]
Hey, hey, hey, Alex, you're hurting me. Hey, I'm Clay Aiken. Ouch, wait, wait, wait. You're a middle-aged woman. You're supposed to love me.

[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.580]
Ouch, stop hitting me. Move your fucking legs.

[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.460]
Fine. Well, don't you even think about asking me for an autograph? Because as far as I'm concerned, you're invisible. Here, mate, invisible.

[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.120]
Let me tell you right now. Forget about bailouts. Forget about the sky is falling. Forget about chicken little. Here's the story of the century. Real surprise.

[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.960]
You're fair. Clay Aiken comes out of the closet. I thought we were going to play a drum roll or something.

[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:09.060]
I can't wait for very, very man-o-lor to come out. And Tommy Cruz. Now that would be news if Tommy Cruz came out.

[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.400]
Okay. Tommy. You're fair. How's the peepin, Tommy? Oh, that's a wrong Tommy. Philips seem more hot. Boy, he's great.

[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.820]
I give you the result yesterday is pulling momentarily, but first breaking news. Clay Aiken comes out of the closet.

[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.460]
What appears to be the cover of the forthcoming issue of People magazine was posted on the gossip website, Perezhilton.com yesterday.

[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:41.580]
Aiken is posed with his new son, Parker Foster, who was delivered by a surrogate and a headline proclaiming, yes, I'm gay.

[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.700]
Gay. You're fair. The subhead continues. The idle star opens up about his emotional decision to come out. I cannot raise a child to lie or to hide things.

[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.540]
I mean, what a shocker. You have to be deaf dumb blind and been deadly. 20 years, not to know that this queen is a screamer.

[00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:09.500]
A real. Call to Aiken's representative was not returned. A representative. And of course, who the hell would care except the core of those, those middle aged ladies that he was talking about.

[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:21.800]
They always fall for some screamer, you know, the clay mates. They're called. No. Oh, yeah. Like Ricky Martin, for example, a representative for people magazine.

[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:32.080]
Do they're confirmed or deny the covers accuracy? MTV news reports. We can confirm that clay Aiken and his son are featured on the next issue of people, the rep said adding complete story will appear today on the magazine's website.

[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:44.080]
I better get right on that during a break. Hop on that people magazine website. Do I think Aiken has been defensive in the past regarding his sexuality of which when you look at him, there really

[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:56.360]
be a much of any any kind in an interview with Diane Sawyer in 2006. He called her really rude for asking. I don't understand why it's any your business. He said bitch. He didn't say bitch. Well, maybe he did say bitch. I'm sure he was thinking bitch.

[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:11.440]
Don't you think that's probably what I imagine was. In fact, what he was probably thinking was more like you bitch. You flex you or interviewed by MTV news later in 2006. He said who I'm dating and what kind of serial I eat.

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:40.040]
Anchor to benefit anybody else. He said what kind of serial I eat. That kind of thing is not important. I think there's a distinction. Aiken was runner up on the second season of American idol is currently appearing in Spam lot on Broadway. I got to catch that not what a flaming. Although I will say this. He's a little more macho than that screamer for subway used to do the subway. He jared and they married him off like they're fooling somebody. Oh, my God.

[00:04:40.040 --> 00:05:09.240]
He could have a hero of 100 wives and they fool in me. Yeah, hey Jared. Oh, you're very. Oh, my God. Is he a screamer? I'm mincer. I'm mincing. I mean, nothing. There's anything wrong with that. Yeah, but he just did the right as diet for that. Serial. Really? Oh, yeah, that clay. Aiken serial. You'll be eat. Eat a bowl that you'll be eating all day. Fruity pebbles. I'm sure. Right. Here's the poll from yesterday. Boy, this was pretty controversial. We had a controversial program. Yeah, yeah. Yesterday.

[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:37.820]
Your go. I'm your friend. Sure, miss that. Not the phone monitor by the way stays off all the time. Joyce says, though, if we would screen the calls, that would be the way it's done. That's how it's done. You don't know what you're all. Yeah. Screw you, Joyce. You simple and bitch. You nasty smelly. The most underrated actor or actress of all time, 892 votes we had. That's not too good. I guess it's okay.

[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:52.000]
When you think there's been a lot more action on that, now let me just take a look at something. All right. Oh, there's one. There's one email on that. Neil at Neil Rogers.com. That thing is just falling off the face of the. Oh, a pines pig report.

[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:07.800]
Pete the chronic. It gives me a figure. Go away, Pete. Get lost. Pigg report in Pember Pines like that's a bulletin. Pigg reports on the email. That thing is turning into another septic tank. The email thing.

[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:22.760]
The first few days with the first three days, especially, man, it was fabulous sensation. I thought I had discovered the cure for every disease ever come down to plank. Surprise. Well, not really surprised. What is surprising to me?

[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:37.360]
Because I'm not you. I'm maybe old, but I'm the same people just because it's a different medium. A different way to see people. Same people. Right. The same chronic. That's right. What about my name is Joe. What do you know? What about him?

[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:52.480]
I think he's matter of time. If he's not one of them, he will be said. No. Well, listen, he'd been improvement over what we got now, which is not much. The most underrated actor or actress of all time, Robert Duval wins by a huge margin hands down the pantaloonies.

[00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:07.020]
He's 219 votes for Robert Duval whose greatest role of course was in Godfather, but second greatest was in network, I think. Frank Hackett. Remember that? Yep.

[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:36.900]
Wait a minute. Maycee 103. Gary Oldman 102. Billy Bob Thurton 60 was in that great movie. The man who wasn't there. The one that George hates. Right. It was. You didn't like it because that fat. Nope. I thought this bag where you're going to say that fat, fat. Yeah. Yeah. No, actually, he was the most entertaining thing in the movie. He was a. He was a terrible. He was a pit. He was very funny. Paul Giamatti 54. Philip Seymour Hoppen 49.

[00:07:36.900 --> 00:08:06.880]

[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:25.260]
Ted 21. And if I'm going to play Kevin Spacey, I got to play John Kazali, right? I think you should. It's only right. Equal time. That's right. I can handle things up smart. I like everybody said. Like, no, I swear. And I want to respect.

[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:50.180]
A Donald Settle in 16, Ted Levine 13. A fellow Bill. Val Kilmer 12. Clores Leachman 11 Charles Durning 11. I'm glad he got a lot of votes. I'm surprised. Tom Wilkinson 9. Chris Cooper 8. David straight him 8. Joseph Cotten 7. Finally finally got votes from some of us old timers.

[00:08:50.800 --> 00:09:17.520]
Lee J. Cobb 6. He was a late addition. We apologize to Lee for that, but he's still dead. So you don't care. He was great. Answer the question. Father paranoia. I lied. It was for me. Remember that the autograph. Yep. Well, you sure are strange today. Am I in these strange today? Chris a little strange. Maybe maybe tired. Maybe he's getting a little strange.

[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:36.320]
Again, more six James Coburn 6 K Francis 5. County Francis didn't get any Maggie Gillin Hall for she's Jewish. Radio to 4 Tony Perkins got a pair and the tab 100 squeezed him. Laura Lennie 2 and Elliott Gould a pair out of 892 votes.

[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:47.120]
Clay is gay? Wow. As far as I'm concerned, it was... I think you're trying to say tattooed.

[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.440]
It says tatted on his forehead, T-A-T-T-E-D. Tatted on his forehead. It was tatted.

[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.960]
Now that pulls sucks, Brandon. What would I do if I never went into radio? That pull blows. Come on. You can do something better than that.

[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:05.540]
What would I do if I hadn't gone into radio? Like shining shoes or like that?

[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:15.340]
I worked retail, Midtown Records and Rochester, worked in my father's sporting goods and fishing tackles store. I worked retail.

[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.800]
Yeah, you sold flies? No, I attacked flies. Okay.

[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.500]
That would really be something to be gay. In Canada, when New York and Little Hicktown, like that. I bet you there was some other. I know there was some other.

[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:35.840]
New. I knew some gay people in Little Hicktowns. Yeah. And the best thing to do if you're gay in a Little Hicktown is get the heat.

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.600]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got a new spot. Okay. Well, so unusual. I'm not using it. I know.

[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:49.260]
Sorry, Chris. I bet you had you on the edge of your seat. I was almost hit. We're almost spanking it. Well, the button.

[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:56.700]
1013 at 560 WQ AM. Here's the schedule for Wednesday, September 24th.

[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.520]
The big O 2 to 4 rock solid, but of tremendous psychotic public opposition.

[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:12.140]
Gialdy 4 to 650. You think, oh my God. First pitch with Jesse Agri by the way to Marlon's lost. They're done. They're finished.

[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:21.060]
The offense tonight, 708, the A show a two 11 Marlins are officially out. No playoffs, no division, no nut and no interest.

[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.080]
Niels half price deals are the head of the town. And this week is no exception starting tomorrow at noon.

[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:33.360]
You can buy 50 now. Didn't you eat their last night? You guys. Yes, we did. At Paisons. Yes. It was perfection. It was spectacular.

[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:41.920]
Food was great. They treated it magnificent. That's right. And tomorrow is place by 50 dollars certificates for 25 bucks to the brand new Paisons.

[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.540]
Restaurant and bar crawl springs formerly onyx. Paisons is now grand opening and to rave reviews to including from George and.

[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:55.280]
That Chris. They offer great dining value with sensational food. Paisons features only Harris Ranch organic beef.

[00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.760]
Try their eight ounce filet tender and scrumptious or their 14 ounce rib. I'm urinated in garlic black pepper, a black pepper or corn and oil.

[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:09.420]
What you say? Their specialty is the primary rib, the big out cut of full 16 ounce slow roasted for six hours. Perfect every time.

[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:15.120]
Sea food lovers feast on their favorless fresh ketchup items like Cedar pike smoked salmon or sea bass wrongton. What do you guys have?

[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.320]
I had a filet and he had. Make a steak. Sirloin or something. And it was great. Yes.

[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:28.180]
The all new Paisons restaurant and bar formerly onyx. 31 11 or university drive this to block south of sample road in.

[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:13.180]
What you doing on this flight? I'll just put my feet. Worthing baby long.

[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:24.440]
You wanted to be. Be all alone. But I have a seat in 17.

[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:39.440]
You pushed my leg over but I survived. I think it just did a foe.

[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:51.360]
To save it my leg takes us your room. I'm not homosexual. But I know I'm bitch when I see war.

[00:16:51.640 --> 00:17:06.200]
You got a nasal form. Saying my sportsman you can't stand. Yes, that bike was almost canned because you look beautiful.

[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:20.400]
Oh gosh. How I hate women. But I'm not homosexual. I'm not. Oh, he changes mine. All of a sudden he's. Yeah. Clay. He's aching. His heart is aching.

[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:27.920]
Oh, that's hard. Love of middle aged deaf dumb blind and stupid women are their hardest break. And right now, yeah, they're aching and hard is breaking.

[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.100]
Obviously, he's out of material too. He suggested no burger is complete without blank.

[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.640]
Hey, it's better pull than I could come up with. You like it? Sure. Chris, let me ask you one question.

[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:53.980]
Do you like it? The possibility. I don't have burger. I absolutely love not not straighten me out on this because we had this discussion a few weeks ago on everybody saying,

[00:17:53.980 --> 00:18:07.680]
oh, they only have that in Canada. We don't have that in the States. Hey, the Mickey D's an anus angus. Anus burger. The bacon and cheese. There's some confusion because burger can has something along those lines. Forget about burger.

[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:21.920]
Okay. Okay. With that rubbery meat. I'm talking about some real good anus beef. I don't think they had that here. They do. I don't think so. They don't got it. I don't think so. Oh, it's the best. And it's on this really interesting pastry bun.

[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:29.840]
They call it a pastry bun. It's good. I don't think so. Oh, it's good. Well, probably too good for there. Probably bush outlawed it.

[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:41.900]
You know, seriously, well, I have to investigate that. Do they have the angus beef burger with or without the bacon and cheese in the States? They got it here.

[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:49.700]
I had one a couple days ago. It's good. Good for you. So you like, you like that pull about no burger is it sounds like a footy pull. All of at least,

[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:55.060]
at least with us, we only keep that for one day. This can be fun. And I have one for you that you'll disagree with.

[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:07.500]
A suggestion. Yeah. A bun. Well, I mean, I ate the the anus burger with the bun, even though I shouldn't eat bread. What? Oh, my God.

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.320]
It's better than eating a pint of ice cream for crying out a lot. Oh, you're right about that. After lunch. What? You're right about that.

[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:21.780]
And like the hot fudge sundae at Mickey D's is pretty good. If you throw ice cream, the hot fudge is good. The soft serve that. Oh, that soft.

[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:36.060]
Oh, nasty stuff. It's not ice cream. It's like dairy queen. Do you think dairy queen ever had like real ice cream? No. And what about Carvelle? That's real ice cream.

[00:19:36.680 --> 00:20:05.820]
No, it's not sure it is. It's soft. It's not real. No, they have both. They have both kinds. I don't think you've ever had it. What? The hard Carvelle? I've had I've had it hard. Uh-huh. Not the ice cream. But you had a cold too. Oh, yeah. And lukewarm. Anyway, here's let's see. Tim. Very defensive guy. Tim. We're starting to get some marginal stuff on the needle at neorodges.com.

[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:35.800]
You folks can do it. Trust me or not. I don't really care. I'm in a really good mood today. I don't know why I'm in a great mood. Well, I want a few bucks at the woodbind yesterday. That grade. I sat down at a machine. And again, it's blind luck. Which everyone is open. I only play the wheel of fortune five times. I did not play a quick hit. I don't know why. I love quick hit. But boy, you can lose a lot of money in a short period of time when you're playing the max. You know what I mean? When you're playing the max and you're six bucks a hit as opposed to squeal of fire.

[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:53.900]
I'm not a good fortune, which is only three dollars a hit. Anyway, I sit down at my first bend, 400 bucks. That nice. And so I'm playing with their money the whole time. One about a grand and I ran out of there. I flew out. Tim says not that I subscribe. But yeah, we don't believe it.

[00:20:53.900 --> 00:21:23.620]
You're fair. Playgirl magazine is shutting down print operations. Playgirl, the female's equivalent of Playboy magazine will be closing down its print operations at the start next year. Nicole Caldwell, the magazine's editor and chief confirmed with rumors with media bistro. According to Caldwell, playgirl is going all web. The last pre-nissue will be January, February 2009, which comes out November 18. The website will feature more videos and pictorials less editorial content, although at this point, the details are scarce. Just like the clothing.

[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:42.480]
The claims from print sales undoubtedly contributed to the decision to shift the focus entirely to online. The magazine was founded in 1973 as the feminist alternative in response to men's magazine such as penthouse and playboy feminist alternative. My ass as the alternative.

[00:21:45.220 --> 00:22:02.160]
Men's health, that's another one. Okay, so the poll is going to be no burger. This sounds like a footy pool to me, although he'd leave it on there for six months. No burger is complete without or I got to get to that. Peter story. No burgers come out complete without vegetables.

[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:28.060]
They're sick. They're crazy. And this story about Ben and Jerry speaking of ice cream and burgers. Yeah, see how it all fits in. Yeah, complete without blank. Now you a bun. Oh, you said a bun. Catch up. I onions pickles. Hold the whole the pickles. Hold the whole the whole the lettuce.

[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:48.880]
Special orders don't set us. Bun onions. What was the ketchup right mustard, which is loaded with sugar. Maustered mayonnaise mayo. That's for go. I'm mayo. Sal. Sal. Sal. Sal. Sal. Sal.

[00:22:50.500 --> 00:23:01.380]
I'm saying the Mexicans man, they just they put sauce on everything they put it on. I mean, what is with that? They like it. They do like it. They like it really hot.

[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:19.980]
It's also what was the one after that? Stakes on steak steak sauce. Oh, yeah. Oh, I love that a one spot. But it says steak sauce on a burger. Well, it's meat. You'd more on that's right. And then the guy reaches over and says, can I try that instead of taking a steak sauce, he takes the whole burger and starts a challenge down on it. It's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing.

[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:49.860]
Worried that the economy will worsen without the bailout. Yes, somewhat worried. 79 not worry. 21. When it doubt, don't bail them out. That's my that's my thought. They go out of business too bad. If everybody lose it's too bad. You know crap happens. This business that the taxpayers got to bail anybody out just like Chrysler. Scrum hubbmann. Drared. That's what I say. Stakes steakhouse. Stakes sauce. See you got me all confused. Sorry. Well, no, you got me confused. Stakes sauce. What else did they put on it? Let us tomatoes.

[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:59.420]
This is a footy pool. I mean, thanks Brandon. It's not too bad. It's just one day and you got nothing else. Do you?

[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:09.020]
Come up with one. If I really put my thing to the grindstone. Remember that story we had that time that's back at I would either got put his thing on the grindstone.

[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.300]
Yes. I could play that.

[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.280]
I know where they felt.

[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.180]
The fourth lead.

[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.540]
The biggest names. The best talent. It's the big dog Joe.

[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.480]
A lot of choices. I just fall out.

[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.180]
Yes, building. It's clearing you.

[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:25.960]
5.62.

[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.760]
A.M.

[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.960]
The sports.

[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:30.300]
Another dick in the White House.

[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.660]
You fair.

[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.200]
Why do you care?

[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.800]
Why do you care?

[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:07.200]
No matter how hard I try, don't understand why this white suitcase.

[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.880]
Such a hot topic today.

[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.700]
People stop ring their suit cans.

[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.380]
With drawing money from their banks.

[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.520]
You're such a bunch of silly geeks.

[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.880]
Acting like paranoid creeps.

[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.100]
Oh, do you believe in what you can?

[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.700]
Why do you care? Why do you care? Why do you play?

[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.520]
I feel something inside the state.

[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.560]
There's really no need to hide and pray no.

[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.360]
Do you believe in what you can?

[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.120]
Why do you care? Why do you care?

[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.780]
I feel something inside the state.

[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.680]
There's really no need to hide and pray no.

[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.200]

He's got a lot of time to talk about me and I'll write you.

[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.840]
I don't give a crap what that fairy has to say.

[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.420]
He's been watching the course of things and guys and what?

[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:38.900]
What?

[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.140]
I'll have you know.

[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.620]
I know what I'm talking about.

[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.360]
I'm promoting at the condo.

[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.520]
I can't be elevated down.

[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.340]
And on my way to the car when I pull my folding basket out,

[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.120]
I give a free condo paper.

[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.920]
The toys are back and down.

[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.480]
The toys are back and down.

[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.040]
The toys are back and down.

[00:34:59.540 --> 00:34:59.540]

[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.080]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:00.880]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.860]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.020]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.620]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.120]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.060]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.360]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.320]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.220]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.840]
The toys are back and down.

[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.960]
I said the toys are back and down.

[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.520]
Why you lose?

[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.720]
I'm a car along you spoiled old bulls.

[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.160]
I know everything that's going on in that news.

[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.440]
Why I even know all the new Majod rules.

[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.580]
I'm hip to the drive that he owns.

[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.100]
You better know it after life.

[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.980]
It's a better show when I take your place.

[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.640]
I know I ain't no employing him.

[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.420]
But when they drive my boys will catch me.

[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.840]
They're little spothies and a bird with a bird with a bird.

[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.980]
Oh, he's got...

[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:02.040]
Oh, he's got it for the bird.

[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.980]
Wow 10-45 at 5-60 W.M.

[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.020]
I think I got it.

[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.480]
I think about a thanks this day, or we can change the poll in a while.

[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:10.820]
All right.

[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.920]
And that's something coming from no poll for tomorrow.

[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.660]
Or reading great one.

[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.340]
Thanks to your close personal friend Brandon.

[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.600]
Thanks to Josh Cortes.

[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.200]
Is good buddy.

[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.060]
Oh, don't let me forget.

[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.340]
I'm going to send a check to court.

[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:20.680]
A something.

[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.300]
Okay.

[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.380]
Because I won his money at the wood by yesterday.

[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.120]
Hey, don't do that.

[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.660]
What do you think, Chris?

[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.480]
Should I send it or not?

[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.200]
That's your one.

[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.840]
I should have known better than to ask you.

[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.980]
If you'd like me to put my name on it, I'll give it to him.

[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:34.600]
No.

[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.360]
Oh, here's a email that says it'll be another hundred years before you make

[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.620]
another appearance here in South Florida.

[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.300]
I'm 29.

[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.840]
I've been a big fan since I first heard you when I was nine years young.

[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.060]
It would be a pleasure to see you in the flesh.

[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.020]
I missed the recent one.

[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.680]
I was on vacation.

[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.220]
Love the show.

[00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.020]
I got to do a choice.

[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:51.560]
Got to run.

[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.680]
No, I won't be another hundred years.

[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.600]
What do you think we had to do when like in the couple of years?

[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.480]
I love the way that when we did the thing at Gulf Stream, they're saying,

[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.740]
oh, it's his first appearance in years.

[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:03.260]
Yeah.

[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.240]
Yeah.

[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:04.480]
Yeah.

[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.720]
So many we lost count.

[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.620]
Like, like, yeah, and what's a big deal?

[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.200]
I mean, it was nice that we had a great turnout that day, but it's always a big

[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.000]
deal to see Neil and reach out and grab a field.

[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.620]
Oh, just like the real.

[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:17.460]
Yes.

[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.080]
To me, hamburger is a bun on a patty says Sam.

[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:26.940]
If you put your bun, if you put buns on them, you should put the patty.

[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:39.180]
In other words, if we put the bun on, oh, a lot of us like atkins it, you know,

[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:39.640]
right.

[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.260]
In fact, the double cheeseburgs and Mickey D's, I'll get a couple of those.

[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:43.660]
No rest.

[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.380]
Not eat the bun.

[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.260]
And nobody in the great thing, but it is nobody looks at you.

[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.480]
You know, you're eating your whole, you're holding the meat in your fingers.

[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.940]
Well, yeah, I shouldn't have said that.

[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.980]
Well, we've all seen that.

[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.900]
I won't eat a burger without barbecue sauce.

[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.820]
Put it on there.

[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.180]
Says somebody that's already on there.

[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:01.580]
Schmuck.

[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:02.960]
Oh, mushrooms.

[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:03.600]
Yeah.

[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:03.960]
Yeah.

[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.580]
I think it's true.

[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.840]
The baking shum burger at the hearties.

[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.620]
And you know, we put cheese on there, but there are so many cheese options as you know.

[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.220]
Well, you know, something we're not going to do that.

[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:13.480]
Yeah.

[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:15.680]
Swiss.

[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:16.860]
Cheddar.

[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.640]
I don't think there's such a thing as a bad cheese to put on a burger.

[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.800]
Is there not fed a cheese?

[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.340]
And it was soft.

[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.300]
What are you talking about?

[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.860]
Anus burger with assy, I go cheese.

[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.980]
Trying to think what that tastes like.

[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.980]
I thought it was pretty good.

[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.360]
It's got a little bite to it.

[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.100]
It's great.

[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:32.840]
I love ass.

[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.900]
You don't like to read.

[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.080]
Oh, that's like I said.

[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.580]
So here's what I got.

[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:45.620]
No burgers complete without a bun, cheese, onions, ketchup, mustard, mayo, salsa, honey mustard,

[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:51.160]
relish, bacon, barbecue sauce, mushrooms, relish, steak sauce, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce.

[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.240]
I like it playing around.

[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:52.820]
I don't eat burgers.

[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.020]
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce.

[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.660]
Now, let me say this to you about the lettuce.

[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.540]
You don't understand what they put lettuce on anything.

[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.760]
Like a taco bell.

[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.020]
I've been rethinking that whole thing ever since nobody has any kind of lettuce that

[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.960]
isn't rancid anymore.

[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:06.640]
Those kinds of places.

[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:13.280]
But I mean, even if it's perfect for filler and for a little crispy, it's moist and crispy at the

[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:13.700]
same time.

[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.020]
No, lettuce is not crispy.

[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.260]
It's supposed to be.

[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.240]
The taco, a taco bell is crispy, not the lettuce.

[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.040]
Let us supposed to be crispy.

[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.840]
You're thinking like more like cabbage.

[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.180]
No, cabbage is crispy.

[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:37.720]
Not lettuce.

[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:37.940]
Yeah.

[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.680]
Iceberg lettuce that they usually use.

[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.260]
No, iceberg lettuce, my ass.

[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.640]
Who the hell uses iceberg lettuce and a burger joint?

[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.360]
But what do you think they use?

[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.480]
They use the cheapest.

[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.500]
They use some of them.

[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.240]
That's iceberg lettuce.

[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.320]
It is.

[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:50.640]
Yeah.

[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:52.200]
That's the standard lettuce.

[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.460]
You're thinking of romaine.

[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.940]
Romaine, which is I think what they use at Wendy's with a big vein, romaine with the vein.

[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.740]
Oh, they got romaine, a romaine in their vein?

[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.340]
Yes.

[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:04.260]
I see.

[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.000]
I think we got a cover there.

[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.320]
I think it's an excellent poll.

[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.300]
I think we got the burger covered.

[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:10.740]
Yeah, we got it.

[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.940]
We got a smeared mayo.

[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.920]
mayonnaise on meat.

[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.140]
Oh, that's double traff.

[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.360]
Stick one of those in Gary Sarner's box.

[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.520]
I'll be asking something, Mr.

[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:25.920]
kosher.

[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.000]
Not me.

[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.280]
Can you mix meats as long as they're both kosher?

[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.020]
Can you what?

[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.720]
Mixed meats as long as they're both kosher.

[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.280]
I don't know.

[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.060]
That's why I'm asking.

[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.000]
Well, why not?

[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:35.800]
I didn't take that class.

[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.920]
You better get your kosher ring, right, man.

[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.480]
Get Gary Sarner in there.

[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.120]
He'll straighten you.

[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:41.620]
Rass out.

[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.060]
He's the kosher queen.

[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:43.780]
How king?

[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.420]
Paida.

[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.960]
People for the ethical treatment of animals

[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.300]
and let it abenco and injure a green field,

[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.820]
co-founders of Ben and Jerry's homemade ink.

[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.080]
Urging them to replace cow's milk,

[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.580]
they use in their ice cream products with human breast milk,

[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.920]
according to a statement recently released by a

[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:03.920]
Paida.

[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.740]
Spokeswoman.

[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:07.560]
Paida.

[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.720]
Requests comes in the wake of news reports

[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.220]
that a Swiss restaurant owner will begin purchasing

[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.220]
breast milk from nursing mothers and substituting breast milk

[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.800]
for 75% of the cow's milk in the food he serves.

[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.100]
Paida officials say moved to human breast milk

[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.880]
would lessen the suffering of dairy cows

[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.220]
and their babies on factory farms and benefit human health.

[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.920]
All the poor moose cows, why are the cows suffering?

[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.000]
All the machines don't feel good, not like lips do they?

[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.720]
How do you know?

[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.160]
Do you have a machine hooked up to your thing?

[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.860]
Yeah, and it doesn't feel good as lips.

[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:39.580]
I'll tell you right now.

[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.940]
That's like a boy and his dog.

[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.860]
Remember that they had the machine hooked up to Don's right?

[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.440]
The fact that human adults consume huge quantities

[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.120]
of dairy products made from milk that was meant for a baby cow

[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.340]
just doesn't make sense.

[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.140]
Well guess what?

[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.300]
People drink and milk makes no sense.

[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.480]
And cheese and ice cream is wrong too.

[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.040]
No, it is not, see?

[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.280]
Because it tastes better.

[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:01.860]
Hypocrite.

[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.420]
Everyone knows that the breast is best

[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.300]
so venengeries could do consumers and cows

[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.140]
a big favor by making the switch to breast milk.

[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.400]
The breast is best.

[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.540]
Oh my god, you people at Paida are crazy.

[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.240]
Right.

[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:13.660]
In a statement,

[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.700]
venengerie said we applaud Pida's novel approach

[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.700]
to bring attention to an issue.

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.960]
But we believe a mother's milk is best used for her child.

[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.100]
That's what venengeries be saying.

[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.800]
Oh, you people at Paida.

[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.560]
I mean, they always go away out on a limb

[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.540]
with something ridiculous just to get attention.

[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.040]
You know, right?

[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.440]
That's their whole stick.

[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:32.840]
Sure.

[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.980]
Is to create some ridiculous non-issue

[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.340]
and whip it up into a frenzy.

[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.860]
Cuban burgers, aka Fritas are very good.

[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.760]
Fritas, I thought fritas are fries.

[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.180]
It's anything fried can be a Frita.

[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.360]
It just means fried.

[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.440]
That's in Dutch.

[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.280]
Pamas Fritas.

[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.040]
That's a French frog.

[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.380]
Pamas Fritas.

[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:57.380]
Pepper Jack cheese.

[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.180]
That sounds good.

[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.600]
Cuban burgers.

[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.760]
Is there such a thing?

[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.680]
Not that I know, I'm sure there is.

[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:06.960]
What do you mean?

[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.640]
Not that you know?

[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.280]
Not that I know.

[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.380]
You don't know, you don't know nothing about being Cuban.

[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.700]
Okay, sure.

[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.540]
If I was one of those Cuban listeners we got out there,

[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.880]
one of both of them, I'd be wild with you.

[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:18.100]

[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.560]
Turned coat.

[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.560]
I sure hope Fuddy don't take offense to the fact

[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.960]
that we're doing this pull about the burger.

[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.260]
Because he's the burger and weener a queen in South Florida.

[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:30.940]
Fudsy.

[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.700]
What he would do is he would like take two of these

[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.540]
and put them on and have like a runoff

[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.860]
in about six weeks when he's done.

[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:42.600]
Fudsy.

[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.380]
Yeah.

[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.760]
So we're invited to go see Fudsy and Danny and Danny and Fudsy.

[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.240]
I'll pass on both of them, okay?

[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.900]
Not that I got anything against Danny, boy,

[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.320]
but he's enough already with him,

[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.700]
enough with the Joker lips and the whole routine of his.

[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.480]
When you think he's got enough money to retire,

[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.320]
I already ate Danny.

[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.100]
Retire.

[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.020]
And get off that QAM website too.

[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.460]
Every time we make a little progress under,

[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.420]
they stick Danny, boy, on top of us around us.

[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.660]
And always he takes precedence.

[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.600]
We're small potatoes on there, you know?

[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.580]
That's because Cortus is in charge of it.

[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.260]
And every time I say that, oh, he's got enough of the say

[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:19.780]
about that.

[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.600]
It's not charged.

[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.280]
There's some guy that, uh, yeah, who's the guy?

[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.240]
Give me a name.

[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.380]
What do you mean who's the guy?

[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:25.900]
Who's the guy?

[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:26.200]
What?

[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.940]
In charge of that website.

[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.600]
Who calls the shots?

[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:31.540]
Joe Bell.

[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.440]
Joe Bell is in charge of the, with the,

[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.340]
the QAM website.

[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.900]
Josh Darrow is actually the QAM website.

[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.280]
Specifically, he's Josh Darrow.

[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.180]
Now I understand why we always get screwed.

[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.140]
Not that he's the only one that has his fingers in there.

[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.640]
Yeah, he's got his finger in it.

[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.440]
I'll write like you can smell it a mile away.

[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.340]
Josh Cortus is a button monkey.

[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:52.880]
You understand?

[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.200]
He just presses the buttons.

[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.340]
If these people tell him to say,

[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.980]
Hey, Clarence, go wash that finger off.

[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:57.300]
Okay.

[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:58.700]
You idiot.

[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.880]
For a delicious kosher burger,

[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.560]
how about adding jalapeno peppers, dear?

[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.580]
How about peppers?

[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.480]
Good choice.

[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.820]
Peppers, especially if you're Mexican.

[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:10.520]
Right.

[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:11.680]
Peppers.

[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.160]
Pepper and Chinese, green peppers,

[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.360]
peppercorn, pepper.

[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.340]
I'm not gonna stop.

[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.020]
I'm not gonna stop.

[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.800]
Oh, geez.

[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.680]
Hassan, pepper, pepper.

[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:20.560]
Claude, pepper.

[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.600]
690 votes on the pool.

[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.960]
My favorite entertainment magazine is,

[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.440]
don't have one, 355.

[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:28.740]
Oh, there's that guy from Magnolia.

[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.560]
You've been on the road.

[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.360]
You need to shower and check your email.

[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.520]
The game show host.

[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:32.940]
What's his name?

[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.620]
We don't know his name.

[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:34.560]
Right.

[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.300]
We did.

[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.080]
But then we forgot.

[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:36.940]
Yeah, we forgot.

[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.420]
He's good.

[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.100]
Playboy 106, Hustler 71,

[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.640]
106, 55.

[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.260]
Now, when the gunshot came through the kitchen ceiling,

[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.420]
yeah, well, the frog fell through the ceiling.

[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.400]
The frog fell through the ceiling,

[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.160]
but what about the gunshot?

[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.520]
The frog fell through that little kitchen exhaust chimney thing

[00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.280]
that he had and hit him while he had the gun in his hand.

[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:00.860]
Then the frog went out.

[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.640]
Oh, and the gun went out.

[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:01.740]

[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.380]
The frog made the gun go off.

[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:04.760]
Bam.

[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:05.360]
Ba-da-boom.

[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.220]
And then like,

[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.820]
Emile would say, bam.

[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:09.400]
Yeah.

[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:10.620]
Somebody ought to give him.

[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.520]
Oh, he got really fat.

[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.120]
He's doing a commercial right now

[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.860]
for a toothpaste or something.

[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.200]
And he ballooned.

[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.140]
Yeah, he's twice the size of his previous self.

[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:20.920]
He sucks.

[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:21.420]
Yeah.

[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.460]
Hustler barely legal 36,

[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.420]
jugs 20, playgirl 13,

[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.100]
high society 10, club 8,

[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.040]
celebrity skin 7, bound and gag's got 5.

[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.380]
Transformation 4 and Gents has got a pair.

[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.600]
The biggest name.

[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.740]
The best talent.

[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.940]
You know what was the new Roger?

[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.340]
Sport radio 560 QAM.

[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:41.940]
Think.

[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.180]
Fourth leader.

[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.080]
The biggest name.

[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.660]
The best talent.

[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:47.180]
Right.

[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.300]
You're listening to sports radio 560 WQAM.

[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.900]
I am a Ford Lutterdale.

[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.400]
This is the new Roger show.

[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.220]
This is your brain.

[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.160]
Any questions?

[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.880]
Boy, they're ripping you and ass George.

[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.740]
Hey, Cuban.

[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.540]
Oji.

[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.340]
I like Christ.

[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:15.320]

[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.760]
I'm saving the cordon corners.

[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.460]
I'm cutting compounds because

[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.500]
I'm a victim of possession.

[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.340]
Buying from this

[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.120]
Countless stores.

[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.860]
And I don't know if I'll get through it.

[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:42.680]
Oh, no, I've spent too much.

[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.200]
I bounced by Checks this month.

[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.940]
There goes my credit rating.

[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.840]
I thought I had more in my savings.

[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.440]
I'll take you out to lunch.

[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.960]
You buy.

[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.420]
It's the soft economy.

[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.820]
It's the soft economy.

[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.620]
I'm saving nickels and corners.

[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.060]
I'm cutting coupons because

[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.120]
I'm a victim of possession.

[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.640]
1102 at 560 WQAM.

[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:31.860]
Who would handle the economy better?

[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.020]
The new poll, Obama 53% McCain 43%.

[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.040]
I think that says it all.

[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.120]
Let's hold the election right now and get it over with.

[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:41.240]
You hear the sound of the facts machine working?

[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:43.640]
You hear it?

[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:44.040]
Nope.

[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.440]
There it is.

[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.540]
Oh, is that that is?

[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.580]
There's some facts in the new poll.

[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.920]
There's this other poll with these magazines.

[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:52.720]
It just blows.

[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:53.080]
Blows.

[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.900]
Somebody sent me an email saying this is a really lame poll.

[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.440]
I'm not sure if they're talking about the one that's up there with the magazines

[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.660]
or the one about the burger.

[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:02.740]
They didn't specify.

[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.340]
You know what?

[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:03.900]
Too bad.

[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.160]
Oh, Justin says before I get to the

[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.960]
emails ripping you and ask.

[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.040]
Just wanted to let you know because I didn't hear anyone mention it yet.

[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.100]
The archive show has only about the first three hours of the show when you download.

[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.360]
For some reason, the last hour is not being recorded.

[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.800]
Love the show and George is great.

[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.780]
Says Justin.

[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.160]
How do you like that?

[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:27.660]
All right.

[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:27.980]
Thanks.

[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.040]
Is that is that true?

[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.540]
Not that George is great but that the archives have only got the first three hours.

[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.400]
I don't know.

[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.180]
I don't know.

[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.720]
Well, why not?

[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.880]
Because I've never listened to the archives.

[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.080]
I'm here for the shows.

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.400]
You know, I don't need to go listen back.

[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.480]
In other words, at the end of the day, you know,

[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.820]
listen the whole four hours again.

[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.240]
I'll let you know as much as I used to.

[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.380]
No, never.

[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:52.980]
Neither.

[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.440]
Well, that's the only person that the reason I never mentioned it is because nobody's ever said that before.

[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.640]
Justin, I don't want to doubt your word, your veracity, but

[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.560]
sounds like BS to me.

[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.560]
Why would that be?

[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:06.500]
I don't know.

[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.540]
Anyway, Pedro says your right George knows nothing about things Cuban.

[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.340]
A Frita is a Cuban version of a hamburger.

[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:14.700]
Ingredients.

[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.880]
Half a pound of ground beef.

[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.080]
One Spanish chorizo sausage ground up.

[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.220]
Oh, I love chorizo, man.

[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.700]
Half a pound of ground pork.

[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.100]
One tablespoon ketchup.

[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.880]
Half a cup of breadcrumbs.

[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.760]
Plain or Italian season for kicker flavor.

[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:27.780]
One egg beaten.

[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.220]
One medium onion chopped.

[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.020]
Three fresh mashed garlic cloves.

[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.280]
A pinch of ground cumin.

[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.200]
Salt and pepper.

[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:33.960]
Cooked patties.

[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.840]
And a half teaspoon of paprika.

[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:39.880]
Says Pedro.

[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:42.160]
You know nothing about Cuban.

[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.760]
I've never claimed it to.

[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:44.760]
Well, why not?

[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:45.980]
Why not?

[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.260]
That would be like me not knowing about the Jew food.

[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:48.980]
Yeah.

[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.340]
Yeah, I know all about Jew food, man.

[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.080]
I know my blinces.

[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.740]
I know my, uh, all my, I know what I like.

[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.800]
I know my homeontation.

[00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:56.800]
I've been very clear.

[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.880]
I came here when I was four before I was five.

[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.980]
My mother moved us into the red lens where the rednecks lived.

[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.460]
Oh, and then I just kept moving deeper into the woods.

[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.340]
So I know about a hit.

[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:05.820]
I don't blame him.

[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.540]
Hick stuff.

[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.460]
Redneck stuff.

[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.960]
Way more than I know about Cuban stuff.

[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.040]
Man he says what George knows about Cuban culture.

[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:14.200]
You can fit in a thimble.

[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.840]
Frita's are Cuban hamburgers made with ground beef and Spanish chorizo.

[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.620]
Then potato strings not the sticks with a thinner ones are added on top of the burger.

[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.640]
They're awesome, but guaranteed heart attack of eating more than one a year.

[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.260]
Great show to you and George even if he's a poor imitation of a fix his manny.

[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.960]
Now Brandon sent me 600 pages on Frita's.

[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.820]
Oh, there's too many pages here.

[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.400]
By the way, Eric says sometimes that happens.

[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:46.700]
What?

[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.080]
That the show only reports three hours.

[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.240]
Sometimes I feel the show is passing us by.

[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.480]
In other words, only three hours.

[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.780]
Well, that's where it goes.

[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.240]
The price is right.

[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.440]
Justin, it's free.

[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:00.300]
Take what you can get.

[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:00.760]
It's free top.

[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.640]
A Cuban hamburger that served in Florida might look like a hamburger

[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.900]
recovered with two string potatoes spiced with paprika and onion and top with mojito sauce.

[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:13.920]
What's mojito?

[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.420]
It's garlic and onion and like all of what I see.

[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.180]
Well, that sounds good.

[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.160]
The Cuban hamburger is similar to what's been called a Spanish hamburger or picadillo,

[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.040]
although these dishes are served and prepared somewhat differently.

[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.340]
Wikipedia, Cuban cuisine.

[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.240]
Of note, as a sandwich that became popular in the 30s in Cuba, the Frita,

[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.880]
this is considered to be a Cuban version of the American hamburger,

[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.320]
although with significant changes that set it aside.

[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.840]
It's prepared with ground beef spiced with paprika and onion.

[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.260]
The patties are made small and fried on a griddle.

[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:49.300]
The patty is placed in a small Cuban bread hamburger bun,

[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:52.920]
top with a mojito sauce and first of all, from her chew-string french fries.

[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.000]
Sounds good.

[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:54.820]
Does.

[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.420]
Actually, I don't think I've ever had one.

[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.860]
I don't think I've ever seen the live anus sometime and have one of those.

[00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.600]
You don't have to go there.

[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:00.920]
Where do you go?

[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.500]
There are Cuban restaurants in Broward County, I'm sure they have them.

[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.500]
Now, what's that place in the airport, the chain of Cuban restaurants?

[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.160]
I don't know.

[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:07.740]
Not Carreta?

[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.320]
Yeah, they're bad.

[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.300]
I beg your pardon.

[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:10.580]
Not good.

[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.160]
Go to Las Vegas Cuban restaurants.

[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.580]
There's like five or six of them in Broward County.

[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.840]
Are you ripping out Carreta?

[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:15.240]

[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:15.760]
Oh.

[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.160]
They blow.

[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.880]
Las Vegas Cuban cuisine.

[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.680]
They're like five or six of them in Broward County.

[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.140]
They're great.

[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.240]
Every one of them is great.

[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:22.380]
You never have a bad meal there.

[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:24.640]
Pick a deal.

[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.640]
I would say that that's how you would say it.

[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.060]
Pick a deal.

[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.620]
Pick a deal is the dish made in the consistent ground beef.

[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.260]
Sometimes shredded beef or chicken.

[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.220]
Completely found in Cuba, Mexico and other Latin American countries.

[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.820]
In Mexico, it sometimes uses a filling such as for tacos and can be mixed with vegetables.

[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.400]
It can also be prepared as a type of stew.

[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.180]
In most other Latin American countries,

[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.520]
it consists of a common table from where people pick small pieces of beef

[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.640]
or other such foods such as french fries.

[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.520]
The name comes from the Spanish word picar, which means to chop.

[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.820]
Pick a deal is a traditional dish made in Latin American country.

[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.300]
It goes with a recipe.

[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.160]
But a beep, but a boop, but a bob.

[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.280]
These are just recipes.

[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.560]
Eight pages of them, but nevertheless,

[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.260]
I'll get in the kitchen and start working on it right away.

[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:14.700]
While you finish the show.

[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:15.980]
Yeah, right.

[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.260]
Here's a bad joke from Frank.

[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.040]
Grandma's boyfriend.

[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.700]
Probably very, very old and it'll kill like 45 seconds.

[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:31.920]
A five-year-old boy went to visit his grandmother one day, playing with his toys in her bedroom.

[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.160]
My grandma was dusting.

[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:33.920]
He looked up and said,

[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.740]
Grandma, how come you don't have a boyfriend?

[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.000]
Now that grandpa went to heaven.

[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.940]
Grandma replied, honey, my TV is my boyfriend.

[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.920]
I can sit in my bedroom, watch it all day long.

[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.020]
The religious programs make me feel good.

[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]
The comedies make me laugh.

[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.400]
I'm happy with my TV is my boyfriend.

[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.260]
Grandma said.

[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.520]
Grandma turned on the TV.

[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.660]
The reception was terrible.

[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.720]
She started adjusting the knobs, trying to get the picture focused.

[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.520]
First ridden, she started hitting the backs out of the TV,

[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:58.960]
hoping to fix the problem.

[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.120]
Little boy heard the doorbell rings, so he hurried to open the door.

[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.280]
There's the grandma's minister.

[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.480]
The minister said,

[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.040]
hello, son, is your grandma home?

[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.200]
Little boy replied,

[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.300]
yes, she's in the bedroom banging her boyfriend.

[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:10.400]
The minister fainted.

[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.160]
Are we going to proofread these?

[00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:16.580]
I did.

[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.780]
I told you it was weak.

[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.120]
Weak.

[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:23.300]
Look, if somebody's going to make the trouble to send the stuff, I'll read it, okay?

[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:23.860]
All right.

[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.000]
Say they're always going to be good.

[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.700]
In fact, the fact that they're bad makes them camp.

[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.560]
You know, they're so bad that they're almost good, almost being the operative word.

[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.120]
They're so bad.

[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.700]
Kind of like the footy show.

[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.460]
It's so bad that, well,

[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.340]
according to what I've heard, the rumors I've heard nothing ain't going to make that good.

[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.000]
Oh, Medina with more good news.

[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.740]
Obama's inching his way up.

[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:50.120]
This week, he leads by nine points.

[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.120]
Keep it coming.

[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:52.320]
Medina.

[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.440]
Medina.

[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:53.900]
Medina.

[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.800]
Oh, and there's a real sour picture of Sarah Palin.

[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.160]
Wow.

[00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:58.640]
With a look,

[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.660]
oh, a real far-bison look on her face.

[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.320]
Far-bison.

[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.780]
Economy gives Obama a big clear age and pull.

[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.060]
Oh, I better print this out, huh?

[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.000]
Somebody might actually care about that.

[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.280]
Although they probably care more about that.

[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.160]
joke about grandma banging the TV, banging her boyfriend.

[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.180]
What do you think?

[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:18.140]
No.

[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.140]
Here's one that says, I love George.

[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.560]
He's the juggernaut bitch.

[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.300]
I love George.

[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.280]
He's just Cuban enough for me.

[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:29.160]
George rules.

[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:29.980]
Thanks.

[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.460]
I can't help it.

[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.040]
We're all a product of our rearing, aren't we?

[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.000]
Are you rearing?

[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.060]
Yeah, I was reared to the sound.

[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:37.960]
Oh, I heard that.

[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.060]
Yeah, I'm still sore about it.

[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:39.540]
You've been reared?

[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:40.080]
Yeah.

[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:41.860]
Just this morning.

[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.240]
Oh, now where's the rest of this story?

[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.460]
That's it. That's all it's going to print out?

[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.720]
Oh, no, I got to go back to that.

[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:50.320]
Jesus.

[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:51.140]
Got all money.

[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.180]
I guess I'll do it during the break.

[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.560]
Now see, I followed your advice.

[00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.160]
I highlighted the whole damn thing.

[00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.520]
And then you print selection?

[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:00.760]
Oh, no way.

[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:01.720]
Yeah, I know how to.

[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:01.960]
Okay.

[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.620]
Jesus, when you've done great,

[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.600]
because I'm not there.

[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.020]
I can't see what you're doing.

[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:06.660]
You're a bastard, man.

[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.600]
Yeah, well, you're seeing all the things.

[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.500]
I've got to compensate.

[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.940]
Well, how am I going to print all this stuff out?

[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.700]
I highlighted the whole article and I printed one page

[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:16.920]
and then it just stopped.

[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:17.940]
I don't know.

[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:18.720]
Can I try it again?

[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:19.700]
Yeah.

[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.940]
Because it doesn't work.

[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.900]
See, I've got all that highlighted print,

[00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:24.900]
selection, print.

[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.600]
Okay, now let's see if the whole thing prints

[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.420]
are just the first page.

[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.020]
I'm telling you, it's only going to be the first page.

[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.800]
I know this.

[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:32.000]
Now you're seeing all of it, though, when you use it.

[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:32.180]
Yes.

[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:32.660]
When you're looking at it.

[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:32.940]
All right.

[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.600]
Here we go.

[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:34.960]
Here go.

[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:35.940]
You hear my machine grinding?

[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:37.980]
It's grinding.

[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:42.380]
Okay, let's see what happens.

[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.320]
Here's all, wait a minute.

[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.920]
The whole article came through this time.

[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.040]
And a second page.

[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:48.900]
All right.

[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.000]
All right.

[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.520]
And a third page.

[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:53.860]
All right.

[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.540]
Economy gives Obama clear age in pull.

[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.560]
I think it's good enough to save after the break.

[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:00.620]
You can have a party.

[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.520]
The best talent.

[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.780]
You don't need no reject.

[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.100]
Fortress, you'll 560 QAM.

[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.980]
The fourth leader.

[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.260]
You're so famous.

[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.760]
The best talent.

[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.520]
If the D&J wingtides remain to 11.

[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.040]
Here on.

[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.260]
Fortress, you'll 560 QAM.

[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:17.720]
Yeah, I'm waiting.

[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.700]
Fortress, where you fudge back in?

[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:24.720]
Yeah.

[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.220]
Recalled meat has bacteria.

[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.180]
Throw up all on a beaver.

[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.720]
With explosive diarrhea.

[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.840]
The beef has eat coli.

[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.900]
You really should be cautious.

[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.100]
You could get very nauseous.

[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.680]
The cows are victorious.

[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.580]
The beef has eat coli.

[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.540]
E-eat.

[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.340]
E-eat.

[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.680]
E-eat.

[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.260]
E-eat.

[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.440]
So if you're going to eat it,

[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:56.320]
in the bowl you will leave it.

[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.120]
On the getting up to vomit,

[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.940]
the beef has eat coli.

[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.760]
You know, that guy disappeared from other bits

[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.520]
a long time ago.

[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.040]
Thank God.

[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:06.280]
Yeah.

[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.280]
You know the one I mean?

[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.160]
The guy I just did that?

[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:09.960]
No.

[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.160]
Yeah, you do.

[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:12.380]
No, I'm not going to say the voice.

[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.340]
Yeah, but I don't know his name.

[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:14.100]
I'm not.

[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.520]
John says, why can't you people

[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.540]
get rid of that Spanish crap on your signal?

[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.360]
Today it's coming in better than your voice.

[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.660]
It's always there and it sucks.

[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.060]
Not to mention the noises.

[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.360]
Well, we're doing the best we can.

[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:28.700]
Okay.

[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.580]
We can't get rid of it because

[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:32.320]
Fidel cranks those illegal or a

[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.820]
Raul will crank those stations up to 80 billion watts.

[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:37.220]
And they don't abide by international broadcast law.

[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.220]
And they like a smear over on our seal.

[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.360]
And of course, you know,

[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.200]
and we're going to do nothing.

[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.440]
Are we doing something?

[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.840]
If we are, we don't know about it.

[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:45.520]
No.

[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:46.540]
No.

[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.940]
Here's the end of that horrible

[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:50.320]
poll.

[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.960]
Your favorite adult, and somebody also

[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.200]
says Uncle Jerry.

[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.740]
Too much of this on the e-mails today.

[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.260]
Yeah.

[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.440]
Uncle Jerry says, please leave

[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.880]
bought off the burger poll because it will

[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.700]
win in the landslide.

[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.960]
I guess that's what you want.

[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:07.420]
Am I the one that put

[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.220]
bun on a poll?

[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.280]
No.

[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:11.540]
Chris?

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.140]
That was George.

[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:13.640]
That's what I mean.

[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.860]
So why does he say, I guess that's what you want.

[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.220]
The true intent is to find out what is

[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.180]
like best on a hamburger.

[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.200]
He's telling me what's what the intent of the poll is that we're

[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:23.420]
talking about.

[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.980]
By the way, cheese is an elite just to shut that guy up.

[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.000]
Bun only has one.

[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:29.820]
I voted for cheese.

[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:30.800]
Bun has one.

[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.600]
I voted for cheese.

[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:32.860]
Me too.

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.720]
Two for cheese.

[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.720]
Here's the wrap up on that horrible poll.

[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.820]
Your favorite adult entertainment.

[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.560]
Sarah Captain sing, but the poll sucked.

[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.700]
Adult entertainment magazine.

[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:44.900]
726 votes.

[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.140]
Oh, you know what?

[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.100]
We're going to get a thousand if we add the two together.

[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.500]
How about what do you think, Chris?

[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:52.240]
Yeah.

[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:52.780]
Yeah.

[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.560]
It's why you don't sound really

[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.660]
enthusiastic today.

[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.900]
What else do you want me to say?

[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.060]
I can get the pop-up done.

[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.160]
Yeah, take your clothes off and jump up it down on George's head.

[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:04.840]
That's okay.

[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:06.980]
There you go.

[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.500]
Don't have one.

[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.420]
373.

[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.360]
Playboy 108.

[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.380]
Hustler 73.

[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.400]
Penthouse 57.

[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.820]
Hustler barely legal.

[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:17.640]
37.

[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:18.960]
Jogs 20.

[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:19.800]
Playgirl.

[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:20.460]
You fare.

[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:20.960]
14.

[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.500]
Bound and gagged.

[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:22.960]
10.

[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.000]
High society.

[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:25.080]
10 club 10.

[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.140]
Celebrity skinny.

[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.820]
Transformation 4 and Gents 2.

[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:28.960]
Bound and gagged.

[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.240]
That made me think of a vision of Mohawar David.

[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.760]
Bound and gagged with that rubber ball in his mouth.

[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.140]
And the lampshade.

[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:38.800]
Yeah.

[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:39.780]
Wouldn't that be some.

[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.060]
Wouldn't that be a sight for Sirot?

[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:43.240]
Tiffany, I can't feel my face.

[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.640]
I also impressed I swised a guyco and saved over $600.

[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.560]
I was very happy.

[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:49.420]
Guyco.

[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.580]
Real service.

[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.500]
Real savings.

[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.480]
Am I smiling?

[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.280]
I can't tell you.

[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.280]
Those guyco spots there are the best.

[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:58.980]
Am I right?

[01:01:59.080 --> 01:01:59.700]
Yes, they are.

[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.980]
Cheese is winning.

[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:02.460]
You're right.

[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.140]
See, I won't eat a burger without cheese.

[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:04.600]
I'll pass.

[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.220]
I don't care how many wonderful adornments it's got on it.

[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.140]
If you don't have the cheese, I'll pass, please.

[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:10.260]
I will.

[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.100]
But I'd rather not.

[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.680]
What about you, Fat Chris?

[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.240]
I prefer to always have with cheese.

[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:17.880]
You prefer what?

[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.140]
I prefer to have it with cheese though.

[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.300]
American cheese has no taste.

[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.380]
What about Canadian cheddar?

[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.140]
Not sure if I've tried it, but I love cheddar.

[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:28.420]
Hmm.

[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:29.540]
Sharp cheddar.

[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.160]
What about peppercorn, Shosh?

[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:33.520]
Good.

[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.460]
Is Mr. Rico still on the ear?

[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.160]
Does anybody know?

[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:36.940]
Does anybody care?

[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:37.460]
Mr. Rico.

[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.480]
And what about a little Brian?

[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.640]
Hey, little Brian, you're fair.

[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.680]
Adopted more kids, little Brian, okay?

[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.940]
Economy gives Obama clear edge in pull.

[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.740]
Turmol in the financial industry and growing pessimism about the economy

[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:52.380]
have altered the shape of the presidential race,

[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.940]
giving Barack Obama the first clear lead

[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.940]
of the General Election campaign over John McCain,

[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.240]
according to the latest Washington Post ABC News National poll.

[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.480]
Thanks to whoever sent this in.

[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.920]
Just 9% of those surveyed rated the economy as good a rexlin.

[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.480]
First time that number has been in single digits since the days before the 92 election.

[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.500]
Just 14% of the country said the 14% said the country is heading in the right direction.

[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.240]
A record low, equalling a record low, and that question pulls dating all the way back.

[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.540]
The 1973, when we had the Arab oil embargo, and Jimmy Carter.

[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.300]
More voters trust Obama to deal with the economy,

[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.140]
and he's currently got a big edge as to candidate who's in tune with economic problems Americans now face.

[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.020]
He's also got a double digit advantage of handling current problems on Wall Street.

[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.940]
And as a result, there's been a big rise in his overall support.

[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:45.940]
The poll found that among likely voters, Obama now leads McCain 52 to 43%.

[01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.540]
Two weeks ago, in the days immediately following the RNC,

[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:53.880]
the race was essentially even with McCain at 47, 48, and Obama 47.

[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.080]
As a point of comparison, either at the last two Democratic nominees,

[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:04.600]
John Curie in 2004, or Al Gore in 2000, recorded support of about 50% in a free election poll by the post-ABC news,

[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.380]
and Al Obama's over that mark with 52%.

[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:13.500]
52% should be 82% but nevertheless, a lot of folks are afraid of that dark guy.

[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.280]
That Muslim, with that name Hussein.

[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.560]
Last week's near meltdown in the financial markets,

[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.440]
and the subsequent debate in Washington over a proposed government bailout of troubled financial institutions,

[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.000]
including Goldman Sachs, by the way, of which Paulson used to be the CEO,

[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.600]
and just a coincidence you understand, just like the fact that the Halliburton made all that money off the Iraq attack,

[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.940]
and Cheney was the one who encouraged it, that was just a coincidence.

[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.860]
Your main paranoid can see the theorist you.

[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:40.540]
Right.

[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.640]
A fully 50% called the economy and jobs a single most important issue that will determine their vote,

[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:50.340]
up from 37% just two weeks ago, and contrast is 9% said to the Iraq War.

[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:55.540]
But voters are cool toward the administration's initial effort to deal with the current crisis.

[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.500]
47% said they approve of the steps taken by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve,

[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.560]
to stabilize financial markets, while 42% said they disapprove.

[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.920]
Two weeks ago, McCain held a substantial advantage among white voters,

[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.460]
including Newfoundst, strengthened white women, in the face of bad economic news.

[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.460]
The two candidates now run evenly, right about evenly among white men,

[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:19.280]
and Obama's narrowed the overall gap among white voters to just 5% its points.

[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.240]
And let me say it again, these polls do not include people with cell phones only,

[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.760]
and as a result, the living and breeding young people under the age of 100,

[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.740]
who only have cell phones, they're not included in here, and Obama wins hands down your pants in them.

[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.500]
And where do white women at?

[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.220]
They're at Syrus House.

[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:43.500]
They're making a spaghetti dinner at Syrus House.

[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.500]
We got the new poll up there. Good one.

[01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.600]
See Brandon bailed us out today. Good boy.

[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.400]
Nice going, Brandon.

[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.920]
37% said you know nothing about Cuban.

[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.600]
Now he's a huge. He said you probably never even eat Cuban food.

[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.160]
I do.

[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.800]
And I said probably only at the relatives.

[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.260]
I don't. I'd eat there and also up the road here.

[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:08.300]
These ones a month of the road where Las Vegas trying to tell you that you've been in Las Vegas.

[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.860]
How about a couple like you that you know,

[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:14.160]
Las Vegas radio trips and talking about the restaurants and the word where is that?

[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.400]
They're everywhere and brown.

[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.360]
They're all over the place. It's a shame.

[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.360]
It started with one and then they kept expanding, but it's still family owned and operated.

[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.600]
I see.

[01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.260]
And what's what's their speciality?

[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.160]
Everything.

[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.600]
But I would I would recommend their.

[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.800]
Their meat. Yeah, their meat.

[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:36.580]
They have a chicken chunk thing, a chicharrones, which is just phenomenal.

[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:43.180]
Chicharrones. Yeah, cubed chicken breast with onions and garlic and you know, drizzled on it.

[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:43.700]
It's just great.

[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:46.040]
The chicken drizzled on it.

[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.140]
Well, you know, you drizzle the sauce on it.

[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.600]
Oh, I just like to say drizzle.

[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.160]
I'm a nizzle for shizzle.

[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.680]
41 votes. No burgers complete without cheese.

[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.080]
14 a bun.

[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.660]
8. We can take the bun off of there.

[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.980]
It'll make that idiot happy to what we have Eric take bun off.

[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:02.640]
No.

[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:08.380]
Catch up six onions for tomatoes to I don't eat burgers one.

[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.780]
One each for peppers pickles mayonnaise barbecue sauce and mayo and mustard.

[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:19.880]
None for I like it plain lettuce steak sauce relish bacon or relish is on there twice.

[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:24.620]
Honey mustard or salsa relish is on there twice and we don't want to take off fun.

[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.680]
Because George is a hard ass.

[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.100]
That's right.

[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.980]
And there was nothing about Cuban food.

[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:34.820]
Cheese is winning two to one over bun 16 to eight out of the first 44 vote.

[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:42.140]
Man, I can't believe that you folks can't enjoy one of those great Mickey D's a a-a-nice burgers with bacon and cheese.

[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.620]
And the cheese by the way is a real good cheddar good with bacon and cheddar.

[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:54.360]
And I think that's what they call it the anise burger with bacon and cheddar.

[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.280]
And if they ever had it by you it would be famous anise.

[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:07.000]
Oh, that's they still make those those cookies you can't even eat only a hundred famous in you.

[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.400]
Oh, those are you don't like famous anise course.

[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.340]
I do, but I'm not a degenerate like you are a sugarcane cream.

[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.740]
You can't eat only six.

[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.220]
I am a sugar addict.

[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.300]
Everybody's got everybody's got their drug right?

[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:29.320]
And there are those people like me who are addicted to sugar who would say, oh no, I can't I have got these drug addicts there, you know.

[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.480]
I don't like it, but I understand it because an addiction is a horrendous thing.

[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:35.980]
It's bad.

[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.420]
For example, today to a clock guess guess where I'm going to be going.

[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.340]
What's the biggest name?

[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:42.420]
The best talent.

[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.760]
How many kisses do you want Roger?

[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:44.660]
I don't know, what time?

[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.060]
6 p.m.

[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.960]
I think 4th leader.

[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.020]
The biggest name.

[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:50.420]
The best talent.

[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.700]
It's the big O or land who else are Gary?

[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.320]
Afternoon, let's do the boards.

[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.880]
Sports radio 560.

[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:56.800]
Q.A.M.

[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.800]
This is the leader.

[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.120]
Oh, thanks so much.

[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.700]
Get the honey tune yet.

[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.420]
We got the arrogant Cubans of the Army.

[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.360]
When we don't get our way, we stamp our feet.

[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.200]
Incredible.

[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.160]
You would grant us our depends or we'll get angry.

[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.440]
And we're short-tuned, black-wing traffic in the street.

[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:39.680]
We know that still they give me from a bigger island.

[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:44.840]
But we're the most important people in our minds.

[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:46.720]
L.I.

[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.760]
The baby G.L.

[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.680]
L.I.

[01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:02.860]
L.I.

[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.320]
On cue with the news cameras red, flashing light.

[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.280]
Action!

[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.960]
Yes, we've got most important people in the universe.

[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:20.840]
At least as far north as the Miami-Dade County line.

[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:28.480]
11.32 at 5.60 W.Q.I.M., Jimmy B., who's obviously a little on the naive side and also

[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.220]
a waste of time.

[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.740]
Why would anybody watch Glenn Beck, rhymes with D.R.K.?

[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:38.920]
Glenn Beck said last night on a show that Sarah Palin is impressed and passed the test of asking questions to two world leaders at the UN.

[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.760]
He said this should shut off the Democrats as to her credibility to work to something on foreign affairs.

[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.140]
She must be a genius.

[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:51.340]
Also, this was the first time the meeting was in an access to tape or asking any questions.

[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.220]
Sounds like the future debate coming up.

[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:56.400]
Comeonista says Jimmy B., comeonista, comeonista.

[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.760]
Now here's one from Alex, who knows his crap.

[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:14.080]
Alex says the Cuban hamburger called Frita is actually seasoned ground beef mixed with ground-spanaged chorizo sausage and thin french fries in a small bun the size of a white castle slider.

[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.820]
You can get it with or without cheese.

[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.800]
The best place to get one is at El Rey de las Fritas on Southwest 18th Street in 18th Avenue, in a little Havana.

[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.480]
El Rey de las Fritas.

[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:30.900]
May you, George and Pat Chris enjoy a bottle of pleasant choices for years to come, regards Alex aka Greece.

[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.380]
Maybe he put Greece in the sliders.

[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.060]
Could be.

[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.680]
Now whatever happened in the White Arles that we find out if he's actually put it again.

[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:40.920]
No, we haven't found out.

[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:41.560]
Oh.

[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.100]
Maybe he'll send us an email.

[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:47.680]
Maybe.

[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.620]
Maybe he will.

[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.460]
What happened with that?

[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:53.720]
Oh, I chopped it off.

[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:54.740]
Did you?

[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:57.900]
Wait till you hear this.

[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.060]
Even almost as important breaking news.

[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.620]
Forget about that damn $700 billion bailout.

[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.840]
Forget about the world is coming to a win.

[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.380]
Oh, that's right.

[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.240]
Breaking news.

[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.880]
Even more important than what's his name.

[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.440]
Chris play Aiken came out of the closet.

[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.220]
Fat Chris came out of the closet.

[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:21.360]
New DVDs, The Godfather, The Copa Restoration.

[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.400]
You ready for this?

[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:24.700]
All right.

[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:31.400]
Many of Francis Ford Copa Los Films, including recent youth without youth, have been haunted by the passing of time

[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.520]
and an acute awareness of its destructive handiwork.

[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:37.520]
The sense that once a treasured moment has been lost, nothing can be done to recover it.

[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:42.340]
But now a piece of Mr. Copa's own youth, which also happens to be one of the greatest works in American film,

[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.400]
has been recovered and spectacularly so.

[01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:52.900]
Yesterday, Paramount Home Entertainment issued the three films that make up Mr. Copa Los Godfather saga,

[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.660]
miraculously be Juvenated by a team of digital restoration experts under the supervision of the film preservationist Robert A. Harris.

[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:09.940]
Offered both in high-definition, Blu-ray, and standard DVD editions, Mr. Copa Los 3 films seemed to have reclaimed the golden glow of their original theatrical screenings,

[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.960]
a glow that's been dimmed and all but extinguished over the years to a series of disappointing home video editions.

[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.820]
Most of Mr. Harris's work has gone to the first and second films of the trilogy.

[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:27.680]
The later and less well received third installment 1990 didn't need as much effort, having been shot on a newer generation of film stock

[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.760]
and never subjected to the abuse that nearly destroyed parts one and two.

[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:35.540]
By all accounts, the original negatives of the first two films were so torn up and dirty,

[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:38.720]
they could no longer be run through standard film lab printing equipment,

[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.080]
and so the only option became a digital rather than a photochemical restoration.

[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:44.420]
Are you following all of this?

[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:44.940]
Nope.

[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:52.020]
The final product, which the studio is calling the Godfather, the Copa Los Restoration, combines bits and pieces of film,

[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:59.460]
recovered from innumerable sources, scanned at high resolution, and then retouched frame by frame to remove dirt and scratches.

[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:06.460]
The color was brought back to its original values by comparing it with first-generation release prints,

[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:10.140]
and by extensive consultation with Gordon Willis, who shot all three films,

[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:16.380]
and Alan Divu, a cinematographer who did ET, who's also a leading historian of photographic technology.

[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.180]
The tight grain of the image, so important to component to Mr. Willis' original low-life photography,

[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.260]
is we turn to a particularly spectacular effect in the Ford Disc Blu-ray edition.

[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.820]
The effect is not an all-like database, a pristine 35-millimeter print projected and perfect focus,

[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.060]
a rare enough phenomenon on a movie theater, and until quite recently inconceivable in the living room.

[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.360]
I guess I got to go out and buy me a Blu-ray DVD.

[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:39.820]
All right.

[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.480]
And, thank you.

[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:42.460]
You ordered.

[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:43.760]
You seen one?

[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:44.580]
Nope.

[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.580]
How about you, Fat Chris?

[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:48.480]
No.

[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.320]
You haven't seen a Blu-ray disc?

[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.000]
No, I've never watched one.

[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:53.380]
On a nice big screen TV.

[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:54.300]
1080, of course.

[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.160]
Out of the kind of money.

[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:55.460]
Nope.

[01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.440]
I didn't ask you to do your own one.

[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.340]
Have you seen my friends don't have that kind of money yet, either?

[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.660]
Well, what kind of deadbeats you hang out with?

[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:03.960]
Birds of a feather.

[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:04.500]
Exactly.

[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:06.420]
Slum together.

[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:12.980]
The Godfather films remained the 20th century's answer to Shakespeare's plays of royal succession,

[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:17.460]
with a twist that here prints how it grows up, not in the Henry V, but Richard III.

[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.220]
Al Pacino's performance as Michael Corleone,

[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.600]
a very introverted, youngest son of a wise and ruthless monarch,

[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.420]
remains a model of modulation.

[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.120]
What does that mean?

[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.340]
I don't know.

[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.420]
Is that some kind of a sued expression?

[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.680]
Sounds like movie sued review.

[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.020]
New York Times, yeah.

[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.260]
New York Times, pseudo-intellectual, Kakka.

[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.740]
The shape of his face, the set of his eyes, the weight of his body,

[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:45.540]
all seemed to evolve imperceptibly, at least until the aggressive intervention of Makeup in Part III.

[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:50.220]
A puppy-ish kid who might have been played by Dustin Hoffman in his graduate period

[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:53.320]
becomes a figure of immense gravity and chilling emotional reserve,

[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.000]
a portrait worthy of Walter Houston or Max von Sito.

[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.660]
Wow, there's Max von Sito.

[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.960]
Wasn't I just talking about him the other day?

[01:15:59.240 --> 01:15:59.700]
Yes, you were.

[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.060]
There is only one.

[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.080]
Yeah.

[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.280]
I'm just causing there for dramatic effect.

[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.980]
The effect is just so great.

[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.820]
And that's another one I've got the reshot version of that,

[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.520]
where she's got like the real piece soup, you know?

[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:18.280]
Yeah.

[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.240]
And she spits it all over the place.

[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:24.580]
Watching the first film, you're struck again by how little screen time

[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.200]
Arlen Brando actually occupies.

[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.820]
Most of his work is done in the 20 minute opening sequence

[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:33.260]
as the Godfather sits in his study, receiving supplicants on the day of his daughter's wedding.

[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.280]
This is a piece of superbly efficient expository writing,

[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.160]
setting out in a, this, this is incredible.

[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.180]
Setting out an exotic milieu describing its rules and moral configuration

[01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.600]
and establishing the larger than life figure who presides over and protects it.

[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.140]
This is just amazing.

[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.600]
Sito in Luxwell clap trap.

[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.900]
Setting out an exotic milieu.

[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.760]
I believe in a miracle.

[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.360]
And of course, the opening scene is like shot in black.

[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.200]
You think you've gone blind when you're trying to watch that opening scene.

[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.600]
And Brando plays it like the master he was balancing just enough exaggeration,

[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.960]
the cut and stuff, cheeks, the asthmatic voice,

[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.280]
and pure behavioral naturalism, the eyes that go blank when he's bored or distracted,

[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.300]
to create a figure that both belongs to this world and is too big for it.

[01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:21.360]
Well, this is great stuff.

[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.500]
After that sequence, his work is effectively done,

[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.960]
and the character can recede in the background of the action.

[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.120]
He spends much of the rest of the movie recovering from an assassination attempt

[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.740]
without surrending his dominant presence.

[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.200]
Like another venerated American, I've been gone with the wind.

[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.820]
The first god of the father films essentially a study in vanishing feudalism.

[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.440]
The older aristocratic masters who made their empires out of sweat and blood

[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.180]
are fading into the background to be replaced by the middle class,

[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.580]
mercantile interest represented in gone with the wind.

[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.660]
By the blockade runner, Red Butler, and the first godfather by the drug dealing upstart, Solozzo.

[01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:59.540]
I'll take care of Luca.

[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.040]
Now what he says?

[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.440]
Let me worry about Luca.

[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.120]
Oh, we also got...

[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.520]
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fishes.

[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.040]
I still can't believe that he kept telling me that that was Tessio.

[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:14.440]
Yeah.

[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.840]
Can you believe it, Chris?

[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:17.960]
Uh-huh.

[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.280]
Oh, I got a little... I got a little Solozzo.

[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.200]
He's still alive.

[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.140]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.800]
They're having with five shots and he's still alive.

[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.720]
Oh, it's bad luck for me.

[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.640]
I'm bad luck for you if you don't make that deal.

[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.820]
Now, wasn't it when he said,

[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:39.740]
let me worry about Luca that he put his alligator teeth over his bottom lip?

[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:40.240]
Yeah.

[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:41.760]
He did a job, then.

[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.320]
Yeah, he did a thing with a jaw.

[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:45.080]
Solozzo.

[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:49.380]
Hey, I got a great restaurant recommendation for Solozzo.

[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.580]
Try to feel it's the best in the city and McCloskey.

[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:59.080]
Do you have any idea what a great actor Sterling Hayden was?

[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.600]
He should have been on our poll yesterday about the underrated actors.

[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:01.860]
Right.

[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:02.900]
Sterling Hayden.

[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.860]
Back like in the 50s and maybe the late 40s, he was in everything.

[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.380]
You name a movie and he was in it.

[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.160]
What's the biggest name?

[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.280]
The best talent.

[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.620]
You know, there's no projects.

[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.120]
Forty-eighth, you're five sixty-q-a-m.

[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.800]
The fourth leader.

[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:19.820]
The biggest name.

[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.000]
The best talent.

[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.220]
It's a big dog, Joe Rose.

[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.360]
We did morning seven o'clock.

[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.900]
Where's South Florida sports?

[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.080]
Always matters.

[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:27.880]
Always matters.

[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.140]
Fort radio, five sixty-q-a-m.

[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.300]
The sports leader.

[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.180]
W-I-O-D.

[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:35.520]
Oh, I hate that station.

[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.940]
Hey, you're good.

[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.060]
I'm going for a coach on board.

[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.340]
The worst of these is all about your mind.

[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.800]
The worst of these is all about the worst of our sense.

[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.520]
The worst of these is all about the worst of our sense.

[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:01.520]
The right way nuts want to project us from ourselves.

[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:07.900]
You've got to watch what you say you better or else.

[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.760]
You're best of us.

[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.740]
You're best of us.

[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.280]
The worst of these are monetary.

[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.820]
Every boy.

[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:18.240]
I'm a happy guy.

[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:22.800]
I'll say I'm fighting me.

[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.660]
So if I just say this, come, please, please.

[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.360]
I hear my order, unit, and disassist.

[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:39.080]
They're using it for a slank wedged by the power of the enemy.

[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.180]
And our lord, God, push the federal education commission.

[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.560]
Head, my brawn, see this, I'm the house.

[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:51.180]
The worst of these is all about the best of our sense.

[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:57.840]
The worst of these is all about the worst of our sense.

[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:03.700]
The worst of these is all about the worst of our sense.

[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.980]
14th of noon at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:07.200]
How's that new poll coming?

[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.320]
101 votes on there.

[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.580]
Now, what do we have on the original one?

[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:10.540]
FATSO.

[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.620]
7.40 or something?

[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:12.780]
7.28.

[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.780]
8.29.

[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.740]
Oh, yeah, we're going to get 1,000 combined today.

[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.200]
You'll see.

[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.820]
And won't you be proud?

[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:24.100]
Won't you want to waddle out of that building with a big smirk on your pulse?

[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:24.840]
I'll be so proud.

[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:28.880]
Won't you waddle through the hallway saying, oh, look what we did today.

[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.320]
Oh, look what I did.

[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:31.500]
Not a lot of them.

[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:38.220]
No burgers complete without cheese 37, a bun 17, onions 13, ketchup 12.

[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:39.840]
I don't eat burgers 5.

[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.080]
Mouth turd 4.

[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:42.440]
Tomatoes 3.

[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:43.280]
Pickles 3.

[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.160]
Special orders don't upset us.

[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.060]
Hold the pickles and lettuce.

[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:47.820]
Slams some mayo on it.

[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.420]
I'll pickle 3.

[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.260]
Bacon 2.

[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.320]
Pepper's 1.

[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:52.420]
Stakesaw's 1.

[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.360]
Shrooms 1.

[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.800]
Barbecue's sauce 1.

[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:55.720]
Mayo 1.

[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:56.820]
I like it plain.

[01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:57.260]
None.

[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.360]
None for lettuce.

[01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.200]
None for relish.

[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.140]
None for any mustard.

[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:00.720]
None for salsa.

[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.440]
I think relish is underrated.

[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.160]
No.

[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:06.940]
No.

[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:06.980]

[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:07.720]
It's sweet.

[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.440]
Sweet relish.

[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:17.860]
I don't have horse radish on here.

[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.580]
Horse radish?

[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.760]
Sure, someone doesn't.

[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.620]
On a burger?

[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:25.480]
Yeah, why not?

[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.020]
Who does that?

[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.400]
Some kind of like an old Russian Jew puts horse radish on it.

[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:29.880]
I have no idea.

[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:30.740]
I'm sure someone can hear you.

[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:31.760]
You're a crazy person.

[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.260]
Okay.

[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.000]
Horse radish, my ass.

[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:35.800]
No, thank you.

[01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:36.700]
I'll go get the spoon.

[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.500]
Talk about the old Mickey D.

[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.180]
Ainus burger.

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:39.420]

[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.920]
Another shame that you guys don't have it?

[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:47.040]
I guess maybe if I had it, I'd know what I was missing.

[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:47.860]
And then it would be a shame?

[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.280]
Well, take my word for it.

[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.540]
You know I know my food, okay?

[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:50.960]
Yeah.

[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.480]
It's great, all right?

[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.540]
It puts the big Mac to shame,

[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:58.220]
puts any of those other quarter-bounder, all that other...

[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:59.900]
It puts all our garbage to shame.

[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:00.640]
It's really great.

[01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:03.140]
It's like, it's got like anus beef.

[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.660]
And it's popular as hell here, man.

[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.360]
You get in line at Mickey D's,

[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.920]
now everybody in their brother is ordering you,

[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:13.340]
either the one with bacon and cheese or without or with this,

[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.840]
with the anus burger.

[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.800]
Anus is really popular here.

[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.640]
It's a...

[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.060]
David said, can you guys please try to offer more

[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.940]
neal deals in the South Miami Coral Gables?

[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.620]
Coat and Grover Kindle Area?

[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.980]
It seems like 90% of your deals are in Broward.

[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:28.420]
Love the show.

[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:29.440]
Well, guess what, David?

[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.140]
Yes, we'll try.

[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.380]
I forwarded that to Duff, but he's wrong.

[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.440]
For a while there, that's all we had.

[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:36.620]
We're gables and Miami and things like that.

[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.980]
Are you picking on Dave Must have missed them?

[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:40.540]
Sure, why not?

[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:41.840]
Yeah, you missed the good stuff.

[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.560]
We had all kinds of great stuff on there, David,

[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.640]
and you got screwed.

[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.140]
Well, we'll go back.

[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:50.380]
Oh!

[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.480]
God, Brandon's not satisfied with this new Godfather thing.

[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.580]
He wants the one with all the outtakes.

[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.800]
All the footage that was left out.

[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.580]
Well, anyway, let's get back to that before I go to this Richard Goldman email.

[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.080]
Part deal takes place in a more modern world where capitalism is king

[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.440]
and it's difficult to tell where gangsterism leaves off

[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.160]
and normal business procedures begin.

[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.380]
Kind of like what's happening on Wall Street right now.

[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.480]
And with the banks.

[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.720]
The action and speaking of that, FBI is probing bailout firms.

[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.160]
Investigators start a search for fraud at Fannie Mae, Freddie MacLean,

[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:28.400]
and brothers in AIG.

[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.420]
When it's out, bail the big boys out.

[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.740]
Little guys screw them.

[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.160]
You know, let that see American F and win.

[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.500]
That's especially the Republican way.

[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:38.640]
You little guy, screw you.

[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.580]
You one of our big money friends.

[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:41.640]
Hey, we'll bail you out.

[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.060]
Well, let the taxpayers bail you out.

[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:48.180]
And we'll not or cannot cannot act.

[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.660]
We will take out high-level terrorist targets like Ben Lawton,

[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.900]
even if we have them over the objection of others

[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.320]
if we have them in our sights.

[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:01.580]
Ladies and gentlemen, Barack Obama has been absolutely clear.

[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.720]
That's Joe Biden getting all whipped up.

[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:04.620]
You tell him, Joe.

[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.540]
I mean, he's no Sarah Palin, thank God.

[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:13.080]
The action shifts to a global scale as the Koleon's

[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.880]
conquerant of data and very nearly Cuba.

[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.800]
And Mr. Coppola rises to the occasion

[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.820]
with a sense of physical scale and epic conflict

[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:21.480]
that no amount of computer-generated imagery enhancement

[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.760]
has yet been able to reproduce.

[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.060]
What does that mean?

[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:30.760]
I give up.

[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.740]
At the center of it all,

[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:34.120]
of course remains the family drama.

[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:36.780]
In an increasingly ruthless country-American audiences

[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:39.380]
envy the Koleon's for their powerful sense of ethnic

[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:40.700]
and family identity.

[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.020]
The privilege of belonging to an extended self-reliant

[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.120]
and self-protecting group.

[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.200]
They were having a group group.

[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.260]
At the same time, the family itself

[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.440]
is a constant source of anguish shot through

[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.740]
by betrayal suspicions and carefully erected barriers.

[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.840]
Who can forget the doors that slowly close

[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.220]
on Diane Keaton's K at the climaxes of Parts One and Two?

[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.960]
Michael can protect his family only by destroying it.

[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.980]
Just this one time,

[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.660]
I'll let you ask me about my monkey business.

[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.560]
18 years after the sting of this appointment has passed,

[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.200]
Parts Three no longer seems the total disaster once did,

[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.280]
but the grander of the first two films has slipped

[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.280]
irretrievably away.

[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.160]
By this point in his career, Mr. Pachino would become

[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.080]
a very different actor,

[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.960]
creating stealth and retention for accurately tricks

[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.980]
the staggering old man's gait,

[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.640]
the sudden explosions of vain popping rage.

[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.820]
The intrigue is now in international.

[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.700]
The plot draws on the scandals surrounding

[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:33.040]
the Vatican bank at the time,

[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.620]
but somehow seems smaller than what has come before.

[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:39.000]
More of a screenwriter's conceit than a peep behind the curtain of power.

[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.300]
But as Michael becomes weaker, his sister Connie,

[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:44.040]
whose wedding opened the first film,

[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.900]
has evolved into a figure out of a Greek tragedy

[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.440]
or Italian opera, a Medea or a Medici.

[01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.220]
Played by Tadja Sharamist,

[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:51.280]
a copial sister Connie,

[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.400]
seems to possess the calm dark resolve

[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.000]
that is abandoned her increasingly sentimental brother,

[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.140]
a godmother who almost seems capable of curing the plot

[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:01.920]
that now reach to a fourth more satisfying final installment.

[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.100]
Hey, how's that sound?

[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.040]
Good. Yeah.

[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.900]
The godmother would tell you, Shire.

[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:09.860]
Then they should fear her.

[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.380]
Maybe you're parents by Rocky. What?

[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.400]
Then they can fear her. Yeah.

[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.020]
Maybe they should fear you.

[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:16.180]
Bitch.

[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.480]
So there you go. It's a...

[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.220]
Whatever for you people who just can't get enough.

[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.080]
I've had enough.

[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:26.000]
In fact, let me scar my cable channels right now

[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.120]
to see if maybe it's on there.

[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.440]
Any time morning, noon and night,

[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.820]
you can go to your cable channels.

[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:32.600]
And there's at least one godfather.

[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.060]
Oh, abducted Fuji.

[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:34.560]
Box.

[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.700]
Abducted Fuji there for love.

[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.740]
What's the movie I'm supposed to watch with Leo and the Matt Damon?

[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:48.420]
The...

[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:50.560]
The parted. Yes. The parted.

[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.320]
A mighty heart. American Venus.

[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.900]
The boss of it all.

[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:55.960]
Babble.

[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.040]
The hunt for a red October. It just ended.

[01:27:59.260 --> 01:27:59.940]
Courage to love.

[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:04.260]
Georgia rule. A mighty heart.

[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.200]
Blue murder.

[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:07.800]
Outer limits.

[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:09.480]
Nash bridges.

[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.640]
Boston legal. That's stupid show.

[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:13.660]
Classic commercials.

[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:14.420]
All right.

[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:15.540]
Soldiers.

[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.140]
Soldiers coffee? Yeah.

[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.660]
Forges is different.

[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:19.900]
They blend it special.

[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:22.660]
See, forges is mountain groom coffee.

[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:23.660]
Nows and grown.

[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:25.920]
Oh, it's missing whatever it is on the Folgers' body.

[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:27.200]
You try it. I will.

[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.560]
Connie. This coffee is the greatest.

[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.840]
You've been taking coffee making lessons.

[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.740]
The lesson I learned is...

[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:36.200]
Soldiers.

[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.460]
Try Folgers. The mountain grown coffee.

[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.800]
Mountain grown for better flavor.

[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.540]
Chinese fortune cookies.

[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:45.880]
Chinese laundry.

[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.800]
Chinese lanterns.

[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.420]
But Chinese jello.

[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.420]
Back to present ancient Chinese pantomime.

[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:55.040]
Just for fun of it.

[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:56.000]
Jello tonight.

[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.480]
Back to present.

[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.640]
Small Chinese Thai baby waiting for dessert.

[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.780]
Chinese mother bling baby.

[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.320]
Jello. Famous Western delicacy.

[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.460]
Poor Chinese baby.

[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.760]
He unable to tell if this jello is strawberry.

[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:10.960]
Jelly.

[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:11.820]
Aspelli.

[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:12.180]
Jelly.

[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:12.860]
Orange.

[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:13.280]
Lemon.

[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:13.660]
Lion.

[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:14.400]
Apple.

[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:15.160]
Black glass.

[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:15.540]
Belly.

[01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:16.020]
Black jelly.

[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:16.620]
Or clay.

[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:19.560]
Jello come in all 10 flavors.

[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.920]
Poor Chinese baby.

[01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:24.000]
But Chinese mother bling baby.

[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:24.620]
I'm ready to jello.

[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.620]
We'll chop sticks by the way.

[01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:26.100]
Spoon.

[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.500]
Spoon was invented for eating jello.

[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.160]
Baby find this is clay.

[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.820]
The dark delicious no flavor.

[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.300]
Chinese baby.

[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.340]
That's my favorite flavor, by the way,

[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:39.600]
since we're taking silly foodies,

[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.560]
type poles, grape.

[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.080]
Oh, I love grape.

[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.220]
Like popsicles or cool aides,

[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:46.820]
stuff like that.

[01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.200]
Let's all drink the cool aides.

[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:48.700]
What do you say?

[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.200]
Oh!

[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:53.480]
Richard and Coral Springs things people are drinking.

[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.240]
The cool aides says,

[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.200]
as they really come to this,

[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:58.100]
has PT Barnum and correct all along with a sucker is born every minute?

[01:29:58.500 --> 01:29:58.900]
Absolutely.

[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.160]
Can the dummy down in America be this complete?

[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.080]
In the single most important presidential election of our times,

[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:06.240]
the mere fact that John McCain is either leading Thai

[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.260]
or closing the poles with Obama is incredulous in astounding at best.

[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.800]
He's dropping like a rock, Richard.

[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.260]
He's nine points down now, McCain.

[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:13.980]
And dropping fast.

[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.240]
And I got the thing about the poles of the battlefronts,

[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.340]
battleground states in my big pile here.

[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:25.000]
Obama's ahead in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin,

[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.800]
Pennsylvania, Florida by two points, Obama's ahead.

[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:28.940]
So just relax, Richard.

[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.200]
The tide is turning.

[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:33.080]
People are finally starting to get desperate and wake up and they're sniffing it.

[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:36.340]
Can people really be like lambs like the slaughter,

[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.120]
support a ticket that includes a bush clone,

[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:41.800]
and a so-called hockey mommy who wants to roe for every way to abolished,

[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:44.020]
is against abortion even in cases of incest and rape,

[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.460]
who is neolithic in her beliefs about a woman and a woman's right,

[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:48.600]
claims that homosexuality can be cured by prayer,

[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.580]
and thinks she's qualified to deal with the Russians

[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:53.640]
due to the single fact that she can allegedly see them out of her back door.

[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:54.940]
It's not the back door, Richard.

[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.800]
It's off her porch.

[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:59.680]
She sits on her porch and she waves to the Ruskies in Siberia,

[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.180]
which would be a good place for her, by the way.

[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:02.680]
Get through, I didn't.

[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.560]
The best talent.

[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:04.780]
You got to have those Rogers.

[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.180]
Sport radio 560 QAM.

[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:08.980]
The fourth leader.

[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:10.780]
The biggest names.

[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.320]
The best talent.

[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:17.180]
You're listening to sports radio 516 WQA.

[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:18.240]
The fourth leader.

[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:20.400]
The fourth Latter-day.

[01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.340]
This is pretty quick, though.

[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.220]
Whenever I shape my balls, I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.

[01:31:31.180 --> 01:31:33.260]
The Middle Eastern world.

[01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:37.420]
We'll be exploded to dumb and people killed.

[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.900]
With the gas that we sold him.

[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:43.860]
First time aggressor nation and the only one that's growing.

[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:48.200]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:53.060]
Forget about Korea and the nooks there toe to the nether.

[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:59.660]
Right, wean is drilling it over and over and to our heads.

[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:06.060]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.180]
3,000 people killed.

[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:20.940]
I'm not forgotten.

[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.780]
Let's exploit them instead.

[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.480]
Hey, there's oil to be caught in.

[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.580]
Going after sentom too.

[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.300]
Plankato Sama.

[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:33.420]
There's no longer mention of the name in Latin.

[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:35.920]
But no one seems concerned all.

[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:37.900]
Come be in complacent.

[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:41.540]
Believe in every word of this cartel administration.

[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.460]
That controls us by fear through linear manipulation.

[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:53.120]
And the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our heads.

[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.560]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:14.260]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.

[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.200]
We're all suspects now.

[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.260]
Not the ass-promptest saying.

[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.180]
I have nothing to hide.

[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.440]
Table talkers all are saying.

[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:26.300]
Blind obedient cattle don't have any reservations.

[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:27.540]
Bow to the people.

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:27.540]

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:27.540]

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:27.540]

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:27.540]

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:27.540]

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:27.540]

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:27.540]

[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.500]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:30.600]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:30.660]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:30.660]

[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:30.740]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:30.740]

[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:31.140]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.600]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.760]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.820]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:41.700]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:43.920]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:54.020]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.520]
That's the end of the world.

[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.560]
weapons of mass destruction.

[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:03.560]
A giant, a giant, off the earth.

[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:08.340]
By the way do you want to communicate with the chicken at can find out where hisありがとう is from yesterday?

[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:09.080]
I didn't know.

[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:11.060]
No why not you take the box.

[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:20.480]
You better get in that little box with chicken at can find out where that the FedEx is okay because otherwise tomorrow and Friday I might just the callen sick.

[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.940]
Probably three at five sixty WQM. Let's take a look at that schedule for the next

[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:30.460]
couple hours. Big ol' from two to four then the mad dog at somewhere in the studio. Oh

[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:37.400]
no, he's not here today. Oh no. Yoldy, the squeak-piste. We won again the

[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:41.620]
Delfand and the hockey seasons the Panthers won Exhibitions game. Maybe Calgary three to two.

[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:47.940]
Any interest? No. Florida Panthers, baby, and at the Bonehead coach that frog, Jack

[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:54.040]
Martin Bonehead. Mike in focuses, I had a comment from my Republican father the other day.

[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.540]
He said that Obama's not elected that the dark, complex folks will ride in the streets.

[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:03.760]
He promised that he and my mother will not be able to leave the house. Well, that couldn't

[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.460]
be a bad thing, Mike. That was the first I heard, but knew was only a matter of time

[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:12.820]
to state the obvious instilling fear and intimidation in an attempt to steal the third consecutive

[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:17.120]
election. When asked where you heard that, he wouldn't say, I suggested pill popping,

[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:23.140]
Lord Ass Limbaugh. May the good Lord help us all. P.S., the governor from Alaska, can suck

[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:29.840]
it, says Mike. I'm sure she has. So, um, yes, Boker says according to FedEx, it was delivered

[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:37.360]
to, not yesterday, delivered red, it might be there. So it was delivered when? Maybe this

[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:43.280]
morning. Maybe. Okay, it's probably downstairs right now. So I'll see you. Bye. Oh, what do you

[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:48.200]
think? Should I go down and get it? No. I'm playing oldies today. Okay. It'll be something

[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:55.240]
to look forward to for tomorrow. Danny says dog excrement used to be merely a nuisance

[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.540]
to pedestrians, but in Rome, now it could be used as evidence against pet owners and

[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:05.640]
may lead to fines. A town in northern Italy plans to create a DNA database of all registered

[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:11.420]
dogs and then test drop, um, the stuff that's left on pavement. Oh, Betty Smith wants to

[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:19.780]
sell me Viagra. Get lost, Betty. I'm I blackberry. Bitch. Then test drop the drooping's left on

[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.060]
payments and in parts to identify the culprit and find owners who failed to clean up after

[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:29.520]
their pets. Lost stop a daily reported yesterday. If signs and invitations are enough, we'll

[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.280]
try genetics. I want a clean city Antonio, uh, Prince, he pay counselor in charge of the

[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:40.380]
environment in virtually a town of some 45,000 habits near Toleno said in the paper. DNA

[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:44.680]
tests would cost around 13 euros, which would be more than covered by fines. Well, let's

[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:52.360]
see a buck 40 times 13 is what? You know, I know you're not asking me. Oh, it didn't estimate

[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:56.480]
the cost of creating a database. The Israeli town of pet that tick-follance to similar six

[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:04.120]
months route program earlier this month, which is what? 1820. What? 13 euros? Oh, yeah.

[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.880]
It's a buck 40 or something. Fuckin' a half. Why did the 140 times 13? I came up to $18 and 20

[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:23.560]
cents or whatever. The Israeli town of pet that tick-follance to similar six month route

[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.440]
program earlier this month in which dog owners were asked to take their animals to a municipal

[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:33.700]
veterinarian who then swabs its mouth and collects DNA. So that if they find their duty

[01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:40.520]
all over the place, then they're going to take DNA and come and take you away. Don't mess

[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:53.540]
with the dog. I mean, the dog is just doing its duty, you know? Races. Oh, oh, R. First,

[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:56.300]
see if he would have left off the first, he would have been fine. He's got a poll suggestion

[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:02.320]
which is okay. But the first part, first, please add to today's poll, several toppings,

[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:09.240]
sometimes one just won't do it. See, these people, so many of them, they don't understand

[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:13.300]
it's like when we ask them who's the greatest actor or actress and they give us a list of

[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:20.640]
50 people. Right. There can't be 50 greatest hamburgers, 50 greatest actors, 50 greatest

[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:29.600]
punjabi, whatever, you know? God, no burger is complete without blank, meaning one of

[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:35.580]
these things. You have to pick one. You got two nostrils. You have to pick one. Don't

[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:44.100]
make me choose while I'm used both hands. You got to admit it's pretty distasteful watching

[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:49.860]
somebody pick their nose. Oh, yeah. And I try to make sure that nobody is looking at

[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:54.720]
me when I pick my nose. I wonder if the queen picks her nose. Yeah, I remember the queen

[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.400]
of a tennis tournament many years ago at Wimbledon, I guess, was picking her nose and bud

[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:07.680]
Collins, the tennis announcer, said, great forehand. Yeah, he really did. It was, it was a good

[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:13.600]
line. As we saw the queen picking her nose, the world, she was picking, world's not out

[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:22.260]
of the world knows. Hmm. Not that she's up at either anything like that. I guarantee that

[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:27.780]
when she has wild diarrhea, man, it stinks like the end of the world. 154 votes on a poll,

[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:35.780]
no burgers complete without cheese. 47. Now we're talking. Bun. 29. Catch of 22. Onions

[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:43.140]
18. I don't eat burgers. Seven. Too bad. They're good. Tomato seven, mustard six, pickles

[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:49.540]
for shrooms three. Oh, that hearties. Shroom burger. God, it's to die for. And I think they

[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:58.580]
use swish cheese and shrooms on their. Yes. Am I right? Yes. Hmm. Hearties, too good for

[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:06.000]
South Florida. Bacon three. Steaks us to Mayo two. Pepper's one. Let us one. I could live

[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.940]
without the lettuce. BBQ sauce one. Relish finally got one. I still say relish is underrated.

[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:22.480]
It's good stuff. It's good crap. None for I like it plain honey mustard or salsa. I want

[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:26.680]
to think about maybe not with Cubans, but I noticed that Mexicans they want they want salsa.

[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:33.580]
They want hot sauce on everything. Even on pizza, they shmere hot sauce. Oh, for me. Even on

[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:38.000]
pizza. And then race is even though I know it's going to kill me, I just can't stay away

[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:46.020]
from blank. Paul suggestion ice cream bacon cheeseburgers pizza prostitutes the track cocaine

[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:51.000]
fast food. Yeah, fried anything spicy food or my wife's sister. Oh, it's going to say

[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.260]
that chick. You know, that could be anybody. No, even though you know it's going to kill

[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:05.520]
you. Right. Oh, I've doesn't have a sister. And if she did, then that chick. Oh, then

[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:11.900]
your wife's sister. Right. Here's one that says don't know if you've looked at HDDB

[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:15.400]
deepers. No, I have not. I'm not looking to be spending any more money. Okay. I'm going

[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.340]
to go to woodbind today. Maybe I'll make a few hundred and I can go out and buy me a

[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:27.220]
blue tooth. Or just a new set of tooth. Not amazing. I still got on my own teeth. My mother

[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:33.840]
was 91. She had mostly her own teeth. She had what do they call a bridge? Yeah, a bridge.

[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.740]
You know, what is a bridge? Yep. She had one of those. But other than that, she had her

[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:46.880]
own teeth 91. And you know what? Yeah, it was old enough. No, she still did. I hate

[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.640]
to admit this because it makes me sound like a sentimental old fool. It takes the hard

[01:41:51.640 --> 01:42:02.660]
edge off of my hard ass image. Every now and then I I miss her for like a minute. You

[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.880]
know, not what you're thinking. You know, in other words, something I would like to share

[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:14.580]
with her. And then I think, no, that's okay. Don't you think 91 in pretty damn good health

[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:19.840]
until the very end? Don't you think that's a I'll take it? Yeah. Me too. Although I think

[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.060]
I'm going to be dead pretty soon. I'm just going to keep saying that every day. Why not?

[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:29.200]
My mom has all my life. Oh, yeah. Well, my mother. I think I'm on the way out. She

[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:32.720]
said that for 20 years. I think I'm on the way. I always say not soon enough. Mom on the

[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:37.340]
day she died, which was her birthday. And I called her that morning. And she also said,

[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:40.400]
I think I'm on the way out. What's goes to show you? Like I said the other day, if you

[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:44.240]
throw enough crap up in the air, some of it eventually will stick. She was right. Finally,

[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:51.960]
I think I'm on the way out. No. Well, have a good rest, ma'am. Anyway, when you do look

[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:58.940]
at HD DVD players, it says you might want to look at the PlayStation 3. It plays HD DVDs

[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:04.040]
around 400 bucks. It's the cheapest I've seen. Picture quality is amazing on my 50 in Sony

[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:10.060]
Grand Vega using HDMI cable. Why do I want a PlayStation 3? You don't. And plus if it's

[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:21.140]
HD DVD, that's the no longer the main format. Bluetooth. Blu-ray. Blu-ray. Blu-ray. Blu-ray.

[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.880]
Blu-ray. That's what I got to go out. And I'm going to this week. Maybe this weekend

[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.220]
will go out and give me a Blu-ray. That's going to be easy to hook that baby up. I'm

[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:32.220]
going to have to put like all new cables and pops you around. I don't want to mess with

[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:36.060]
my beautiful Samsung 46 inch, which is not making those groaning sounds anymore. Thank

[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:41.360]
God. It was just a once in a lifetime thing, man. Where you got that groaning sound. Yeah.

[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:53.380]
You did too. I do. Sure. Under what groan? Oh. Wow. I'm at this moment. I never knew

[01:43:53.380 --> 01:44:02.420]
that till this very moment. I thought it was. Bud Zini. No, I thought it was what's

[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:13.040]
his name? The tag. The tag. The is a pimped. That's right. It was Bud Zini all along.

[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:21.100]
Or Zini was played by Richard Connie. Another great actor. He was in like. Stuff. No, but

[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:26.600]
like all those Roman gladiator movies. You know, yeah. Richard Connie. I would like

[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:32.580]
what Peter used to know. Remember Peter used to know. Pretty sure he still did. He was

[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:38.160]
Russian Jew. By the way, Peter used to know that 1213 at 560 WQM. Niels have prized deals

[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:41.940]
are the hit of the town. And this week no exceptions starting tomorrow. You can buy

[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:46.380]
$50 certificates for 25 bucks to the brand new Paisens restaurant in Barrel Springs.

[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:50.960]
Formerly on X. Paisens is now doing their grand opening and to rave reviews, including

[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.440]
from George and Chris who had a great meal their last night. They ain't free. But anyway,

[01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:02.540]
they offer great dining value with sensational food. Paisens features only Harris Ranch organic

[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:07.080]
beef. Try their eight ounce filet. It is tender and out of this world. Or their 14 ounce

[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:11.040]
rib. I'm urinated in garlic black pepper, pepper corn and oil. What did I say? Almost

[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:15.440]
said it. Their specialty is the primary of the big out cut of full 60 ounces slow roasted

[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.880]
for six hours and perfect every time. Seafood lovers feast on their fabulous fresh ketchup

[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.340]
items like Cedar Plank smoked salmon or C. Bass Wellington. The all new Paisens restaurant

[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:28.940]
in Barre, formerly onyx and 31 11 North University drive just to block south of Sample Road

[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:32.320]
and Coral Springs. I'm getting choked up just thinking about it. Call for reservations

[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:39.460]
9 5 4 5 10 7400. And now thanks to me tomorrow, you can buy $50 certificates that have prices

[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:46.060]
25 bucks. Our way of saying thanks to you. The store opens at noon tomorrow on wqam.com.

[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.780]
The biggest name. The best talent. It's the mad dog.

[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:07.580]
The sports radio 5 60 Q. A. M. The sports leader. Meal God.

[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:11.780]
Oh God. Don't go in there. You hear my stomach mubbles.

[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:28.440]
I'm. I'm. People hitting homes from work late one nine when they fall behind on the

[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:58.420]

A police officer,

King corrects.

[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:37.860]

[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:37.860]

[01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:37.860]

[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:39.380]
County manager for.

[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.680]
ASL.

[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:44.660]
As one or two.

[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:49.300]
Viuvatno Kar bouncing.

[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:50.760]
a G Ann.

[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:50.760]

[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:57.480]
As One or two courts?

[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:57.480]

[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:57.480]

[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.040]
State calling the bloke

[01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:58.060]
Yep.

[01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:58.140]
Just Drops and

[01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:58.340]
Pано Microsoft Students

[01:48:58.340 --> 01:48:58.340]

[01:48:58.340 --> 01:48:58.340]

[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:04.700]
of his time too. He was great, especially in network. I mean, sure, he was a lot of other

[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.440]
great movies, especially when he was younger. He was a good looking guy when he was young.

[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:14.680]
I told you that once before, back in the 40s, when he was only 100. You have that. But he

[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:28.320]
was a great actor. Leave him on. Remember that? Leave him on. And the opening scene, I'm

[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:34.860]
just obsessed just like as much as I love the Godfather. Network to me is like just so much

[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:40.520]
more significant being in this horse ball business that we used to be in. And we used to be

[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:49.300]
in radio? No. Oh, it's long ago and far away. And it's like these morons, these two

[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:52.960]
network twins. Haven't got any emails from them. Thank you. So I won't mention their

[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.460]
name. You know the ones? Yes, I do. Oh, we bring you ratings. No, what you bring us is

[01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:01.300]
heartburn. And what you've been attempting to do for the last year or two years is destroy

[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:07.020]
the show. And the tragedy of that is that management has sat back and offering these lame excuses

[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:13.380]
like that email from Joyce yesterday. Oh, when I spoke with 75 other legal abegos for

[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:20.200]
blow it out your ass on a you idiot, you crippling, you simple and your partners in crime

[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:27.140]
their jolly joe bill and clearance. Now, now let me ask you this since they have all these

[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:31.240]
meetings in that building. There are always always having a meeting to set up the schedule

[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:35.040]
for the next meeting. Right. One day, one of somebody at the meeting going to say, are

[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.240]
you going to do something about those regio and standardized them so they tell us

[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:42.080]
going to break his order? You know that that has never discussed. Well, when are you going

[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.600]
to approach there? What breed? I'm not. I gave up a long time ago. No, you need to know

[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:50.460]
that. Right now and take a big dump on his desk and shove it in. I'm walking here all over

[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:55.000]
his head. I'm a walking joke as it is whenever I bring up anything radio with fat Chris.

[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.880]
You can have fun with that. Why don't you go in here and tell clearance, give him what

[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:02.680]
for and say the old man is bitching about these inconsistent rejoins. And nobody knows,

[01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:06.620]
you know, first of all, that whole thing, these sports leaders sucked in the first place.

[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:14.400]
Just get rid of it all together. Get rid of it. These sports leader, my ass. Well, we're

[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.400]
building a wall of football. Yeah, right. I hope it falls on your ass, the wall. I hope

[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:24.460]
it comes crumbling down just like the walls of Jericho right on jolly joe's fat ass. What

[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:27.260]
are you going to do about it, Chris? Now, let me ask you, are these in like rotation,

[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:31.900]
these regioins or don't you have control over which one you play? No, with this new thing,

[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:37.760]
it's just a cart and they all play over and over and over and over. It's a cart? Yes.

[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:43.520]
A digital cart. You know, like the DCS, you can have multiple tracks on one cart. So

[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:49.940]
you have control which one is going to pop up. Correct. No. On the, on the previous AV I could.

[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:57.220]
Mm hmm. But not on this one. So worth a mercy of a new faulty piece of equipment. Well, it's

[01:51:57.220 --> 01:52:02.280]
not really faulty. That it is for our purposes. It is. Well, that's not the equipment's fault.

[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:08.220]
That it would be like if I pressed the button on DCS for example, for a, for an out cue.

[01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:10.940]
And anyone just to have what happened to pop up.

[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:21.780]
Even legal ID too. I think we ought to go back to some of those.

[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:34.420]
I'm going to start using that one. I don't think we can use that voice as what it is, I think.

[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:39.560]
We can't. I don't know. They've changed so many times. I don't remember anymore.

[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:47.800]
Why is he? We got the cheapo twins on that one. Oh, we can't use that guy's voice.

[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:52.260]
I think that's because then we'd have to pay him money for it. We don't mind. We don't mind.

[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:57.980]
We don't want to pay nobody no money. We don't want to. Even though it might make, make the station sound

[01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:02.700]
a little bit better. All I think he's, he's on one of them. Isn't he? The real dramatic rejoin

[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:05.560]
there and then all of a sudden there's no these sports leader. I think so.

[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:13.380]
Anyway, tell clearance that that sucks. It sucks. Clarence, you suck.

[01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:17.620]
Well, Jim and Tallahassee, what does it say there?

[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:23.420]
Their point of view is there's only one show that that like, you know, messes with and so

[01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:27.400]
they're not going to worry about it basically. What do you mean by that? Well, the other shows,

[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:32.340]
the producer does everything like you play, you know, the coming back bit, but in the other shows,

[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:36.260]
it's the producer that plays the rejoiner and then music or drop or something like that.

[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:41.140]
And then they tell the host to talk. So they tell the host to talk. Yep.

[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.120]
They have to tell the host to talk. Well, you know, when to talk or whatever they put his mic

[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.960]
on, whereas with you, you you pick it up from the rejoiner and then play the bit and then you start

[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:57.960]
talking. So I think I'm surrounded by a bunch of non-radio people. I could be wrong about that.

[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.440]
Am I wrong about that, George? No, I don't know.

[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.400]
I'm not sure if I have a bunch of amateurs.

[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.060]
The biggest name is the best talent.

[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.080]
One of these amateurs applies that job.

[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:11.640]
They want to be the fourth leader.

[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:14.580]
The biggest name is the best talent.

[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.060]
It's the G.A. Joe.

[01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:17.400]
Weak nights for being to an amateur.

[01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:18.040]
Here I come.

[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.120]
The sports for your five sixty two A.M.

[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:24.120]
Yeah, the sports leader.

[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:29.820]
The sports for your radio is one of the cues for you.

[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.660]
Absolutely.

[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:37.860]
You're famous.

[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.120]
He lives on queer street.

[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:48.960]
Linger's rounds on queer street.

[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.880]
He has a house and garden.

[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:57.000]
I would love to see what happens.

[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:08.000]
Paces, toes and pets is monkey.

[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:11.660]
Women's clothes make him look real funky.

[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:18.660]
He has a whizz-whiz and knows what to do.

[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:25.760]
He wants me and he.

[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:27.840]
Don't you?

[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:33.660]
He lives on queer street.

[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.580]
You're very pure and thorough.

[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:38.580]
We're all the creatures, mate.

[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:41.960]
I wonder what they're doing.

[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:46.040]
He said he likes to just find.

[01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:51.720]
A few of Jews, like I know Jews.

[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:04.480]
He lives on queer street.

[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:08.300]
Linger's a round on queer street.

[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:10.300]
He has a house.

[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.120]
I don't know if they go to pick it on poor Clay Akin again.

[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:13.160]
Clay is out.

[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.540]
Was there any doubt?

[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:14.820]
No.

[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:17.820]
That's like saying the sun is shining somewhere.

[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.660]
Shining here is beautiful.

[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.200]
Aren't you jealous?

[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:22.960]
No.

[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:28.540]
From thirty two at five sixty W.M., we're going to have one if you were employee, one less tomorrow.

[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:31.700]
Wait.

[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:32.180]
Why?

[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:34.820]
Why?

[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:36.860]
What's up with George?

[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:37.280]
Why?

[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:39.380]
Are you puking your guts out of you?

[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:42.520]
What was his name?

[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.300]
Mike Disney?

[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:44.980]
No.

[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.120]
Mike Disney used to puking away space.

[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:50.680]
You're bored of.

[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:51.400]
Carlos.

[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:52.380]
Carlos, free key.

[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.940]
No, not freaky Carlos.

[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.360]
What was that one?

[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.540]
Anyway, flea sends me this email.

[01:56:58.980 --> 01:56:59.820]
Says, I'll do it.

[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:02.380]
I'll bring up rejoins in a meeting tomorrow morning.

[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:03.680]
Thank you, flea, what you're done.

[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:04.100]
You're out.

[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.580]
And the funny part of it is flea replaced Miguel, didn't he?

[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:08.040]
Yes.

[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.020]
Eventually.

[01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:10.360]
I warned him.

[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.060]
Once they know that you're really on our side.

[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:14.500]
Right. A lot of similarities there.

[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:19.940]
Working on the show, volunteering with for no extra paid work on the show.

[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:24.800]
And the last act was to bring our name up, the show's name up, you know.

[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:25.200]
In a meeting.

[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:29.120]
And they said, bye bye Miguelito.

[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:30.920]
So long.

[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:32.160]
Don't come back.

[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:33.740]
Yeah, that was a fed-ass Joe Bill.

[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:36.520]
Bastard.

[01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:37.600]
Oh, God.

[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:40.660]
That was one of his first acts was to blow out Miguel. Am I right?

[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:41.900]
I think so.

[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.440]
Here's a pulsing Justin from Joe,

[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:48.440]
who was the best sportscaster of all time.

[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:52.640]
And he's got a list of 10 male Island, Ernie Harwell,

[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.600]
Keith Jackson, Harry Carey, John Madden, John Madden.

[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:01.040]
See, we're going to have to do a play by play people, not color people.

[01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:04.000]
Best play by play sportscaster.

[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.600]
Okay. Play by play.

[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:08.340]
Got it.

[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.340]
Got it.

[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:14.700]
Michael Lang, Don, see Don Cherry is not a play by play.

[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:16.940]
And not a sportscaster, either as a commentator.

[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:19.160]
A Marvel Albert, Howard Cosell,

[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.520]
who also was not a play by play, Kurt Gowdy,

[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.760]
and whatever other, yeah.

[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:24.740]
Okay, I can add another hundred names to that.

[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:26.680]
That's not bad. We've done it before a long time ago.

[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.460]
Long ago, not long enough though.

[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.220]
Let's do it again about 10 years.

[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:33.700]
Thanks, Joe. I like that one.

[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:34.840]
Maybe we'll do that to our Friday.

[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:38.600]
Now, how many votes have we got, uh, Tubby?

[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:41.060]
We had seven, seven on the first one, right?

[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:44.980]
Two, twenty-five now, and seven, twenty-eight.

[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.140]
Oh, my God. Nine, fifty, three.

[01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.580]
We got, we got a thousand licked easy.

[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:51.800]
We're licking it.

[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:56.460]
Eat your heart out, footsie. See, footsie, he won't tell you how many votes he's got.

[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.020]
You know why? Because it's huge.

[01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:00.860]
And he's still doing the best album of all time.

[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:05.340]
He's doing one against the other. You know, he could do that for like the next hundred years, if he don't get canned first.

[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:07.820]
That'd be a good poll, uh, question.

[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:11.300]
Who's going to get canned first?

[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:13.280]
Footsie or Jimmy Cifilis?

[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:20.240]
I know somebody who'll never get, well, really surprises me is because the Humper was, uh,

[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.200]
he was his big ally. He was the big supporter now that the Humper got blown out,

[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:26.840]
and they're still hanging out there. Well, that's right.

[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.060]
U.M. gets to pick him, right?

[01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.080]
I guess. Chris?

[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:33.620]
Sure. I don't know actually what that one is.

[01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:34.740]
I guess. I guess. I don't know.

[01:59:34.740 --> 01:59:36.140]
Joe's a big part of the fraternity.

[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:37.700]
Yes. He's got his own cloud.

[01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:41.600]
Joe? Joe's a Gaki.

[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:42.740]
Oh, Joe Mama.

[01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:50.500]
PlayStation 3 plays the Blue Ray Standard, and you only need to connect one cable TV, uh, cable TV.

[01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:51.820]
Just letting you know. Thank you.

[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:58.300]
I don't want it. I don't want to play PlayStation 3. I don't want to, uh, first of all, let me ask you this.

[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:02.800]
Well, I've had several, let's see. Playstation 3's got a Blue Ray player built into it, so somebody.

[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.020]
Hey, did you hear?

[02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:10.160]
Yeah, I hear what about PlayStation 3 has the blue Ray player built into it.

[02:00:10.180 --> 02:00:12.680]
I don't care. I can get one, but I don't want to.

[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:17.200]
Long time list, their first time emailer, you can buy a blue rate DVD player for 280 bucks.

[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:22.380]
So even Schlepper is like me, can own one. He says you don't have to buy a PlayStation by Sony in order to get blue Ray.

[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:27.980]
The one I got connected easily to my TV, sent audio components. It's not a high end, but it works great easy to use.

[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:32.780]
What do I want with the blue ray?

[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:37.280]
I guess that I can go out and buy that new Godfather DVD, right? And shove it in my BVDs.

[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:45.060]
Jim and Tallahassee says I've been listening for 15 years and love the new format. Me too, Jim. I'm your fan.

[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:48.420]
The calls had long time ago become ponderous, right?

[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:53.260]
I can't listen to the live stream of work, so I have to rely on the archive since last Friday.

[02:00:54.100 --> 02:00:58.960]
Oh, no. Since last Friday, the show archives have been only about three hours and 20 minutes long.

[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:04.240]
Can you have Eric Rudge check to see what the problem is? I realize the price is right, but I still need my last 40 minutes.

[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:07.240]
Well, guess what, Jim? Some days you're not going to get it. Corn Eric.

[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:15.060]
I will vote early and often for Obama. Obama loss will not only be a sad day in American history, it will be a sad day for America's future.

[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:23.280]
Not just America's future for the world's future. Okay? If they put this right wing Nazi goofball, this duface in there with this duface running mate.

[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:24.380]
The hockey man.

[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:33.380]
Thanks for the wisdom and laughs over the years, Neil, you're the best. Yes, I am, Jim, in spite of all the negative crap from Joyce and Clarence.

[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:37.060]
Oh, he doesn't talk about sparts. He didn't talk about spits.

[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:46.320]
The idea that the people that run this radio station would sit back and let a couple of morons destroy the show and leave it to me to like resurrected.

[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.840]
Like the penis rising from the ashes. I'm the penis. Remember a phoenix still there, huh? Yeah.

[02:01:52.460 --> 02:02:07.580]
I got you a good nepotism poll someday, not not for like soon. What what celebrity achieved their fame only because of their relation to somebody else?

[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:15.320]
That's you. I'm not asking you well, but you know what I mean, like Joaquin Phoenix. We can tweak the Joaquin Phoenix. Sure.

[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:26.380]
And what's Rob Lowe? Chad Lowe is that his brother's name? I believe so. That's a screamer. That's floater. Is he? Oh, please. I still think Rob Lowe is gay probably swishful thinking in my part.

[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:35.660]
Oh, but there was that video. Neil, yeah, great. That proves it to me. So I'm on biography there today. He sure looked pretty back in those days. Rob Lowe.

[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:44.340]
We could play Lowe below, but now can we play that any? No, no, no. Let's find out. Let's see. Lowe.

[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:20.180]
Entertainment Jean shallot says this one fires no blanks. No, no. Rob Lowe filmed in sensual round and spread a vision. No, no. Rob Lowe is coming in your living room with a spasmodic release of his directorial debut.

[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:35.140]
No, no. Right in PG 13. It's make that 16. That was fine. Yeah. Wasn't it just fine. I mean, it kind of like pushed a couple of edges here in there. A little. You know, I write it fine.

[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:48.860]
I read it PG for pretty good. Dancing wrong with that. Oh, no, you can't play that. They said. And then they said, yeah, screw you guys. Just scandalous. It's one of the great scandals of all time.

[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:54.920]
Of course, if we had anybody in town who wrote about what's going on radio and TV anymore, somebody would be writing about it, but they're not.

[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:05.460]
Little Tommy jica once in a while. He gets a bug up his ass. You know, read a little something but not very often. And of course, Barry Jackass. He's got the inside pipeline. You know, he's got the bad phone at red phone.

[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:14.300]
Oh, let's tell Barry about it. And then of course, maybe like a month later, Barry, I corrected like about Joe Rose is going to do six to 10.

[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:30.040]
The best talent for you. No projects for you. 560 Q AM. The fourth leader. The biggest thing is the big. Or landy wells are Gary morning. 5 to 7. Sports radio. 566.

[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:44.620]
5 to 8. Hey, sports leader. Were you grudge back in this weekend on access Hollywood George Michael. You were busted over the weekend for drug possession, right? Yeah. Yeah. What kind of shape were you in?

[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.760]
And what kind of drugs?

[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:58.500]
The cops wanted to bring you down to the station. What did you say to them?

[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:01.720]
So innocent or guilty?

[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:06.360]
Anything else you want to say?

[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:14.140]
No, thanks. I don't swing that way.

[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:20.700]
Thanks for the interview. Gotta go.

[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:24.340]
One thing about this. We can't access.

[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:28.660]
Always timely. You know, just wait a few months and play it again. Am I right? Yep.

[02:05:28.660 --> 02:05:40.520]
Absolutely. 1245 at 560 W. If you ever do a poll on nepotism says a K, please put Torrey spelling on it. She's just playing grotesque. Grotesque.

[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:53.620]
Okay. You agree? She's grotesque. Oh, nepotism. That is a good poll. Joaquin Phoenix. Sure.

[02:05:55.960 --> 02:06:04.940]
First of all, what is that? What is that name? Spanish? No, I don't mean Joaquin. I mean Phoenix. I'm not.

[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:10.940]
I'm not. Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix and Shloy. I think they were hippie. It's Hock Phoenix. They made a hippie name. Oh.

[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:19.180]
Uncle, you are right. Sterling Hayden was a great actor. He and John Wayne owed matching p-boats, which they refurbished in my hometown of San Pedro, California.

[02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:30.360]
He would later take off to Mexico because the IRS was hounding him after failing the time to the Communist Party and the red baiting of the 50s. They would often go to Ketlin Island and drink the place dry.

[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:44.140]
He would cruise off long beach in San Pedro staying 12 miles out at sea so the IRS would nap him. Also, why don't witches wear underwear? I give up so they can get a better grip on the broom handle.

[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:57.160]
Oh, I didn't even wore the rim shot. No, it's worth one of these. Well, I really cliff and candle says Neil, there's an actual organization called Parrot heads.

[02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:08.880]
It's all about listening to Jimmy Buffett music and getting drunk in a shirt and flip flops and a something shirt. It's chopped off. There's nothing less attractive than a bunch of drunk white old and overweight fat people wearing Hawaiian shirts.

[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:17.580]
I visited Key West in April for the first time in 11 years. It didn't take long for me to remember why I quit going. Key West is everything wrong with Florida times 10.

[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:29.700]
Terrible service, even if you could get any, the food was overpriced and disgusting. Half the stores on DuVal Street are closed. They're a drunken parrot heads vomiting in every alley. The poor people are working Key West can't afford to live there.

[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:39.300]
The Key West police are the most obnoxious nasty overweight bunch of pigs I've ever seen. Their favorite pastime is stopping cars on DuVal Street causing traffic jams.

[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:50.780]
The final straw was finding a pocket ticket on my rented moped. I must have taken the cop spot for getting lunch. Couldn't get out of there fast enough. I puked my cheeseburger and paradise over the rail of the seventh mile bridge.

[02:07:53.500 --> 02:08:20.760]
Cheeseburger and paradise my ass. The great Jimmy Buffett. I'm in right. I can't wait until we can say the great late Jimmy Buffett. Music for drunks. Is that what that's all about? I like it. I think that's what the message from Cliff was. Music for drunks. Here's one from John says keep doing whatever you want on the show. You make this out for the market. Lowly reeking $50 and John McCain the 700 billion. J.B. and Boca et a boy J.B. And I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm

[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:35.760]
going to say, he said. He said. And Kenny Graham or one of our former co workers has become a doctor a chronic here on the Youd emails, isn't he. He's just fine. He's fine. I'm not knocking, Jesus Don't get all defensive now. Anybody that you used to work with us, you're like Fred, that's true.

[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:38.400]
You get all defensive about that's not true

[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:45.200]
Name me somebody who we used to work with that you wouldn't get defensive about Roger McLean Nick Lawrence

[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:47.960]
I had no problem with Nick. I didn't either

[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.720]
In fact when he got me those two guys from that video. What was the one on Palabra and Espanol?

[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:56.200]
See word in Spanish by Alton John. I was filmed on South Beach

[02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:01.240]
And he got me those two kids on the show from the video remember that yep that was quite an accomplishment

[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:05.100]
Except the fact that one was really ugly and never less. They were they were okay

[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:08.120]
It's amazing what you can do with makeup

[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:15.280]
Yep, isn't it remarkable you see somebody like on a video or on TV and then you meet them in person and like wait a minute

[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.540]
Are you are you the person that I've seen on you know like that?

[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:21.180]
Amazing what they can do with makeup

[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:28.520]
Anyway Kenny says for the announcer pull Charlie Jones who always sounded like he had a bad head cold

[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:33.600]
Charlie was okay, but certainly not the greatest sports and on Don Cricky who also is okay

[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:38.420]
He's still working am I right Chris Don Cricky? I believe so yes. Yeah, he's good

[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:45.400]
He's I'll tell you who needs to hang it up badly badly. Oh my god, and I used to like him. He used to be great

[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:46.560]
Dick Enberg

[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:50.520]
I'm trying to remember which game he was doing on Sunday

[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:54.620]
He had one of the games I watched a lot of so maybe I don't know this make a difference

[02:09:55.020 --> 02:10:01.440]
He kept giving the wrong names of the running backs and receivers every time somebody would make a great catch

[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:07.100]
Oh, and a great catch my my Shmendrick and it turns out it was a hamyanco not Shmendrick, you know, I it's it

[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:11.520]
He was just horrible awful and he sounded like he was so confused

[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.720]
He just why let me out of here. You know like that. Let me out

[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:20.480]
Dick's dick and not to stock and he's always terrible dick Enberg. What do you think about dick Chris?

[02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:27.440]
I'm telling you he's lost it

[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:34.880]
What are you talking about dick and bro? Oh?

[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:40.480]
You don't even know who that is. No, I don't know dick. He's one of those all around guys for a hundred years

[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.480]
He's he's been like football

[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:45.880]
They fall tennis he does tennis he does it all

[02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:52.040]
The used to have a guy named the Jim Simpson. I think I didn't be see who also was you know

[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:54.060]
He did a little verse a little bit. He was awful

[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:58.480]
Enberg used to be very good. I mean not the best, but he was certainly in there

[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:01.860]
He was no Jimmy syphilis

[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:09.440]
So anyway, well, I'll put the good that best enough to that that'll we could do that like what's his name like?

[02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:12.140]
Futsi does it we could do that for a hundred years

[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:18.560]
Just have two names on there we didn't and keep having a runoff and whoever survives we put them up against somebody else the next day

[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:20.800]
Right right

[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:23.740]
Let me ask you is Danny Galovane, Jewish

[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:29.980]
The FBI is investigating Fannie Mae Freddie Mac Lehman brothers and AIG

[02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:37.140]
And their executives as part of a broad looking to possible mortgage fraud sources would now to the investigation told CNN yesterday

[02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:40.920]
The sources would not speak on the record because the investigation is ongoing

[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:49.800]
FBI spokesman special agent Richard Kolko had no comment on information said that 26 firms were currently under investigation as part of the Bureau's mortgage fraud inquiry

[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:58.160]
Earlier this month FBI director Robert Mueller told Congress that 1400 individual real estate lenders brokers and appraisers were now under investigation in addition to

[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:05.700]
Corporations the FBI currently has 26 pending corporate fraud investigations involving subprime lenders Kolko said

[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:09.140]
I wonder if he was related to a Joe Kleco remember Joe Kleco Chris

[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.560]
Another name looked just like AJ doing

[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.360]
Look like his twin brother

[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:21.820]
As we've seen this number can fluctuate over time however we don't discuss which companies may or not be the subject investigation

[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:25.780]
Previously CNN reported that country wide is part of the investigation

[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:31.400]
Sources said the probes of Fannie Freddie Lehman and AIG are believed to be in the early stages

[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.600]
One source of the government would be remiss if it didn't look into what happened at these companies because of the financial problems

[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:41.500]
They're involved in and the actions of the individuals running them the individuals running them who are making

[02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:44.520]
Zillions and trillions and gazillions of dollars

[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:49.880]
We got to have Larry doing loomie 700 billion dollars

[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:53.020]
Now I'm curious

[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.720]
When you come right down to it. Where did we ever get that flip from you know the history of that yes, I did it was there what happened

[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:05.440]
Really yep, let me tell the audience long me Shostidaz. That's the clue long me Shostidaz

[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:07.700]
Yeah, so I'm doing the overnight

[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.140]
I'm the board up for the Larry King overnight from 11 to 5 a.m. Oh back when he was on mutual

[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:18.040]
Yeah, when I was still a part-timer before we ever met before you ever heard of me

[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:22.500]
And you were just some voice on the radio that the redneck repo man used to listen to who trained me

[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:26.960]
We've got a yell at the radio all the time and I say change the station. He called you every name of the book

[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:29.620]
And I said change the station we can listen to all these

[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:35.500]
So anyway, I'm there and you know Roger would come in to do the micronary show which started at six and

[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:41.060]
And he would show up at like four in the morning for that to do the show prep for an area

[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:43.080]
Yeah, and

[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:51.920]
The last hour of Larry King was on at that time the last rebroadcast hour and Roger would always come on and slap on a reel to reel so that he could capture

[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:55.540]
Larry King drops all of these Larry King drops that we have were a

[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:59.900]
Roger Maglund production as you may or may not know at least most of them

[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:02.160]
You know that right. Yeah

[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.280]
Roger was the one that was obsessed with getting like all me struck it up. Give them to you so that you know

[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:09.420]
He could kiss up to you which never worked. Yeah, so he could get your job

[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:14.420]
Right which I didn't have to worry by the way. I'm gonna have a weeny before I go to woodbuyer

[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:17.740]
So I'm gonna go to to nook my weeny no problem

[02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:20.640]
Send their try not to fall asleep during the Larry King broadcast and

[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:27.500]
And Roger comes busting into the control room screeching like a girl. Oh my god. I can't believe he just said that

[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:29.660]
That's the best thing in the world. Oh my god

[02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:32.480]
And he starts rewinding the real real tape and I have no idea

[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:35.080]
About the only time that's fine not to fall asleep. Yeah

[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:38.420]
Larry had been telling the story about how he got the

[02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:43.600]
This this ticket that he didn't pay and they were gonna or rest him if he didn't pay

[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:46.400]
And so he's at some appearance at some restaurant

[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:50.920]
I think pumpernix or something like that in Halendale and he's telling this whole story about how he had to borrow

[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:54.040]
$50 from somebody who was standing there and upon saying

[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:58.200]
Don't be $50. That's when Roger came busting back into the room and

[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:02.000]
An isolated it carted it up. Oh, I always like that Roger

[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:06.780]
Maybe Roger's looking for a job these days. Hi a handsome don't be $50. Oh boy

[02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:10.220]
poor renery

[02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:13.020]
One thing about renery though he was very um

[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:18.620]
Even tempered in other words. He didn't he just we mean I mean he could have slowed once in a great while

[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.780]
Custody once did he really sure about what?

[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:25.760]
Uh, he was on a remote. I was running the board. He was on a remote still

[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:31.560]
When I was a part-timer. I made a mistake and uh, he cussed me out. I know what he said

[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:34.100]
I've got a little tire to that crap. I can tell you right now

[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:38.360]
Oh, man, he was a good guy for the most part. Yes

[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:43.060]
Well nobody's perfect. I'm not saying he was a perfect guy or he was uh, you know

[02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:46.860]
The best guy that ever was in the business. He was a good guy. I like them

[02:15:47.540 --> 02:15:52.100]
Me too. I enjoyed following him. I enjoyed he had a sense of humor about himself

[02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:56.640]
And he could poke a little fun at me and we you know, we get a little back and forth and whatever

[02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:58.220]
Mm-hmm

[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:02.820]
And he had an audience. He actually had an audience and then of course they screwed him over a big time

[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:08.980]
They just like all management man. They can't wait to screw things up. Yeah, his audience was getting older and yadda yadda

[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:11.200]
He's still uh, he's still done pretty good

[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:14.040]
Especially for the crap he put on a ear. I mean

[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:20.480]
You know, remember the allman act and all that stuff and they never did replace that with a show that did better

[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:23.020]
That all but that that uh

[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:27.320]
What what was his name the news guy Chuck Meyer sure those interviews man

[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:28.260]
Mm-hmm

[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:29.460]
Welcome

[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:38.840]
The biggest names the best talent

[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:52.380]
You're listening to sports radio 560 wq a.m. I am a for the latter day. Hello. This is on this is not a tumor. It's the ones a two hour

[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:01.300]
Election day

[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:07.480]
The first Tuesday and November

[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:12.880]
You

[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.160]
When you go to

[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:22.280]
Please oh, just your ballot for some old cranky dope

[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.500]
Let's select the man who gives us home

[02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:27.200]
Food for for right

[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:30.120]
And what you'll find

[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:40.140]
It's not because

[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:48.380]
He's have black and have white. I

[02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:51.480]
Meet my wini by the way with my

[02:17:55.160 --> 02:18:00.520]
Freshers accord and if you have heard a message and follow this campaign

[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:04.400]
There's no way you could vote for John the trade no

[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.720]
Barば Shaw

[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:18.320]
Hey

[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.640]
And

[02:18:32.250 --> 02:18:34.530]
Almost now with my Schneider's wing you would march toward.

[02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:36.350]
Okay.

[02:18:37.610 --> 02:18:37.930]
What?

[02:18:39.150 --> 02:18:39.470]
Nothing?

[02:18:39.790 --> 02:18:40.310]
You're not impressed.

[02:18:40.770 --> 02:18:44.230]
I would have much rather had one of those anus burgers with bacon and cheddar.

[02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.350]
What's it?

[02:18:45.450 --> 02:18:46.510]
From Mickey D's, but you know.

[02:18:47.730 --> 02:18:48.470]
What are you on it at?

[02:18:48.610 --> 02:18:49.370]
There's a couple blocks away.

[02:18:51.010 --> 02:18:52.470]
I'd go get one now if you want to cover.

[02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.690]
No, that's all right.

[02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:54.430]
You sure?

[02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:55.110]
I'm sure.

[02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.950]
Mmm.

[02:18:56.330 --> 02:18:57.050]
Not as good to me.

[02:19:02.670 --> 02:19:04.090]
I got all this stuff here.

[02:19:06.210 --> 02:19:08.790]
Kenny, grammar, says sorry I'll stop in chronic.

[02:19:09.090 --> 02:19:10.150]
No, don't stop sending stuff.

[02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:11.250]
Okay, just keep sending stuff.

[02:19:11.810 --> 02:19:15.170]
But it says, in light of the new email format, what qualifies as chronic?

[02:19:15.370 --> 02:19:17.470]
I will say this, some of the chronic's like Sal Biendo.

[02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:19.990]
We both mentioned his name on here and he stopped sending crap.

[02:19:20.170 --> 02:19:20.650]
Go away, Sal.

[02:19:21.850 --> 02:19:24.290]
Didn't he used to play third base for the A's?

[02:19:25.170 --> 02:19:25.270]
Who?

[02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:25.830]
Who?

[02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:26.650]
Sal Watt.

[02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:30.690]
Who played third base for the Oakland A's back in the glory days?

[02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:32.650]
I don't know when the glory days.

[02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:35.390]
When they used to win the penalty all the time.

[02:19:35.510 --> 02:19:37.950]
I had registered Jackson, you know, not tennis.

[02:19:38.130 --> 02:19:38.850]
Was I live back then?

[02:19:39.610 --> 02:19:40.010]
No.

[02:19:40.570 --> 02:19:45.650]
Well, Sal, somebody will email Sal Bando.

[02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:48.270]
Maybe his name was Bando.

[02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:48.950]
Wasn't Sal.

[02:19:49.170 --> 02:19:49.950]
Maybe it was, I don't know.

[02:19:51.130 --> 02:19:54.370]
My sense, my two senses, I'm sorry for eating on here.

[02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:55.210]
You believe me?

[02:19:55.350 --> 02:19:55.590]
No.

[02:19:56.050 --> 02:19:56.850]
I'm not sorry at all.

[02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:59.690]
I wish you guys could still eat on here.

[02:19:59.690 --> 02:20:01.490]
Well, I guess you'll be eating on here tomorrow.

[02:20:02.090 --> 02:20:03.070]
Yes, we will with the vengeance.

[02:20:03.690 --> 02:20:04.130]
Sal Bando.

[02:20:05.410 --> 02:20:08.330]
Who played third base from 68 to 76.

[02:20:08.770 --> 02:20:09.670]
I know those great teams.

[02:20:12.710 --> 02:20:16.410]
And they had, who was the great relief pitcher with a handle bar mustache?

[02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:18.050]
Rolly fingers?

[02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.690]
Yeah.

[02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:20.790]
Boy, what a memory, huh?

[02:20:25.690 --> 02:20:27.110]
I wasn't even alive then, yeah.

[02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:29.210]
Well, I can't remember his name.

[02:20:29.370 --> 02:20:30.770]
I just remember he had the handle bar mustache.

[02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:33.150]
And Sal Bando's the brother of Chris Bando.

[02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:36.670]
Which I don't know, I'm clicking on the link.

[02:20:38.610 --> 02:20:39.810]
Chris Bando was acute.

[02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:43.850]
Played from 81 to 88 for Cleveland.

[02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.470]
Nepotism.

[02:20:45.450 --> 02:20:47.150]
It's like a Yogi Berra's kid.

[02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:49.490]
I played shortstop for the Pirates for about five minutes.

[02:20:49.850 --> 02:20:50.650]
What's all was his name?

[02:20:52.690 --> 02:20:53.070]
Bira.

[02:20:55.090 --> 02:20:55.810]
Somebody will know.

[02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:58.750]
Anyway, Fred Sarekhen says, my two cents,

[02:20:58.910 --> 02:21:00.250]
never let Carlos say jokes on here.

[02:21:00.610 --> 02:21:02.210]
So I vote to Schmidt-Kenn email jokes.

[02:21:02.530 --> 02:21:03.010]
You're the best.

[02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.650]
Yes, I am, King.

[02:21:04.430 --> 02:21:04.950]
I am the best.

[02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:10.590]
And I, I, you know, the jokes is at least it's an excuse to get people in the habit of emailing, you know what I mean?

[02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:13.870]
And then maybe someday they'll sense something worthwhile.

[02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:18.210]
I doubt it, but, you know, I got rid of some of the chronic son there already.

[02:21:18.370 --> 02:21:20.170]
Some of the people who are just pests.

[02:21:21.290 --> 02:21:27.510]
One I didn't get rid of is that guy from New Orleans, that Gary guy, who sent me another, another lengthy,

[02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:28.690]
it's in my pile here today.

[02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:29.750]
I'm sure I'll never get to it.

[02:21:30.250 --> 02:21:31.830]
Well, somebody sent me a picture of this.

[02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:33.330]
I don't know who this guy is.

[02:21:34.510 --> 02:21:35.910]
He's laying butt naked.

[02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:40.090]
It looks like on a, on a pure, on a dock.

[02:21:42.030 --> 02:21:44.410]
Yeah, on an American flag, butt naked.

[02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.670]
And I do mean butt.

[02:21:45.810 --> 02:21:46.570]
He's lying on his stomach.

[02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:47.810]
Got shades on.

[02:21:49.250 --> 02:21:53.790]
And, and I remember the, the accompanying comment was this was, I wish I looked like that.

[02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:54.350]
So do I.

[02:21:55.470 --> 02:21:55.830]
God.

[02:21:56.890 --> 02:21:57.250]
Woo!

[02:21:58.770 --> 02:21:59.730]
Look at that.

[02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:02.410]
But I better put that on the bottom of my pile.

[02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:03.310]
It's bad.

[02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:07.710]
And I hate to say this because you're going to, you're going to laugh at me.

[02:22:08.350 --> 02:22:08.630]
Okay?

[02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:10.670]
I've told you this before.

[02:22:11.350 --> 02:22:15.670]
Back in the days when I used to talk about losing weight, which I pretty much say, I just pretty much stay the same now.

[02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:18.470]
189, 190 for a long time.

[02:22:19.050 --> 02:22:22.350]
Not that that's good, but it's better than, you know, oh, salvando.

[02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:23.850]
Kenny gamers, Raymer, gamer.

[02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:26.650]
Since two more.

[02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:28.110]
Look, that's chronic.

[02:22:28.810 --> 02:22:29.250]
Okay?

[02:22:29.370 --> 02:22:30.810]
You asked that's chronic.

[02:22:31.390 --> 02:22:33.010]
Kenny wants to take over the show now.

[02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:37.090]
And he also says salvando.

[02:22:37.530 --> 02:22:39.930]
Oh, and let me say one other thing to about these emails.

[02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:41.930]
They're slow.

[02:22:43.490 --> 02:22:46.290]
You're always raven about this outlook and express how it's real email.

[02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.830]
It's slow.

[02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:49.350]
I don't know what you mean.

[02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:54.410]
In other words, from the time that somebody sends one until the time it shows up here, it's slow.

[02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:57.990]
That's a, it's not the program's fault.

[02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:59.750]
Well, whose fault is it then?

[02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.410]
It's time.

[02:23:00.810 --> 02:23:01.510]
Must be my fault.

[02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:02.390]
Yeah, must be something wrong.

[02:23:02.430 --> 02:23:05.050]
It depends on the server.

[02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:08.210]
There's an yours and all points in between.

[02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:10.210]
Well, let me ask you something.

[02:23:10.350 --> 02:23:16.210]
How come, if I send myself an email like from Yahoo to HaMail to test my, it's there very soon.

[02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:16.630]
Right.

[02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:22.630]
It depends on their server and where they're sending it from and all points in between.

[02:23:23.370 --> 02:23:27.810]
Anyways, as I was working W.I.O.D. as an overnight board op on his last day, Orenery.

[02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:34.090]
People behind the scenes, you probably know who, who he was going to get the accident, trickle down to me, as my shift was ending that night.

[02:23:34.090 --> 02:23:35.370]
I saw Roger in the studio.

[02:23:35.710 --> 02:23:39.890]
Remember how Roger used to clip news articles from Mike from the studio, as Mike did the show from the control room?

[02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:42.090]
Now, that's a radio old schooler, Mike, I mean.

[02:23:42.990 --> 02:23:48.630]
Had no sympathy for Roger, but when I walked into the closet of the producer's room, the tiny room across from Cheryl that had the mailboxes,

[02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:52.390]
I saw Mike sleeping on the couch in the dark, literally, and figuratively.

[02:23:52.430 --> 02:23:53.270]
It was a sad sight.

[02:23:53.770 --> 02:23:57.410]
Knowing what I knew, I thought a tellingman advance, it was going to be his last show.

[02:23:57.790 --> 02:23:59.470]
But, oh, why would you do that to somebody?

[02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:03.790]
But I was sworn to secrecy in a new employee, so I didn't, I regret that.

[02:24:04.270 --> 02:24:08.350]
My dad was a real Rene Rief fan. He told me I should have said something, so I might constate it by properly.

[02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:11.210]
Oh, well, live and learn. No, it would have been, no.

[02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:12.530]
Devastating.

[02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:14.730]
Never retire, can he say it?

[02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:17.750]
Okay, now I'm going to croak on the ear soon, maybe today.

[02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:19.430]
Maybe I'll have another weeny.

[02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:20.770]
Dale Barra.

[02:24:21.490 --> 02:24:23.430]
Dale Barra. The shortstop for the pirates, right?

[02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:26.470]
For Pittsburgh, the Yankees, and Houston from the 70s.

[02:24:26.910 --> 02:24:27.550]
He sucked.

[02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:30.050]
A 77, a 80, 70, lasted that long.

[02:24:30.350 --> 02:24:31.910]
What was his lifetime batting, average, about 1, 85?

[02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:33.610]
For a 236 lifetime.

[02:24:33.970 --> 02:24:35.990]
236, just above the Mario Mendoza line.

[02:24:36.090 --> 02:24:36.710]
That a boy, Dale.

[02:24:37.350 --> 02:24:38.930]
You know what Yogi said? It's over.

[02:24:39.530 --> 02:24:40.530]
263 was his best year.

[02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:42.730]
Well, he was all right.

[02:24:45.290 --> 02:24:47.210]
So how about that, quite a renear history?

[02:24:47.430 --> 02:24:51.210]
Inside radio crap, baby, you don't get that on a, they will run in Paul crap.

[02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:53.430]
And that old rehash garbage.

[02:24:53.930 --> 02:24:55.770]
Oh, now let's see, how many votes did we have?

[02:24:55.770 --> 02:24:58.730]
Did you say this, first poll, that awful poll about the magazine?

[02:25:01.170 --> 02:25:03.410]
Two, I'm sorry, 729.

[02:25:04.090 --> 02:25:05.590]
729 and 280.

[02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:06.810]
281.

[02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:08.170]
281.

[02:25:08.390 --> 02:25:09.890]
281. That's it. That's it.

[02:25:15.130 --> 02:25:16.670]
That's an even 1000 votes.

[02:25:16.810 --> 02:25:18.210]
No, it's a 1010, 1000.

[02:25:18.430 --> 02:25:19.810]
Okay, just relax. 1010.

[02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:21.290]
1010 wins New York.

[02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:26.510]
Well, this, too bad for the young people out there.

[02:25:26.530 --> 02:25:27.810]
Don't know what this business used to be.

[02:25:27.810 --> 02:25:28.810]
This used to be a great business.

[02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:31.010]
Used to be a great medium.

[02:25:31.330 --> 02:25:31.510]
Radio.

[02:25:32.810 --> 02:25:33.650]
Back in the day.

[02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.710]
A happy medium.

[02:25:35.430 --> 02:25:35.710]
Mm-hmm.

[02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:41.550]
Even these memories back from IOD, even, you know, stuff like that about renear getting canned.

[02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:43.490]
Even that brings back some happy memories.

[02:25:44.450 --> 02:25:46.850]
Even Roger Magillin trying to get you can to get your job.

[02:25:48.310 --> 02:25:49.990]
And he didn't want to just do my show.

[02:25:50.050 --> 02:25:51.450]
He wanted to do renear and my show.

[02:25:51.470 --> 02:25:52.470]
He wanted to work eight hours a day.

[02:25:52.570 --> 02:25:52.770]
Correct.

[02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:56.350]
What, what's he doing right now?

[02:25:57.790 --> 02:25:58.290]
I don't know.

[02:26:01.170 --> 02:26:02.090]
He was strange.

[02:26:05.070 --> 02:26:11.670]
I mean, I'm sure you've got some other adjectives to describe him, but my take on him is he was a strange dude.

[02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:13.850]
Got a few Roger stories.

[02:26:13.850 --> 02:26:14.710]
Do you know what?

[02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:16.250]
I got a few Roger stories.

[02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:16.750]
Do you?

[02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:17.770]
That we can tell on the year?

[02:26:18.590 --> 02:26:18.770]
Yeah.

[02:26:18.890 --> 02:26:19.030]
Yeah.

[02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:19.950]
Like what?

[02:26:21.430 --> 02:26:24.510]
Um, as a matter of fact, speaking of them, I'm trying to get my job.

[02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:26.870]
I don't know if you remember the great best of tapes.

[02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:30.290]
There were a huge and, uh, and, uh, it was on the show.

[02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:32.070]
The ones that Joe Bell was doings and for so bad, yeah.

[02:26:32.370 --> 02:26:32.570]
Right.

[02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:37.010]
Well, one of his plans to get my job is to make better best of tapes and the ones that I used to make.

[02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:42.790]
I used to just very simply try to recreate the new Roger, Neil Roger show, but I would take out the phone checks, the time checks.

[02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:43.930]
You're giving the number out.

[02:26:44.090 --> 02:26:51.850]
I would also take out the pauses, the um-a's, and I would just leave in all the good stuff, good calls, good tirades, uh, funny lines, things like that.

[02:26:52.350 --> 02:26:54.750]
My understanding of what a best of is supposed to be.

[02:26:55.270 --> 02:26:56.890]
Roger thought that he had a better idea.

[02:26:57.050 --> 02:27:03.850]
So he would take like a collection of you talking about food, and then he would create this montage of you just you talking about food.

[02:27:04.090 --> 02:27:08.970]
But in between all of the elements, he would have this sweeper, a sound effect, uh, uh,

[02:27:09.630 --> 02:27:10.990]
he would put the zingers in there.

[02:27:11.090 --> 02:27:13.030]
He would add sound effects to what you were doing.

[02:27:13.230 --> 02:27:17.610]
In other words, trying to make it better because he thought that your show could be better with his.

[02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:21.010]
So that's what, uh, that's what his idea was now.

[02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:24.690]
He presented that idea to Gary Bruce, but Gary Bruce never auditioned the tapes.

[02:27:24.970 --> 02:27:31.290]
So on one really happy day for me, Gary said, why don't you play these tapes while Neil is off.

[02:27:31.530 --> 02:27:32.810]
And I said, okay, fine.

[02:27:33.070 --> 02:27:34.330]
And there were the Roger tapes.

[02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:37.250]
Uh, within 10 minutes, Gary Bruce was on the phone saying, what is that?

[02:27:37.430 --> 02:27:42.010]
Yeah, yeah, I kind of, uh, Bell's slide whistle sound effects like you would say a line.

[02:27:42.170 --> 02:27:46.370]
And there'd be, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, really cornball cheesy crap.

[02:27:46.530 --> 02:27:48.910]
Joey Reynolds kind of stuff, film, martial kind of stuff.

[02:27:49.850 --> 02:27:54.130]
And, um, and so I'm playing that and Gary calls and he goes, what is that?

[02:27:55.850 --> 02:27:56.930]
It wasn't Zimfar.

[02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:57.370]
Oh.

[02:27:57.610 --> 02:28:01.270]
And I said, that's the tape you told me to play Gary and he goes, is it all like that?

[02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:04.870]
And I said, uh, everything that I played so far is like that.

[02:28:04.970 --> 02:28:08.770]
And he said, when you go into this night, I said, well, do you have the other tapes ready?

[02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:10.350]
And I said, yeah, I made a whole week's worth Gary.

[02:28:10.350 --> 02:28:11.490]
You told me to play these instead.

[02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:13.130]
And he said, well, go into the break.

[02:28:13.130 --> 02:28:16.530]
And when you come out, put one of the other ones on another one's the ones that I make.

[02:28:16.970 --> 02:28:17.290]
Wow.

[02:28:17.390 --> 02:28:18.030]
Put one of those on.

[02:28:18.150 --> 02:28:19.550]
And then I did so.

[02:28:19.810 --> 02:28:23.030]
And no, within 30 seconds Roger comes flying into the studio.

[02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.530]
What's going on?

[02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:24.090]
What's going on?

[02:28:24.250 --> 02:28:25.830]
I said, Gary called me to put these on.

[02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:26.750]
He did not.

[02:28:26.890 --> 02:28:27.370]
I said, he did.

[02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:29.670]
Um, with wine.

[02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:30.310]
Did he say why?

[02:28:30.430 --> 02:28:31.330]
I said, I don't think he liked it.

[02:28:31.330 --> 02:28:32.010]
Because they sucked.

[02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:33.470]
I don't think he liked those other tapes.

[02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:38.430]
I had any called Gary a bunch of names and stormed out of the, um, the control room within

[02:28:38.430 --> 02:28:38.930]
the next morning.

[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:42.890]
The worries stories almost over the next morning, somebody I forget who it was that was

[02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:49.130]
in the bathroom taken a doose, um, uh, overheard Roger talking to somebody else.

[02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:50.730]
There were two stalls down there, if you recall.

[02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:52.390]
And they were both occupied.

[02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:56.790]
And Roger is in there at the mirror or, you know, first he uses the urinal and then he's

[02:28:56.790 --> 02:29:00.150]
using the sink, washing his hands, talking to somebody else about the event the day before.

[02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:04.490]
And just calling Gary, every name on the book, that, that thing, a, age, doesn't know

[02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:04.530]
what's in the other stall.

[02:29:04.530 --> 02:29:05.730]
How much of Gary was in the other stall?

[02:29:05.950 --> 02:29:06.730]
Gary was in the other stall.

[02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.630]
All right.

[02:29:08.250 --> 02:29:11.770]
So this person gets up and does his business and, uh, and walks out and Roger continues

[02:29:11.770 --> 02:29:14.090]
with this other person, the person that gave me this fire report.

[02:29:14.430 --> 02:29:20.110]
And then, uh, and then that person walks out and then, uh, he, uh, and then Gary walks

[02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:20.730]
out of the stall.

[02:29:21.690 --> 02:29:23.910]
And then, of course, Roger went flying out of the bathroom.

[02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:25.190]
So Gary heard every word that.

[02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:26.450]
All right.

[02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:27.150]
The best.

[02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.650]
All right.

[02:29:27.890 --> 02:29:30.310]
You never did, uh, get to take over your show.

[02:29:30.590 --> 02:29:31.090]
The QAM.

[02:29:31.410 --> 02:29:32.910]
The fourth leader.

[02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:33.890]
The biggest names.

[02:29:34.170 --> 02:29:34.970]
The best talent.

[02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:40.530]
Are you sure the big dogs, your own, we dim morning seven o'clock, with South Florida sports

[02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.870]
always matters.

[02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:44.490]
Sports radio 560 QAM.

[02:29:44.970 --> 02:29:46.610]
The sports leader.

[02:29:47.430 --> 02:29:47.890]
Neil.

[02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:48.950]
God.

[02:29:52.770 --> 02:29:58.470]
I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,

[02:30:12.850 --> 02:30:23.850]
really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,

[02:30:38.370 --> 02:30:43.090]
really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,

[02:30:43.090 --> 02:30:45.050]
I'm going to keep talking because we don't do retakes.

[02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:47.390]
We don't do no retakes at WIO and D.

[02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:51.330]
I remember all, uh, Mr. Eagle, there used to blow his nose.

[02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:54.290]
Right in the middle of a couple of his spots, there, back in the old days.

[02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:55.770]
Oh, here it is.

[02:30:56.170 --> 02:30:56.670]
Here it is.

[02:30:57.150 --> 02:30:57.710]

[02:31:02.410 --> 02:31:03.910]
That's the School of Double Tuck.

[02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:05.510]
Plenty finished.

[02:31:05.710 --> 02:31:05.810]
Farrity.
