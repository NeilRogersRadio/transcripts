[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]
When she realized she raised her criminal crown

[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.620]
God grant Bush as party bells and I

[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.940]
And she kissed me, old and crafty

[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.100]
And she raised her party, think that he's chicken drowsy

[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.780]
And takes her bricks to a table

[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.860]
She says they want no boys

[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.520]
Watch like she's carrying an apple and fall between her thighs and eyes

[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.080]
Party bells and I

[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.240]
And she's had to feed her corn

[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.060]
And let she move a surprise

[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.720]
These wiggles when she's caught

[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.040]
But her voice has already fell tonight

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.160]
Three days before she got Bush and Jen Bush

[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.620]
Not a man she's been looking wild and white

[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.500]
She'll be reaching back

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.460]
And smells just like the magic sauce

[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.780]
I'm a big guy

[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.560]
I'm a boy she resembles on his first night

[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.420]
I'm a bad day with money

[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.080]
That will be nice

[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.920]
Well she hasn't played that for a long time

[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.080]
I ran here just to pop it up

[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.620]
Oh, that's one of life's simple pleasures

[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.980]
I didn't even know it was posed up

[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.880]
So it's on in that pole simple pleasures

[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.260]
Yeah

[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.080]
Popping ears

[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.840]
Finger pop in time, who did that song?

[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.180]
I'll find out

[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.380]
I've got any idea

[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.180]
Finger pop in time, I bet you got it

[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.960]

[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.920]
Hey now, hey now

[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.640]
Finger

[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.800]
I don't know something like that

[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.040]
Finger looking good pop in time

[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.280]
Oh you got to know this one it's all

[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.900]
You know

[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.140]
Yeah, I know

[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.960]
Yeah, it's all in it

[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.460]
I have no idea, it's a heavy checker

[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.280]
Close

[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.140]
Close

[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.220]
When my pickin'

[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.860]
Close

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.280]
Who did it?

[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.980]
Hake Ballard

[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.500]
Oh, Hake Ballard and Midnight

[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.640]
Well he did the twist

[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.940]
He's right, it's what I said, it's heavy checker

[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.880]
That's why I said close

[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.260]
Oh, it was close

[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.200]
Okay, that's not

[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.440]
Did his race speech turn things around Barakabama?

[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.220]
Two new poles seem to indicate yes

[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.220]
Two new poles of Pennsylvania North Carolina

[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.700]
The two biggest remaining states left

[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.380]
were released today and show momentum

[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.020]
toward Barakabama

[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.980]
It released yesterday, excuse me

[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.180]
First Rasmussen now has

[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.080]
a Clinton up 49 to 39 in Pennsylvania

[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.880]
Last week she had a 13 point lead

[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.700]
Now it's only 10

[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.500]
V before was a 15 point lead

[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.520]
so it is diminishing

[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.200]
This is important for a few reasons

[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.440]
First of all, poles last week

[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.480]
seemed to show Clinton expanding her lead in Pennsylvania

[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.800]
probably due to the

[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.340]
Reverend Wright controversy

[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.120]
Obviously that is stopped now

[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.160]
At least according to this poll

[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160]
Obama is gaining even if it's only a slight game

[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.240]
It should be noted that Obama is yet to even start

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000]
major campaigning in Pennsylvania

[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.300]
It's also important because the media expectation

[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.200]
that is building is that she needs to blow

[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.660]
Obama out of Pennsylvania by at least

[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.120]
15 to 20 points

[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.800]
Last week it looked like she might do that

[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.180]
now it don't look so great

[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.820]
The other interesting thing to look at is the

[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.980]
Poles Favourability Survey

[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.600]
Last week 76% of youths were refavorably

[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.240]
This week that number was down to 68%

[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.120]
Maybe they abogged in the lie about

[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.620]
all that sniper fire on the term

[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.940]
Yeah, but the latest one

[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.860]
Yeah, the latest lie

[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.060]
The poll was taken two days ago

[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.880]
Monday, so it's possible

[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.620]
Meanwhile Obama's favorability

[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.520]
was 72% last week and still 71% this week

[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.740]
Considering all the hoopla around the right business

[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.360]
and that it was going to wreck his campaign

[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.040]
to think his favorability rating would have dropped more than just 1%

[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.900]
Following a week of near non-stop coverage about right

[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.560]
Well, the media evidently got a wrong game

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.640]
And in North Carolina

[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.960]
Public policy polling now has got Obama

[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.180]
with a massive lead

[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.120]
55 to 34% 21 point lead

[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.540]
Wow

[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.680]
And last week they released a poll

[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.840]
that had the race at 44% for Obama

[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.640]
So it's a huge shift in just a week

[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.880]
According to the internal polls the main reason for the shift

[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.960]
is white voters

[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.820]
Last week swallowing lead among white voters in North Carolina

[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.140]
56 to 30%

[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.320]
Now this week that lead is down to 47 to 40%

[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.560]
Most obvious reason in the shift is Obama's

[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.640]
praised speech on race

[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.260]
Regardless of what she says

[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.760]
From now until then

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.080]
Clinton will have a near impossible time convincing anybody

[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.180]
She's got any kind of a shot

[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.500]
if she loses North Carolina by more than 10 points

[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.800]
She's going to get her ASCICT in North Carolina

[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.900]
Nothing will be finer than to kick her ass in North Carolina

[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.460]
Five eyes swallowing

[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.240]
Don't let the door hit you in the fat ass on the way out

[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.320]
Go back to Chappacua

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.440]
We're going back to Albany

[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.240]
We're ever going to hang it in now

[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.060]
Go back to Washington

[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.180]
When Nero George talks about religion

[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.220]
This is yesterday's poll

[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.100]
which we almost have in the thousands of votes already Chris

[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.560]
Which means we're going to change it real fast

[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.200]
We've got tomorrow's poll on there already

[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.580]
Okay

[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.640]
Thanks to Brandon

[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.780]
Now maybe you don't like tomorrow

[00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.780]
Do you want me to tell you tomorrow's poll before we do this one?

[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.680]
Why not?

[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.380]
What part of the newspaper do you always read?

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.920]
Okay

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.160]
I hope that

[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.820]
I hope none is one of the options

[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.500]
Yes, all right

[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.020]
I don't read newspapers on air cross reposal

[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.880]
I don't judge local state antelope

[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.380]
Front-to-fade world sports business

[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.800]
Comics horoscope, obituaries, classifiers

[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.940]
and coupons

[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.660]
I'm one of those great coupons

[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.740]
If I find one of them about them before I kick it out of my stall

[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.780]
What the newspaper?

[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.160]
Yeah

[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.900]
Well of course look at what you've got to choose from

[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.900]
You've got the herald and the scum sentle

[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.560]
Well dirty my fingertips with either one of those rags

[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.060]
Because we don't have the Hollywood Suntaler for you anymore

[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.740]
That's too bad

[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.140]
Well I think when Thor to really start going in the crapper is when all the dog prikes close down

[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.880]
Well I don't think they close down

[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.660]
But they started nobody

[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.260]
People stop going there

[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.640]
Hey everybody go to the dog track

[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.540]
Okay let's bring South Florida back to life

[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.540]
I'd rather go to the horse track

[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.740]
But you're going to be there on Friday

[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.700]
But I'm pretty excited

[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.060]
And Jordan is going to be back in Gillespie

[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.240]
He's like a regular there now

[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.900]
I'm going to be

[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.040]
And I didn't tell you before the show today I want a thousand bucks in woodmine

[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.560]
I'm going to be there

[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.180]
That's the good news

[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.580]
The bad news is I got off a machine that paid three grand

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.080]
So how would you feel about that?

[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.060]
Whatever I would count my bloodsings anyway

[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.780]
I just didn't have a good feeling about that machine

[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.580]
Because it paid big and in fact that's a machine I won on Sunday

[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.860]
And usually they don't stay hot that long

[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.360]
Of course there's no such thing as a hot machine

[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.420]
You know all those tips is that right those stupid books like the one you want to send me

[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.720]
But never leave a hot machine

[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.720]
But anyway so the guy got on there and he got a spin for a thousand followed up almost immediately

[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.260]
By two grand on the line

[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.840]
Which is a clever way to computer paying out three grand

[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.240]
So you're playing against the computer and these idiots who don't understand that

[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.380]
You know you can bang on the wheel, you can bang on the machine, you can break the glass

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.940]
Which several people have done that

[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.380]
Because they get so frustrated and they slam the glass and they break the glass

[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.880]
And then the woodmine polis come and they take them away in handcuffs

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.020]
But anyway

[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.820]
When Neil or George talks about religion we have not 165 votes

[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.660]
And this is not very uplifting compared to the time we did it years ago

[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.580]
I mean we're talking some ornary people out there

[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.600]
And I guess maybe they think by casting the votes like that they're going to stop us from doing it and other not

[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.780]
I love it 442

[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.100]
It's interesting 242

[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.520]
You had those two together you got over 80%

[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.780]
I turned it off 135, 13, 28% turned it off when we talked religion

[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.520]
You believe that?

[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.220]
No

[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.240]
And it pisses me off 55, 5.6% out of 9.74

[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.980]
We'll get to a thousand and then we'll uh, Schmidt can't

What are you talking about?

[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.100]
That's the discussion that we have before the show is that we don't know exactly when we're going to do that

[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.340]
And I'm sure we'll find out

[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.260]
I didn't do the joys this morning

[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.640]
No because it was a two-way conversation so if you were doing the joys you must have taken that microphone with you

[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.020]

[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.200]

[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.160]
Race track in Casino and Hellendale

[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.920]

[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.020]

It's in Hellendale baby we're all the old parts so play a little poker maybe hit the slots for a big jackpot

[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.700]
Oh speaker that some of some bag won 9 million dollars on the mega bucks

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.420]
Not a wood buy but a casino ramma up in Berry

[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.220]
In ramma they call it

[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.680]

But anyway some of the bitch out of some lady won 9 million dollars on it

[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.960]
I noticed because they have it at all the Ontario casinos it's one of those where they have it at all the places

[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.440]
You know and it's a it's just keeps going up and up and up and unless somebody wins the jackpot keeps increasing

[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.240]
And I've noticed the wood buy was like 8.7 8.8 then I stop paying attention

[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.760]
I don't play that because it doesn't pay worth of crap unless you have the jackpot

[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.060]
Which is like winning the lottery

[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.560]

Artutti, you know, just draw it about that

[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.300]
Their playoff hopes are up in the smoke just like the make believes here

[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.220]
They're pounded by a Boston 62 right here at the air candidates

[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.080]
They're scared scared can't at the center

[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.640]
We got our thousand votes yet or what so I want to change that poll and get off of this stuff

[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.020]
One more one more what one more vote

[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:56.980]
Well, let me refresh it 999 the next person will be the thousandth vote on the poll and we'll win a big prize

[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.280]
Rock a big pro like a pencil

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.080]
We're an eraser on it no less can we afford to win?

[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.200]
I don't know a lot of cutbacks here at QAM

[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.400]
Lot of cutbacks including Chris's job pretty soon. It's been a lot of fun. We've enjoyed having it

[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:21.360]
Right and that was done all seven points what I said well, thank you you're not going anywhere the kind of money that you're a pity cash more than covers your salary

[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.920]
Yep, we're still stuck at 999 they're doing that just to piss me off you do know that all those good religion is out there

[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.760]
Come on somebody out there can cast another vote or don't we have a thousand people listening probably not

[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.980]
We used to have nobody wants the pencil there we go a thousand

[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.720]
We got it see all right

[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.000]
Here's the final total but nearer George talk about religion

[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.680]
I love it for bit 49 it's interesting 355 I turn it off 139 13.9% turned off is anybody believe them?

[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.140]
No lion getchkeys no and it pisses me off 57 5.5

[00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:03.300]
5.7% out of a thousand votes now I just go over here and I click this and I click that I click back to here and look at that

[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:10.280]
Pull has changed George like magic whoo you do that what part of the newspaper do you always read

[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.880]
Well, I'll save the sports section

[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.160]
I'm not saying that's just because we're on this station, but I mean I always read this sports section

[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:24.460]
I usually read the front page in the editorial and stuff like that let us the editor do we put that on there by the way?

[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:31.760]
editorial page I'm looking I don't see it no but I added on there to do it

[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:37.280]
Because generally that's what I do I read the sports section I'll read the front page and then the editorial page letters to the editor

[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.160]
A column stuff like that and then I I Schmidt can't although at least we got some real newspapers here to them

[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.020]
The star and well the star and the global mail and then the sun which is a right wing tabloid and then of course the national post

[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:54.600]
Which is not tabloid but further right wing then you can't even imagine the national post day real right wing

[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.760]
Tom Andrews and the hoving in post right now do we give that the

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.660]
Yeah, yeah, we did well. I'm just checking just to make sure oh yeah, yeah, you're kidding me you got five listeners

[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.120]
It could have been a used bandaid

[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:15.000]
Okay, anybody call the number 800 I want to use bandaid plus soaked bandaid from my knee

[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.360]
Oh, you got a bad knee no, I just made that up

[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:27.480]
Look at that we got some votes on the new pool that's good but I'll tell you we're really kicking ass our own and footies still doing must wear you find the best burger in town

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.860]
Oh brother, it's just

[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:36.000]
It's one thing to have when I've always said in this business see there some people are scared of competition because they have no

[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.460]
self-confidence and usually with good reason you know like Joey but I've always said that good

[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.380]
Competition makes you better. It's good good to have good and we have horrible. Oh, we got a lot of ass

[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.100]
Noon, you know, we got that tub of crap but footy

[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.840]
Can't take them up with something better over there over there than that than footsie tootsie putsy wouldsy

[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.400]
Oh, oh god. I think even noodles would be better than that

[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.540]
Maybe lotion kugel with raisins hmm

[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:14.920]
Time Andrews and having imposed rights 4,000 and counting yesterday's coding of the 4,000th American soldier in Iraq was the latest grim maker in the Bush administration's

[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:21.260]
disastrous war and occupation of Iraq coming just days after the tragic passing of the fifth anniversary of the American invasion

[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:28.460]
Both occurred as the hollow claims by the Bush administration that it's so-called military surge is working became even more obviously absurd

[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:35.940]
For months it's been painfully clear that the goal of the surge political reconciliation that a decline in violence was to make possible had totally failed

[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.320]
Now even the reduction of violence promoted daily by Bush and the Iraq war apologist lack credibility

[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.920]
Up to now the misleading claim of a decline in violence and a record only be made by comparing the numbers killed and wounded

[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:53.320]
The last years catastrophically high levels kind of like standing in a violent category 3 hurricane and claiming that it's a beautiful day comparing to a category 5

[00:20:53.320 --> 00:21:00.920]
Now even that claim can no longer hold water the so-called decline in the number of violent tax stop last November and for weeks the level of violence has spiked significantly up

[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.300]
Or again

[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:07.500]
Meanwhile the people of Iraq continue to pass their own cataclysmic milestones for more than a hundred thousand who've been killed

[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.480]
Well over four million turned into a few years

[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.440]
There's no even sight for the carnage

[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:19.920]
No sign that the US back government will be willing to compromise with its rivals and absolutely no hope that the wishes of the majority of Iraqis that American forces be removed from their country will be taken seriously

[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:27.340]
Next month the President will ask Congress to pass another tragic milestone by handing over a hundred billion dollars more dollars for the military occupation

[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.080]
That'll be the latest installment of what Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz

[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.260]
Calculates will be a three trillion dollar price tag for American taxpayers

[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:43.420]
Washington pundits predict that Democratic control Congress will facilitate this milestone by once again rolling over and handing the president whatever he wants

[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:50.300]
But this is one milestone that we need not reach. That's why the 40 member win without war coalition mark the fifth anniversary of the war last week

[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.440]
By circulating open letter to Congress imporing it to reverse course

[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.560]
Adverse to Congressman Jack Murthorck, chairman of the House of Appropriation Subcommittee on Defense

[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.900]
It calls on Congress to stop funding the war

[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:06.860]
Support a diplomatic offensive stop funding the construction of permanent military bases in Iraq and military contractors and

[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:14.080]
Refuse to fund any permanent security agreement between President Bush and Iraqi President Maliki unless first approved by Congress and the Iraqi Parliament

[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.760]
The only acceptable milestone will be the removal of the final US soldier from Iraqi sword

[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.280]
I

[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.680]
Was in my fun making my car run but I didn't get real far

[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:48.000]
I got a crummy deal fake these four wheels maxing out my car can't drive around to the prosco

[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.540]
Down I thought it could but I was wrong

[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.060]
With their pump and got my wallet trinketing so I stopped here at exon

[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.820]
And I said exon is was making me poor makes me I read that been out my cash flow

[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.340]
It makes me grow when my tax bill

[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.340]
Cuz it ain't up the last of my go

[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.400]
Exon is providing gas your home paycheck only build up a half-day

[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.340]
It's all out of control over

[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.620]
I

[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.480]
Don't raise it again

[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:34.720]
Don't raise it again or you're gonna want to list the 1033 to 560 WDQ. I am so any who we have 52 votes on the new pool

[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.440]
Archer thrilled archer said it actually

[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.560]
Super

[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.800]
What part of the newspaper you always read comics nine

[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.940]
Comics yeah, do you read the comics? I voted for I don't read newspapers

[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:55.580]
Oh, I don't read the comics ever. I haven't read the comics in years. I guess I don't mean sometimes there are political cartoons and comics that are already

[00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:02.420]
Sports eight. I don't read newspapers seven local seven front page six editorial page three obituary's two

[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:05.400]
Yeah, that's a nice hobby. Let's see who died

[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.460]
And then you get you know when you finish reading you think well, I'm still alive, you know

[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.040]
And then about five minutes later. Oh massive heart attack. You're dead

[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.960]
Just because you're so evil and insensitive world section two dear Abby one coupons one

[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.780]
Classifies one business one national one crossword tourist gop and stayed none

[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.060]
Yeah

Crosswords just find the guy one. Oh, okay. Oh wait until we're okay. What who are you gonna wait until they got a vote?

[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:47.020]
No, I just I just checked because I'm a little bit behind here. There's three more hosts on the other thing after I've printed this thing out

[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.960]
I'll hang on a second the phone's ring all right

[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.200]
And here I don't have any music you know

[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.780]
By the way, we're gonna have a uh a seminar

[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.800]
Hope it'll be um

[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.280]
It's all being arranged case these slow and come in here

[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.080]
On handicapping how to bet on the horses seminar next but right there in uh in our face at our table hopefully

[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.720]
Is she can point to the board and explain what things mean and

[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.000]
Show me how to do a wheel

[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:19.260]
Oh, I almost found wrong. Yeah, I should be up to get being rude

[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.580]
That the bitch. I mean the lady from the driving school is driving me nuts

[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.700]
You like the drive? No, it's not for me. It's for Paco obviously

[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.960]
First she called me on my on my black bar and my cell phone

[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.900]
And then after I finished talking now she calls on the other number because I had been trying to call her yesterday

[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.200]
We're answering their phones. So I guess it left a you know it left the numbers

[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.760]
Go away Rosanna or whatever go back to uh

[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.660]
Mexico she actually is from Mexico and ironic

[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.220]
Okay appropriate. Yeah, very appropriate

[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.900]
American Airlines the world's largest carrier canceled 200 flights to rein specced wiring and Boeing MD 80s after

[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.800]
The federal regulators raised questions during a maintenance audit

[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.800]
I don't know about you of course you don't fly you don't go anywhere because you're a slumber. You don't have any money

[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:09.580]
I

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.600]
Can't even remember the last time I flew on American Airlines. That's how many years ago it's been

[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.260]
I don't like American Airlines especially in Miami

[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:25.960]
The airport in Miami the terminal is just always congested in fact the rest of the airport can be empty

[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.260]
And of course people will say well that's because everybody flies American ho ho ho

[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.660]
Well good for them. I don't want

[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:41.160]
About 50 departures each were canceled and Americans hubs a Dallas for worth in Chicago or here international airports named of course after the great legendary Francis

[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:41.700]
Oh here

[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.220]
One flight from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale Hollywood was canceled. No flights were canceled at Miami International

[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.460]
Or it's always chaos and psychosis at American Airlines

[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:58.500]
The cancelations represent about 9% of their flights today Americans checking whether a bundle of wires was installed and secured

[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:05.620]
According to a FAA's administration directive a mercant spokesman Tim Wagner said an emailed statement the spokesman

[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:12.140]
It's the second time in a week that Americans had a cancel flights as the FAA can have special maintenance audits the U.S. Airlines

[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:17.940]
Carriers have come under increased scrutiny since March 6th when the agency proposed a 10.2 million dollar fine against

[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.140]
Southwest airlines for flying 46 jets without required fuselage inspections

[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.280]
Many inspections have already been completed the aircraft are currently in service Wagner

[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.660]
Say we're in the process of completing the inspections on the main air planes will return them to service on a rolling basis throughout the day

[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:39.740]
Following me proposed flying against Southwest the FAA said it would check records in more than 100 airlines by March 28th

[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.860]
Which sounds like what day is that Friday?

[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.400]
By Friday to see how they complied with a sample of 10 agency directives

[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.920]
And if they don't comply they're going to shoot all their planes out of the sky just to teach a militant don't do it again

[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.840]
Is it a good idea?

[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.880]
Yeah, shoot them all down

[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.860]
Unless it's the one that I'm on Friday that would not be a good idea

[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.280]
Well go ahead and do it anyway

[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.840]
Okay, so we gave away that gift certificate right? Yes, to clear that

[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:12.760]
And then between noon and one dollomy forget we got that panther ticket hit we got a panther hit ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket

[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.440]
Is anybody ever sent anything about that or explain why we do that stupid thing in there?

[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:22.840]
You look let's let's let's roll play this like I go and talk to somebody about something like the stream or why we're doing something

[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.920]
All right, and their response is who are you?

[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.960]
Why are you talking to me? You're just a dingleberry on Neils ass. What does it have to do with sports?

[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.040]
Why are you even bothering me anything we say really?

[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.220]
Any questions. It's like why we even bothering them

[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.260]
And they're world and how they do more sirens coming by the way

[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.740]
Maybe it's a lady from the odd driving school

[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.980]
I should have told her I should have said speak it in English bitch

[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.760]
That's what I should have said and don't call her again. Don't bug me

[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.960]
Hear that oh yeah

[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.900]
It just goes on and on and you know

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:02.860]
I'm not one of those people who's nosy, but I just wonder are these like dead people or they people have just got hit big car wreck somewhere or you know

[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.900]
Curiosity killed the cat

[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:12.300]
That's why WKAT is playing Spanish or Haitian melodies now whatever the plan that station's still on the year

[00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:19.070]
You guys can mean yeah, I listened to as much local radio as I read local newspapers. I don't listen to radio

[00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.250]
I do listen to six eighty news though when I'm driving a woodbinding back. I told you that

[00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.670]
I learned to say CDs. I don't know what the station man

[00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:31.190]
And you find out where the traffic is and what's going on over here? I'd like sure and I'm a gardener and over here and blah blah

[00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:32.530]
It's good

[00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:39.110]
And actually if people sound like they belong on the air like real broadcasters is opposed to some of the say are like

[00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:44.770]
Like that for example you don't hear that in like a real professional market, which is is not a course

[00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:50.290]
But nevertheless Gary Hart is pissed off. He said the media is hyping democratic candidates negatives

[00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:54.870]
former senator Gary Hart's criticizing the sensationistic tendencies of the media

[00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.990]
In the 2008 democratic dominating process appearing on CNN's newsroom

[00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:05.050]
The one time Democratic presidential contender said the media plays a role in all this and when producers are networks

[00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.990]
Decide to recycle charge after charge after charge and go to the other campaign and ask for responses

[00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.650]
That's what you're going to see on television

[00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.210]
Hard as a porter of Barack Obama continued

[00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.510]
I don't mean to point the finger

[00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:22.370]
But it's not as if the media plays no role here if the media focuses on budget deficits on casualties in Iraq and elsewhere on the failures of Bush economics

[00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.190]
But I think the voters will tune in

[00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.810]
The Colorado Democratic who halted his own run for the White House in 87 after intense media scrutiny of alleged

[00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:36.210]
extramarital fair Donna Rice rude the constant news focus on videos a former Obama pastor Reverend Jeremiah Wright

[00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:43.290]
If you see nothing but Reverend Wright hour after hour day after day and the Obama campaigns asked to be spotted that endlessly

[00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:50.510]
That's the news said Hart adding that such coverage makes it very very difficult for candidates to be focused on what's really important for this country's future

[00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:52.310]
biggest name

[00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:54.930]
New York's neurologist

[00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.090]
4560 QAM

[00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.870]
The fourth leader

[00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.190]
Have a heart or a liver?

[00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.770]
No

[00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:06.830]
You failed

[00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.510]

[00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.090]

Don't get tired

[00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.170]
Keep on home by and spend all of it

[00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.510]
Just don't put it in the bank

[00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.390]
Don't get keep on home by and spend all of it

[00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:18.610]
R e b a g e

[00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.270]
Don't put it in the bank

[00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.030]
Send us man we can put it to good use

[00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.250]
I can take it to woodbine and triple it for you this afternoon

[00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.170]
1046 14 before 11 at 560 WQM

[00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.770]
The jerk show come up into this afternoon

[00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.130]
A lot of rumors about that show about the future of it

[00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.210]
Or the fact that it doesn't have one but nevertheless

[00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:35.810]
We want to go into that do we?

[00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:36.310]
I don't care

[00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.670]
Which is a backhanded way of saying oh yeah

[00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.930]
Let's wrap it up and ask again

[00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.190]
You rip him you'll be on Friday

[00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:45.690]
From the other's a difference

[00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.410]
Me acknowledging things that are going on

[00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:48.850]
Has nothing to do with my opinion of it

[00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.250]
It doesn't matter what they stick on in the afternoon

[00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:50.950]
It's going to fail

[00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.090]
Now why would you say that?

[00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.630]
Because they'll be the ones losing

[00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.330]
On a lot of time we were doing we were kicking ass all the way to the end

[00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.930]
Because Joe and Clarence will be the ones deciding what will be on in the end

[00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.170]
Oh so therefore well that's a good point

[00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:01.610]
Therefore it will fail

[00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.430]
I never thought about that

[00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.130]
George W. Bush is not stupid John Stuart told a crowd in 2005 he invaded Iraq

[00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.510]
They didn't have a weapons of mass destruction or ties to al-Qaeda

[00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.830]
But Iran does so he's only one letter off and that should he should be credited

[00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.770]
The agency that brought you over scintelligence on the Iraq war

[00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:23.710]
A defense intelligence agency operative who knew that a key US intelligence source was unreliable

[00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:28.290]
Said in on meetings within secretary state colon pal when he appropriated claims about mobile Iraqi weapons

[00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:29.310]
Lives into his portfolio

[00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.650]
Now brings you the Iran that is actually Iraq

[00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:36.990]
In a brief official history of their own agency posted on their website the DIA

[00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.670]
Confused Iran and Iraq the defense intelligence agency

[00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.910]
Noting world crises in the 80s

[00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:48.950]
The agencies report sites in Israeli F-16 raid to destroy an Iranian nuclear reactor

[00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.170]
The discrepancy was first caught by the Federation of American scientists Steven actor good

[00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.410]
Who writes the blog secrecy news

[00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.650]
In fact Israel attacked an Iraqi nuclear reactor

[00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:03.230]
Osirac in 1981 Israel hasn't attacked Iranian nuclear sites or released not yet

[00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:08.090]
The description appears to match Israel's raid on Iraq's Osirac nuclear reactor 81 is really

[00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.070]
Scalar Gideon Ramez told actor good on his blog

[00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:16.190]
Today's preoccupation with Iran's nuclear program seems to have been projected on the events of 27 years ago

[00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.950]
If that indeed is the case I'd recommend a correction he added

[00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:23.070]
The defense intelligence agency which offered the report couldn't do each for comment

[00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.590]
The DIA isn't the only one who's made ghost comments about Iran recently

[00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:31.250]
On an official visit to the Middle East that was supposed to highlight his knowledge in foreign affairs

[00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.170]
Senator John McCain told reporters

[00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.110]
It's common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al-Qaeda is going back into Iran

[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:39.970]
And receiving training and are coming back into Iraq that's well known

[00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:42.970]
Press by reporters as Julie Berman was whispering into Osir

[00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:46.630]
Who knew there were no uh that al-Qaeda was being trained in Iraq McCain continued

[00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.770]
We continue to be concerned about the Iranians taking al-Qaeda into Iran

[00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.730]
And training them and sending them back he said only after fellow senator

[00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:57.510]
Julie Berman who was traveling with him whispered into Osir did McCain correct himself

[00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.850]
I'm sorry the Iranians are training extremists not al-Qaeda not al-Qaeda

[00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:07.310]
I'm sorry McCain said and sorry we were very sorry that you're the best that one of the two major parties can come up with

[00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.670]
A dottering old fool like you who never made a war they didn't like

[00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.670]
Who wants four more years or maybe eight more years of Bush uh crap

[00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.350]
With tax cuts for the rich and of course with the more and more wars

[00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.710]
There's always going to be a lot of words when there always be war especially if John McCain

[00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.210]
It's going to be a say about it

[00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.630]
He's pissed off about those years as POW don't think he took it lightly you know

[00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.850]
He's pissed off and so he's going to go out and kill some people

[00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:40.330]
Not necessarily uh you know enemies but just some people in general just to make him feel better

[00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.830]
Doesn't make you feel better if you could go kill some people

[00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.270]
Yeah I got a list

[00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.550]
115 votes on the pool and I don't think we're picking on jerks again

[00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.230]
Huh what means nothing to me

[00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.390]
It's out of stories about him in the shortening about

[00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:59.090]
See any go once again your bad judgment about people you just you know no no no bad

[00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.370]
Yeah, it's like to make things up

[00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.430]
I said that he seemed like a really good guy and I don't uh change that opinion

[00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.830]
He's uh you know seem very nice to me. What does that have to do with his performance on the air?

[00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:14.170]
Now just yesterday uh the day or maybe Monday you were saying that um

[00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.730]
There are people saying that he's not a nice guy just this morning

[00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.130]
Just as much as they but there are people who say that he's not

[00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.650]
He's only ever been nice to me. Let's not pick on the jerks because after all we got

[00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.470]
We got to uh we'll be a part of the club can't wait to be part of the team

[00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.190]
Give me the ball. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. You know that crap

[00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:38.670]

National news one and state news none who wants to know about what's going on in Florida?

[00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:09.630]
Anyway, yeah, those people read the obituary so the same ones whose idea of a fun vacation is taking a tour of all the concentration camps

[00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:14.850]
Ooh, Dacau and Bergen Balson. They're so serious. You know they love those names right wax figurines

[00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:19.350]
Lime shades. Oh, that was bad. I can't believe you said that

[00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.610]
What are they? Tell somebody you are

[00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:25.690]
No, it's got nothing to do with that. It's got to do with the fact that why why be morbid? Why do you have to be morbid?

[00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.450]
Well, what's the point of going to see it? Why agree? No, we know what happened

[00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.650]
We read about it. It's like it's like going to the to the Coliseum in Rome uh to

[00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:39.170]
And to know look at all the Christians that killed here and fed to the lion, you know, you don't have to see that

[00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.370]
You go there to see the uh

[00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:43.010]
the edifice

[00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:44.850]
Yes

[00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.170]
Am I right? Right. Remember that movie with the

[00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.010]
Moses name Richard Burton edifice Rex. Yep

[00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:56.270]
Chelsea Clinton has failed a lot of questions as she campaigns for his mother's or mother's presidential bid

[00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:04.110]
But yesterday the former first daughter faced an especially awkward query for the first time a query for she looks man. She is so

[00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:10.230]
meous. I mean we can't all be beautiful. I sure is howl know that but do something for crying out loud

[00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:15.690]
The hair do something with that hair. That's the biggest picture. She's doing all she can. No, she's not

[00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:21.310]
Why do you say that? I don't think it helps. She's doing all she can but it's you don't only do so much

[00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.450]
She's doing all she can to look gruesome. That's what she's doing. Have you seen her lately?

[00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.950]
Yes, because it wasn't nearly as roomous a mission used to

[00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.950]
Well

[00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.250]
Since he was a little girl she grew some yeah

[00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.810]
campaign

[00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:41.230]
Get Butler College and Indianapolis and audience member asked the 28 year old whether the Monica Lewinsky scandal had damaged your mother's reputation

[00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:46.970]
Wow, you're the first person actually has ever asked me that question. I don't know maybe 70 college campus. I've been to

[00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:53.050]
I don't think that's any of your business she responded appearing a bit surprised by the question the crowd immediately cheered loudly at the response

[00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.350]
Yeah, you go Chelsea and got are you ugly?

[00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.910]
It was supposed to be the last question of the event but Chelsea Clinton decided to take one more saying

[00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:02.750]
I don't think that should be the last question

[00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:09.930]
Maybe the last question should have been after that is daddy still screwing around and his mommy really a bull bike

[00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.490]
Though she's faced and wear a public license. She was a girl

[00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:19.490]
Chelsea Clinton's contender with renewed press coverage after taking on a more prominent role in her mother's campaign earlier this year

[00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:25.450]
The Monica Lewinsky scandal made a brief return to the news last week when newly released White House schedules indicated

[00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.670]
Hillary Clinton was likely in the White House

[00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:32.530]
During at least six before the instances of encounters between her husband and the former White House intern

[00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.230]
She was in the house

[00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:39.750]
Which he didn't know what was going on in the house that speaks real well for ability to be like the guardian of our

[00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:44.130]
National security doesn't it she can't even secure what's going on inside that then building

[00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:50.050]
For husbands down there on on her hands and knees or Monica's on her everybody's on their hands and knees

[00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.410]
They're trying to send a blue dress out to the dry cleaner. So let's be alive

[00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:59.590]
Took those pants to the direction is just they will see what happens. Oh, okay. I was gonna say was there a verdict that you on

[00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.350]

to bring the newspaper on Sunday morning

[00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:42.610]

[00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:33.910]
Oh, she looks like intern Shannon.

[00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:34.890]
Like it could be a princess.

[00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:37.450]
She looks a little bit like her.

[00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:39.390]
Intern Shannon looked exactly like that.

[00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:40.030]

[00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:42.590]
Like that could be your sister.

[00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.910]
Matter of fact, Shannon looks better.

[00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.030]

He wants to stay here.

[00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:22.970]
But his own party wants him to go away.

[00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:27.030]
The minute his ride rides,

[00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.090]

This could make for one odd family reunions is here Barack Obama's a distant cousin of actor Brad Pitt and

[00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:52.450]
Swelry is related to Pitt's girlfriend Angelina Jolie

[00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:58.670]
Is she his girlfriend? I think that's what they're called

[00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:05.750]
They're not married. I don't know who's he married to now? Is he married to her? Is he married to I

[00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:12.310]
Think they're married or something. Oh, well says here girlfriend. Maybe to the world what differences and make I mean

[00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:17.830]
You know what society today. It's like nobody's married everybody just screwing everything and making babies. That's right

[00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:25.290]
Researchers at the New England historic genealogical society found some remarkable family connections for the three presidential candidates

[00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:27.990]
Both Obama and Clinton and even insane McCain

[00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:34.830]
Clinton who was a French Canadian descent on their mother's side. I know it. I knew there was something there

[00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:40.730]

Vosha's cousins the can is the sixth cousin of first lady Laura Bush

[00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:56.730]
You think with all that singing talent the family she'd be able to carry a tune Clinton senior advisor

[00:57:56.730 --> 00:58:00.470]
Philip Reyn said but now it makes much more sense how she snagged a Grammy

[00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:06.530]
Clinton won for the best book in word Grammy in 97 for it takes a village of Obama also want to Grammy in that category

[00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:11.470]
This year for the audio version of his book the audacity of hope we the thoughts on reclaiming the American dream

[00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:17.770]
Genealogist Christopher Child said oh, what a used to be one of my favorite places in the world was childs on

[00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:21.310]
Boyleston Street in Boston where you get a great banana split. Oh

[00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:26.430]

Chelsea Chelsea

[00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:41.830]
Now it's just ugly now it's just ugly right stringy. I had to step in the right there money

[00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:45.930]
She can't afford to go get a do maybe in another 10 years. She'll go with a little bit human

[00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:51.970]
Genealogist Christopher Child said the while the candidates often focus on 20 our differences between them

[00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:54.790]
Their ancestry shows they're more alike than they think

[00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:59.550]
It shows a lot of different people can be related people you wouldn't necessarily expect child said

[00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:03.530]
Obama's got a prolific presidential image that features

[00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:10.010]

Other Obama cousins include Dick Cheney British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and Civil War General Robert E. Lee

[00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:27.330]
Obama often jokes about his cousin Cheney at campaign appearances his kinships are across the political spectrum child said

[00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:33.330]
Child to spent the last few years tracing the candidates genealogy along with senior research scholar Gary Boyd Roberts

[00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:36.790]

Camilla Parker Bowles wife and Prince Charles. Oh my God talk about a donkey puts wow

[00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:52.850]
This start is the puzzle starting to take shape now for you. Uh-huh all the pieces are started to fit together

[00:59:53.850 --> 01:00:00.070]
McKinsey ancestry was more difficult to trace because records on his relatives were not as complete as records for the families of Obama and Clinton

[01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:06.830]
Child said a bomb on president Bush our 10th cousins once removed linked by Samuel Henkley of Cape Cod who died in

What's going to play doing a game show on St. Patrick's Day, but we missed the opportunity

[01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:42.550]
We could play different pieces of Irish music and play real or good. I can't I don't know we need

[01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:47.610]
I've got a power center, but I'm sure it's on our community that there's got to be delivery service there in Toronto for a big shot

[01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:50.710]
Why for a big shot like you bring you stuff right there?

[01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:53.450]
Listen, I don't need any more

[01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:55.490]

More food you're right anymore armed a more fat the walking to the store for the food is the only way I do what I wait on

[01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:07.230]
The plots right there. I'm not gonna do it. Don't was not good. It was the highest I've waited years

I have again on the scale every day

[01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:12.450]
You get on your feet every day

[01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:17.050]
Pit and Obama our ninth cousins linked by Edward Hickman who died in Virginia in 1769

[01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:22.190]
Then a lot both a spokesman for the Obama campaign to climb a comment on the center's ancestry

[01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:28.670]
Clinton and Jolie our ninth cousins twice removed both related to Gene Cusson who died in St. Sulpice Quebec in 1718

St. Sulpice

[01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:40.590]
It's a frog thing you know the New England historic genealogical society found in 1845 is the oldest and largest

[01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:46.610]
Non-profit genealogical organization in the country. Maybe I'll heat up that bratwurst in there. How's that sound?

[01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:49.630]
All right, maybe I'll put it on the flavor wave sure

[01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:55.070]
Well, no, it's not I mean I'm sure that they're pre-cooked, you know, but no, but still you didn't want to cold brats

[01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:58.810]
It's a white weeny one now. You can't eat cold brats. Oh, yeah

[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:02.230]
Man just a thought of that makes me want to gag

[01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:09.250]
So I would be like taking those pants to the cleaner which Chris in the Zach especially Zach is a slob, okay

[01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:16.290]
He really got guy, but it's wrong with that though. I mean fact people were all slobbed. He's a real slob

[01:02:16.290 --> 01:02:17.690]
Oh, just wrap it up in some

[01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:22.650]
You know a paper and a plastic bag from publics and taking the cleaner and pop it down on the account

[01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:25.830]
Right and say I was speaking a plopping down by the way to the open

[01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:34.770]
That's gonna be really interesting this afternoon when I pick up my laundry from the a dry cleaning Chinese lady across the street

[01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.370]
Well, you tipper nice right

[01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:41.550]

Yeah, you tip the dry cleaning lady. I haven't been to the dry cleaners in a long time. Yeah, there you go

[01:02:55.810 --> 01:03:01.730]
A guy like you can't afford to be going to no dry cleaners right and that's the least that that wife of yours can be doing is doing all her clothes

[01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:05.470]
You know it's the least but nevertheless she don't she doesn't who doesn't have it once a while

I'm not gonna give her a she charges an arm and a leg. It's already expensive enough

[01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:32.330]
What are you talking about what's a buck or two? I'm gonna tip her

[01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:36.850]
I tip the a drinks people at woodbind about the only or two. They every time they bring me a dive coke

Every time they love me. Mm-hmm. They keep them so does come and manage just and I'm right

[01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:45.890]
I'll put my coat on this here and run into the tea room P in and P in and P in my brain

[01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:47.610]
So which is good for a bottle yet is?

You don't believe me. I've seen plenty of people at woodbind that maybe I'll try the other one this

[01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.850]

...yeah let me take a look at the security緊張

[01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:58.250]
Anything to do with sports.

[01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:02.290]
No.. just a lot of building burning and carnage.

[01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:02.870]
crossvious

[01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:04.270]

[01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:53.250]
We cheated. We had what? The thousand five. Woo! So we got twelve hundred and nineteen votes.

[01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:59.910]
So far today our goal is twenty-four million. A billion. We want a billion votes on the poll today.

[01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:05.890]
Call everybody you know and say vote on that neo-roger.com or there or God's gonna smite your ass. He's gonna smote you.

[01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:10.610]
What part of the newspaper do you always read sports forty-six of course George?

[01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:15.830]
Anybody knows that of course. Local thirty-four I don't read newspapers thirty-three.

[01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:21.370]
Comics twenty-two. The front page twenty-one and a toil page sixteen. Obituraries.

[01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.310]
I'm tired of the hair. Ten.

[01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:30.770]
Vitness eight, Crossword puzzle six, coupons four, World News four, classifieds three, Horoscope three,

[01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:36.350]
National two, Dear Abby one, State news one and the ads have got none.

[01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:42.950]
Of course. You show me somebody's gonna take the newspaper just so they read the ads and I'll show you somebody really really really.

[01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:46.750]
I have no life. Yes, you're serious. Well, we got a lot of people out there need some serious.

[01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:51.530]
Oh, that's beside the point. So that's that's what we got going on there on our second poll of the day.

[01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:55.810]
The person that sends stories all day that doesn't need to send any ever.

[01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:03.610]
Yes. And stories all day need to stop. This whatever multi-page large print several stories that they're sending today that you already have and don't care about.

[01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:06.010]
They need to stop. What are they sending?

[01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.110]
Hilaries or Reverend Wright.

[01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:15.370]
Yeah. And then they got a cover story on all the pages Larry King.

[01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:19.450]
A summary king story. Uh-huh. That might be interesting.

[01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:23.150]
Name least sexy TV host. Oh, gee. How that happened.

[01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:26.890]
Name what least what? Least sexy TV host. Yeah, no kidding.

[01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:35.630]
Pages and pages pages that I'm on giant print. It's like one page story, but they print it really big for your old eyes.

[01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:40.270]
I got a fax number on it. A return number. I'm a hitter.

[01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:44.330]
There's Chelsea, man boy. No, he is.

[01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.790]
Well, they're sending it from their computer as a matter of fact.

[01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:54.730]
Oh, my God. It's probably Eric. No. Doug Thompson on Capitol Hill Blue writes for a Hillary lying eating no big deal.

[01:07:56.410 --> 01:08:01.170]
He says Hillary Clinton got caught in a lie recently a wapper about being under fire in a so-called combat zone.

[01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:04.330]
A well rehearsed lie. She's been telling on the campaign trail for months.

[01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:10.890]
When the truth came out as it so often does in the microscopic world of politics, she shrugged her shoulders and dismissed it by saying,

[01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:15.250]
I made a mistake. That happens. It proves I'm human, which you know for some people is a revelation.

[01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:21.010]
Calling her tall tales of running and ducking for cover a mistake is a massive understatement.

[01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:25.030]
Her claim about being human leaves an opening that's right for comment, but we won't go there.

[01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:28.790]
Clinton's campaign for president is built on a mountain of lies.

[01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:36.230]
She said she brokered peace in Northern Ireland, the man who did broker the peace, and also who won a Nobel Prize for his honest efforts, says her claims are a crock.

[01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:42.270]
Ron Forney of the Associated Press writes an excellent analization of Clinton's vague association with the truth.

[01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:45.970]
During a speech last week on a rat Clinton stretched the truth to the breaking point.

[01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:54.290]
I certainly do remember that trip to Bosnia and there was a saying around the White House that if a place was too small, too poor, too dangerous, the president couldn't go send the first lady.

[01:08:54.770 --> 01:09:03.710]
That's where we went. I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.

[01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:11.670]
Hogwash, the truth is, there was no sniper fire. Nobody ducked for cover. Bad weather, not security concerns kept her husband from making the same trip a few months earlier.

[01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:22.490]
Clinton anirates to behind the story which he has told more than once until video surface showing the former first lady, her daughter Chelsea and their entourage strolling off the plane and walking calmly across the tarmac.

[01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:35.090]
What makes swillery situation unique in the Bosnia establishment so damaging, the embellishment so damaging, is the fact that the New York Senators build a candidacy on the illusion of experience any attack on her credentials as a potential Achilles heel.

[01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:49.070]
As firstly, she did not attend national security council meetings, did not receive the presidential briefings on terrorism and other threats and didn't have a top level security clearance. Her foreign trips were glorified goodwill tours, a collection of photo ops and sightseeing trips.

[01:09:49.810 --> 01:10:03.730]
Let's be fair, Hillary Clinton is not the first political candidate to lie, Iowa Senator Tom Harkin lied about being a combat pilot in Vietnam. Barack Obama's petitors resume with glorified claims about brokering a deal on immigration in the Senate about writing a bill to deal with a housing crisis.

[01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:09.330]
If Clinton manages to make it back to the White House, she won't be the first to last president to play fast and loose with the truth.

[01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:17.730]
John F. Kennedy lied about American involvement in the Bay of Pigs, Fiasco. Lyndon Johnson lied about a purported attack on a Navy ship to justify escalating the war in Vietnam.

[01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:22.950]
Nixon lied about water gating many other things, Jimmy Carter lied by simply claiming he would never tell a lie.

[01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:31.070]
Ronald Reagan lied about a rhyme contra among other things, Bill Clinton lied about doing the nasty within termonical whiskey and lots of other things that were more important in damaging to his presidency.

[01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:36.810]
George Herbert Walker lied when he promised to never raise taxes, his son lies just about every time he opens his mouth.

[01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:44.210]
So we shouldn't be surprised that Sweltery Clinton is trying to lie her way into the White House as a career politician she simply doesn't know any other way.

[01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:54.470]
Yet her lies about being under fire used as a questionable way to justify her claim of being qualified from day one to be commander in chief are an insult to every man a woman who served their nation and actually came under fire.

[01:10:54.930 --> 01:11:01.210]
Anyone who's been under fire in a combat situation will take it. It's not something you forget and certainly not something that you simply miss speak about.

[01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:08.470]
To accept Clinton's ludicrous claims that she mis-spoke means accepting the fact that she mis-spoke at least three times during the campaign.

[01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:18.750]
Each time she added more embellishment to the story. When challenged with the facts, her first claim was that she was sleep deprived and because of lack of sleep she wasn't in full control of her, her memory or faculties.

[01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:24.210]
This for the woman who wants us to believe that she'll be the best person to answer that ringing phone at three o'clock in the morning.

[01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:29.530]
Think about that sobering thought says Doug E. T. Had a boy dog, ripped her an ass baby well this year.

[01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:36.730]
She's confused. She is the rain. She's a bubblehead. She's full of crap.

[01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:43.190]
Now let me say again if her last name was Smith or Jones, she wouldn't get eight vote. Am I right about that?

[01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:44.190]
You bet. You bet.

[01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.170]
Shrill. Shrill and full of crap.

[01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:52.690]
Are these ready from day one? She knows where the silverware isn't where the fine-challenge is.

[01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:56.590]
She knows where that blue dress was.

[01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:57.950]
Oh God.

[01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:06.070]
229 votes on a poll not too bad. Not too shabby. Don't forget the next hour we're giving away some, well we're not doing giving away anything.

[01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:07.910]
But QA is doing it.

[01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:13.850]
At the Carolina ale house might as well start promoting it now. Why don't people can go there for long?

[01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:14.070]
Sure.

[01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:18.130]
26 18 Western Road in Western. We got a Florida Panther ticket hit.

[01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:21.670]
You go there I'm sure and see the QM van. Am I right? Right?

[01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:23.550]
Or the 100 and one of those things.

[01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:28.270]
And you can take your pick. You just see the Panther Crapital game or the Panther Trasher game.

[01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:32.510]
Washington, or Atlanta. But hurry because when they're gone it says they're just growing.

[01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:38.930]
They put that in every promo now in every line. When a guy and they're growing it's a Tommy thing.

[01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:42.250]
I got nothing to do with it. Tommy, you know Tommy speaks strange.

[01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:47.230]
Good guy but strange voice, strange. Oh he's a saleswoman, right? That's right.

[01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.650]
Still? Still.

[01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:53.290]
Is he selling anything?

[01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.990]
I don't know.

[01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:57.150]
You don't see him anymore?

[01:12:57.650 --> 01:12:57.850]
I do.

[01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:01.930]
And I don't say hey have you sold anything? Why not?

[01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:07.230]
Why not? Don't you care about whether he's making enough money to buy you some good wheat or something?

[01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:09.170]
He has never bought me.

[01:13:09.170 --> 01:13:11.830]
You are so insensitive to his needs of other people.

[01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:15.410]
Yeah. I don't care about it being selfish. You know you're going to get your time in I.

[01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:18.910]
And good friends will talk about interesting things all the time like sex and play.

[01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.510]
Yeah. Look at late sex drugs have you you know things like that.

[01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:23.230]
I don't ask him about his business.

[01:13:24.170 --> 01:13:25.950]
Well just this one time.

[01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:26.370]
Alright.

[01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:28.150]
Hey Tommy.

[01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:30.310]
The best talent he does is he'll reject.

[01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:32.710]
4.560 QAM.

[01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.510]
The fourth leader.

[01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.570]
Hey sounds that you hate.

[01:13:45.690 --> 01:13:49.030]
But I'm in it and I think they're really great.

[01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:52.850]
I don't ask you can't hit a one or two.

[01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:56.510]
Much less or eight.

[01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:59.010]
Eight sounds that you hate.

[01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:03.190]
But men from the boys they will surely separate.

[01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:06.790]
I tell you what they are.

[01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:09.030]
Guaranteed you'll go.

[01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:09.550]
Yeah.

[01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:15.150]
I like fingernails on a blackboard.

[01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:18.630]
People crack their neck for their knuckles.

[01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:22.190]
When I rough style we're full together.

[01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:25.570]
That just makes me shuck.

[01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:31.090]
Eight sounds you can't stand.

[01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:35.490]
But you could tolerate if you were a handsome man I am.

[01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:38.770]
And to the list of eight.

[01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:42.530]
A fork and a knife scraping on a plate.

[01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:44.390]
Scraping on a plate.

[01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:47.650]
Scraping on a plate.

[01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:54.350]
Here's what I really love.

[01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:58.450]
You might want to try it.

[01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:00.150]
Give me feedback.

[01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:02.070]
In my head froze.

[01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:03.890]
Oh yeah.

[01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:05.830]
That's more like it.

[01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:07.370]
Little more.

[01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:08.970]
Little more over there.

[01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:09.810]
Little more.

[01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:11.130]
Yeah.

[01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:14.790]
Eight sounds so unique.

[01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:19.130]
Now let's review so you can really, really free.

[01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:22.090]
Figure nails on a blackboard.

[01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:25.830]
When people crack their neck for their knuckles.

[01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:29.170]
Rub his eye, we're full together.

[01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:32.730]
Cause it makes me shuck.

[01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:36.630]
I like when new sneakers on a gym floor.

[01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:39.830]
Raising in a womb and a window.

[01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:43.510]
When it gets it's drilling my mold.

[01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:46.490]
That makes me pay.

[01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:47.190]
Big no.

[01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:50.590]
My boy singing on his record.

[01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:54.230]
You can't hold on for a China.

[01:15:55.410 --> 01:15:57.930]
If these have give you the shivers.

[01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:01.590]
That makes you a winner.

[01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:06.290]
Hey, you go nuts to someone bite their fork like this.

[01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:08.650]
Cause I love it.

[01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:10.950]
Here, I'll do it again.

[01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:14.390]
Do you have a nervous system left?

[01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:18.790]
How about the squeegee wiping a window I crack my neck?

[01:16:23.490 --> 01:16:24.550]
Suprae whips.

[01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:26.150]
Supra whips.

[01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:27.070]
Oh wait.

[01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:28.690]
I got one more.

[01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:35.190]
Yeah, we got that one.

[01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:39.950]
But nevertheless, I shouldn't have done this toward the beginning of the show.

[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.430]
I meant to.

[01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:41.830]
But we're still on a year.

[01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:44.670]
Now is down 117 by the way.

[01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:46.330]
I bet you the S&P is down.

[01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:50.090]
I'm putting out some useful crap here.

[01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:52.590]
I want to get the address of this place.

[01:16:53.670 --> 01:16:53.950]
The famous.

[01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:56.210]
Not the old famous, but the new famous.

[01:16:56.950 --> 01:17:00.170]
Somebody from my space emailed us to me yesterday or the other.

[01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:01.230]
I don't know a few days ago.

[01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:06.410]
The famous kosher restaurant is open at 203-01 Biscayne Boulevard, Aventura.

[01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:11.270]
Now this isn't the same old famous that used to be on 6th Avenue or...

[01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:12.730]
What a Martian Avenue, Miami Beach.

[01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:14.430]
Years ago, that was just phenomenal.

[01:17:14.710 --> 01:17:15.750]
That I was rave about.

[01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:17.490]
Is there any connection, other than the name?

[01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:18.810]
How about a hybrid theatrical?

[01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.330]
It's all right.

[01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:20.090]
You win new times.

[01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:22.870]
Top notch, Nush, it says.

[01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:26.610]
The famous kosher restaurant fills up, coming void and then some.

[01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.690]
You know, we also had the Carnegie Deli.

[01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:30.550]
Wasn't it in the Gables?

[01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:31.730]
Was it in the Grove?

[01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.570]
Where was that?

[01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.750]
I don't know.

[01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:34.710]
Don't you remember that?

[01:17:34.810 --> 01:17:36.230]
Years ago, we had a Carnegie Deli there.

[01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:37.110]
Boy, that was good.

[01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:37.710]
Man.

[01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:43.790]
It's said that Jewish history, along with religious holidays that celebrate it, can be summed up in three sentences.

[01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:45.070]
They try to kill us.

[01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:45.830]
We survived.

[01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:46.610]
Let's eat.

[01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.630]
Oy!

[01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:48.430]
That's very good.

[01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:54.510]
At no time of year, does this ultimately concise historical summary seem more accurate than now, Thursday is poor.

[01:17:54.730 --> 01:17:55.790]
Being last Thursday, of course.

[01:17:57.070 --> 01:18:02.950]
A holiday where religious rules mandate that Jews gift others with food and personally scarf down as some sure as suffice is affordable,

[01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:07.570]
even rabbis have required a drink enough wine that they can no longer distinguish, one blessing from another.

[01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:11.970]
An April comes Passover, Pesach, with its lavish satyr dinners.

[01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:17.370]
And in May, Israel's modern independent state tradition is an Al-Fresco feast meeting barbecue time for most.

[01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:19.310]
Barbecue time?

[01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:25.830]
There are those, though, who think of a picnic of a Jewish jelly for strommy and corny sandwich on rye far more appropriate.

[01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:37.410]
So even folks philosophical enough to accept that the Lord give it and the Lord take it away can't help but believe the scheduled April closing of 53-year-old Rolfi Cohen's rascal house is a mighty poor timing on the part of somebody upstairs.

[01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:45.590]
Luckily, the famous kosher restaurant, a bustling Eden take-out deli with a comforting classic New York City feel openly last year to help fill the gap.

[01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:50.590]
It opened last October or something, October 14th.

[01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:58.790]
And how come here it is, it's March 26th and all of this time nobody is told us anything about it.

[01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:01.070]
Have we ever had anybody say anything?

[01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:01.810]
Not that I would call.

[01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:12.430]
Since heaping bowls of creamy coleslaw and fresh pickles, sauer's and half-sour's both admirably crunchy or I've almost as soon as dinners slide into their booths, appetizers aren't really necessary.

[01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:16.670]
But it would be ashamed to miss two nosh plates potato pancakes and fried creplach.

[01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:18.630]
Well this sounds like the old famous baby.

[01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:25.590]
The former were mostly finely grated potato with ample onion to make the crisp crusted cake savory.

[01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:35.190]
On all her dietary laws make dairy products a no-no-what kosher meat eateries, the part of neutral-line dairy sour cream supplied upon request was an astonishingly good ringer.

[01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:37.570]
A dining companion couldn't believe it wasn't a real thing.

[01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:44.550]
The plumpy, the plumply stuffed creplach, especially popular a firm owing to their triangular shape,

[01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:51.910]
symbol of either the pockets three corner hat or ears of the holidays villain, Heyman, could have used more spicing and it's gone be filling.

[01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:56.930]
But the generous mound of fried onions topped the noodle dumplings more than compensated for the meat's mildness.

[01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:03.730]
Literally salted and peckered at the table and dosed with more of the rich sour cream, the creplach was sumptuously sinful treat.

[01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:05.930]
Scrumptuously, what did I say?

[01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:07.690]
Some just, what do I whatever what?

[01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:11.210]
I'm getting tongue-tied just reading with some so pissed off.

[01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:15.470]
Sandwiches come regular or extra-large described as mile high in the menu.

[01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:24.490]
X New Yorkers expecting Carnegie daily-like creations, mountains of drippingly juicy fat meat too big to even get a sand ribbon-art-sized mouth around, will likely be disappointed.

[01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:31.050]
And allegedly extra-large to me for strom-me corn-beef combo on very small slices of rye bread was more mouse than monster,

[01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:36.710]
especially since slices were nearly paper-thin, minimizing any interesting chewiness, for that chewiness.

[01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:42.130]
But the flavor of the homemade corn-beef and New York-made for strom-me was pleasant of mild.

[01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:59.330]
Surprisingly, since both Nova Scotia salmon and saltier locks are available, the delis take out counter, the menu offers no eatin' locks, and only two no-vitems, a Jewish western salmon, sliced veg omelette, and a smoked fish platter which was a bagel and light textured par of cream cheese, plus green leaf lettuce tomato pepperine onion and cucumber.

[01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:04.390]
The quality of fish was sparse of the quantity, but the quality was high.

[01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:07.490]
Let me say it again, the quantity of fish was sparse, but the quality was high.

[01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:11.410]
Properly custom-carved from slabs, the slices were silky at firm.

[01:21:11.550 --> 01:21:14.990]
Unlike standard moshi, pre-slice smoked salmon.

[01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:19.650]
With per pound prices relatively low, take out as a way to go for smoked salmon mavens.

[01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:27.930]
From chicken soup to bargain-priced means under $20, with super-salad plus two sides, including the lockies, there is much more for eating diners to enjoy.

[01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.710]
At least you can think of it through paysox.

[01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:35.650]
Well, that's good. This is written by Pamela Robin-Brant in New Times, as a public service from us.

[01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:37.910]
I wonder what Fuzi knows about it yet.

[01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:42.850]
Where's the best deli in town? Is it the famous kosher restaurant? Is it the...

[01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:47.530]
I wonder if the deli then is still open and it's the 18th reincarnation in a Hollywood.

[01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:49.910]
And if they aren't, guys, blew his brains out.

[01:21:50.230 --> 01:21:50.390]
Did he?

[01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.630]
Yeah.

[01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:55.530]
I think it's when they wouldn't let us play sofa king anymore on the air.

[01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:57.950]
That'll play the...

[01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:58.710]
But it's anyway.

[01:21:59.770 --> 01:22:02.170]
So here's the ad which I googled, I looked it up.

[01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:04.170]
Oh, you can download the menu.

[01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.270]
The location is 203-01, Viscane Boulevard, Avonchura.

[01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.930]
They're open Sundays, 80-M-9-PM.

[01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:14.270]
They have a Sunday breakfast, 8-3, that's supposed to be something special.

[01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:17.710]
Monday through Thursday, 10-M-9-PM, Friday, 10-M-3-PM.

[01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:22.510]
Oh, that's right. It's a kosher place.

[01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:25.490]
So they close at 3PM on Friday. They don't want to be open at sundown.

[01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:26.970]
We're burning hell.

[01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:30.710]
And Saturday, open 1 hour after Shabbos till 12 midnight.

[01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:34.250]
I...

[01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:38.830]
Have you know when it's 1 hour after Shabbos?

[01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.910]
How are after Sunday?

[01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:44.630]
You start to watch. You start your timer.

[01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:46.630]
You look it up in the paper.

[01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:50.590]
It says, oh, I see.

[01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:55.910]
There's a... They had a contest here with face painting, balloon arc, that whole big thing.

[01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.590]
They were brand opening.

[01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:58.810]
How come nobody ever signed them up to be on our show?

[01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.210]
Right.

[01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:00.090]
They thought to promote it.

[01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:01.370]
We missed out on face painting.

[01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:02.050]
Yeah.

[01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:05.670]
I'm talking about the food, about the famous kosher restaurant in Avonchura.

[01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:07.850]
How come nobody in our sales department ever got them on a year?

[01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:09.810]
What kind of a joy are we running here anyway?

[01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:10.710]
I could have been a cat.

[01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:15.310]
You could have told Tommy to go crawl on them for Christ's sakes or for ours.

[01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:17.930]
Yeah, for your sake, I would write in there.

[01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:20.130]
Although maybe when I'm down, I'm going to check this place out.

[01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.470]
It opened October 14th, 2007.

[01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:23.970]
But you have really good kishki, too.

[01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:25.950]
I wouldn't be surprised, in fact.

[01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:26.890]
You know how during the break?

[01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:27.350]
Gravy.

[01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:28.470]
Maybe I'll check out the menu.

[01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:31.290]
Or certainly between now and two o'clock.

[01:23:31.410 --> 01:23:32.830]
I'll check out the menu. Probably not a good idea.

[01:23:32.970 --> 01:23:33.970]
It's nice brisket.

[01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:35.270]
It's a nice little bit of fish.

[01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.870]
It's a nice little fish.

[01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:36.950]
Let's check out the brisket.

[01:23:38.370 --> 01:23:40.710]
And some great potato lockies and maybe some kishki.

[01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:40.950]
Yeah.

[01:23:41.130 --> 01:23:42.810]
I haven't had good kishki in the years.

[01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:48.350]
Since the Goyom took over the local deli here, the one I used to get my kishki remember.

[01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:49.090]
Mm-hmm.

[01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:52.050]
But the Goyom took it over and now they got like all kinds of stuff for Goyom.

[01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:56.270]
And people from India and stuff like that in Chinese people.

[01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.950]
Oh my god.

[01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.890]
Lots of Chinese money.

[01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:01.590]
252 votes on the poll.

[01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:02.590]
What do they read in the newspaper?

[01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:04.910]
Most of the sports section, of course, 52.

[01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:08.330]
What part of the newspaper do you always read?

[01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:09.150]
Sports 52.

[01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:10.610]
I don't read newspapers 40.

[01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:11.850]
Local 39.

[01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:13.510]
Editorial page 25.

[01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:14.730]
Comics 25.

[01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:15.830]
Front page 23.

[01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:17.670]
Obituaries 11.

[01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:18.530]
What a great hobby.

[01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:20.790]
What biggest name on time?

[01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:21.770]
That's Tababash.

[01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:22.330]
You know what this is?

[01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:26.550]
Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:28.250]
Whoa, I'll be good.

[01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:31.610]
So Hillary, I wouldn't have.

[01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:34.890]
I'll be good.

[01:24:36.150 --> 01:24:38.050]
And I'll behave like I should.

[01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.930]
I'll seriously.

[01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:41.330]
So good.

[01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:43.050]
So good.

[01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:44.830]
I swear to you.

[01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:48.190]
Wow, I'll be nice.

[01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.430]
And I'll control my voice.

[01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:54.810]
Truly, I'll be nice.

[01:24:56.490 --> 01:24:58.050]
Hillary won't tell me twice.

[01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:01.290]
Hey, so nice.

[01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.990]
So nice.

[01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:04.570]
I swear to you.

[01:25:04.570 --> 01:25:07.330]
Oh, daddy.

[01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:09.950]
They won't let me play my horn.

[01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:12.630]
They say I'm too horny as it is.

[01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.410]
I know sometimes in my life.

[01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:19.590]
I've done some things that were wrong.

[01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:23.730]
But when I campaigned for my wife,

[01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:26.350]
I promised I won't do any harm.

[01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:28.670]
And I'll be good.

[01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:31.010]
Told Hillary I would.

[01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:34.630]
I'll be good.

[01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:37.670]
Lisa, I think I could.

[01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:41.010]
So good.

[01:25:41.890 --> 01:25:42.690]
So good.

[01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:44.470]
I swear to you.

[01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:47.250]
Put a course on the figures across.

[01:25:48.690 --> 01:25:50.190]
Well, here's some visitors from India.

[01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:51.610]
They rescued that two year old girl.

[01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.330]
She was trapped in that well, well, well.

[01:25:53.610 --> 01:25:55.210]
And for many, many hours in their rescue.

[01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.570]
I hope she's got a good dowry though.

[01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:58.090]
Oh yeah, we got another one.

[01:25:58.090 --> 01:25:58.510]
That's fine.

[01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:59.730]
Oh yeah.

[01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:03.850]
One of these days, once you least expect it,

[01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:06.690]
well, I had something really, oh yeah,

[01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:08.430]
I checked the menu and they have kishki.

[01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:08.850]
Of course.

[01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:09.950]
All right, with gravy.

[01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:12.570]
Of course with gravy.

[01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:15.770]
Anybody think like dry, like khazirai, dry?

[01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:17.770]
I want to make sure, you know, I don't know how to do that.

[01:26:17.770 --> 01:26:18.830]
Dry dry, man.

[01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.930]
Dry what?

[01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:20.730]
You better get with it.

[01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:21.530]
Dry anus.

[01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.690]
Dry, yeah.

[01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:24.550]
Oh, let's get back to that anus punsing, you know,

[01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:24.970]
stir it, man.

[01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:25.550]
It was good.

[01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:26.350]
Start eating now.

[01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.070]
Heavy do these stuff.

[01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:29.790]
No, anyway, their menu looks unbelievable, man.

[01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:31.110]
It's really, oh.

[01:26:31.450 --> 01:26:33.030]
Well, someone should call on them then.

[01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:34.510]
No.

[01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:36.110]
Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that.

[01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:37.770]
Then Neil might actually have a spot.

[01:26:38.290 --> 01:26:40.310]
Or maybe we could get him on that two for one thing we got going.

[01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:41.690]
Yeah, I heard you had a soft spot.

[01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:43.910]
They believed me.

[01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.430]
Trust me.

[01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:45.110]
It's all I got.

[01:26:46.930 --> 01:26:47.670]
I'm doing fine.

[01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:49.810]
Okay, for an old fart like me, I'm doing a good job.

[01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:51.550]
What are you eating now?

[01:26:51.690 --> 01:26:52.570]
You're not doing so fine.

[01:26:52.710 --> 01:26:53.170]
You're still with.

[01:26:54.130 --> 01:26:56.170]
From how is how is he on an inch cuban?

[01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:04.430]
It's success.

[01:27:04.890 --> 01:27:06.170]
I can't, can I just move on?

[01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:07.730]
But there's nothing to say after that.

[01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:11.050]
Okay, there's nothing to say after you blurt that out.

[01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:11.910]
It's part.

[01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.690]
Now what's Chris eating?

[01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:13.410]
Are you also eating?

[01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:15.270]
Yes, I had a turkey sandwich.

[01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:16.390]
You had?

[01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:17.110]
You inhaled it?

[01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:18.090]
I had it earlier.

[01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:18.950]
Okay, about an hour ago.

[01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:21.230]
So in other words,

[01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:23.670]
a nutnik there was just getting around eating now.

[01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:24.350]
Is that a safe?

[01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:25.330]
It's a little floundster.

[01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.730]
It's a fine baby.

[01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:27.050]
So, get on time.

[01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:31.790]
A ceasefire critical to the improved security situation in Iraq.

[01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:36.070]
A period of one raviled this week when a militia loyal to radical Shi'ed Muslim cleric

[01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:41.450]
Mokta'a al-Saudr began shutting down neighborhoods in West Baghdad and it was issuing demands of the central government.

[01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:45.510]
Simultaneously, in this strategic southern port city of Bazarah,

[01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:50.230]
where Saudr's mocked the militias and controlled, the Iraqi government launched a crack down on the face of warnings

[01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:54.070]
by Saudr's followers that they'll fight government forces if any Saudrists are detained.

[01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:57.730]
And he's Saudrists are detained.

[01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:03.150]
So I want to hear an Arab satellite news channel's reporter clashes between the Makhni Army and police in Bazarah.

[01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:09.130]
The freeze on offensive activity by Saudr's Makhni Army has been a major factor behind the recent drop in violence in Iraq

[01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:16.310]
and it refers that the confrontation that's erupted in Baghdad in Bazarah could end the low in attacks, assassinations, kidnappings, and bombing.

[01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:17.230]
All of these things.

[01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:22.230]
As the US military recorded its 4,000th death in Iraq, US officials in Baghdad ward again this week

[01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:26.490]
that drawing down troops took where they could collapse Iraq's fragile security situation.

[01:28:28.930 --> 01:28:32.790]
There's only one war that's going on. It's a civil war and we're the ones who created it.

[01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:37.310]
Okay, we made a create the situation of vacuum of leadership there and we created this civil war there.

[01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:39.770]
That's the war that's going on. Shut up, comedy, what do you hate America?

[01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:43.450]
Pentagon officials said that military leaders are watching for any signs of backsliding

[01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:46.870]
as they consider whether to keep drawing down troops below pre-search levels.

[01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:51.970]
President Bush spoke about the death toll saying one day people will look back at this moment in history and say,

[01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:57.410]
thanks God there were courageous people willing to serve because they laid the foundations for peace for generations to come.

[01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:01.150]
Even as he spoke the situation on the ground was rapidly deteriorating.

[01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:07.390]
On Sunday, a barrage of at least 17 rockets at the heavily fortified green zone in surrounding neighborhoods

[01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:10.590]
were both the US and Iraqi government headquarters or Houset to corner police.

[01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:13.590]
Most of them were launched from the outskirts. I don't want to read this. It's too depressing.

[01:29:15.190 --> 01:29:20.250]
So far this month 27 soldiers have been killed in Iraq of those 16 or 59 percent died in Baghdad.

[01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:24.750]
In January 25 percent of the US deaths happened in Baghdad or 10 out of 40.

[01:29:24.930 --> 01:29:26.750]
But so far this month 27 already.

[01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:34.490]
Civilian casualties also under rise in Baghdad. After a record low number through November when at least 76 people were killed 306 injured,

[01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:44.630]
the deaths began to rise. December crept up to 88 people killed. On February 172 in February and is in March 24, at least 149 killed a 448 injured.

[01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:52.130]
There's blood shed in chaos is what's going on. But the media don't want to be bothered with that because they're busy talking about crazy preachers and stuff like that.

[01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:54.730]
And there's the shrunken head on CNN.

[01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:59.870]
When it comes to foreign policy it's not the way to go and it's even going to be.

[01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:04.390]
She is one of the weirdest. I mean I realize it's supposed to be journalism although it's not.

[01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:06.790]
Right. One of the strangest creatures.

[01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:09.030]
Dandarage. Straight creatures right.

[01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:15.630]
And your buddy Lou Dobbsman, he's screaming in the out about the poor middle class and about the outsourcing of jobs and all these damn illegal aliens.

[01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:17.910]
And listen all the Mexicans back except his wife.

[01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:23.230]
Like that. How would that pull kind of slow down on this baby here Chris?

[01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:26.810]
You're not going to make your 10 million votes. 283 is all we got.

[01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:29.450]
Let's set a goal of like 450.

[01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:33.810]
Okay. I think about 900 but okay.

[01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:49.930]
Join WQM right now at Carolina Alehouse at 2618 Weston Road in Weston for a Florida Panther ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket in the ticket.

[01:30:50.670 --> 01:30:54.850]

[01:30:58.030 --> 01:31:02.150]
So look for the QM van or the Hummer the Humper right look for the QAM Hunter.

[01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:06.850]

[01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:10.170]
Well that the famous Cocher Deli sounds really good.

[01:31:11.710 --> 01:31:20.550]
I think we got one facts about it and we always get these facts saying is this the real is this original or what's not the original one but nevertheless it sounds pretty damn good.

[01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:23.430]
Well sure be nice if we got some facts with some reviews on it.

[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.690]
Yeah.

[01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:31.470]
Somebody's actually eating there instead of pining away but what are we going to do the Rascal House is going all the old Rascals.

[01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:32.790]
I don't have anywhere to eat anymore.

[01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:34.590]
Well there's a place right there in Evan's Uro okay.

[01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:37.070]
Which last time I checked isn't that far from the Rascal House.

[01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.170]
What is the Rascal House about 170th?

[01:31:41.670 --> 01:31:42.310]
Oh yeah.

[01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:44.430]
Yeah I don't remember the last time I was there. Wait.

[01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:46.570]
I've never been there.

[01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:49.070]
You've never been to the Rascal House?

[01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.410]
No.

[01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:50.890]
Am I missing?

[01:31:50.890 --> 01:31:54.310]
You've never been to the Rascal House.

[01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:55.330]
What the Puppernicks wants?

[01:31:56.490 --> 01:31:57.170]
What about Wolfies?

[01:31:57.710 --> 01:31:57.850]
No.

[01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:01.010]
You were never to Wolfies?

[01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:01.270]
No.

[01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:02.090]
Corkeys?

[01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:04.490]
Many times.

[01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:08.050]
Wolfies was better than Corkeys.

[01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:09.310]
Oh it's take your word for it.

[01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:13.210]
Corkeys the best thing they had going of course was the brisket and the potato pancake.

[01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:14.670]
Oh I guess what I'd have.

[01:32:18.330 --> 01:32:21.230]
I don't know.

[01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:21.730]
Quitsons.

[01:32:22.730 --> 01:32:23.770]
And what about Wayne Arle?

[01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:24.850]
He must be reopened now.

[01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:25.870]
The quitsies are in a month.

[01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:26.430]
I don't think so.

[01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.350]
What?

[01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:28.410]
I don't think so.

[01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.930]
No.

[01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:29.670]
We would know.

[01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:31.450]
He would not reopen without telling us.

[01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:34.030]
Well how can he tell us we don't take any calls and fats are there.

[01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:36.030]
He's not going to answer the phone when we're not putting him on the air.

[01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.690]
He knows how to get a hold of us.

[01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:39.090]
And how is that?

[01:32:39.210 --> 01:32:40.990]
How did he ever get a hold of us both by the following?

[01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:41.850]
Yeah.

[01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:42.710]
Good one.

[01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:43.470]
All right.

[01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.630]
All right.

[01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:44.650]
I'm going to get a hold of him.

[01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:44.650]

[01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:44.650]

[01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:47.830]
Over waiting Senator McCain's foreign policy speech on CNN.

[01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:49.490]
We don't have to wait for CNN.

[01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:50.790]
I can tell you what he's going to say.

[01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:53.090]
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

[01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:53.470]
Yeah.

[01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:54.050]
That's it.

[01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:58.490]
Crazy person man insane McCain and Julie, remember that would be a hell of a ticket.

[01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:00.790]
Guaranteed to lose.

[01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:03.250]
287 on the point.

[01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:05.010]
You got to get to 300 before we can get to 450.

[01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.730]
I'll take it that.

[01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:06.450]
It's pretty slow.

[01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:07.070]
So I heard.

[01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:08.030]
Maybe that what?

[01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:09.430]
They don't like this poll I guess.

[01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:09.990]
Sorry Brandon.

[01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:12.390]
Brandon's not communicating with us today anyway.

[01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.790]
I don't know.

[01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:14.710]
What's the story now?

[01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:15.530]
It's spring break.

[01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:18.910]
In fact, there's a thing in one of the local, local papers.

[01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:20.550]
I figured whether it's the hair of the sun, or the middle.

[01:33:20.770 --> 01:33:25.950]
Got a big picture of some guy hanging from a light post, light post in spring break and four lot of day.

[01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:27.390]
Back in the late 60s.

[01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.750]
Yeah.

[01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:30.590]
Looking for some elbow room.

[01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:32.850]
Those were the days baby.

[01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:35.930]
Before all the politicians and all the old folks drove the kids out.

[01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:37.130]
Oh, we don't want to have that.

[01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:38.630]
They create too much of a fuss.

[01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:40.070]
And there's all this drinking.

[01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:41.150]
Listen to that.

[01:33:42.630 --> 01:33:43.070]
See?

[01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.910]
Wow.

[01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:46.490]
Well, I talk about timing, man.

[01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:47.510]
I still got it.

[01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:51.510]
The sirens are coming for all those spring breakers, all those punks.

[01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:52.530]
Send them back to Daytona.

[01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:54.230]
Send them to a panellini city.

[01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:55.250]
Send them someplace else.

[01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:56.150]
Send them to Cancun.

[01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:58.090]
Anyplace else?

[01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:02.330]
Because we sure don't want anybody in the age of 100 in South Florida.

[01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:03.110]
God forbid.

[01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:06.170]
Oh, and speaking of crazy people, she's ended again.

[01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.870]
Sally Kern.

[01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:11.070]
Oklahoma House representative Sally Kern made an Easter Sunday appearance.

[01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:14.930]
A KFOR TV's flashpoint to face off of an openly gay pastor,

[01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:18.210]
elaborating on her recent leaked speech and defending her views.

[01:34:19.650 --> 01:34:23.170]
A spirited theological and political debate ensued between representative Kern,

[01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:27.010]
host Kevin Ogle, panelists Burns Hargis, and Mike Turpin,

[01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:29.910]
and Dr. Scott Jones of Oklahoma City's Cathedral of Hope.

[01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:33.350]
I was speaking to a group of Republicans, grassroots Republicans,

[01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:37.110]
Kern explained of the original speech, which gained worldwide attention after posted on the internet

[01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:38.550]
by the Gameless Biennick Victory Fund.

[01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:42.530]
And I was talking about the homosexual agenda, and how they're putting forth

[01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:47.950]
funding very heavily, homosexual and pro-homosexual candidates to run against and defeat conservatives across the nation.

[01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:50.370]
Like Charlie Chris, for example.

[01:34:51.570 --> 01:34:53.730]
I did talk about what I believe scientific evidence healthcare

[01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:56.750]
proved that the homosexual lifestyle is a dangerous lifestyle,

[01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:59.190]
and yes, I did compare it to being more dangerous than terrorism.

[01:34:59.850 --> 01:35:01.390]
And my point in doing that, gentlemen, was this.

[01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:04.530]
Everybody knows that terrorism destroys and tears down,

[01:35:04.690 --> 01:35:07.510]
and that was the only analogy I was making is that the homosexual agenda,

[01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:11.610]
this lifestyle, which is so destructive to individuals, is that the heart trying to tear down what is

[01:35:11.610 --> 01:35:14.710]
the bedrock foundation of our society, the family and traditional marriage.

[01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:17.970]
You don't really believe that, Scott? As panelists Michael Turpin,

[01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:20.350]
a pastor of Jones is more dangerous than a Somovian Lawton Dwayne.

[01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:24.690]
I believe that he, with the homosexual agenda, and lifestyle that involves his deadly relation.

[01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:28.470]
Now, I wasn't saying that Scott, who is personally as dangerous as a Somovian Lawton,

[01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:30.630]
but I was just making comparison to who my point, she said.

[01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:34.210]
Well, I would denounce hate speech of any kind, rebutts Jones,

[01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:36.430]
and having my public remarks in response to yours.

[01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:39.450]
And you have to understand that when you say that gay people are like cancer,

[01:35:39.810 --> 01:35:41.830]
and cancer is something that we eradicate that we kill,

[01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:43.570]
or that we're worse than terrorists and terrorists,

[01:35:43.710 --> 01:35:45.810]
or people like what we go after to annihilate, to kill,

[01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:48.090]
you have to understand why those words without rage people,

[01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:51.710]
because what are you saying? That we should go after gay people and eradicate them, or annihilate them?

[01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:54.690]
I wasn't saying that you guys were cancered, legislative,

[01:35:54.690 --> 01:35:58.050]
Dr. Jones. I was saying that the effect is the very same as cancer.

[01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:00.790]
If God's people don't stand up and proclaim God's word,

[01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:02.850]
which teaches that homosexuality is a sin,

[01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:05.850]
and if we just try to ignore it, let it become mainstream and take on the mentality

[01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:08.010]
that you folks want, that it's a normal lifestyle,

[01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:09.870]
then that's going to spread through our culture,

[01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:12.670]
and we'll no longer have the same kind of culture we've had for over 200 years.

[01:36:12.930 --> 01:36:13.530]
That's all I meant.

[01:36:15.090 --> 01:36:17.770]
You have to understand, appeals Jones, that there are multiple churches,

[01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:20.290]
Christians, denominations, highly respected scholars,

[01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:22.830]
who disagree with your interpretation and application of scripture.

[01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:25.030]
Sally asked, chirping, if you had a gay child,

[01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:27.430]
I would love them as much as anybody else representative Krona,

[01:36:27.690 --> 01:36:30.290]
answers. I would love them more than any other children

[01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:31.610]
because they would have a greater need.

[01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:35.110]
Kron also weighs in on her son answering allegations that he was gay,

[01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:41.450]
gay, bashed, on a 1989 arrest of Jesse Jacob Krona,

[01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:42.590]
an old Sodomy charges.

[01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:46.330]
In 1989, my son Jesse Aaron Krona was 12 years old,

[01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:47.210]
he was over living in Boise, Idaho.

[01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:49.290]
He's never been arrested, he's never been interviewed,

[01:36:49.290 --> 01:36:51.170]
and he said, I am not, I am straight.

[01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:53.750]
But if he were, I'd love him, she continues,

[01:36:53.890 --> 01:36:55.530]
because God created us all in his image.

[01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:57.730]
God's got a wonderful plan for every single one of us.

[01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:59.290]
Sin is out to destroy God's plan.

[01:36:59.290 --> 01:37:03.030]
She goes on and on about the gay agenda and yada yada yada.

[01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:05.870]
She's almost as crazy as my neighbor, but let me say it in almost.

[01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:10.950]
The biggest name of the best out of Tito is the name of the nation's Krona.

[01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:12.610]
It's the only name I am.

[01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:14.450]
The fourth leader.

[01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:16.170]
Neil God?

[01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:26.690]
Is it done or a lean, or does it involve your behind?

[01:37:27.690 --> 01:37:33.510]
Don't strum, there are many things that only gays do this.

[01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:34.390]
Absolutely.

[01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:37.890]
Most states have laws,

[01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:41.230]
you could be jailed or they are fine.

[01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:48.530]
The Senate now must pick which you're a best.

[01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:49.970]
Oh, oh.

[01:37:49.970 --> 01:38:02.010]
Oh, sat me, Peter, Pup, Ford, Cobbos, Ride, Archback, Corridor, Abandoned me

[01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:14.930]
Oh, sat me, the front door's the backside, Just go and ask to Kennedy

[01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:18.510]
If long is my face in the Senate, you'll have a seat

[01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:24.250]
People without health care, folks lacking livelihood

[01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:32.410]
The way they act is really what is loo-oo-oo-oo

[01:38:32.410 --> 01:38:39.070]
Well, there's Helms to model Spectre, and Hornet Bob Packwood

[01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:45.950]
No matter where you stick it, we get screwed

[01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:53.710]
Look out of me, the Senate's lost its mind

[01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:59.070]
There's stronger drugs and crime, God knows

[01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:07.930]
Look out of me, they're saving our maintain

[01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:14.130]
With careings on the Lichio

[01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:44.110]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:39:44.110 --> 01:40:13.250]
a big write-up here in New Times for Christ'sACE. With the whole menu. I mean, who's more powerful, new times are... no, god! You're thinkin' about back in the day when we had an audience? Back in a day when we were moving it, and shakin' it? Yeah. They got potato pancakes, they got stuffed cabbage, fried crepe, and onions, kishka, geffilfe, chicken fingers, buffalo chicken wains, smoked salmon. These are just appetizers. All kinds of salads like wight tuna, omelettes,

[01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:16.370]
Like the famous Jewish western omelette with no onions, peppers and mushrooms,

[01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:21.990]
grilled Franks and coniches, they got the famous meat conich, the Frank conich, hot dog and a bun,

[01:40:22.330 --> 01:40:23.110]
knack worst than a bun.

[01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:28.430]
How come I'm giving him like a whole spotter because I think it's a revelation baby, right?

[01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:33.870]
I think it's in the bobble and maybe somebody will you know put them on the air. This is a little freebie like a little taste.

[01:40:34.630 --> 01:40:36.090]
I doubt it.

[01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:40.890]
Homemade chicken soup with noodle or rice or with lots of balls or crepe block and then they got soup a day

[01:40:40.890 --> 01:40:44.610]
like every day they got something different like mushroom barley on Sunday. I love mushroom barley.

[01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:49.010]
Wednesday it's lentil. Oh and Thursday split pea.

[01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:55.490]
We'll take a split pea just this morning. Mishmash salads. Mishmash.

[01:40:56.170 --> 01:41:00.570]
And then they got on trays like stuffed cabbage and rotisserie chicken and chicken cutlet and

[01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:02.870]
smothered and chicken breast and chicken in a pot.

[01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:04.990]
Dirt will take the pot part.

[01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:10.490]
Fresh brisket. There you go. A task in a biscuit. Let's strap that brisket. Hungry and goulash.

[01:41:11.250 --> 01:41:16.250]
Sweet and sour tongue polonies. Oh, we were doing so well till we got to the tongue.

[01:41:18.190 --> 01:41:21.450]
Flanking. Oh, what a menu. Ribbon steak. Schmork is boring.

[01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.870]
Cachia varnish.

[01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:31.830]
And this is like a spaghetti marinara spaghetti meatballs. You shove in your meatballs and sausages a little wine.

[01:41:34.770 --> 01:41:39.450]
Boats. And they got all kinds of course of sides like macaroni salad and potato salad and

[01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:44.350]
cashe, cashe varnish. And mashed potatoes and potato pancakes and Greek olives.

[01:41:46.570 --> 01:41:51.190]
And of course the gigantic sandwiches, the mile high sandwiches. All the reviews said they're not

[01:41:51.190 --> 01:41:55.470]
that big. Well, they don't have to be gigantic. They don't have to gag on it for it to be good.

[01:41:55.870 --> 01:42:00.890]
But it helps. Corn beef and pistrami and brisket sandwich and roast beef and beef tongue.

[01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:07.310]
Turkey breast salami. And they've also got desserts.

[01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:16.450]
Chocolate or raspberry cigar. Cake, humentation. They got humentation. Oh my god.

[01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:22.330]
Also available in no sugar added. We got a whole bunch of things on here that have

[01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:26.930]
rubla. Remember the lady brought the rubla? Almost killed me on a year. Apple stewed

[01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:34.510]
Russian coffee cake baked apple, seven layer cake, Danish, Swedish, Goyish, all of these things.

[01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:38.750]
Wow. All of these things. That's pretty sunny. I'm going to put that menu right away. I'm

[01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:43.070]
going to check that place out next time I have a chance in Evan sure. I'm going to go and say,

[01:42:43.150 --> 01:42:46.770]
I'm the famous meal Roger. Oh yeah, you're looking for a free meal. Yeah, you should live so long.

[01:42:47.410 --> 01:42:51.550]
I'll tell you the other place. I really like a lot. And I only was there twice. And I still have

[01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:56.430]
their menu because I liked it so much. Two jays. Oh, no, I think it changed ownership.

[01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:59.150]
And when I went through the second time, they didn't have the same omelette that I wanted

[01:42:59.150 --> 01:43:04.590]
from the first time. Okay. I could be wrong about that. But it was very good. Two jays. And they're,

[01:43:04.650 --> 01:43:09.030]
I guess they're all over the place. It's a chain. Oh yeah, look at this on the back of the menu.

[01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:13.010]
Plantation. That's the one I went to on university, driving to fountain shops. Are they still there,

[01:43:13.050 --> 01:43:18.670]
by the way? Good question. Because you told me you've been there more than once. To two jays?

[01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:24.710]
No, that must have been somebody else. Maybe it was a court. Somebody told me they'd been there.

[01:43:24.730 --> 01:43:29.350]
What about you, Chris? You're a big eater. No, you never been to two jays? Never.

[01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:37.330]
I must have been yash. T-O-O-J-A-Y two jays. They're in coral springs in Boka. Plantation. They're

[01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:48.650]
all over in Boka. Like worth Palm Beach Palm Beach Gardens. Jupiter Stewart. Viral. They're not in

[01:43:48.650 --> 01:43:53.250]
the plantation area. They're about to pop a nose somewhere up there, northwest. Coral springs.

[01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:58.430]
Coral springs. They're about to. Anandadream dessert. Oh, you know what I had for dessert before I

[01:43:58.430 --> 01:44:03.990]
had pooped my pants at Ruth Chris Saturday night? I don't know, Crembroulai. No, they didn't have that.

[01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:08.810]
In fact, Paco Taco got that, but he didn't finish it. He loves that, but he didn't finish it,

[01:44:08.890 --> 01:44:14.890]
because that's when he got into his debate with his buddy. I said, anyway, I got that. What do they call it?

[01:44:14.890 --> 01:44:21.570]
Banana Cream Pie. What the hell do they call it? Carmelized. Carmelized banana cream pie.

[01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:26.150]
No, Crembroulai. It's got that same caramelized topping. You know where they take out the

[01:44:26.610 --> 01:44:30.930]
Nuke with the blowtorch there. But they take a blowtorch. That's great. Oceans 2, 3, 4 has

[01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:34.950]
wonderful. I'll crèmebroulai by the way. They nuke the top of it and boil the caramelized banana

[01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:45.210]
cream pie. Oh my god. I almost had time to finish it. It's got out of here. It's got out of here. We're going.

[01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:51.570]
Maybe that's why my stomach was upset. No, it's that butter again, you know.

[01:44:53.290 --> 01:44:57.670]
They broil the steaks in butter. And if you're sensitive to butter or if it makes you get the

[01:44:57.670 --> 01:45:04.050]
squirts man, let me tell you right now, say, oh, hold the butter, please, because otherwise you

[01:45:04.050 --> 01:45:14.330]
might have a meal experience. You'll be kneeling. I can't take too much butter and shoots right

[01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:21.310]
out my ass. Back up back up back home. Ben, Fer and have ring up. Blue me to the can.

[01:45:21.570 --> 01:45:27.430]
Now's now my time to wash and the butter now. And close the window and see the

[01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:36.710]
butter. We're there too much butter. We'd be the butter. Then I get the butter. I can't take too much butter.

[01:45:37.450 --> 01:45:45.750]
I can't take it at all. My ass burns from all less drop and especially sorbet tall.

[01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:57.410]
I know my feet are jumping in a quick shaft. I got a double hole in my back. It ain't got a

[01:45:58.470 --> 01:46:08.870]

[01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:48.050]
About 31 to 5.60 WDQM. What is Sunnish Island in here? It's beautiful, man. Why is it that

[01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:51.130]
people who predict the weather are so full of crap? I mean, once in a while they get it right,

[01:47:51.290 --> 01:47:55.730]
but then even I could do that just right by the outside. Yeah, that's right. Look outside

[01:47:55.730 --> 01:48:02.150]
and look like you're out of the window. Take an umbrella. Sunnish in 38, it's gonna be 40 today. Oh,

[01:48:02.290 --> 01:48:07.730]
I had a Lucio. A happy day. And no snow and no wind blowing like crazy like the world is coming

[01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:13.010]
to an end. And speaking of good things, God is good. Says $1.1 million slots winner. I

[01:48:13.010 --> 01:48:18.210]
talked about the lady who won the 9 million. Right. Well, Cassino Ramoff and Barry here a couple

[01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:25.550]
days ago. Well, here's a lady right there in Margate who says God is good. A hard working

[01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:28.910]
home health aide from Margate who couldn't afford health insurance for herself is now likely

[01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:32.790]
the biggest Jack, Cassino Jack by winter and Florida history. Well, that's because we're just

[01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:37.190]
getting the slots going, baby. You wait till this weekend when I'm there. I'm gonna be dangerous.

[01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:43.710]
I think I'd go to Gulfstream. Yeah, three to shoot. And Pompano. They got will fortune there.

[01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:52.010]
Yeah, $4. $5. $5. Yeah, how much you can lose in a $5 machine like in 12?

[01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:58.990]
No, but I bet you'll tell me or show me. Oh, Paulette Miles 48 was down to her final spin

[01:48:59.530 --> 01:49:05.210]
on a progressive jackpot cash cow class 2 electronic gaming machine at Syneril Covenant Creek

[01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:10.750]
Casinos there tonight. And it turned out to be a good machine, man. She hit the button and won a

[01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:16.970]
record $1.1 million. Good machine, man. This is wonderful. Now instead of having to work seven days,

[01:49:16.970 --> 01:49:21.370]
I only have to work five days a week said Miles reached by the Harold by herself on this morning.

[01:49:21.970 --> 01:49:26.130]
As she was leaving the home from a patient she'd been carrying for overnight. Miles and Megan

[01:49:26.130 --> 01:49:30.010]
from Jamaica, man, since he's using her winnings to pay off her mortgage pay off her car loan,

[01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:33.130]
buy yourself health and life insurance, help her niece with her college tuition,

[01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:37.770]
help her needy family in Jamaica and pay the taxes from her jackpot win. See, there are taxes on

[01:49:37.770 --> 01:49:44.850]
your winnings there. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, you're finally getting lucky and you win something

[01:49:44.850 --> 01:49:51.810]
that they make you pay tax and I guarantee it's like 40%. At least. Isn't that disgusting?

[01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:57.530]
There's no tax when you win it to track here with a casino. Then you're the cash,

[01:49:57.530 --> 01:50:03.210]
are they right? You check. Have a good time. Have a great life. The right she said will be safe

[01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:07.650]
for emergencies and to build a retirement nest egg. God decided to bless me for a reason. I will

[01:50:07.650 --> 01:50:11.030]
not waste my blessings on things that aren't necessary. She said I will not waste it on things

[01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:17.110]
like a vacation. Steve Bonner, General and I am Jirthy Semidal Coconut Creek Acinus at Miles

[01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:21.950]
hit her jackpot shortly before 11 o'clock Saturday night. She was playing one of the nickel machines

[01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:25.790]
one of the progressive electronic gaming machines that for a year now a build up a jackpot of

[01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:29.310]
over a million bucks bonner said we were wondering when somebody would finally hit the jackpot.

[01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:34.430]
The nickel machine that Miles was playing builds at jackpot because it's linked with all the

[01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:39.170]
other progressive nickel machines at the Semidal tribes seven Florida casinos. Bonner said Miles

[01:50:39.170 --> 01:50:43.630]
won the 1.1 million dollar jackpot because instead of betting one nickel at a time which in total

[01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:49.090]
he'd played just one pay line she was playing all 27 pay lines at once. He said people about the

[01:50:49.090 --> 01:50:54.510]
maximum pay lines are the ones who win the big jackpot which is absolutely correct. Now let's see 27

[01:50:54.510 --> 01:51:02.390]
nickels is how much 20 nickels is a buck so it's like a buck 35 yeah very good.

[01:51:04.210 --> 01:51:07.430]
So it's like a dollar machine man a little more than that it's like a buck and a half machine.

[01:51:08.490 --> 01:51:11.930]
Miles said she'd bet the next one because she gets poor to spend a dollar 35 per play on

[01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:15.170]
nickel machines see if I would have just kept reading I would have known it was a buck 35 but we

[01:51:15.170 --> 01:51:19.850]
can do the math we can handle it. I can't afford to play the quarter machines that way that's

[01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:23.390]
why I played the nickel machines said Miles said she plays the machines once in a while to relax

[01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:28.310]
and dream and has never bet more than a hundred bucks at a time. Miles said that when she had the

[01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:32.210]
jackpot she thought she'd won five grand but the woman playing next to her screamed that Miles

[01:51:32.210 --> 01:51:36.170]
had actually won one point of million dollars they treated me like a queen when I once said Miles

[01:51:36.170 --> 01:51:40.830]
that's how they always treat me a woodbine like a queen. I'm appropriate. Said Miles who

[01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:45.050]
after filling out necessary paperwork with the IRS received the amount in the lump sum. God is

[01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:50.450]
good she said. Oh God! Bonner said the biggest jackpot win to take place at Seminal was 800,000

[01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:55.710]
seven years ago and also took place at the Seminal Coconut Creek. I wonder if that was the one

[01:51:55.710 --> 01:52:00.450]
where they didn't want to pay the guy remember remember that one. Yeah I do but they straighten

[01:52:00.450 --> 01:52:05.330]
that out. Now function at the junction oh they certainly did they straighten it out because he

[01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:09.550]
came back and said hey guess what you guys owe me a bunch of money like that and he'll okay. He's

[01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:17.970]
that lawyer and bad press to them. Mm-hmm. Things like that. Right anyway that very nice

[01:52:17.970 --> 01:52:22.950]
option. Joyce it unfortunately she's got to pay a ton of ton of money in taxes. Yeah well I'll

[01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:30.270]
take it anyway. I understand but 1.1 million Christ. Now how do we know how we're doing with those

[01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:34.110]

[01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:09.270]
with that because that's a noondah one thing you know it's already 1236 now that I'm watching

[01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:12.470]
a clock or anything like that that would be bad there's nothing worse that people are going to

[01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:17.850]
work and they watch the clock you know when you go into a supermarket and you go through the

[01:53:17.850 --> 01:53:21.890]
checkout and all these young punks are talking to each other all the employees oh what times

[01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:25.650]
your break what time you get off that's all they're thinking about is when the hell they get off

[01:53:25.650 --> 01:53:31.150]
from work yeah that's not my idea if somebody really has their nose to the grindstone like Chris

[01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:35.410]
who wants to know how early can he come in and how late can he stay exactly yesterday's can he

[01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:38.710]
work that's only because he might make an extra couple of bucks something like that

[01:53:40.090 --> 01:53:43.170]
is that what you're thinking about when you come in in the morning how late can I stay and how much

[01:53:43.170 --> 01:53:47.430]
can I get done here today always how can and in Georgia you think of that how can I get done today

[01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:55.370]

[01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:25.170]
that we can do in the free so it used to be free world is to come up with this this piece of

[02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:59.150]
with uh with some hummus but it was good big with some hummus yeah it's real it's a real deal kosher

[02:01:59.150 --> 02:02:04.590]

[02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:19.350]
flee I was going he ran away as soon as he heard my voice he ran all right another call

[02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:24.210]
I called them said he's been there since the famous that's great it's great probably the owners

[02:02:24.210 --> 02:02:29.410]
that's okay the the menu looks sensational and one thing I will tell you is this there aren't too

[02:02:29.410 --> 02:02:33.410]
many bad delis although rumor once took me one in the Adamsville here remember that time he took me

[02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:38.850]
out here about a hundred miles out into like who knows where it was I have no idea I think he

[02:02:38.850 --> 02:02:42.670]
took me to Kingston or somewhere I may have never driven so far to get to such a mediocre place

[02:02:42.670 --> 02:02:49.270]
rumors favorite deli oh hey the tables were so small you were knocking these under the table

[02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:56.150]
which I think is what rumor wanted oh my god just to die from not to die for to die from but if

[02:02:56.150 --> 02:03:00.930]
you don't usually find bad delis and the reason that all the delis in town went out of business

[02:03:00.930 --> 02:03:05.690]
like the Carnegie Carnegie I'm trying to think where the hell it was you don't remember it

[02:03:06.570 --> 02:03:11.310]
nope was it on miracle mile and a gables or somewhere like that it was somewhere down south

[02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:16.290]
I never hung out there it was great in fact that's not the one I'm even thinking of the Carnegie

[02:03:16.290 --> 02:03:22.890]
deli was a different one this one began with an M Marshall majors Marshall majors not to be confused

[02:03:22.890 --> 02:03:27.130]
with stand major all right yeah the more you're the thing it's great it's great and they want to talk

[02:03:27.130 --> 02:03:31.410]
to you I don't want to I don't want to talk to them okay forget about it oh that's why hung

[02:03:31.410 --> 02:03:35.410]
up on a one they said that good I want to take calls we could do that you could punch

[02:03:35.410 --> 02:03:41.430]
about there but I don't want to Marshall majors now that was in the gables I'm going to google it

[02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:48.150]
during the break that place was great and the Carnegie deli used to be a sponsor but I wish to

[02:03:48.150 --> 02:03:52.650]
have a long time ago a million years ago I can't remember where the hell it was they weren't

[02:03:52.650 --> 02:03:59.270]
browards somewhere in browards for a lot of deli to be exact and it was really excellent but the

[02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:03.370]
problem with the delis is that all the old Jews stole the silver and the sweet and low and they

[02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:07.870]
put them out of business and you think I'm joking when I say that like more fees and pump or next

[02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:18.010]
I don't think you're joking it's a true story and anyway so you don't remember Marshall majors

[02:04:19.210 --> 02:04:24.790]
no I remember Marshall Mathers from that bad show you just haven't been around man you've been

[02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:28.770]
of course it's probably a hundred years ago yeah that's what happens when you get to be 500

[02:04:28.770 --> 02:04:32.210]
years away I told you the places where I lived down here all the places that you used to love

[02:04:32.210 --> 02:04:35.190]
and you ask everybody else oh I never heard of that that's because I live where you've been

[02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:39.750]
bought his dollars on when I lived down here before it was down there homestead leader city redlands

[02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:44.870]
yet I'm sorry for me that before you can't tell me that well you keep forgetting it you never got

[02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:52.050]
far away from home is that it instead I'm sure they got a lot of great kosher delis in homestead

[02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:58.630]
yeah for the gigantic kosher you don't have to be Jewish to love deli you know who loves deli

[02:04:59.790 --> 02:05:05.030]
black folks okay it's true I'll take your word for it I don't know what the reason is that the like

[02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:10.770]
but the black folks love deli what because it's good maybe yeah like in Detroit I mean like that

[02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:15.230]
when Dick Burton was talking to us and I had turned him on to lose finer deli contest now unfortunately

[02:05:15.230 --> 02:05:19.970]
like everything else in Detroit it went downhill and in the years since I left the turn and he tried

[02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:25.910]
it on my recommendation and said oh yeah it was horrible lose finer deli and when you'd go in there

[02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:29.790]
like at least 60 percent of the client though would be black of course I was in Detroit but nevertheless

[02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:34.870]
they had all these other restaurants to choose from they love deli man who doesn't love a great

[02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:42.290]
bowl of mots of all soup some fried crepe block this place sounds sensational I might just have

[02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:48.010]
to come down there and try but don't go there on Friday night because they're not going to be open

[02:05:48.010 --> 02:05:53.290]

so chicken egg is still using his ears credit cards what I hear it's more

[02:07:52.810 --> 02:08:00.350]
clock at 5 60 WQAM so I googled martial majors deli into my phone what nothing oh that's

[02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:06.570]
depressing that was a great place was in the gable somewhere somebody call up and tell Chris

[02:08:06.570 --> 02:08:12.030]
where the martial majors was now a Carnegie deli I don't have to I did google it wait till I

[02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:19.930]
tell you what I found but I wasn't it was in gallery and for a lottery okay give a rea Carnegie

[02:08:19.930 --> 02:08:26.570]
deli never heard of it the gallery yeah and so I googled Carnegie deli to find a soft photo

[02:08:26.570 --> 02:08:30.470]
one because I think there was more than one but there was that one for sure in lottery and I

[02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:35.790]
found from the New York Times in article July 30th 2002 two men are sentenced to life for slaying

[02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:43.110]
about Carnegie deli two government convicted of killing three people and woundy twitters

[02:08:43.110 --> 02:08:47.570]
an execution style shooting above the Carnegie deli contestant midtown Manhattan were sentenced

[02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:54.310]
to life in prison yesterday July 30th 2002 the killings on evening of May 10th last year were

[02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:59.310]
the result of a boxed attempt to steal marijuana and cash in an apartment above the deli on 7th

[02:08:59.310 --> 02:09:04.350]
avenue between 54th and 55th Street after the sound of gunfire sent people scrambling on the

[02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:09.150]
midtown streets outside the two gunmen fled the apartment and mancy lost in the crowds

[02:09:09.150 --> 02:09:15.830]
and he liked that above the Carnegie deli nothing kosher about that

[02:09:17.690 --> 02:09:22.170]
and once in these other delis weren't really strictly kosher but this one obviously is

[02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:26.930]
because any place that closes down friday night at sundown and doesn't open up again till Saturday

[02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:33.470]
at sundown yeah that's kosher can't get much more kosher than that speaking of kosher how do we

[02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:38.350]
do with our pan through ticket ticket ticket did we get rid of them all we don't know yes we got rid of them all

[02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:43.510]
did we really we did how do you know that you're just saying that okay i'm just about to call

[02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:50.050]

[02:09:54.630 --> 02:10:01.990]
crowd you know the uh they don't know them who it was in south Miami right right off 57th and sunset

[02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:08.810]
see that's back in my ws news days in the studio for w and ws was on lowlam road at pixie highway

[02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:14.370]
and what's the lowlam road like 70 six in the seventh 60 that very good excellent that's that's

[02:10:14.370 --> 02:10:20.810]
absolutely correct so this wasn't far from work this was right up the over she highway martial majors

[02:10:22.230 --> 02:10:26.970]
boy that was good see and people so you're living in the past and like you you get all bent out of

[02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:32.690]
shape when i do that think about the restaurants from the past just like those shows about the

[02:10:32.690 --> 02:10:44.010]
controversy the shows from the past with your friend reverie reverend show oh my god so many morons

[02:10:44.010 --> 02:10:50.310]
and so little time it's just it's staggering you know sure is so you had now somebody called and

[02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:54.410]
said they remembered martial majors that they just knew where it was uh they told me where the address

[02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:59.450]
was yeah that's okay but it was great and they ate there many times and it was fantastic they didn't

[02:10:59.450 --> 02:11:04.070]
say that much kneels got great taste in the deli and other uh Jew food and stuff and say that

[02:11:05.230 --> 02:11:12.130]
that's where it was though in south day boy how the times have changed uh now back in those days

[02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:20.070]
i lived in kindle office sunset on row 7th and kindle right off the corner there and then and remember

[02:11:20.070 --> 02:11:24.610]
we're talking about the supermarkets and it used to be uh whatever a grand grand union the grand

[02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:28.850]
union is long gone right why that i'd be like you know 50 years ago now that's right a hundred years

[02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:34.230]
ago what what do you expect i'm 140 years old that's when i was the young guy was only 40 a hundred

[02:11:34.230 --> 02:11:40.950]
years ago it was out right in the corner there was a grand union et cetera mm-hmm

[02:11:41.710 --> 02:11:44.490]
more in doubt right telly or nobody question mark

[02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:51.310]
well the cool cats away the Hillary my soul play marine says as Barack Obama was floating in the

[02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:55.170]
pool with his daughters the last few days in st. Thomas some fit and disciples were floating the

[02:11:55.170 --> 02:11:59.930]
idea of st. Hillary as his vice president she can't move without him said one Hillary advisor

[02:11:59.930 --> 02:12:05.010]
and he can't move without her they're stuck with each other it's one of my favorite movie formulas

[02:12:05.010 --> 02:12:10.510]
driving the dynamics in such classic says a few good men the big easy and guys and dolls charming

[02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:16.070]
good guy spars and crawls with no nonsense driven girl until they team up in the last real he

[02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:20.450]
spices up her life she stiffens his spine and soon they hear the pit or pattern of little super

[02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:24.570]
delicate feet who are thrilled not to be pulled in two directions anymore and everybody's happy

[02:12:24.570 --> 02:12:30.170]
or are they a couple weeks ago when hill and bill mentioned the possibility of a joint ticket it

[02:12:30.170 --> 02:12:34.290]
was an attempt to undermine Obama and urge voters and super delegates to put Hilary on top the

[02:12:34.290 --> 02:12:38.570]
implication was that this was the only way democrats could have both their stars and besides it

[02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:44.230]
the prokoshis boy wonder had plenty of time but with the math not in her favor in her options

[02:12:44.230 --> 02:12:51.030]
running out bill Richardson running out and uh why can't there's a word here that i can't read

[02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:55.730]
narrative of dodging bullets in Bosnia oh i see a lie and securing peace in northern

[02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:58.910]
arland on raveland could Hillary actually think the best presidency is the best she'll do

[02:12:59.750 --> 02:13:03.890]
one Hillary pal said she wouldn't want to go back to a center for lawmakers who'd abandon her for

[02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:07.850]
Obama and even if she could get to be a majority leader would it be much fun working with Nancy

[02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:11.110]
Pelosi who's just taste for the Clintons has led her to suddenly maneuver for Obama

[02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:16.090]
maybe the terminator is thinking if she could just get her pump in the door dig chainy after

[02:13:16.090 --> 02:13:19.590]
always able to run the white house in the world from the vice presidents residence calling every

[02:13:19.590 --> 02:13:24.070]
shot while serving under less experienced and younger president and observatory circle is just

[02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:28.390]
up to speak from where Hillary now lives but aside from Barack and Michelle Obama's certain

[02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:33.250]
resistance would it fly many Hillary voters are hardening against Obama and more and more Obama

[02:13:33.250 --> 02:13:37.390]
fans are getting turned off by the idea of dragging down the Obama brand with Clinton dysfunction

[02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:42.390]
no drama vote Obama pluckered in t-shirts are popping up at Obama rallies and one of his military

[02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:48.110]
advisory dubbed him no shock Barack it's hard to imagine that after spending her whole life playing

[02:13:48.110 --> 02:13:52.710]
second fiddle with superstar politician Hillary wants to do it again she's been vice president

[02:13:52.710 --> 02:13:56.790]
could the Veepe talk be a red herring? applaud design to distract attention from the Clintons

[02:13:56.790 --> 02:14:01.810]
real end game? even some kind of loyalists are wondering allowed if the wind at all cost

[02:14:01.810 --> 02:14:05.810]
strategy of Hill and Bill which continued Tuesday when Hillary tried to drag Reverend White back

[02:14:05.810 --> 02:14:10.150]
into spotlight is designed to rough up Obama so badly leave the party so driven that Obama will

[02:14:10.150 --> 02:14:14.910]
lose in November to John McCain if McCain only served one term Hillary would have one last shot

[02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:20.250]
on election day in 2012 she be 65 why also would Hillary suggest that McCain would be a better

[02:14:20.250 --> 02:14:24.510]
commander in chief than Obama and why also would Bill imply that Obama was less patriotic and

[02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:31.170]
attended by more static than McCain why also would fill singer Hillary spokesman Santa conference

[02:14:31.170 --> 02:14:35.070]
called the reporters on Tuesday that Obama was trying to disenfranchise the voters of Florida and

[02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:40.310]
when it comes to voting senator Obama's turn the audacity of hope into the audacity of nope he

[02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:44.830]
said adding there's a basic reality here which is we could have avoided the entire George W.

[02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:49.370]
Bush presidency if we'd accounted votes in Florida so a singer making the case that Obama's

[02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:54.070]
as anti-democratic as W. was when he snatched Florida from Al Gore some top Democrats are

[02:14:54.070 --> 02:14:57.890]
increasingly worried that the Clintons divide and conquer strategy is nihilistic Hillary or no

[02:14:57.890 --> 02:15:02.630]

tanya harding option if she can't get the gold knee cap arrival after all the Clintons think

[02:15:08.710 --> 02:15:12.450]
of themselves as the Democratic Party when Bill and Dick Moore's triangulated the first term it

[02:15:12.450 --> 02:15:16.910]
was what was best for Bill not for the party in 96 when Bill turned the White House into motel

[02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:21.110]
1600 for fundraisers it was more about his reelection than the reelection of fellow Democrats in

[02:15:21.110 --> 02:15:24.990]
Congress in 2000 the White House focused its energies more on Hillary Senate when the

[02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:29.410]
Al Gore's presidential run and even Clinton supporters know that Bill doesn't want to be replaced

[02:15:29.410 --> 02:15:33.430]

[02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:05.970]

[02:22:05.970 --> 02:22:11.210]
crits screw up on my computer I say that when you huh all the time it freezes up what what does

[02:22:11.210 --> 02:22:17.190]

[02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:21.850]
your life no you guys are supposed to be the computer expert I I'm telling you it's Murphy's law

[02:22:21.850 --> 02:22:27.330]
of computers you want to do it it's gonna blow up just freezes up your computer and you have to

[02:22:27.330 --> 02:22:32.670]
like do all kinds of a stand on your head to get the dancing back to a fox fire fire fire fox fire

[02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:38.590]
anyway and it was an article about four Lauderdale working harder than any other city in the U.S.

[02:22:38.590 --> 02:22:43.210]
to the spirit spring breakers and Nikki Grossman was going on with her big fat mouth

[02:22:43.210 --> 02:22:47.690]
oh yeah it's wonderful we had to work very hard but we finally got all those punts out of here

[02:22:47.690 --> 02:22:49.970]

[02:23:07.370 --> 02:23:11.270]
so I can't find too much about the while the Carnegie deli is still in New York I'm sure and the

[02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:15.350]
people saw a photo had a chance to have a really and they didn't want it they said here's a great

[02:23:15.350 --> 02:23:20.490]

[02:23:20.490 --> 02:23:26.070]
they don't want that's why I wish the best elective is new famous kosher deli whatever it is

[02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:30.390]
and having sure because if it's really great now I would imagine in that area that it would be

[02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:36.130]
when you I imagine and I bet it is I imagine they do a hell of a business man area where

[02:23:36.130 --> 02:23:41.350]

[02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:10.510]
Consequo claims Rodriguez paid him back by ogling his then white Jessica

[02:26:10.510 --> 02:26:15.450]
Consequo and Rodriguez are working out a Consequo's Florida home when Payrod made his admiration obvious

[02:26:15.950 --> 02:26:20.450]
the first day he was there my then white Jessica joined us in the gym and a rod's eyes bugged

[02:26:20.450 --> 02:26:25.170]
right out of his head Consequo wrote man your wife is the most beautiful one I've ever seen Payrod said

[02:26:25.170 --> 02:26:31.430]
later Consequo added Rodriguez began calling Jessica on her cell phone I'm not a jealous man he says

[02:26:31.430 --> 02:26:35.650]
but I can see that Payrod a bachelor at that time was Jonesing from my wife

[02:26:37.570 --> 02:26:41.350]
Consequo's book and Skidzel be released on Tuesday and I want to say to him that I was yesterday

[02:26:42.690 --> 02:26:46.650]
Oh next Tuesday but publisher Simon and Tuesday started shipping copies this week the

[02:26:46.650 --> 02:26:50.610]
New York Daily News obtained a copy yesterday after online columnist Joe Levin first report on

[02:26:50.610 --> 02:26:55.490]
the contents of the book Rodriguez didn't join Yankee's winner Haven Tuesday for the game with

[02:26:55.490 --> 02:26:59.670]
the engines but as you left legends feel and travel is asked about the book he told the AP I have

[02:26:59.670 --> 02:27:05.730]
absolutely no reaction absolutely asked about the portion pertaining Consequo's ex-wife

[02:27:05.730 --> 02:27:10.710]
Rodriguez said I don't know how to answer that reached by phone Consequo's team myth that his

[02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:14.350]
book would be available a week early I can't give a comment on till Simon and Tuesday's okay

[02:27:14.350 --> 02:27:19.270]
is it so we're gonna have to wait Consequo also writes that he's not 100% sure that Roger Clemens

[02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:26.170]
used steroids but he sure sounds like he is according to the books I saw Clemens would sometimes say

[02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:31.710]
he was off to get a B12 shot a known synonym in club houses for steroids when a teammate

[02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:36.590]
homework Clemens would say such things as man you must have had your juice this morning he's

[02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:42.330]
talking about Apple use even when a television's most respected reporter is this thrown into the

[02:27:42.330 --> 02:27:47.050]
mix Mike Wallace in 86 privately grilled Consequo about the benefits of steroids and human growth hormone

[02:27:47.050 --> 02:27:52.130]
after interviewing Consequo in 2005 when the camera stopped rolling Wallace asked me if we could

[02:27:52.130 --> 02:27:56.670]
talk off camera Consequo writes he kept me there for another hour clearly curious about steroids

[02:27:56.670 --> 02:28:00.490]
he wondered how the steroids in human growth hormone might help him a man in his 80s

[02:28:00.490 --> 02:28:04.430]
little longer healthier life he wanted to know everything well now Mike Wallace is on steroids

[02:28:05.210 --> 02:28:10.730]
all right Consequo also writes that he injected maglio or donias of the tiger several times with

[02:28:10.730 --> 02:28:14.890]
steroids earlier this year the times he ported a Consequo to keep ordonias out of the book

[02:28:14.890 --> 02:28:21.830]
if ordonias invested five million dollars for a film that Consequo is producing sounds like a

[02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:25.990]
higher price Consequo writes in the book that the times charges not two and he wasn't involved in

[02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:31.050]
the documentary I met mags in 2001 when I was with the white socks Consequo writes when all was

[02:28:31.050 --> 02:28:35.950]
said and done when mags had the information in the 80 told me he was in a few days later we went

[02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:40.450]
in the back room in a clubhouse and I jabbed a needle into his butt oh he said that hurt you got

[02:28:40.450 --> 02:28:48.990]
to get used to it I said oh he said kind of like the don't taste me guy oh Andy wouldn't that his name Andy

[02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:55.690]
that was Andy from Western right were you so surprised Gator that that you remembered that

[02:28:55.690 --> 02:29:01.910]
he wasn't even cute right exactly Consequo writes that he will bottom I'm going to tell you man

[02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:06.450]
it's Steven straight in that movie wasn't in that movie again the covenant that's

[02:29:06.450 --> 02:29:12.370]
that's got all my I'm going to tell you at any rate Consequo writes that he wanted to include his

[02:29:12.370 --> 02:29:15.830]
suspicions about films in his first book juice but the publisher wouldn't let him according to

[02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:19.430]
source close to the publishing house Harper Collins the names included net book were ones about which

[02:29:19.430 --> 02:29:24.830]
Consequo had first hand knowledge of use oh Consequo writes a comment he made about Clemens to 60

[02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:28.730]
minutes in the S.P.N. were mysteriously ended out of the reports Consequo began to think there was

[02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:34.910]
some sort of conspiracy efforts specifically Roger Clemens was from Texas he went to play for the

[02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:39.110]
Astro to be close to his family George W. Bush are former owner of the Texas Rangers baseball

[02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:44.910]
theme is like Clemens are proud Texan Clemens is a personal friend of Bořinion and his wife Barbara

[02:29:46.590 --> 02:29:51.030]
with her Marty Feldman eyes Clemens still has a standing invitation from Bořinion to visit the

[02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:54.690]
White House anytime he wants getting the picture maybe the president of the U.S. or his daddy the

[02:29:54.690 --> 02:30:00.730]
X-Preson made some calls and took care of things for old Roger says Jose Clemens attorney Rusty

[02:30:00.730 --> 02:30:05.130]
Hart and Clemens spokesman Joe Household didn't return calls he can comment but Clemens gets

[02:30:05.130 --> 02:30:09.650]
Higley treatment of the book and per day Rod can say go in one chapter by saying so a Rod if

[02:30:09.650 --> 02:30:12.870]
you're reading this book and I'm not getting through the let's get clear I want thing I hate your

[02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:18.530]
blanking guts well how do you like that I hate your effing guts pay Rod that's what soze can suck

[02:30:18.530 --> 02:30:28.050]
us yeah woo heavy duty so what do you think Jose can suck or Pete Rose the figures come back

[02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:35.030]
Chris I'll go to say come you think Chris is the bigger uh yes I do he's the best

[02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.550]
kind of thing

[02:30:41.290 --> 02:30:50.410]
well a couple years ago I made some money I didn't pay taxes on the government's got plenty of money

[02:30:50.410 --> 02:30:56.670]
they don't need your taxes dramatically higher taxes it's tax rate my grades and I know why

[02:30:56.670 --> 02:31:01.710]
the headaches always come around tax time keep that and I gotta fill in the lines and get it in

[02:31:01.710 --> 02:31:08.390]
on time oh I know tax forms of a pain to think and fill in the mouth man it really stinks I'm

[02:31:08.390 --> 02:31:15.030]
doing all this so they can take but pay yes they can't cap away it's so unreal but a fact you know I'm

[02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:20.650]
in a matrix of pencils and numbers and no spots have my receipts long ago how I'll ever get to this

[02:31:20.650 --> 02:31:26.130]
I just don't know as we love and cry even though I try and it all fell apart right from the start

[02:31:26.130 --> 02:31:34.090]
what it means to me it just means to read equal fantasy try so hard and then get far

[02:31:34.610 --> 02:31:46.190]
this is the end someone who fits this matter pay to go to step girl in the end there will

[02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:56.770]
be better in your tax time coming up the burden of taxes has shifted from the wealthy to the

[02:31:56.770 --> 02:32:07.810]
middle class that sucks clear it is hello there is there is bozo man 132 560 WK don't forget to

[02:32:07.810 --> 02:32:13.070]
do I George this Friday speaking of plunging your guts off a gallstream from 10 to 2 come

[02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:16.430]
by for great horse racing played a little bit of poker maybe hit the slots for big money like

[02:32:16.430 --> 02:32:21.110]
that the lady of one or one point one million plus in dressing great food and very strong George

[02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:26.570]
gets ready for the Florida Derby with his handicrapping I got to leave the noon on Friday so you're

[02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:30.670]
on your own I got an expert we're going to have a hopefully we're going to try to get it lined up

[02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:36.790]
a nice lady that will give us a nice handicap he's nice lady and George is trying to he's

[02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:41.410]
trying to line up a nice lady for the golf team show or act out of the golf team several nice ladies

[02:32:41.410 --> 02:32:48.370]
right yeah okay whatever good luck to him thank you Mike Lupica writes in the New York Daily news

[02:32:48.370 --> 02:32:55.070]
I thought Mike Lupica only wrote about sports Chris okay all the way does any I know he likes

[02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:58.930]
the Rothport a lot but I guess all we just made sure Roger Clemens in the story so I guess

[02:32:58.930 --> 02:33:03.490]
that makes it kosher the headline on the story governor Patterson and Hillary Clinton need to stop

[02:33:03.490 --> 02:33:08.710]
telling stories it goes one in two ways for David Patterson another politician out in New York

[02:33:08.710 --> 02:33:13.810]
who doesn't know when to shut up any more than swirly Clinton does here's one Patterson continues

[02:33:13.810 --> 02:33:17.870]
to give us way more information about his past and any of us ever needed and they run him out of

[02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:22.410]
all but he's faster than his predecessor and working girls on hotel rooms the other is that he

[02:33:22.410 --> 02:33:27.650]
stops giving interviews now stop acting as as if that's his day job and begins to show if he

[02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:31.430]
actually is seen chops if he has the chops for a job he clearly never expected to have a

[02:33:31.430 --> 02:33:35.450]
near as when he was in the words of late grade Warren Zevan making out like Charlie Sheen

[02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:41.110]
if Patterson can manage that an old Albany boss named Joe Bruno I end ends up acting governor

[02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:44.950]
for a few months then Mike Bloomberg gets a special election he wants in the fall and Bloomberg

[02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:50.030]
essentially succeeds one kind of frisky crusader spitzer the way he did when he succeeded another

[02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:56.230]
frisky crusader Rudy Giuliani to become the mayor of New York Bloomberg says he's not interested

[02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:59.750]
in being governor generally with him when he says one thing about his political ambitions it's

[02:33:59.750 --> 02:34:04.290]
show it all down and bet the other way so that's one scenario for Patterson one that takes him across

[02:34:04.290 --> 02:34:09.130]
clown line forever the other is that he really does learn how to stop acting as if he's talking

[02:34:09.130 --> 02:34:14.710]
to doctor Phil instead to us because up to now the only thing David Patterson hasn't told us

[02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:19.030]
is that he had a dog sniper firing his way to his next girlfriend Patterson apparently

[02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:23.290]
expected to request to start singing happy days are here again because he's the governor

[02:34:23.290 --> 02:34:27.070]
who didn't have to pay for it even as college kids start to think hanging with him would be a lot

[02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:31.870]
more fun on spring break than going to Florida Patterson is a progressive and decent guy

[02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:35.690]
sent him in Richard Brodsky someone who knows Patterson from Albany was saying yesterday but he

[02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:39.010]
needs to understand that the political climate in this country right now the whole president's

[02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:42.830]
elections about character if there's one message that the American people are sending it's that

[02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:47.390]
we all ought to be listening Brodsky Hillary Clinton's supporter was asked if that includes the US

[02:34:47.390 --> 02:34:51.050]
senator from New York as well as the new governor of the state it means all of us he said

[02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:55.550]
but both the governor of New York and the senator from New York had called out on character now

[02:34:55.550 --> 02:35:01.150]
in judgment why because neither knows when to zip zip it that's why Patterson keeps telling us all

[02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:04.510]
about the women he said send up a flare if you think there aren't more to come and his delta

[02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:09.150]
house passed in Hillary Clinton talks herself into a world of trouble by making a trip to Bosnia

[02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:13.890]
in 1996 sound as if we're seen out of black off down when it wasn't anything of the kind

[02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:21.970]
what's this facts oh I see it's about a deli this is what senator Clinton said last week in

[02:35:21.970 --> 02:35:25.670]
the speech referencing the trip to Bosnia and remind another example of her former careers in

[02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:30.030]
international troubleshooter remember landing under sniper fire there was supposed to be some kind

[02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:34.510]
of greeting at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get to vehicles to get

[02:35:34.510 --> 02:35:39.170]
into vehicles to go to our base that was last week on Monday here's where Clinton said when I

[02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:43.670]
asked about the trip to Bosnia that communist will bunch of they filled off your daily news we had

[02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:47.510]
to have our bulletproof stuff on because of the threat of sniper fire I was also told that the

[02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:51.270]
greeting ceremony would move away from the tarmac but there was this eight-year-old girl and I

[02:35:51.270 --> 02:35:55.450]
I can't rush by her I've got to release greet her so I greeted her I took her stuff and then I left

[02:35:55.950 --> 02:36:04.390]
now that's my recollection of it when pressed on the issue of her credibility by a bunch she

[02:36:04.390 --> 02:36:08.810]
continued I think that a minor blip you know if some if I said something like that you know I say

[02:36:08.810 --> 02:36:12.370]
a lot of things millions of words a day so if I miss more than this spoke that was a mistake

[02:36:13.470 --> 02:36:17.410]
when she talks about how she misspoke and this statement she starts to sound like Roger Clemens

[02:36:17.410 --> 02:36:21.850]
knows she means exactly what she said originally there was a story that she thought she could get

[02:36:21.850 --> 02:36:25.810]
by with and a campaign built on this welfare of a notion that she was practically co-president

[02:36:25.810 --> 02:36:30.690]
of the U.S. ones you can only imagine the hysterical reaction from her spokesman howling Wilson if

[02:36:30.690 --> 02:36:34.930]
Obama's version of something was this far from the truth she originally talked about being worried

[02:36:34.930 --> 02:36:38.730]
about sniper fire running for cover will but I'd say yesterday then you look at the footage and

[02:36:38.730 --> 02:36:43.230]
there's your daughter Chelsea standing right there next right next to her the mea's kite while both of

[02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:47.870]
is it why the new governor of New York looks more honest when talking about women on the side

[02:36:47.870 --> 02:36:51.470]
than women running for president looks talking about a trip abroad yesterday Clinton was still

[02:36:51.470 --> 02:36:55.450]
answering questions about Bosnia even if she desperately wanted to change the subject back to Barack

[02:36:55.450 --> 02:36:59.970]
Obama's pastor saying again she misspoke and then adding this I'm a human in which you know

[02:36:59.970 --> 02:37:08.090]
is for some people a revelation not so much says my clupe are you there right here okay I

[02:37:08.090 --> 02:37:13.070]
thought I lost you oh here you are you didn't want to hear it because it's by my clupe who

[02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:17.590]
usually talks about sports he didn't mention Roger Clemens okay either way that was good

[02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:21.450]
and what's even better is we got enough votes on there we got what 432

[02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:30.290]
I bet if I refresh it we got more than 433 woo they're pouring in by the ones man we need only 17

[02:37:30.290 --> 02:37:37.630]
votes to get that 450 and you got 23 minutes to do it hold it. Puerto Rican Ralph says I last time in

[02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:41.930]
New York City either the Carnegie deli at 57th Street I was greeted by the owner who was a big fat

[02:37:41.930 --> 02:37:46.250]
Jew then we had a nice bowl of Jewish penicillin and then we had pastrami on the table they had pickles

[02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:51.970]
and coleslaw so the one here if it's closed they're missing the best in the world also it says

[02:37:51.970 --> 02:37:59.690]
the reservations for Vancouver been made air for hotel oh good deal good deal you want to go to a

[02:37:59.690 --> 02:38:03.690]
really great hotel by the way in Vancouver certain places my recommendation route right downtown

[02:38:03.690 --> 02:38:08.670]
right to middle of things it's a beautiful I don't remember if it's that expensive but you like it

[02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:12.850]
so have a good time in Vancouver Ralph and thanks for the Carnegie deli yeah we had it and it's gone

[02:38:12.850 --> 02:38:19.270]
and once it's gone they don't come back it's gone you know what's that yep like the famous thing

[02:38:19.270 --> 02:38:23.010]
now another famous may have absolutely nothing to do with the original of famous because this one's

[02:38:23.010 --> 02:38:30.290]
called famous kosher deli but I have a feeling they're you know playing on the name because it's

[02:38:30.290 --> 02:38:36.090]
I think the third or fourth time they brought back a famous deli and I'm going to give it a

[02:38:36.090 --> 02:38:39.330]
try if it's as good as the one on Miami Beach man I'm going to rave about it even if they don't

[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:44.380]
buy any spots I'll rave about it until the cows come home see once about a time I would discover

[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:49.480]
a food product or a restaurant or something really good and I go on the air and I'd rave about it

[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:53.000]
and then before you know we'd be doing spots for them they become a sponsor you know like the way

[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.240]
we're selling the radio you'll be happy no Pete Lenny came in and to get the name of that place

[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:01.840]
and he's gonna go call on them there you go a real real professional zoo I mean salesman

[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:07.140]
Pete Lenny good for him even though he isn't asked his sir but you know he knows what he knows

[02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:15.080]
what it takes to survive in his doggy dog world dog he's a hustler he hustles he does he

[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:19.300]
goes out there and he makes calls you know as a plan as opposed to some of the people like Brian

[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:23.660]
Schmutz who come back from oblivion wherever the hell he went to and they blow away whatever spots

[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:30.540]
we had on the air it's just amazing I could write a chapter in a book the book you keep telling me

[02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:34.120]
I'm gonna write a chapter just about the sales department and how they've destroyed everything

[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:39.500]
it took me 32 years to build up it's just amazing to me astonishing shocking

[02:39:41.020 --> 02:39:45.060]
and of course keep in mind we don't we don't really get to hear the story behind the story you know

[02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:49.740]
what I mean mm-hmm like the story with Pony Thiel we don't know what really went on there that

[02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:55.740]
pissed him off so bad which he keeps telling us it's the sales department 434 votes you need 16

[02:39:55.740 --> 02:39:56.660]

I'm 46 and 560 WKM, we got jerks back now for another

[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:27.280]
Gettin' it's ready for another heat loss

[02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:30.520]
I'm in games they got love, hopefully not too many

[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:32.380]
What about Tanner, so far?

[02:41:32.380 --> 02:41:35.000]
Oh, too many, way too many, I would say 10 do many

[02:41:35.980 --> 02:41:39.640]
Anyway, Sean the a pull guy from Hollywood says despite the potential actor effect

[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:41.980]
I seriously stumbled upon the best way to make a stake

[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:45.940]
Granger's stake to medium rear, slap it on the cutting board and slice it up

[02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:48.060]
Stir fry it for 90 seconds in butter

[02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:51.760]
Salt pepper and maybe some garlic, serve on a TV tray in the bathroom

[02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:53.740]
That's cute

[02:41:53.740 --> 02:41:54.460]
What a...

[02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:57.080]
He says the butter really does it in more ways than one

[02:41:57.080 --> 02:41:59.180]
Stake butter, salt and pepper garlic

[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:02.720]
One to two tablespoons of steak

[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:05.040]
Why see, he's got the amount of each ingredient

[02:42:05.780 --> 02:42:08.100]
And he says two each medium depends on the diapers

[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:10.120]
They have five game flutton

[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:12.080]
No, that's, see, I totally didn't, it was way too many

[02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:15.300]
PS, please mention time location of Georgia's next appearance

[02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:16.420]
You think I need to do that again?

[02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:18.620]
Georgia via Gulfstream Friday, 10 to 2

[02:42:18.620 --> 02:42:21.060]
Now where exactly are you going to be hanging it out at Gulfstream?

[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:26.340]
It's in the same place, the finish line, casino right there, it's in the middle, very hard to miss

[02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:28.460]
It's hard to miss, Sean

[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:29.440]
Kind of the ground floor

[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:33.100]
Right next to the... what do they call it?

[02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:34.940]
Where they parade the whole shion

[02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:36.080]
No, where they parade the way

[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:36.460]
Oh, are you a ring?

[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:37.500]
Walking ring?

[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:39.920]
Yeah, like the... not the promenade, not the...

[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:40.480]
It starts with the...

[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:41.020]
Walking ring

[02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:41.780]
It starts with a P

[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:44.960]
It starts with a P

[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:45.560]
Yeah

[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:50.300]
I want to say promenade but I'm sure that's not it

[02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:51.720]
The paddock, something like that

[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:53.140]
The paddock, yeah, there we go

[02:42:53.140 --> 02:42:54.620]
Right there, right there next to that

[02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:57.220]
Who does have probably the best early speed

[02:42:57.220 --> 02:43:01.000]
of the speeds in here today and she's coming up from Gulfstream Park

[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:02.060]
See how do you like that?

[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:03.180]
Is that a homeowner or what?

[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:04.320]
Woo, heavy duty

[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:06.860]
It's the third race of equinox him in its way

[02:43:06.860 --> 02:43:09.000]
And if Sean shows up he can be part of our

[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:12.400]
betting seminar class that we're going to take there at 1 o'clock

[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:13.780]
How do you know he knows anything about betting?

[02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:15.700]
It's for people that don't know anything

[02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:16.100]
I see

[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:17.880]
It's going to get that girl to take us by the hand

[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:18.680]
Gently, I hope

[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:20.980]
And walk us through the bus

[02:43:20.980 --> 02:43:23.000]
Well, my way at least got pounded by Boston six two last night

[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.400]
We'll lose in Boston again tomorrow night

[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:24.780]
They're done

[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:25.960]
Panthers are done

[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:27.440]
It's better that last spot

[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:29.560]
We have, we'll take the money though, thank you

[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:31.860]
Hillary Clinton, Tuesday, we vived the route

[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:33.800]
over fiery racial rhetoric by democratic

[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:35.280]
Fobarak Obama's former pastor

[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:37.460]
As she tried to dodge that storm over her

[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:40.140]
Overblown account of the 96 trip to Bosnia

[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:42.100]
With a White House race again

[02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:42.940]
Consumed by bitterness

[02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:44.720]
The New York Center said she would have left the church

[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:46.780]
Had her pastor come out with a march like those of

[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:48.160]
Reverend Jeremiah Wright

[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:52.080]
The Obama campaign accused her trying to deflect from her own embarrassment

[02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:54.560]
After she admitted that her claims that she dodged sniper

[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:56.260]
Fired during the Bosnia trip as first lady

[02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:57.480]
Were untwool

[02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:59.400]
How come they keep using all these

[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:00.440]
They're lie

[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:01.380]
That's all lie

[02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:02.120]
L.I.E.

[02:44:02.140 --> 02:44:03.520]
Okay, not a misstatement

[02:44:03.520 --> 02:44:05.360]
Not untwool, a freaking lie

[02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:08.040]
I made a mistake that happens

[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:08.760]
It proves I'm human

[02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:09.960]
Which for some people's revelation

[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:11.080]
She said is the controversy

[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.460]
Raged, distracting from her claims of high level

[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:14.880]
Foreign policy experience

[02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:19.060]
In addition to which what if the story was true

[02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:20.660]
What if she did have to dodge sniper fart

[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:23.080]
What does that have to do with foreign policy experience

[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:25.080]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:26.300]
She wrote on a jet

[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:28.160]
You know she'd been to foreign places

[02:44:28.660 --> 02:44:30.900]
And what about the pilot? How come he can't be president

[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:32.600]
Then good at the pirate?

[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:33.100]
Are

[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:35.420]
She used that same news conference in Pennsylvania

[02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:37.240]
To pointedly discuss Wright who after

[02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:38.960]
We could choosing not to comment on the issue

[02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:41.280]
I think even all we've seen and heard

[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:42.420]
He would not have been my pastor

[02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:42.960]
Flynn said

[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:45.200]
We don't have a choice when it comes to our relatives

[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:47.120]
We do have a choice when it comes to our pastors

[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:48.320]
And the church we attend

[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:52.560]
The fewer prompted Obama to give a landmark speech

[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:54.100]
On racial reconciliation last week

[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:55.300]
Which appeared to quiet the storm

[02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:57.200]
But Republican commentators denounced him

[02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:58.500]
For refusing to disown Wright

[02:44:58.500 --> 02:44:59.280]
And the drama

[02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:01.020]
Which some analysts could say could hurt Obama

[02:45:01.020 --> 02:45:01.660]
With the drama

[02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:03.040]
With working class wide voters

[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:05.000]
Looks set to be a general election issue

[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:05.840]
If he wins an nomination

[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:08.900]
Obama spoke to him in Bill Burton

[02:45:08.900 --> 02:45:10.740]
Accused to a worry of bringing up race row

[02:45:10.740 --> 02:45:12.940]
The race row to cloud her own embarrassment

[02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:16.000]
After originally refusing to play politics with this issue

[02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:17.340]
It's disappointing to see

[02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:19.060]
Swellery's campaign sink to this low

[02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:20.120]
And a transparent effort

[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:22.540]
To distract attention away from the story she made up about

[02:45:22.540 --> 02:45:25.000]
Dodging sniper fire in Bosnia he said

[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.080]
The truth is Barack Obama has already spoken out against his pastor's offensive comments

[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:30.720]
And addressed the issue of race in America

[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:31.720]
With a deeply personal

[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:33.620]
And uncommonly honest speech

[02:45:36.780 --> 02:45:37.640]
How do you like that?

[02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:39.160]
Every time he makes a mistake

[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:40.680]
Or somebody makes a mistake in the word

[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:42.680]
She just falls in a puddle of mud

[02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:46.020]
Her attempts to chase down former Obama

[02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:47.660]
More complicated by the Bosnian snap

[02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:50.840]
Which arrivals aids her frame does an example of her dishonesty

[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:53.900]
And her overstating is for her foreign policy experience

[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:55.720]
It's been a very long campaign

[02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:58.880]
The laughing cleanse and interview with Pittsburgh Radio Station KDK

[02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:00.500]
I didn't misspeak the other day

[02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:00.780]
Right

[02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:01.360]
Lire

[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:06.640]
Obama is quickly pointed release for the recasement stretching back to December

[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:08.340]
When she recalled coming under fire

[02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:11.800]
When she landed at Tuzla Air Base on March 25th 1996

[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:13.880]
She's got this habit of misspeaking

[02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:15.840]
In other words, she's got Greg Reed syndrome

[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:16.920]
She lies a lot

[02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:21.980]
She lies like a trooper man like a champ

[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:26.440]
Don't let me forget to give away that thing tomorrow

[02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:28.000]
All right

[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:28.980]
That meal

[02:46:28.980 --> 02:46:29.940]
That's significant

[02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:31.240]
Put the reminder right here on the

[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:34.180]
443 Chris is knocking on heaven's door now

[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:35.820]
Knocked on the edge

[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.300]
450 we got it already how do you like that I

[02:46:39.300 --> 02:46:41.260]
I didn't

[02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:42.800]
Refreshed it

[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:45.460]
And it came 450

[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:47.820]
That was a great line by Sean on there

[02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:49.900]
Yeah

[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:51.960]
About to the pins

[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:54.080]
He did on a TV tray in the bathroom

[02:46:56.100 --> 02:46:58.460]
Where our gold steam takes most of the meals I understand

[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:02.300]
Why do you say that because we have a bit of him doing just that

[02:47:02.300 --> 02:47:07.100]
Oh, we can't play that no are you crazy art of dumping where he's got a TV tray in the bathroom

[02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:07.940]
Yeah, right

[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:10.880]
Well, when you're that fat you have to have food with you all the time

[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:12.940]
You're looking for the glory holes for L

[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:16.840]
I just every time I think about him it just brings a tear to my eye

[02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:20.720]
Because in spite of all his bombacity and all of his um

[02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:24.940]
You know not knowing where to draw the line and just being over the age all the time

[02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:26.420]
He really is a sweet guy

[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:28.260]
He's here he means well. Yes, he is

[02:47:28.820 --> 02:47:30.260]
He means well, but you know

[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:32.080]
so did uh

[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:35.460]
Genghis Khan no he didn't

[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:39.140]
During by 80 Cobb in the fourth race of the anchors remember 80 Cobb no

[02:47:39.580 --> 02:47:39.980]
Uh

[02:47:40.980 --> 02:47:45.760]
What do you know about how about corn? I do I remember corn and I do like that Indian corn man

[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:50.880]
Now is that is there really such a thing or is that just the way you cook it maze what is maze corn? Willy corn

[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:57.820]
But it means it just any old kind of corn is not maze. That's another word for corn. It is yes. Get out of here

[02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.240]
I thought maze was like with different colored the kernels. No

[02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:06.460]
And was the kernel colored it depends on which kernel you're talking about the one with the chicken

[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:09.300]
Okay, that's colored white very white

[02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:12.660]
450 votes on a pool. Here's the deal

[02:48:13.780 --> 02:48:19.820]
Which part of the newspaper do you always read? I don't read newspapers 90 20% don't read newspapers

[02:48:20.780 --> 02:48:22.720]
And of course if software to have one they might
