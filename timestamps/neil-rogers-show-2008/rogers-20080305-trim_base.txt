[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.860]
You did a lot of things

[00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.760]
I did a lot of things

[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.900]
With your hydrogen sports hall radio

[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.000]
W2A-L

[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.500]
Star about the Earth

[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.160]
And, well, the Earth

[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.100]
We don't want you around

[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.800]
So won't you drop that please

[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.760]
Absolutely

[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.160]
You're an old and daughtering

[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.440]
Grantee has been

[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.440]
We should have been a lot of in the loony bin

[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.600]
A brain dead of element

[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.020]
We go to school and wear the same suit

[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.580]
You bought in 1966

[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560]
Now, yeah, yeah, you're out there

[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.360]
You're up to us all of the Earth

[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.780]
Put the pruning head back up your butt

[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.860]
And choke on a battery on the man on my

[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.680]
To drive your core

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.180]
There's nothing to a tree

[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.080]
That was my first car I've told you that a thousand times

[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.680]
Have I ever known a million times? Yes, you have

[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460]
That 1960 Corvair, a little blue Corvair

[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.120]
That it explode

[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.960]
That it explode

[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.960]

[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.080]
Did it blow up?

[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.860]
Well, it did not blow up

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.020]
And I did have to change a fan belt a couple of times

[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.740]
That was the thing with those Corvairs

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.300]
So I'm told

[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.920]
Fan belts kept breaking why?

[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.860]
So I'm told?

[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.740]
Yeah, but other than that

[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.060]
I think I put about 150,000 miles in it, little baby

[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.100]
60 Corvair, I'm going to go out and give me another one

[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.660]
Okay

[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.520]
Probably pretty good on my words, wouldn't you think?

[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.220]
I'm out there

[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.780]
Thank you, Mr. President, for those little gas prices

[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.740]
By the way, and for that worthless American dollar

[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.440]
That you could wipe your own ass with

[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.480]
God

[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.300]
So, do your Zack say he's got a 295 now?

[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.540]
Yeah, he's got a 295

[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.220]
I have a contest between Chris and Zack

[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.480]
Yes, we're up to

[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.000]
See who dies last

[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.400]
Chris is leaving earlier day by the way

[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.040]
He might have to because of his root canal

[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.760]
His baby root canal

[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.620]
Oh

[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.080]
You're not speaking, is that it?

[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.000]
Are you jarred, Aiken?

[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.500]
It's a little...

[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.460]
Well, he'll leave early now

[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.640]
You understand what's going to happen to George at two o'clock

[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.480]
He's going to be called in on the carpet again

[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.740]
To explain why

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.220]
To explain why you had to leave early

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.560]
Well, maybe Joe doesn't care about him

[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.380]
Yeah, or maybe I'll just walk by that way

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.740]
And I'll say Joe, I'm going home early

[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.040]
Oh, I wouldn't do that

[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.440]
You'll never make it home

[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.780]
You'll never make it to your baby root canal

[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.360]
Well, I don't know, maybe he should have taken the day off if you're not feeling well

[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.660]
Because you've got to really be on top of your game to be on this show

[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.640]
If you want to mail it in

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.520]
Yeah, well...

[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.840]
You're the sirens again out there, man

[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.040]
It's snowed and ice and freezing, right?

[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.220]
This is...

[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.200]
It's the fifth of March already for crying out loud

[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.660]
With somebody tell the weather guy, somebody tell what's his name

[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.100]
Faced the ball there on the CTV that they're kind of into

[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.160]
And all of this, Jesus

[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.780]
How about a nice spring day with a sunshine and about 65 degrees?

[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.500]
That would be nice

[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.840]
God

[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.740]
Anyway, that's swallery, man

[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.820]
He just won't go away

[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.240]
You know what? Really bugs the hell out of me

[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.920]
Of course, you know what you got in the Ohio?

[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.720]
Is a bunch of real blue collar and those picking...

[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.300]
Ohio always screws everything up

[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.520]
Yeah

[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.720]
She will never buy ten points

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.100]
And then in Texas where she'd eat at a three point win

[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.660]
But she lost in the caucuses

[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.720]
It's all screwed up

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.720]
But nevertheless, in Texas, you got all those Mexicans, you know

[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.860]
And you know what they say about those

[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.280]
No, what do they say?

[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.360]
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton handed it at the possibility of a democratic dream ticket with Senator Barack Obama

[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.160]
Speaking on the early show to the NCBS, swallery said that this may be where it's headed

[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.820]
But we have to decide who's on top of the ticket

[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.100]
We're going to have them together maybe, but we have to figure out who's going to be on top

[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.360]
Clinton said the race between her and Obama arranged incredibly close with just smidgings of difference between them

[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.380]
Right, only he's got about an 85-dug of lead

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.660]
And she ain't never going to overcome that

[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.660]
Because he's going to win in Wyoming and in North Carolina and in Mississippi

[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.260]
And then of course, Pennsylvania, which is a seven weeks away, even if she wins Pennsylvania, she's still going to be well behind

[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.400]
I got a story about that about how these statistics go

[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.460]
It's almost impossible for her to win on delegates

[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.340]
Almost impossible

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.560]
So in Sputel last night, it says she won Rhode Island, Ado, Highland, Texas

[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.820]
And she got lawleth in Vermont, Ben and Jerry are probably happy about that

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.400]
He pasted her by 22 points in Vermont, but she also pasted him in Rhode Island

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.840]
I don't understand a lot of these states, I don't get it

[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.980]
But nevertheless, I'm sure you stayed up and lost till midnight 12th of October

[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.040]
Oh yeah, you know it

[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.780]
Didn't do it?

[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.140]
No

[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.960]
Why not?

[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.200]
Were you watching vacancy?

[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.000]
I didn't want to, no, it wasn't on

[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.640]
Oh, and what about, what's that all about?

[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.480]
I look for it

[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.680]
I look for it

[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.180]
Reach, reach

[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.060]
Reach for the breach

[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.200]
I don't see anything around here

[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.360]
It ain't on my feet, like you do

[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.940]
It ain't on now, if vacancy is on, but you're going to hear a lot of like that

[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.260]
Oh, and guess what?

[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.480]
Clarence was in there, no, were you there when he came in?

[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.040]
Yes

[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.660]
Oh, so you heard the fact he's not going to be here on Friday?

[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.340]
I did

[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.420]
Because he's got to travel from other sports

[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.020]
It's important things, I don't even know what he's been to

[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.760]
I wonder if there's going to be an inquisition to find out how come Clarence is not going to be around on Friday

[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.460]
He's going to be AWOL

[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.740]
Boy, just amazing to me, the kind of crap that codes on

[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.480]
And you have to get called in on carpet because I'm leaving it on Friday because I'm going on vacation

[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.220]
That's right

[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.460]
You've been doing for a lot of, you've got to say 21 years I've been doing this

[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.840]
It's locker

[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.080]
Too bad

[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.380]
Too bad

[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.520]
Too bad, screw off

[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.160]
If anybody don't like it, screw off

[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.280]
And you welcome again by the way for other vaguid job

[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.540]
Those five hours I did, several days while a little dog was there on jury duty alleged

[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.200]
God

[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.520]
Senator Swolory Rotten Clinton defeated Barack Obama in the Ohio and Texas primary's last day

[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.240]
Ending a string of defeats in when he won Vermont which they called really early

[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.640]
They made a dozen in a row

[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.440]
And letting her to soldier allowing her to soldier on a Democratic presidential nomination race

[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.040]
It seemed like they had named time soon

[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.120]
Swolory also on Rhode Island while Obama won in Vermont

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.800]
But the results mean that Mrs. Clinton won the two states he most needed to keep her candidacy alive

[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.600]
She's still alive

[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.900]
Wow

[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.240]
In interview this morning on CNN she said she wasn't deterred by Obama's continued reading elected delegate support

[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.760]
Argued that she would need a stronger candidate in a general election against the now assured Republican John McCain insane

[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.840]
What's important is that this campaign has turned a corner she said

[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.260]
They turned the corner

[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.620]
Seeking to minimize the importance of Obama's string of victory

[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.840]
Swolory said a month ago people didn't know who the nominee would be

[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.020]
And said she was prepared to contest McCain on national security issues

[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.340]
Which he said would be the focus of his campaign

[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.640]
That phone is ringing at three o'clock in the morning you know where your kids are

[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.620]
You know who's answering the phone at the White House

[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.320]
You know who's on the floor with Monica Lewinsky I mean all of this stuff you know

[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.480]
So sick and tired of so many stupid people man just buying into that crap

[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.960]
Like what what what what is her claim to fame what is her big thing on national security when it came to the war in Iraq she said oh yeah

[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.400]
Here you go W here's a blank check go ahead and spend all the money and kill all the people you want to have a good time

[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.140]
That's her claim to fame on national security just like her fame to fame on health care that she just blew right down the toilet

[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.880]
On CNN this morning also a bomb appointed out he retains his leading delegates and said he had run strong

[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:25.280]
The states where he started a big disadvantage we started 20 points behind in Texas in Ohio he said he said he was not able to close completely the gap in those states

[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:33.600]
But he would continue to seek the democratic nominations as here like as if there was a doubt New York Times what a stupid Adam Nagourney what a moron you are Adam

[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.560]
Jesus New York Times this is a real newspaper once upon a time it was

[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.760]
Swirly's victory in Texas was razor thin and came early this morning after most of us had gone to bed

[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.080]
But by winning the size of the Ohio earlier in the night she was able to deliver a televised victory speech in time for the late night news

[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:58.480]
And the result there allowed her to cast Tuesday's the beginning of a comeback even though she stood a good chance of gaining no ground against a bomb in the hundred delegates

[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.460]
Well she picked up a few not many just a few

[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.260]
No candidate in recent history democratic Republican is one of the White House without winning the Ohio primary she said at around in Columbus

[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.220]
We all know that if we want a democratic president we need a democratic nominee who can win democratic states just like Ohio

[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.900]
Although she won the popular vote in Texas her hundred delegates was complicated by the states bizarre nominating process

[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.540]
Which includes a separate caucus that awards 35% of the state's delegates irrespective of the primary result

[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:35.840]
It is so stupid so half-assed every state makes up their own crap because almost as stupid as the fact that they're talking now about all the other seats the delegates from Michigan and Florida

[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.680]
Even though nobody campaigned in Florida and everybody agreed they wouldn't and that the delegates wouldn't count in Michigan

[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.040]
There was nobody else on the ballot except her on the democratic side

[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.860]
Remember that she got 55% against her and now you're nitpicking

[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:58.720]
Yeah, the Associated Press reported that all told Obama retains his lead in the delegate count with 1477 pledge delegates to her 1391

[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.900]
And 86 in the delegate lead the AP said that 100 and oh I see

[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.240]
That's not the final total he's 85 ahead right now based on whatever they're telling

[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.620]

That they could only contest in these two states where she had an advantage and she did well

[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:56.700]
But as I said before we emerged with the same delegate delegate gap between her and me that we had essentially before we got in

[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:04.180]
And so you know we have constantly focused on the next states in front of us we got Wyoming and Mississippi this week

[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:05.060]
No, right up here. I thought I made a pretty good list there. That's fine starter list. Oh the Hungarian Charter

[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.160]
Do I really want to put that on there? Yeah, it used to be a sponsor on KIT 100 years ago

[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.440]
See I'm gonna vote for sizzler man. All you can eat shrimp

[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.380]
How do you spell charter

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.760]
All right, I just guess who's gonna correct you?

[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.820]
He's gonna know the Hungarian Charter SCAR DA. I don't know how you spell it. That's close enough

[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.160]
Or maybe it's a CZAR I think it's CZ

[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.560]
Hungarian Charter that was on a Craig sponsor. I don't think I ever got to eat there Rocky Graziani's was good too, but it won't get any votes

[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.460]
But I'll put it on there anyway

[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.380]
What the hell is cracking his knuckles again? No, no really nasty

[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.160]
Thanks to be on an ear again, and you get another memo from John

[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.660]
You're eating on the air again. What was through said it was disgusting?

[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.840]
That's a good funny. Our list news are disgusting. I see her leave me

[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.500]
Putting the guy with a white t-shirt used to come to the hockey and he used to wear a t-shirt

[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.480]
There was like four sizes too small, you know

[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.580]
He need like a double X and he was wearing like a child small why I have no idea

[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:17.540]
And just nauseating just gross. There's nothing worse than guys who would think that they're real hot, you know, and they're oh my god

[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:23.120]
You know walking around in the hair is like off their back and like up over the top of the shirt. Oh

[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.980]
But anyway, to each its own, you know, I think that's a pretty good list

[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.940]
All right, and then we'll probably get some calls in you know

[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.480]
Of course, I can't take any because I don't I took your advice. I did not try to read a jigger this thing

[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.760]
It's good. Yeah, yeah, and that's why we're doing fine. That's why I got my internet

[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.680]
Yeah, go figure

[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.820]
Well, no, because I don't want to I don't want to screw up again

[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.840]
That's right sure that I probably will you know if you could see the massive

[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:53.600]
Fours and wires and schmutz that I hear behind the event very complicated. I don't want to deal with it

[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.240]
Senator swore we scored big last night taking Texas handle

[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:03.000]
Ohio State's her husband said rain must win for her to retain be a viability in a race for democratic nomination

[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.280]
but

[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:12.720]
A close analysis of the delegate counts which still favor Barack Obama even after Clinton's Tuesday bomb may put a Clinton victory out of reach

[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:20.880]
By some calculations Clinton would have had need to win more than 60% of the vote in a dozen contest remaining between

[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.180]
Now in June 7th the ketchup bomb and pledge delegates a steep challenge that given that so far

[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.640]
She's won that much only in one state her one time adopted home of Arkansas

[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.060]
Although I think she did get that in Rhode Island last night. She got like 60 or whatever she got

[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.660]
Maybe not even in New York where she's a sitting senator. She won 57% of the vote

[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:45.000]
She won 55% of Michigan where Obama wasn't even on the ballot neither was anybody else. She got 55% against nobody

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.080]
By CBS news is count Obama remains ahead 15 hundred and 12 to 14 23

[00:21:50.080 --> 00:22:00.720]
Which is 89 ahead by AP's count Clinton got 13 91 and Obama 14 77 which is 86 lead Jim Jordan Iran Senator John Karrie's initial primary race in

[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.320]
2004 told the New York Post he believes she can't win

[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.840]
Her durable

[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:12.360]
Durabilities impressive not astonishing, but she's still looking at some pretty cold hard numbers in the racetrack and said she's running out of time

[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:18.500]
She's running out of space. He described her Clinton nomination even with wins in Texas in Ohio as really impossible

[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.320]
Impossibly how do you like that?

[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.820]
Carey is endorsed Obama the nomination fight another democratic strategy told the Post is difficult to see how the math works for Clinton

[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.980]
If you look at most models out there circulating the one thing that's consistent is that she has to perform very strong

[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.880]
We don't have any hope of making up the deficit among elected delegates

[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.200]

Siding her victories in the two states the theory of momentum suggested Obama should roll up equally large margins today

[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.420]
But voters seem to want to keep this race going said Paul baggalla a former Clinton eight I suspect swallah agrees with them

[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:51.740]

[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.420]
It's one of the all-time best burger joints too good

[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.980]
Wouldn't be right. Yeah, it was too good. That's why it's gone. And of course once it's gone at the game

[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.740]

[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.780]

[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.040]
That's what it is really fine. It's consistent unlike that's correct other places

[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.720]
Unlike some places like steak and shake where the shapes are great for the burger sometimes are like fallen apart and like

[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:50.100]
In 17 sections. I hate to say I wish I knew any other place where I could get what I'm expecting

[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.260]

Haven't heard from that guy in a long time. That's another good reason not to take the calls

[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.480]
Well, what's the point? What is the point?

[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:48.840]

Life's too short. Yeah, life is too short to put up with people who want to nudge you

[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.900]
You know my mother's been dead for about three years four years whatever it is and I don't want to be nougete anymore

[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.680]

[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.260]
But

[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.960]
Now we got a way for Neil to come back

[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.380]
Jesus H. Christ. I don't even have any music ready

[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.680]
I gotta do the show at noon on Friday

[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.700]
What I said to you was true joebell and he was a slacker

[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.820]
He takes advantage of the fact that you can do whatever the hell he wants

[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:47.380]
Nobody's gonna stop him you need to make him hourly new contract. I was still doing the same thing

[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:52.340]
Am I back? Are we back? All my lights are on here on my thing all the five lights are on and you're gonna be okay

[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.740]
I guess I guess yes

[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.580]
No, I just heard like that well

[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.640]
Like somebody pulled a plug on the damn line or something

[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.640]
Somebody went back there and somebody see I think it's because we got that thanks about the forge

[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.700]
They're already getting evil with us. You don't mess with those people treat it. You know what I mean? No

[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:14.560]
I don't think you're gonna come back. I think it's just gonna be me

[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.060]
Just in the course when you play a spot you're not gonna hear that either

[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.360]
Come on anybody doing anything about this or is this uh, you know or tell me what you're talking about

[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.920]
But hey, I should be court. I'll tell you what I'm gonna put in your head. I'll record the thing and you talk

[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.740]
One right day in the middle of the night you dead boys got up to fight back to face each other through the street inside

[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.340]
Shout each other

[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.920]
The deposition only came to hold the two that voice

[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.340]
You would have one and he's like to

[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.120]
And you would keep talking like that my check my check

[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.320]
Like a little little little list of sound. Yeah, that's all I get

[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.660]
Yeah, yeah

[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.220]
Oh

[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.440]
Now there's no point I don't so anyway. Let me look at the pool now. We got the new one up there

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.760]
And I'll just keep talking. I'm assuming I'm on the ear. Am I on the ear? Yes

[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:11.640]
Yes

[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.040]
Like that

[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.760]
Should I reset my thing again?

[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:24.500]
Okay, sure, huh? Why not? I'm gonna reset it right on me. Okay, we got to then we have three minutes before the break

[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.580]
I'm gonna go walk around yeah, behind the way more fun than this

[00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:32.340]
And how is this possible? I'm assuming you can do something the audience can hear you

[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:38.200]
Yeah, the audience hears me fine. Just pretend you're the one who calls the word there. I'm gonna reset my thing. All right. Go ahead. We set your thing

[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.880]
We said now. Oh for the love of God. Oh, what?

[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.100]
Oh

[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.380]
Yours again, it's a hit your rent of course

[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:13.860]
Of course, oh there you go. What difference does it make? Can you hear us now? I hear you all right

[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:18.700]
What I was writing on a fax over here. Yeah, it's storming like a mother down right now

[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:23.040]
It's a ran like I say a a be the audience hears us both just fine

[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.940]
So just you can't hear me

[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.680]
Right the audience here. I know what am I supposed to do about that? You know this

[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:35.440]
Stopping and trying to hear me business is you know terminal. So just just just go on

[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:41.100]
I hear what you're saying just pretend the blanks before everyone that it doesn't matter just go on and

[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.280]
And

[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.400]
Yeah, the engineers know about it. Everybody's running around trying to do something about it

[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.900]
But this is gonna happen because once again, it's storming like us some of it outside really yes

[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.240]
Here the snow is finally stopping looks like to me and it's a mess out there

[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.500]
It's a mess. I think it's the end of the world folks

[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.280]
I don't want to get anybody all panicking on herbice because that would be irresponsible in my part, but

[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.360]
That's for damn sure. Cue it up some tunes just in case

[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:17.340]
Cue up some wax man. That's right. Get some gase to wrap going here. Okay. Did anybody call it about floris? Is it a year or a name?

[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.480]
Um, they haven't called that florist supposedly. Lumb there's still a lumb's around

[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.720]

[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.780]

I can tell you where the party is it's the array is that though

[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:10.400]
When you get to be uh this age, you know, you don't want to have a party in your pants because it generally turns out to be

[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.980]
And it wasn't one you planned you know, I mean that kind of a party

[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.980]

[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:44.200]
But you have to be at least 100 years old and remember a lot of these

How do you ever eat at the monks in lever? I mean remember where the hell it was it was in date county somewhere at the monks in was in the gables

[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.260]
He don't speak George's language

[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.180]
Breaking news

[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:38.560]
Rhythm we talk of a 10-day cruise to Baja carrying dozens of people sick and by the morlant

[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.840]
We should

[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:51.000]
You threw up on my gram gram the illness to produce nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. I think I may fall in

[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.480]
The

[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.740]
Dookie everywhere

[00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:05.360]
You enjoy growing up every five minutes. It is the fourth suspected outbreak of war the ship since last year

[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:15.180]
I saw this truck guy throw up and then a pigeon ate it the rhythm except the set sail again tonight

[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:15.780]
For

[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.020]
I feel it and throw up I might explode

[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.860]
It's love at 16 I would see the unicorn or Rudy's on this list here

[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:28.700]
I could be wrong about that maybe uh, you know, let's just left it to the craps turn all the time

[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:29.900]
Yeah, but they slip to the crack

[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.320]
Just like what we just heard there sounded like something slipped through a big crack

[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.940]
We had the unicorn and Rudy's Rudy's was great. You know, remember Rudy's I'm sure you do I do

[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.200]
There was one right as you drove around as you went north on this game, Boulevard

[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.960]
She drove from the one I went to was out the one in Pembro puns on university in like as you drove

[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:53.120]
I'm 79 street and then you made the right hand turner on biscuit boulevard. It was run right off the corner there

[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.000]
Rudy's and you went through the drifter after work many a day after work at iod

[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.940]
Go through the drag through and just mind your mind. Maybe it was good by the way

[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:05.760]
Well, yes, uh, somebody's uh one of the factors that's coming across you right now is explaining the

[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:11.480]
The fact that that shopping center that I'm familiar with yes used to be evolved back in your old days before

[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.540]
That's right my mother lived there in that other place

[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:18.240]
So there you go the reason that I don't remember there being them all there is because I didn't live there when there was a mother

[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.240]
Now it's like a park park road and the Hollywood and Hollywood indeed

[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:28.220]
And I guess I found something online here, which believe me we could go till midnight although I don't want to waste the facts

[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.140]
Maybe we got a long list

[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.580]
It's a uh website memories of old Miami and date county florida

[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.960]
And I started printing it out because it looked pretty interesting and had restaurants and other things

[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:42.440]
And then it says page one of 62 well when it says pace

[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.860]
One was yeah, too. I don't think I'm gonna let it keep going

[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.880]
I can't have different pages, but you know I'll get to that in a minute

[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.860]
Do all the historical guilt strikes moring down in the New York Times today

[00:57:53.860 --> 00:58:00.480]
She says someone in a women in their 30s 40s and early 50s who favor Barack Obama have a phrase to describe what they don't like about Hillary Clinton

[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.740]
Shorter pad feminism

[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:07.140]
They feel that women have moved past that man our pigs is what was me sisters must stick together

[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:10.760]
Pantsons are powerful era that Hillary's campaign is likely to be five with the vengeance

[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.620]
The men our pigs always me sisters must stick together

[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.640]
Pantsons are powerful era and they don't like Gloria Stein

[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.560]
Another old school feminist trying to impose gender discipline and call to order on the sisters

[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.740]
As a woman I know put it Hillary doesn't make it look like fun to be a woman and her

[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.520]
I've been victimized campaign is depressing

[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:32.840]
But Hillary carried on the panty shoulders of the older women in Texas or how in Rhode Island who loved her

[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.300]
I will survive rallying cry

[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:38.120]
That I'm a little older never in every wrinkle on my face has been saved to fight another day

[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:43.880]
Exit polls to show that fans of Hillary who won't say they'd be happy with Obama if Hillary dropped out

[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.680]
We're hardening in their opposition to him while Obama voters were not so harsh about her

[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:53.820]
Three Hillary volunteers older women from Boston approach the New York Times reporter in Austin, Texas parking lot on Tuesday

[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.240]
To vent that Hillary hasn't gotten a fair shake from the press

[00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:01.820]
They said that they used to like Obama but now can't stand it because they think he's been cocky in this respectful to Hillary

[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:07.860]
As Hillary remarkably and cleverly put Obama on the defensive about a real estate deal health care and after her campaign

[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:13.180]
Ratchet it up the retro battle of the sexes when they sent that in fine-stun on the Fox News Sunday morning talk show

[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:18.620]
To promote the idea that Hillary should not be forced up regardless of the results of yesterday's primary simply because she's a woman

[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.840]
For those of us that are partly women not need to apply to generation that goes back to the time

[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:28.420]
I went out to get my first job following college and year of graduate workers in extraordinarily critical race to send her said

[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.460]
With Obama saying the hours upon us to elect the black man and Hillary saying the hours upon us to elect a woman

[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:37.080]
The Democratic primary has become the ultimate nightmare of liberal identity politics

[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:41.720]
All the victimizations go tripping over each other and colliding a competition of historical guilt

[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:48.120]
People will have to choose which Americans sins are greater and which stain will have to be removed first as misogyny worse than racism

[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.360]
It always races and worse than misogyny

[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.060]
As it turns out making history is actually a way of being imprisoned by history

[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.180]
It's all about the past

[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:59.820]
Old America's racial past be expunged or America's sexist past be expunged

[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.680]
As Ali Gallagher a white Hillary violent here in Austin told the Washington Post

[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:09.540]
Crystal Williams a friend of mine a black man said to me my ancestors came to this country in chains

[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.400]
I'm voting for Barack

[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.720]
I told him when my sisters came here in chains and on their periods I'm voting for Hillary

[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:20.040]
And meanwhile the conventional white man sits on the Republican side enjoys the spectacle of the Democratic's

[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.960]
Democrats identity pile up and victim lock

[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.540]
Just as Michelle Obama urged black to support her husband many shoulder-pads feminists are growing more fierce in charging that women who let

[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.440]
Obamalee progo or Hillary are traders

[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:37.120]
Julie Acevedo a precinct captain for Obama and Austin noted that many things were getting ugly around Friday during the early voting

[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.420]
Which he saw some very angry women just stopping by us to go to vote for Hillary they cut us off when we tried to walk

[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.740]
Talk about Barack

[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.100]
I'm 46 he said a fundraiser for state politicians

[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.680]
Maybe I missed it by a few years

[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.740]
But I don't know why these women are so fueled by such hostility and think other women are misogynists that they don't vote for Hillary

[01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:55.180]
It's insulting and disturbing

[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.140]
She said if Obama definitively outpaces Hillary she will work to heal the wounds and rule back women who are now angry at him

[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:09.260]
Watching Bill Clinton greef and out of dress the big dog is been muscled an excited group of students at Texas State University in San Marcos on Tuesday

[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.540]
19-year-old Allison Kroelzerk said she was leaning toward Obama and felt no gender guilty about voting for him

[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.720]
Not at all she said I think they're both pretty amazing

[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.460]
Your crowd held up their camera phones to cap to the former president in his bright orange tie and orange brown

[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.740]
Osteridge cowboy boots. We love you Bill the old one boy. You did a good job except for Monica

Yeah, the brick oven pizza where they had like that real kind of authentic Italian pizza the real thin crust

[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.320]
They cooked in the wood burning brick ovens

[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.760]
The brick oven

[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.380]
Been closed for many years. We're lucky for me location was available. We own pines peach to be in October open

[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.420]
Says in Hollywood. Well, good luck. He had pines pizza

[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:59.820]
Where the brick oven used to be and then here's another fact says the old Hollywood mall was located

[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.160]
Hollywood Boulevard in park road the German deli there was called Lawson's Deli

[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.520]
Well, and maybe it was called Lawson's Deli once upon a time

[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:12.960]
But once a least once it was called Mr. Dunderdecks and I'll guarantee you that my bottom that was a great place

[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.900]
They had really great German food the mall is closed down and target is there now oh

[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.520]

They're got them confused it would definitely not okay, Mr. Dunderdecks was in the Hollywood mall

[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:38.180]
Trust me when I tell you I do because that was ready this both were great, but they're long gone and once they're gone

Citicle leaders were still working to make downtown more viable at night

[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:54.040]
Which they haven't seen since the 50s and 60s going to movies in downtown Miami day or night because it was safe to go downtown

[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.060]
And there were several theaters on flyover street

[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.980]
Shopping in the little river area because the north side shopping center had an open year for folks in the north end of the county

Because it's pretty weird for Sunday

[01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:53.600]

[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:00.200]
I'm enjoying it, I don't know whether the audiences are not

[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.520]
You know what they do

[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.620]

Oh yeah I wish I'd been here when that was

[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.380]
But then of course if he would have been here when that was there

[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:12.500]
Then you'd be an old man now like me and you'd be ready to die

[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.020]
So look at it that way

[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.800]
I thought they'd think of that

[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.500]
What are they thinking?

[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:19.940]
Not too bad

[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.040]
Santana from Alapata says

[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.120]

[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.460]
You call the University of Miami baseball games on it

[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:42.200]
And I did not, it was not Waxy, it was the WNWS

[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:42.660]
Okay?

[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:43.540]
Santana

[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:44.540]
It says Love You

[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.100]
And then it says the Olive Garden rules

[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.640]
Oh the Olive Garden

[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:47.880]
No

[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:51.340]
It's Italian issue

[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:54.840]
Voters and two Vermont towns approved measures

[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.620]
Yesterday calling for the indictment of President Bush and Vice President

[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:00.340]
And Cheney for what they consider violations of the Constitution

[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.640]
More symbolic than anything the Adam Sautant police arrested Bush and Cheney

[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.800]
If they ever visit Braddleboro or nearby Marlboro or next to them for

[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.120]
Prosecution elsewhere if they're not impeached first

[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:13.440]
And Braddleboro the vote was 2012 to 1795

[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.800]
And Marlboro, which held a town meeting on the issue

[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.240]
It was 43 to 25 with three abstentions

[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.680]
I hope the lump in that people take from this is he had candy dons had curred dynes 54

[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.200]
Organized the position grab the little do Braddleboro vote

[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.800]
I wonder if he's a entity to do with the march of dynes

[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.240]
The measure in Marlboro isn't binding because it didn't apparently warning for the meeting

[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:37.620]
You know if the R started the march of dynes to raise money for a cure for polio

[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.540]
Because he had polio that's why it was in the wheelchair

[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.400]
Right, I know that, that's a did

[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.180]
It was emotional they were heartfelt speeches on both sides Wilson said

[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:48.840]
The question to put voters in Braddleboro refer to crimes against our Constitution

[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:52.040]

[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:07.460]
Food was good, oh man if you could just if you wanted to know with a blindfold

[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.580]
And then you just got the food and ran out

[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:13.820]

[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:15.600]
No

[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:19.420]
In fact the guy who's dead ran a business called on the show one day

[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.780]
But way back went long time ago

[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:23.300]
So I know that they're long gone once they're gone

[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.380]
Uh-huh

[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.400]
Remember you got that on there? I'm asked?

[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.240]
I'm just reading these I don't know whether you're a crisis putting them on or not

[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:33.000]
I sure hope so I didn't see the unicorn on there last time is it on there now?

[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:35.020]
Put on there for a while

[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:36.940]
Oh has it well here's what we got so far

[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:39.960]
Well we got a long list we got a long list here baby

[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.920]
Which out of business rest to occupies the most lumps?

[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.300]
41 is that one on baby road extension?

[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:49.700]
I bet you're going to be crowded this up pretty soon because we're bringing back those great memories of the

[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.880]
Winnie's steamed in beer is that like steam in your Wieny and beer baby?

[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:53.580]
Morgan

[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.460]
And then of course those great Olly burgers

[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.880]
Sizzler 26, Wolfies 19, did we put the

[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.380]
Oh we did get samples and then we both Wolfies 19, D. State Charlie 17, Wieny and Oyster House 15,

[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:08.900]
Corkeys 14 and those great little potato lockers

[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:13.560]
Oh man, and they create brisket memories to bring us brisket right there and I never said no

[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.700]
Oh yeah, a task of the Tisket let's get some Corkeys brisket they're gone

[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.380]
Looked it

[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:25.080]

Minero's 3, Rocky Rochionis 3, Vito's Pizza 2, New York State House 2, Marty Susman

[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:37.940]
Did a long time and Big Wilson 2, Hungarian Charter 2, Size Rivergate 2, Piccolos 2, The Clock 1

[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.720]
Gotta be careful, Taco V, Vito won, Fodruckers won, see what I mean?

[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:43.400]
Mm-hmm

[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:48.460]
Unicorn won Rudy's won, The Turp of 1, The Studio won, Monks in 1, Gigi's won

[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:54.500]
Somebody else remembers Gigi's way back when? Wow, boy! That was a great place that was right near um...

[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:57.640]
Pier 66

[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:05.320]
Villa Deli won and Prince Samlet won, no votes yet, zero for Prince Samlet, Luther's barbecue, The Sizzlin,

[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.840]
Sambo's, Vodangles, Figaro's, The Rascal House, Burton Jack's, Thomas,

[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.960]
Painted Horse, Sporting Brews or Marries? Oh come on, Marries? Quite contrary?

[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:21.840]
Wow, that's where I had the transexual waitress to call the show that one day, a long time ago

[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:25.000]
Because I was talking about Marries and about the Hurrim, whatever, you know

[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.480]
She was very nice, she had hair on her arms though, was you know...

[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:32.380]
On or under? On her arm, okay

[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:39.000]
Maybe under her arms, I didn't check her pits, okay? Jesus God, you're eating it, that was a good place to imagine

[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:46.980]
The dog Thompson says, Nemo to the fat lady, go home, and then I'll get back at this, oh I got... I printed out the 14 pages of that crap

[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:50.980]
Memorina, did you find something that marginally interesting?

[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:51.980]
Margillin

[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.000]
Come on, you are such...

[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.260]
Now get your crystal out of it, it was like a ponderous, because it was all before he was born

[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.100]
Oh, it's all like that, whoop

[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:06.660]
That whole other option says the fat lady that Barack Obama had waiting in the wings to his den, I didn't even get the chance to clear her throat

[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:11.060]
Before Hillary Clinton said her packing with a plane ticket home in a hotel reservation in Denver for August

[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.200]
Obama didn't see a reveal and drive from the Democratic presidential race, instead she won two out of three primary races

[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.180]
And stayed yet another improbable comeback

[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:25.780]
Before the polls closed, Pundits wondered when Democratic leaders would descend on the senator from New York, and convince her to withdraw for the good of the party

[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:31.920]
Now they know what many political pros knew all along, never saw the Clinton short, never count anyone out before the final votes are counted

[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:38.760]
Many of those same pundits wrote off the struggling candidacy of John McKayne lie's fall, when New York's senator seemed to run out of steam and campaign cash

[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:42.860]
On the same night Clinton staged her comeback, McCain clinched the GOP nomination

[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.660]
So much for conventional political wisdom, when the shouting dies, Donald Clinton's victory may seem more cosmetic

[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:54.100]
She didn't gain much ground on Obama's lead in the delegate cup, and she still trails the Illinois Senator in states one, and the overall popular vote

[01:27:54.100 --> 01:28:06.680]
But her wins in Ohio, Texas and Rhode Island, give her renewed straight street cred, energize the campaign, be set with morale and cash flow problems, and opens the door for the seven more weeks of the kind of attack-dog campaign tactics that some say turned around her campaign or recent days

[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:20.760]
Obama mainly may be declining as he struggles with three losses after a string of 12 straight primary wins, questions about his relationship with a corrupt Chicago real estate developer, and the shady political power broker still linger, it needs to add substance to his rhetoric if he wants to regain that lost momentum

[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:31.100]
Still, Obama has the numbers on his side, and Clinton will lead more than one night stand to overtake his lead, she can overtake Obama as super delegates vote her way, and she finds a way to con delegates from wins in Michigan and Florida

[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:39.520]
But winning in such a way could lead Democrats split and wounded for a tough fight with McCain in the fall, Yogi Barrow said in eight over until it's over, and this sucker is a long way from over

[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:41.200]
What's the biggest name?

[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.620]
Hold on, and then false alarm

[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.180]
I like doing that, keep him honest to us

[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.120]
You lose it, you have a very couple of calories that we start to be told

[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.860]
Oh, no, don't do it

[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:56.880]
Let me put you in a QA, and you sit, you're like I said, you'll sit so close to the water you can taste it

[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.600]
You following that? No, sit again

[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:06.980]
You'll sit so close to the water you can taste it, it's why you drove to the beach, it's my pick for this week's Niel D'Oll, Maniana, Oceans 234 and Dear Field Beach

[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:12.560]

[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:29.340]
The entries are great like the crab and crutchage, saline, and sea bass, Seared scallops, Mecha, Dmy, Dalfon or King crab legs, fresh succulent and delicious

[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:52.280]
Look for the water, you can't wait to order in Oceans 234

[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:55.500]
And what did I do? Oh, I knocked that thing off, and that's a bad scene

[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:56.660]
What?

[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:57.360]
Do it

[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:01.140]
Just relax, then, don't start getting too close to your own age

[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.600]
What are you doing?

[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:07.860]
I can't get this down to this real life, it's 4.560 QAM

[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.680]
The sports leader

[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:14.200]
This mark, Morgan, is the 12-to-1 hour on Q8M

[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.040]
It's 3 a.m.

[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:25.840]
Your children are fast asleep, the fold is ringing

[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:35.140]
You think they're safe, but a little bit is picking days and a little bit of Bob is exploding behind her

[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:40.360]
These are the states

[01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:43.260]
We must die

[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:44.960]
It could be a dream

[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:48.200]
But your phone still rings

[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:54.380]
And a well calculated ad to keep you in and suspense and the fear

[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:58.040]
Who could possibly be calling this time of night?

[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.220]
They answer lies and answering the phone

[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.940]
It's the only way to find out

[01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:04.320]
Hello?

[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.040]
Hey, baby, both of them are alive

[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.560]
Are you going to die?

[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.340]
I'm telling you now

[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.660]
Shame on you, if you don't move from my world

[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.740]
That phone is ringing at 3 in the morning

[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:19.660]
And you just want to sleep, you know?

[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.020]
12-to-560 WQ-A

[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:24.040]
And here's, uh, who was it that sent me this?

[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:25.760]
I don't know if somebody emailed it

[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.420]

[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.940]
You're bringing back some huge memories today though

[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:32.960]
We says, welding pot, anyone?

[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:34.040]
Nulley pots not gone

[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:34.920]

Still very much alive and well over a day vanbrower

[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.620]
I'm not sure if he was alive

[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:42.080]
Not to mention wings to go and it's silly as when are old

[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.760]
Well, wings coming back, he's reopening

[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.220]
One of these, uh, you'll see

[01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.100]
Maybe he's open now for all we know

[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:50.200]
If Chris would just answer that phone

[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:50.820]
Uh-huh

[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:53.500]
Now, did you get anybody else calling with any ideas or that was it?

[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.180]
That was it

[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:54.680]
Good

[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.380]
I don't want to have to read 5,000 names

[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:59.240]
Now, let me get back to that page 5

[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.440]

Do you remember that?

[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:23.120]
Absolutely not

[01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:26.300]
I'm just told by an email that there's still a flood record around

[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.360]
Oh, we better get that off of there or not

Well, get that off of there

which annoyed the music listeners on QAM

[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.340]
I didn't know that Ricky Tiki never told me that Alan Courtney was on QAM

[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:10.400]
Wow, that old toad

I guess all the resident pages are comments from different people like Joanne Kay she says oh I wouldn't give for a confriter from Alabama Jacks

[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:19.580]
Oh go get your fritters, you know, well not confritters but one of the other kind of fritters

Oh yeah

[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.020]

He'll have it and if he doesn't have it too bad I didn't know if he needed it for this weekend he should ask me sooner

[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.340]

I already did this page

[01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:53.450]
Well, I think that's enough

[01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:55.230]
I can't take no more

[01:40:55.230 --> 01:40:56.930]
For direct diplomacy

[01:40:57.470 --> 01:41:00.970]
I ignored our allies refusing to talk to our enemies

[01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:05.150]
Even though presidents from Kennedy to Reagan have done just that

[01:41:05.150 --> 01:41:11.950]
Because strong countries and strong leaders aren't afraid to tell hard truths to petty dictators

[01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:13.430]
You over and out

[01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:15.630]
Get the hell out of the street, get the hell out of the street

[01:41:15.630 --> 01:41:18.650]

[01:41:18.650 --> 01:41:21.290]
I am the sports leader

[01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:23.490]
You know who I am?

[01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:28.070]
I'm Moe Holiday David and you will make enough bone

[01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:31.490]

As I guzzle, why?

[01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:37.510]
High-calonic tonic

[01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:44.510]
Our guest is under Hillary Clinton, the Democrat from New York, Kennedy for President

[01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:47.190]
And perhaps a drug dealer to boost

[01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:47.630]
That's right

[01:41:47.630 --> 01:41:48.790]
What is this all about?

[01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:51.790]
I have pushed very successfully for a very long time

[01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:56.690]
But I have no intention of running to become our president

[01:41:56.690 --> 01:41:57.710]
Why is that?

[01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:00.170]
I am just downright fraudulent

[01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:01.710]
There is no doubt about that

[01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:07.270]
And that does sometimes draw a little bit of controversy and criticism

[01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:10.250]
Do you believe that Barack Obama is ready to be president?

[01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:11.410]
Absolutely

[01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:15.310]
He is one of the people that I admire most in the world

[01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.790]
Why?

[01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:17.450]
I intend to be a show horse

[01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:19.990]
Somebody doing the press conference is all the time

[01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:22.190]
Senator Obama will work for a show horse

[01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:22.990]
A work horse

[01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:27.090]
Who will tackle the problems that we confront

[01:42:27.090 --> 01:42:28.830]
Obama for President

[01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:30.070]
Yes, that's what I want

[01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:31.850]
Senator Clinton, thank you very much for joining us

[01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:32.250]
Thank you

[01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:35.870]
Okay, 2018, you welcome at 560 W.C.M.

[01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:36.990]
This is a great pull today

[01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:38.030]
And thank God we changed it

[01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.770]
You got off that other one

[01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:39.390]
What was the other one?

[01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:39.750]
Right

[01:42:40.610 --> 01:42:43.250]
See, I forgot already, other side out of mind, that's how bad it was

[01:42:43.710 --> 01:42:44.770]
Oh, stories, that's right

[01:42:44.770 --> 01:42:45.970]
We did the stories that are gone

[01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:47.550]
And once they're gone, they're gone

[01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:48.010]
Right

[01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:49.510]
And now we're doing the restaurants that are gone

[01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:50.930]
See, I don't know about you

[01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:53.330]
But one of the last things I would ever want to do

[01:42:53.330 --> 01:42:54.570]
Be in a restaurant business

[01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.930]
Oh, yes

[01:42:55.930 --> 01:42:58.010]
All my life, everybody's always said, oh, the worst business

[01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:59.470]
Ever go into as a restaurant business?

[01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:02.390]
Oh, we know this radio, but second to that maybe

[01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:04.350]
That will not even close to radio

[01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:09.770]
But I'm already in it, well, I used to be in radio now I'm on whatever business is going on

[01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:10.230]
Now we work here

[01:43:10.730 --> 01:43:12.050]
Now we work in QAM

[01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:14.270]
I had everyone also

[01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:15.270]
What was that?

[01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:17.470]
Joe Sunkins Gold Coast

[01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:19.110]
Was on the intercostal in Hollywood

[01:43:21.650 --> 01:43:23.590]
It was like a fishing steak place

[01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:27.050]
Joe Sunkins, that's what I was told

[01:43:27.610 --> 01:43:29.250]
Oh, somebody called in there, huh?

[01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:30.830]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:33.030]
He believed that, he bought it in that crack, Joe Sunkins

[01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.950]
Yes, I did

[01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:36.090]
Is it what he got lost in the Gulf of Tanken?

[01:43:37.530 --> 01:43:40.110]
Was he having a car that where the horn was honking?

[01:43:40.890 --> 01:43:41.810]
He was hockey-talking

[01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:44.090]
Which out of business restaurant you missed the most?

[01:43:44.170 --> 01:43:45.410]
We got 270 votes

[01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:47.090]
Lones

[01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:48.710]
Now why is that?

[01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:50.330]
What was the big tennis with Lums?

[01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:51.230]
Okay, he was good

[01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:52.750]
They were everywhere, they were huge stuff

[01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:56.990]
Yeah, they were everywhere, so therefore so I just didn't get it

[01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:59.090]
I was just looking for a little bit of Lums

[01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:03.030]
I mean, Wags was a million times better than Lums

[01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:08.290]
Lums had very limited menu, you know they had winners and burgers and uh, and whatever

[01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:11.290]
Too long for me to remember, I know I've been there, but it was Lums

[01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:12.010]
34

[01:44:12.630 --> 01:44:13.630]
Sizzler has got

[01:44:13.630 --> 01:44:14.450]
33

[01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.870]
Wolf's 23

[01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:19.510]
Beach State Carly 17, England Oyster House 16

[01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:20.710]
Corkeys 15

[01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:25.350]
And let me say it to you again, I want to emblaziness in your brain, I said it three years ago

[01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:27.470]
Well, it's more true now than it ever was then

[01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:33.750]
Once Corkeys left, the day that Corkeys in North Miami Beach on 163rd Street closed its doors the last time

[01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:38.370]
That was the day South Dakota officially died, morto, morto, and the spot

[01:44:40.590 --> 01:44:44.290]
Wolf's 13, Wags 12, Humbernik's 11, Black Aina's 10

[01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:49.370]
Ranch House 10, Taco Viva 9 with a great squeegee's cheese baby

[01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:53.690]
Ooh, man, those burritos with that nice orange mooshy cheese

[01:44:53.690 --> 01:44:57.910]
Mmm, there was a Taco Viva there on sunset right close by my house

[01:44:57.910 --> 01:45:01.010]
And it was also the first Godfather's there in Kimbo 2 on sunset

[01:45:01.010 --> 01:45:04.330]
Where I met that, when they were overcame a spot, your mind

[01:45:04.770 --> 01:45:06.050]
That young man, Javier

[01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:09.910]
Mmm, he wasn't on the menu though

[01:45:10.890 --> 01:45:11.690]
Damn it

[01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:14.850]
Manero's 9, where they had the great Corkeys olive cheese, you never had that though

[01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:16.390]
So, are they gone?

[01:45:17.550 --> 01:45:18.530]
I'm sure they're there

[01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:23.330]
Mr. Coney Island, the unicorn, Burton Jacks 4, or I'm not reading the numbers

[01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:29.630]
Manero's 9, Coney Island, the unicorn 5, a Burton Jacks 4, kneels on Alton Road forward with a great French onion soup

[01:45:29.630 --> 01:45:34.130]
I don't remember anything else about that place except they had the best French onion soup in history, I love that

[01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:39.650]
Sanbo's 3, Ojangles 3, Vito's pizza 3, with that stuffed pizza with a cheese inside

[01:45:40.150 --> 01:45:43.790]
See, they were doing it years before all these chains decided to stop pizza

[01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:47.030]
Have a kinship of ideal

[01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:49.270]
Oh, it's speaking of stuff, take a puket him, man

[01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:52.290]
New York steakhouse 3, Rocky Graziani's 3

[01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:55.670]
The Rascal House 2, but now why is the Rascal House on there?

[01:45:55.970 --> 01:45:58.310]
Why did you do that? You're so easy, it's not gone

[01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:00.190]
I don't get it off

[01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:02.230]
Well, why is it on there?

[01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:07.610]
One of my way to say it's not going to be closed till next month and he just puts puts it on here again

[01:46:07.610 --> 01:46:09.310]
You are so easy, man

[01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:13.010]
Villa deli too, Hungarian Charter too

[01:46:13.010 --> 01:46:15.430]
Villa deli should have more than that, remember it's the delivered that...

[01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:17.910]
Oh boy, I would be

[01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:20.650]
Now that would be a good poll question for myself

[01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:25.650]
At which station did we get the best food delivered all the time?

[01:46:26.670 --> 01:46:31.210]
Now that would be a tight, I guess a real tight battle between Zeta

[01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.850]
And I would be

[01:46:32.850 --> 01:46:34.950]
Oh, I have to take your word for it

[01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:36.050]
What do you mean by that?

[01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:41.010]
I only know from IOD and it would be like one to three places every day that would be lined up

[01:46:41.010 --> 01:46:43.370]
It would be in the pudding and shifts

[01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:45.310]
It would have to stagger the door

[01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:48.030]
Now what was the tire restaurant I've ever been to?

[01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:51.850]
I would be put him out of business because the Jeff Clark was maybe a member there

[01:46:51.850 --> 01:46:52.270]
Yeah

[01:46:52.690 --> 01:46:56.070]
It was in Palm Beach County somewhere where it saw something dull

[01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:57.270]
Siamay Shore

[01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:58.650]
No, something dull

[01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:01.050]
Oh, the Siamay Shore was water-crossed the street

[01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:01.370]
No

[01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:04.130]
Yeah, or something dull

[01:47:04.130 --> 01:47:05.490]
Tired out

[01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:07.470]
No, not China

[01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:09.150]
You know what the Ness Tired Out

[01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:13.070]
Size Rivergate 2, pick those two pick those was really good

[01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:15.790]
That's where Jim Alton tried to pick up the young waiter that night

[01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:18.790]
Jim Alton's did not so I can say that I guess

[01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:21.230]
And even if he announced it, I can still consider it's true

[01:47:21.230 --> 01:47:21.890]
The waiter was cute

[01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:27.230]
Luther's barbecue won the Clark one, Rudy's one, Tirpob won the studio one

[01:47:27.230 --> 01:47:33.810]
The monks in only one, Gigi's one, Prince Hamlet won the early really really old to remember some of these

[01:47:33.810 --> 01:47:37.230]
And no votes for Joe Sankin's gold post of course

[01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:43.070]
The Sizzlin, Figaro's, Tiber's, Painted Horus, Sporting Brew's, or Mary's

[01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:45.510]
Can't believe there's no votes for Mary's

[01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:49.990]
That was a really great, great pizza and the Tad and food joint

[01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:52.230]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.410]
What he said?

[01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:55.050]
I'm saying it was damn good

[01:47:57.130 --> 01:47:59.410]
Daniel LaDouche in the Washington Post says

[01:47:59.410 --> 01:48:03.250]
The message to the scoreboard in the National Park is like a high definition TV on steroids

[01:48:03.250 --> 01:48:04.670]
There's Dan Abash

[01:48:04.670 --> 01:48:07.730]
And Stelke from others and the original Shrunk and Head on CNN

[01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:12.150]
And although that might not be the best word to associate with baseball these days, steroids

[01:48:12.150 --> 01:48:14.050]
There's no getting around the size of this monster

[01:48:14.050 --> 01:48:14.990]
It's a big one baby

[01:48:15.730 --> 01:48:17.230]
Said for its first public viewing

[01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:19.110]
Oh I see yesterday

[01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:21.530]
The screen is the equivalent of a 13-hours TV

[01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:25.290]
More than five times as large as the scoreboard at R&K Memorial Stadium

[01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:28.870]
Other than the game on the field it's separately the centerpiece of the fan experience

[01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:32.070]
At the 41,000-seat ballpark, National's Park

[01:48:33.490 --> 01:48:36.670]
Live action, instant-replace, images, graphic stats all there

[01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:42.590]
Oh stats, maybe our jerseys can go there and read the stats for the crowd with some bongos in the back

[01:48:43.630 --> 01:48:47.170]
And the programming is brand new so the high-tech features will have the same freshness as the

[01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:52.270]
$6.11 million stadium where the Washington National Hose of the regular season opened on March 30 against the Braves

[01:48:53.610 --> 01:48:56.470]
You've got a lot of graphics associated with the inaugural season nationals

[01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:58.790]
Park to start a new era, said Chris Maschitello

[01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:02.610]
Executive VP of Technology, Sales and Services at ANC Sports

[01:49:02.610 --> 01:49:05.030]
A digital sign that's coming in and it's working with the team

[01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:07.150]
Stars and Strets have got a very prominent theme

[01:49:07.150 --> 01:49:11.630]
But axels will figure some highlights and a formal unveiling of the scoreboard they did it yesterday

[01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:13.950]
Excuse me, but they want to keep things mostly surprised

[01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:17.490]
Well we weren't there so we can't give you any a loadout, we can't give you the skinny

[01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:21.970]
Although Zach lost a couple of positive give you the skinny, fat Zach

[01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:26.750]
They promised a range of programming made possible by high-definition LED technology

[01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:30.810]
That the learner family paid to have upgraded beyond the basic specs called for an evolved park design

[01:49:30.810 --> 01:49:33.350]
The city built the ballpark and the learners owned the team

[01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:37.870]
We were just limited by our imagination, said David London, the National Scoreboard Producer

[01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.770]
Wow!

[01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:42.970]
Few may be happier than London about the moves of the new ballpark on South Capital Street

[01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:47.830]
RFK Stadium is nearly 50 years old and just wasn't built to handle modern scoreboard technology

[01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:51.970]
And of course with that great team, the Washington Nats, oh my god

[01:49:53.770 --> 01:49:56.610]
I'm going to share Georgia with you there for opening day of the new stadium

[01:49:57.530 --> 01:50:00.150]
Park to watch the Nats and the Bravos

[01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:01.490]
Sure, right at your Nats

[01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:05.310]
They're flying around, grab them

[01:50:06.110 --> 01:50:09.910]
Do we ever figure out that restaurant where I've slid off the toilet seat, Vittys?

[01:50:10.050 --> 01:50:14.130]
They're still around right in the Fort Lauderdale, World of the Hell there, our 441 I guess

[01:50:14.130 --> 01:50:14.910]
I'll take a look

[01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:16.410]
I'll take another one that's definitely not around

[01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:21.850]
And it was on 441 in Lauderdale, changing neighborhoods baby, it was an understakehouse

[01:50:23.490 --> 01:50:23.890]
Chuck's

[01:50:24.930 --> 01:50:25.690]
Chuck's steakhouse?

[01:50:26.170 --> 01:50:27.690]
Okay, doesn't ring any bells?

[01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.430]
No

[01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:32.770]
Are you, are you, are you smitten me?

[01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:35.810]
I had a steakhouse, steakhouse, they had great drinks

[01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:37.370]
I'll take a look at the board

[01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:38.330]
Inexpensive, huh?

[01:50:38.630 --> 01:50:39.390]
I'll take your work for it

[01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:42.870]
It was on 441 in Lauderdale

[01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:46.370]
And of course, changing neighborhoods

[01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:49.150]
Well, I know, yeah, got kind of like a smarmy, you know

[01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:49.970]
Kind of run down

[01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:54.030]
And it was also that four guys pizza, whatever that was right in that same area

[01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:56.650]
On 441 Lauderdale, was it four guys?

[01:50:57.110 --> 01:50:59.050]
Three guys in a bean bag?

[01:50:59.330 --> 01:50:59.570]
Something

[01:51:02.830 --> 01:51:03.450]
I don't know

[01:51:03.450 --> 01:51:05.310]
It was awesome, you just don't get around very much

[01:51:06.690 --> 01:51:07.370]
That's right

[01:51:09.690 --> 01:51:14.970]
Well, I'm just telling you, ever in a year, these places certainly were there before when you're talking about coming back

[01:51:14.970 --> 01:51:21.970]
Just because you got, eating all the pre-food at work and then trying to afford to buy in the actual real cash money

[01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:24.910]
You know, the last time I lived in Miami

[01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:30.630]
I'm 441 and, and Broward I'm talking about, Chuck's and, uh, at pizza joint

[01:51:30.630 --> 01:51:31.690]
Yeah, don't remember it

[01:51:31.690 --> 01:51:32.890]
Is the Lauderdale in Miami?

[01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:33.830]
Maybe

[01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:36.110]
Don't remember it

[01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:37.590]
You better get with him, Mr.

[01:51:38.290 --> 01:51:39.090]
Alright, I'll be right back

[01:51:39.090 --> 01:51:42.810]
Time is passing you by, and you know, the worst thing is to miss a really great restaurant

[01:51:42.810 --> 01:51:46.170]
And then somebody says, oh, she had a great place and now it's closed

[01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:49.170]
And you think, gee, I'm sure we should have eaten there

[01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:50.890]
Is that what you think?

[01:51:51.670 --> 01:51:52.350]
Yeah, that's what I think

[01:51:53.110 --> 01:51:55.910]
I don't know what you think, actually she's the way I am

[01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:57.190]
That's right

[01:51:58.710 --> 01:52:00.330]
The crack was Simon Fowl

[01:52:00.330 --> 01:52:02.370]
Yeah, I don't like him with the public my life

[01:52:02.370 --> 01:52:03.250]
You know what?

[01:52:03.610 --> 01:52:04.110]
Fuck you

[01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:06.310]
New York City, hello

[01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:07.630]
Hi Simon, this is Richard

[01:52:07.630 --> 01:52:08.450]
How do I Richard?

[01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:13.130]
A question, is Paula Abdul still sleeping with American Idol contestants?

[01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:14.190]
Oh yeah, because

[01:52:15.070 --> 01:52:16.350]
Oh God, I wish I knew

[01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:18.430]
How many she up to now?

[01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:20.530]
13, 31, 31, so he's here alone

[01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:22.870]
Come on, be a South Carolina, hello

[01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:23.870]
Simon, yeah

[01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:27.050]
A lot of people are accusing you in the other judges as being anti-day

[01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:28.630]
Oh, I didn't want to go to this again

[01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:30.190]
Okay, but is it true?

[01:52:30.570 --> 01:52:31.850]
Uh, yeah, yeah

[01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:35.090]
Wow, I like people who are pretty straight

[01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:36.110]
Yeah, I like straight people

[01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:39.030]
Well, what if someone's definitely the best singer that happens to be gay?

[01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:41.130]
It just doesn't matter because they're never going to win

[01:52:41.130 --> 01:52:43.250]
North Providence, Rhode Island, hello

[01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:46.950]
I mean, you still like the pay prostitutes to spank you with a hairbrush?

[01:52:47.250 --> 01:52:47.410]
Yeah

[01:52:48.850 --> 01:52:49.910]
Yes, I'm doing that

[01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:52.350]
Yeah, it is an indescribable feeling

[01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:53.590]
I absolutely love it

[01:52:53.590 --> 01:52:55.510]
Simon Fowl, you'll never forget that feeling

[01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:56.530]
That was great seeing you

[01:52:56.530 --> 01:52:57.710]
Yeah, thank you for having me on my way

[01:52:57.710 --> 01:52:58.590]
Enjoyed that, thank you

[01:52:59.590 --> 01:53:01.410]
It's 1232-560-W

[01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:03.510]
You can't talk about people who leave you beyond limp

[01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.070]
You know what I mean?

[01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:05.590]
Limb

[01:53:06.250 --> 01:53:08.990]
On February 13th, Shakespeare retailers in Texas

[01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:12.490]
We do it when a federal appeals court ruled just in time for Valentine's Day

[01:53:12.490 --> 01:53:15.830]
The Texas prohibition against the sale of villos and

[01:53:17.150 --> 01:53:18.810]
Pocket, well, I can't say the word

[01:53:19.590 --> 01:53:20.870]
Violated the 14th Amendment

[01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:22.970]
I didn't realize that was an historic pocket

[01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:23.990]
It's the keyword

[01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:25.610]
I know

[01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:29.230]
Pocket, these, Violated the 14th Amendment

[01:53:29.230 --> 01:53:29.650]
Right

[01:53:29.650 --> 01:53:31.510]
According to Texas Penal Code

[01:53:34.510 --> 01:53:39.050]
It's forbidden to sell or advertise an artificial penis or vagina

[01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:41.590]
Primarily for the stimulation of human genital

[01:53:41.590 --> 01:53:43.310]
What if it's secondarily?

[01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:46.730]
Well, maybe it's like a mental piece

[01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:49.090]
I can call me a virgin, you're a little mitreasing

[01:53:49.090 --> 01:53:51.870]
Calling you a metallic or a baby, you're a little bit too old

[01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:52.770]
I can't tell you how to deal with it

[01:53:52.770 --> 01:53:53.370]
I can't tell you how to deal with it

[01:53:53.370 --> 01:53:53.750]
Okay

[01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:55.690]
Jesus

[01:53:56.170 --> 01:53:57.150]
No, that's a lie

[01:53:57.150 --> 01:53:57.310]
The statute

[01:53:57.870 --> 01:53:59.510]
The statute makes a reception for instance

[01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:01.150]
In which the purchase meets a medical

[01:54:01.150 --> 01:54:04.550]
Psychiatric, Judicial, legislative or law enforcement need

[01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:07.330]
Oh, she needs a judicial dildo

[01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:10.970]
Even so unreliable consultants versus one

[01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:13.430]
You're only normally conservative, fit, circuit, court of appeals

[01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:14.690]
Struck down the ban

[01:54:14.690 --> 01:54:17.430]
On grounds that it violated the right of ordinary citizens

[01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:19.430]
To engage in private intimate contact in the home

[01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:21.330]
Conduct without government intrusion

[01:54:21.330 --> 01:54:24.610]
One of only four states banning sexual doodas

[01:54:24.610 --> 01:54:26.770]
The other three being virginia, Mississippi and Alabama

[01:54:27.590 --> 01:54:30.890]
Texas is not about to take this insult lying down, so to speak

[01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:34.590]
Last week, state attorney general Greg Abbott petitioned the appellate court

[01:54:34.590 --> 01:54:35.570]
To reconsider the matter

[01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:37.910]
And I would wrote that it permitted to stand

[01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:39.030]
Of course this is my invite

[01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:42.110]
Challenges to previously uncontroversial criminal prohibitions

[01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:43.890]
On sexual practices such as

[01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:46.390]
Concentral ideal incest or bigamy

[01:54:47.850 --> 01:54:49.010]
All of the suburbiculate

[01:54:49.710 --> 01:54:50.470]
I'm a bigar friend

[01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:51.510]
I was very big of you

[01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:54.850]
Now I don't have any idea how to pronounce this guy's name

[01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:56.470]
Because I don't know anything about dimensions and dragons

[01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:59.610]
Gary GYG-AX

[01:54:59.610 --> 01:55:00.290]
GIG-AX?

[01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.890]
GIG-AX

[01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:02.290]
GIG-AX?

[01:55:02.490 --> 01:55:03.370]
GIG-AX

[01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.590]
He's dead

[01:55:05.590 --> 01:55:07.330]
Yeah, plagiarist

[01:55:09.590 --> 01:55:10.550]
You know he was dead?

[01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:11.170]
Yeah

[01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:13.570]
He got this yesterday morning

[01:55:13.570 --> 01:55:14.230]
Uh-huh

[01:55:14.230 --> 01:55:15.450]
You see it?

[01:55:15.570 --> 01:55:17.390]
There's only Yahoo who was one of the front story

[01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:18.230]
Oh, well

[01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:20.590]
Gary GYG-AX?

[01:55:21.090 --> 01:55:21.550]
Is that what he said?

[01:55:21.810 --> 01:55:21.930]
Yeah

[01:55:21.930 --> 01:55:24.850]
One of the co-creators of Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game

[01:55:24.850 --> 01:55:25.270]
GYG-AX?

[01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:26.950]
Any morning to the showman Lake Geneva, Wisconsin?

[01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:28.610]
Uh-GYG-AX?

[01:55:28.770 --> 01:55:32.730]
The design of the original D&D game with Dave Arnison in 1974

[01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:37.470]
And went on to create the dangerous journeys and legendary adventure RPGs

[01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:38.790]
As well as a number of board games

[01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:40.310]
He also wrote several fantasy novels

[01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:46.770]
I don't think I really glocted yet, said Mike Murls, the lead developer of the upcoming 4th edition of Dungeons and Dragons

[01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:49.270]
He was like the cool uncle of every gamer head

[01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:51.350]
He shaped an entire generation of gamers

[01:55:52.810 --> 01:55:53.470]
GIG-AX?

[01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:53.690]
Murls

[01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:59.850]
GIG-AX was not directly involved with Dungeons and Dragons after 85th's relationship with his former company T.S.R. Inc.

[01:56:00.170 --> 01:56:01.210]
Wasn't friendly at first

[01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:04.950]
The company sued him over his competing game Dangerous Journeys

[01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:08.990]
And in 2000 for interview with Game Spy, he stated that he was pleased to say that

[01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:11.190]
He thought the girl he associates to the game

[01:56:12.690 --> 01:56:18.330]
While reportedly on a front of the Dungeons and Dragons game, he created adventures and settings that could be used with it

[01:56:18.330 --> 01:56:20.910]
Which were published by Troll Lord Game

[01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:31.730]
Everybody's taller

[01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.730]
I'm gonna be there

[01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:41.570]
You're all good

[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:53.090]
Well there's supposed to be some words here but I forgot because I'm supposed to much fine

[01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:53.970]
I'm gonna be fine

[01:56:53.970 --> 01:56:56.930]
I'm gonna be allowed to lose it everybody out there is supposed to fine

[01:56:57.490 --> 01:56:58.170]
I'm gonna stop

[01:56:58.610 --> 01:57:00.250]
I'm bailing in the middle of the street

[01:57:00.250 --> 01:57:02.570]
I'm gonna go to heaven and watch your face

[01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:03.930]
Let's go to fight

[01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:04.510]
You're fair

[01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:06.150]
Let's not stop to fight

[01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:06.510]
Oh

[01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:08.250]
Let's go to fight

[01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:09.290]
Oh

[01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:10.010]
Let's go to fight

[01:57:11.150 --> 01:57:11.530]
You're fair

[01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:12.990]
Come on

[01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:14.670]
Let's go to fight

[01:57:15.250 --> 01:57:15.290]
Yeah

[01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.850]
Oh

[01:57:24.850 --> 01:57:25.010]
Oh

[01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.070]
Oh

[01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:25.130]
Oh

[01:57:25.130 --> 01:57:27.950]
Club 47, 13 to 15, 65, 60 W.A.M.

[01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:30.050]
We got the jerk show coming up with two mad dogs and four

[01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:31.070]
The jerk show

[01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:33.590]
What happened yesterday?

[01:57:33.850 --> 01:57:36.750]
Something you know, I guess they got on on time. I don't know what the deal was

[01:57:37.530 --> 01:57:38.130]
I don't know

[01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:41.250]
Oh no, you kept saying okay okay remember that?

[01:57:41.410 --> 01:57:43.050]
Well we had a little bit of a

[01:57:43.050 --> 01:57:43.970]
A little bit of a

[01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:47.890]
It's like a little bit in there because quarks tweet whatever that kid's name is an idiot

[01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:50.970]
And that would be surprised if you get called in for another inquisition

[01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:54.550]
How come you guys can't end the show the right way everyday so they know when to start

[01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:57.630]
That's just us were bastards

[01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:04.590]
If you want to call it in sign...let me try it again.

[01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:06.530]
I haven't even got to the first sentence that is,

[01:58:06.610 --> 01:58:08.350]
by Michael Collins on the smirking chimp,

[01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:10.430]
Obama's lost votes no surprise.

[01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.530]
Is that a lie?

[01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:14.570]
If you want to call it significant undercounting your assets,

[01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:16.970]
a euphemism for fraud, Michael Bloomberg,

[01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:19.410]
made of New York City commenting on 80 election districts

[01:58:19.410 --> 01:58:21.710]
with zero votes for Barack Obama.

[01:58:23.150 --> 01:58:25.510]
A review by the New York Times of the unofficial results

[01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:28.270]
reported on primary and I found about 80 election districts

[01:58:28.270 --> 01:58:32.330]
among New York City's 6,106, or Mr. Obama,

[01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:34.490]
supposedly didn't receive even one vote,

[01:58:34.810 --> 01:58:37.650]
including cases where he ran a respectable race in the nearby district.

[01:58:39.490 --> 01:58:41.670]
The reports of voting problems in New York City

[01:58:41.670 --> 01:58:42.730]
should come as no surprise.

[01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:45.410]
Anyone who's examined the administrative urban elections administration

[01:58:45.410 --> 01:58:47.190]
and reporting in the modern political era

[01:58:47.190 --> 01:58:49.770]
knows that the urban centers have shot evoting equipment,

[01:58:50.330 --> 01:58:52.370]
curious results, really question or investigated,

[01:58:52.370 --> 01:58:54.110]
and lackluster administration.

[01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:57.970]
In 2004, a stunning event occurred,

[01:58:58.150 --> 01:59:00.470]
one so stunning was never reported by the mainstream media,

[01:59:00.810 --> 01:59:03.090]
according to the media consortium's Nationalized at Poll,

[01:59:03.590 --> 01:59:04.910]
George W. Bush won the election,

[01:59:05.290 --> 01:59:07.410]
through a huge increase in his big city votes,

[01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:10.310]
three cities are defined as half a million or greater population.

[01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:13.590]
Let's take a look at the questions about results in New York

[01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:15.310]
and other big cities in 2004 election

[01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:17.670]
and how those questions were apparent to the mainstream media

[01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:18.810]
but deliberately ignored.

[01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:21.970]
This will provide an obvious clue

[01:59:21.970 --> 01:59:23.570]
about what's behind the 80 election districts,

[01:59:23.810 --> 01:59:24.710]
absent Obama votes,

[01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:26.610]
and other urban election irregularities

[01:59:26.610 --> 01:59:28.450]
as they show up around the country in 2008.

[01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:34.790]
80 districts, he didn't get a one vote in any of them in New York.

[01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:37.930]
Accordingly, 2004, a final exit poll

[01:59:37.930 --> 01:59:38.970]
from the media consortium,

[01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:40.690]
a PPC and then the four-mage in efforts,

[01:59:41.170 --> 01:59:44.090]
there was a 66% increase in big city turnout,

[01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:46.790]
compared to a 16% average increase nationwide.

[01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:50.410]
Bush made huge vote gains compared to a 2,000 exit poll,

[01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:51.830]
even when any big cities,

[01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:53.590]
but without these gains, he would have lost the election.

[01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:56.130]
He shared a big city minority votes

[01:59:56.130 --> 01:59:57.590]
with similar water ben in 2000,

[01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:59.630]
minority showed a strong lawyer to the Democrats,

[01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:01.530]
but how about that 80% increase

[02:00:01.530 --> 02:00:03.910]
and turn out for big city white voters?

[02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:06.830]
Right away we know that there's something wrong with the exit poll.

[02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:10.410]
The exit poll showed that Bush increased his votes here in the big cities

[02:00:10.410 --> 02:00:12.930]
by 53% over 2,000 performance.

[02:00:13.230 --> 02:00:15.410]
He also racked up a healthy game in the smaller cities,

[02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:17.730]
breaking even with Kerry where Gore had whipped his ass,

[02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:20.410]
57% to 40% that category in 2000.

[02:00:21.730 --> 02:00:23.570]
Charles Cook led the upward tyranny list

[02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:25.110]
by proclaiming that Bush and Roe v.R.N.

[02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:28.230]
the best plan best executed presidential campaign ever.

[02:00:28.650 --> 02:00:30.450]
Cook was dead wrong when he asserted

[02:00:30.450 --> 02:00:32.770]
that the Republican gains in big cities came through defections

[02:00:32.770 --> 02:00:34.510]
from traditional Democratic voters,

[02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:36.350]
lacks Latinos and Jewish voters,

[02:00:36.610 --> 02:00:38.130]
that simply did not happen.

[02:00:39.330 --> 02:00:42.490]
We were also told that 2004 was a red versus blue election.

[02:00:42.970 --> 02:00:44.810]
The media concerned him that specified and sponsored

[02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:47.570]
and the polling and an analization somehow failed to report

[02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:50.350]
massive reductions in the Bush Roe vote totals,

[02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:53.490]
two million less than 2004 revealed by their own polling.

[02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:56.210]
They also failed to mention the major reduction of the role segment,

[02:00:56.530 --> 02:01:00.690]
which fell from 23% of the electorate in 2000 to 16% in 2004.

[02:01:01.150 --> 02:01:02.350]
Roe white set this one up,

[02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:03.550]
and nobody bothered to tell us that.

[02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:05.530]
But we're in for a surprise,

[02:01:05.850 --> 02:01:07.510]
while Roe white stayed home in record numbers

[02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:08.370]
according to the exit poll,

[02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:11.130]
four million new white voters were conjured up in the big cities.

[02:01:13.190 --> 02:01:17.370]
Bush supposedly grabbed those big city gains according to the final exit polls of 2004,

[02:01:18.250 --> 02:01:19.870]
Grobby Bush among big city white voters,

[02:01:19.870 --> 02:01:21.750]
54% to 40% in 2000.

[02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:25.090]
But in 2004, white ghosted Roe's in their slumber

[02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:26.970]
and rushed to the polls to give Bush the votes he needed.

[02:01:27.250 --> 02:01:28.630]
From five million in 2000,

[02:01:29.150 --> 02:01:31.530]
the number of white voters swell to nine million in 2004,

[02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:34.270]
giving Bush a 39% share for 2004,

[02:01:34.650 --> 02:01:36.370]
compared to just 26% in 2000,

[02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:37.850]
it was a freaking miracle.

[02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:45.550]
The national exit poll finding of our four million new big city white voters resulted in major gains for Bush,

[02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:47.930]
and the immediate conservative national exit poll scenario,

[02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:51.650]
the big city turned out waving the resulting millions of white ghosts easily compensated

[02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:53.070]
for the two million fewer votes

[02:01:53.070 --> 02:01:54.550]
both gotten his red state stronghold,

[02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:55.890]
the rural voting segment.

[02:01:56.410 --> 02:02:02.230]
This information is all in the data sets used to formulate the final exit polls for 2000 and 2004.

[02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:09.190]
The false basis for the claimed 66% increase in big city turnout by the immediate conservative

[02:02:09.190 --> 02:02:12.390]
was revealed in the discussed in June and again this September of last year.

[02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:14.150]
Official big city vote totals,

[02:02:14.290 --> 02:02:17.010]
the vote count is opposed to the estimated vote based on exit polls,

[02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:23.550]
showed only a 17% increase in turnout based on 13 big city vote totals representing 60% of the big city population.

[02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:29.030]
Here's how the immediate conservative explained their 66% increase in big city turnout, no comment,

[02:02:29.490 --> 02:02:30.830]
no correction, not a word.

[02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:33.390]
They don't care because they don't have to, they don't want to.

[02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:37.510]
The big cities are treated like a political version of Roman Polanski's Chinatown,

[02:02:37.810 --> 02:02:43.010]
a place where we hide our deepest secrets knowing fuel will look even fewer where we report their findings.

[02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:49.450]
Select the reporting erases real news that's tidying up history so the truly important questions are never asked and never answered.

[02:02:49.770 --> 02:02:55.790]
This action takes on extra meaning when reporting I focus on highly questionable behavior by the owners of media organizations that do the reporting.

[02:02:56.410 --> 02:02:57.730]
Why would New York City be any different?

[02:02:58.450 --> 02:03:01.310]
The National exit poll is the narrative for our national elections,

[02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:05.530]
it's used by nearly every major media organization to explain who voted, why they voted,

[02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:07.650]
the way they did and where they voted.

[02:03:08.110 --> 02:03:12.610]
We now know that the 2004 National exit poll is deeply flawed in its measure of big city voting.

[02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:14.670]
What about the official big city vote totals?

[02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:19.670]
These are the votes reported by election officials in New York City based on official reported totals,

[02:03:19.930 --> 02:03:23.330]
which votes increased in all five boroughs in 2004 compared to 2000.

[02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:28.510]
Turn out for the president so it was only 12% to 260,000 votes in New York,

[02:03:28.810 --> 02:03:32.010]
but Bush got almost all of that with 47% increase over 2000.

[02:03:32.630 --> 02:03:37.890]
He went from 399,000 and 2000 to 588,000 in 2004.

[02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:44.590]
One of the nation's poorest areas that branched was so pleased with Bush that the voters emerged to give him a 40% increase.

[02:03:45.190 --> 02:03:49.510]
Brooklyn also showed its appreciation, maybe it was those new big city white voters the exit poll found.

[02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:53.090]
Heavily democratic queens had new votes in excess with the president,

[02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:59.890]
all three liberal Manhattan and the side of 9-11 fell generous and gave Bush 17% more votes in 2004 than they did in 2000.

[02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:04.290]
We must believe that four years had allowed some New Yorkers to know and love the president with these increased margins.

[02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:05.370]
How did that happen?

[02:04:05.970 --> 02:04:09.850]
Did Bush do something special to appeal to New Yorkers, was he campaigning hard in the big apple?

[02:04:10.130 --> 02:04:11.870]
How often did he visit New York after the convention?

[02:04:13.110 --> 02:04:14.890]
One piece of evidence not often mentioned,

[02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:17.830]
but in the speech of the city of Bush's improved performance in 2004,

[02:04:18.250 --> 02:04:21.290]
so that the international announced poll findings in August 30th of last year.

[02:04:22.410 --> 02:04:26.170]
On the eve of a Republican national convention in the hooking 9-11 symbol sound bites and imagery,

[02:04:26.590 --> 02:04:31.270]
half of New York City residents say that some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on around 9-11

[02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:32.970]
and that they consciously failed to act.

[02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:38.430]
There's a very good argument that many of the 50% would go out and vote just to send a message.

[02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:43.130]
There's no argument at all that a single one of that 50% would ever vote for Bush under any circumstances.

[02:04:43.630 --> 02:04:49.050]
Nevertheless, he received 47% more votes in 2004 in New York than in 2000.

[02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:51.130]
How can these games happen?

[02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:55.690]
Can we believe this took place in the city with a tradition ranging from indifference to hostility of national Republicans?

[02:04:56.090 --> 02:05:00.630]
At a time when nearly half the population believed that some of our leaders knew about 9-11 advance but just let it happen?

[02:05:01.690 --> 02:05:05.430]
These results make no more sense than the big city numbers in the media sponsored exit polls.

[02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:10.890]
Did the pundits, officials and politicians forget the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers are protested?

[02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:14.170]
The mere presence of Republicans at the National Convention in New York in 2004?

[02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:21.810]
Did they fail to notice a major increase in vote totals by a dislike present and hostile territory while that same candidate was suffering major vote losses in his rural base?

[02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:28.070]
A political parties and media refused to admit that to the failed 2000 for exit polls findings.

[02:05:28.450 --> 02:05:33.050]
The median politicians also failed to notice the unbelievable increase in New York City votes for Bush in 2004.

[02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:39.450]
We can anticipate that the national media will now ignore what New York Times reporter Roberts found and they will miss one likely explanation.

[02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:43.430]
That's a typical expert event points to a election fraud.

[02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:48.810]
And it goes on to the length of ponderous, you know what I mean? Too many numbers.

[02:05:50.010 --> 02:05:51.750]
You read numbers, you made a good ending up.

[02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:53.590]
To me, in fact, Georgia I think is passed on.

[02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:54.030]
What?

[02:05:54.450 --> 02:05:55.710]
Not passed out, passed on.

[02:05:56.010 --> 02:05:56.610]
Passed on to what?

[02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:57.650]
Passed it on.

[02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:58.550]
To the other side.

[02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:59.250]
All right.

[02:06:00.490 --> 02:06:01.550]
And now what Jim Morrison said?

[02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:02.830]
Breakout through.

[02:06:03.010 --> 02:06:04.290]
Pass out through to the other side.

[02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:05.010]
He's out there.

[02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:06.190]
He's in France now.

[02:06:06.370 --> 02:06:06.930]
He's ten in bar.

[02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:08.750]
He's ten in bar.

[02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.950]
He's ten in bar.

[02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:09.670]
It's some frog bar.

[02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:10.970]
Maybe he's in Montréal.

[02:06:11.890 --> 02:06:12.890]
The biggest name.

[02:06:13.190 --> 02:06:15.350]
The vast majority of his little projects.

[02:06:15.670 --> 02:06:16.930]
Fortight of 5.60 QAM.

[02:06:18.010 --> 02:06:19.490]
The highest points leader.

[02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:20.890]
This is honored.

[02:06:21.310 --> 02:06:22.430]
This is not a tumor.

[02:06:22.770 --> 02:06:24.490]
It's the one that took two hours.

[02:06:25.450 --> 02:06:26.730]
This is honored with his news.

[02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:30.690]
Former president Clinton was in Texas yesterday, something for his wife.

[02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:32.670]
If she wins in Texas, you know how?

[02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:33.870]
I think she'll be the nominee.

[02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:35.130]
It's all on you.

[02:06:35.130 --> 02:06:37.850]
You can trust her with your money.

[02:06:38.410 --> 02:06:43.030]
President Clinton was criticized for what some were calling negative campaigning towards Barack Obama.

[02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.950]
Senator Obama.

[02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:46.130]
It's severely hydrocephalic.

[02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:48.650]
His head is big.

[02:06:49.330 --> 02:06:51.610]
So incomprehensibly large.

[02:06:51.930 --> 02:06:53.190]
It is a serious problem.

[02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:55.450]
You should tell you today he stayed very positive.

[02:06:55.570 --> 02:06:58.590]
In fact, he never mentioned Barack Obama's name one story in speech.

[02:06:59.010 --> 02:07:00.470]
I worked hard to try to kill him.

[02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:01.350]
I tried.

[02:07:01.690 --> 02:07:03.010]
So I tried and failed.

[02:07:03.010 --> 02:07:05.270]
It was a perfect political strategy.

[02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:08.030]
I just wanted to make sure everybody knows I'm helping her.

[02:07:08.410 --> 02:07:09.470]
She loves it.

[02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:11.210]
But it sounded gruesome.

[02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:13.970]
President Bill Clinton is fine tuning the message.

[02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:15.050]
Senator Obama.

[02:07:15.490 --> 02:07:17.130]
Cut in half.

[02:07:18.170 --> 02:07:22.030]
You notice how they put him back into the cupboard and made him disappear last couple of weeks?

[02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.970]
Yeah, he started.

[02:07:23.110 --> 02:07:24.470]
And how much better he did last night?

[02:07:25.130 --> 02:07:26.130]
What if that's his coincidence?

[02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:27.630]
Oh, well.

[02:07:28.270 --> 02:07:31.250]
Well, we had 51 dropouts on our streaming there.

[02:07:31.250 --> 02:07:32.750]
I have no idea what else going on with that.

[02:07:33.130 --> 02:07:33.850]
That's not good, man.

[02:07:35.370 --> 02:07:38.550]
Fick you on dropout and it happened like in a lickety split.

[02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:40.070]
Yeah, I mean, it's a nightmare out there.

[02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.690]
It's the weather.

[02:07:41.170 --> 02:07:41.790]
Was that what it is?

[02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.550]
Storm in dormant.

[02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:44.370]
What's that got to do with your internet streaming?

[02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:45.230]
Are you kidding?

[02:07:47.790 --> 02:07:48.150]
No.

[02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:52.690]
It got, you know, the wires, travels on wires and storms knock things out.

[02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:53.830]
Lightning, you know.

[02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:58.890]
245 votes on our, which restaurant, the joint?

[02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:00.850]
No longer there, did you miss the most?

[02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:05.110]
And Lums continues when I, I don't know.

[02:08:05.190 --> 02:08:05.830]
I agree with you.

[02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:06.970]
I don't get it.

[02:08:06.990 --> 02:08:08.850]
I mean, I'm not saying that Lums is OK.

[02:08:08.890 --> 02:08:15.490]
It was fine, but compared to some of these other really good type like the studio, I mean, I guess this is a poll for Schleppers.

[02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:16.030]
I don't know.

[02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:17.810]
I mean, everybody could afford to eat the Lums.

[02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:19.630]
Even the homeless could afford to eat the Lums, right?

[02:08:19.970 --> 02:08:21.150]
There's a Schlepper factor.

[02:08:21.250 --> 02:08:21.570]
Oh, wait a minute.

[02:08:21.630 --> 02:08:22.470]
There's McKinnon Bush.

[02:08:23.230 --> 02:08:24.130]
Oh, what a Kinnon Bush.

[02:08:24.490 --> 02:08:25.110]
It's a Kinnon Bush.

[02:08:25.110 --> 02:08:27.290]
I'm out before the cameras had...

[02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:28.310]
Call a daughter of no craziness.

[02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:30.050]
Call a woman to be endorsed under the Kinnon.

[02:08:30.050 --> 02:08:31.050]
I mean, what a difference.

[02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:32.210]
Eight years, Nick.

[02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:32.670]
Yeah.

[02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:35.670]
Fony Baloney, that's what he's trying to say.

[02:08:36.050 --> 02:08:36.650]
Fony Baloney.

[02:08:37.730 --> 02:08:41.030]
Remember that smearing, smearing, he'd be out of the Kinnon in 2000, wow.

[02:08:41.230 --> 02:08:41.410]
Yeah.

[02:08:42.330 --> 02:08:44.070]
So that he did steal a freight train.

[02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:49.290]
Lums 50, Sizzler 34, now that was yours, wasn't it?

[02:08:49.630 --> 02:08:49.750]
Right.

[02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:52.990]
Wolfies 28, V. State Charlie's 21.

[02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:55.290]
Were those big pictures of Sangria?

[02:08:57.290 --> 02:09:00.850]
You know, I was thinking during the break about the most

[02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:02.810]
the meaning jobs other than the ones we're doing.

[02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.750]
Right.

[02:09:04.230 --> 02:09:07.430]
The most the meaning jobs you could, and I'm thinking of being a waiter or waitress.

[02:09:08.010 --> 02:09:08.310]
I agree.

[02:09:09.090 --> 02:09:11.750]
Isn't it the meaning they get their revenge?

[02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:15.470]
Because I was thinking about guys peeing in the Sangria.

[02:09:15.650 --> 02:09:16.590]
You know, there are no the difference.

[02:09:17.550 --> 02:09:19.490]
I think that should's called San Pia.

[02:09:20.110 --> 02:09:20.750]
Yeah, it might be.

[02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:23.930]
I'm out of, I'm out of, I'm out of poor beer with the Santa Pia.

[02:09:25.730 --> 02:09:27.950]
Anyway, I just, I can't envision doing that.

[02:09:28.050 --> 02:09:32.410]
Waiting on people and like kissing their ass and like, and of course then you get all these ground cheaper.

[02:09:32.690 --> 02:09:33.050]
A lot of time.

[02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:36.050]
Oh, this was then, it was cooked a little bit too much.

[02:09:36.230 --> 02:09:42.550]
Can't you get it to, or the best one is people are real, real cheap skates who eat like 90% of the steak and then,

[02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:43.810]
oh, I want to send it back.

[02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:44.990]
It was, I don't want it.

[02:09:45.490 --> 02:09:46.150]
I don't like it.

[02:09:46.770 --> 02:09:48.930]
And they've eaten 90% of whatever the meal was.

[02:09:48.930 --> 02:09:49.790]
You know, I didn't like it.

[02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:50.150]
Right.

[02:09:51.010 --> 02:09:55.770]
What they try to do is get hope that they'll not the thing off the bill and they won't have to pay for it.

[02:09:56.250 --> 02:09:56.570]
Cheap.

[02:09:56.930 --> 02:10:01.730]
If there's one thing, it's one thing for people to be cheap who can't afford, you know, who need to be cheap.

[02:10:02.670 --> 02:10:03.410]
Like you guys.

[02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:08.890]
Yeah, but George isn't cheap even at Gostin last couple of times.

[02:10:09.070 --> 02:10:11.370]
He's, he's got a little bit of plunge in there for guys to make a try.

[02:10:11.490 --> 02:10:12.010]
He's like, he's sitting now.

[02:10:12.170 --> 02:10:13.370]
Hey, you know, when in Rome.

[02:10:14.070 --> 02:10:14.230]
Rome.

[02:10:14.370 --> 02:10:14.810]
Do the Romans.

[02:10:15.130 --> 02:10:17.010]
Right in Rome do the Romans and believe you me.

[02:10:17.210 --> 02:10:17.970]
Oh, baby.

[02:10:17.970 --> 02:10:18.370]
Wow.

[02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:20.150]
Oh, who's this David?

[02:10:20.410 --> 02:10:20.870]
What's his name?

[02:10:22.450 --> 02:10:25.030]
Hernandez from American Idol, which I don't watch.

[02:10:25.130 --> 02:10:26.790]
You never have an ever-wielding with him on their naked.

[02:10:27.210 --> 02:10:27.630]
Who is he?

[02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:28.550]
He's a pretty good looking guy.

[02:10:28.590 --> 02:10:29.110]
He's got some fake.

[02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:30.690]
Is he another, uh, queen?

[02:10:30.970 --> 02:10:31.130]
Yes.

[02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:34.410]
He was a male, male stripper or something like that.

[02:10:34.530 --> 02:10:34.990]
A male model.

[02:10:35.130 --> 02:10:36.050]
I don't know what, a male stripper.

[02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:36.930]
That's what he's going to be.

[02:10:37.050 --> 02:10:37.530]
The big scandal.

[02:10:37.650 --> 02:10:38.630]
That's the news, says, yeah.

[02:10:39.010 --> 02:10:41.330]
And it's interesting because I was just, I always on your Yahoo.

[02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:43.510]
You know, you're all that big on getting your news from Yahoo.

[02:10:44.230 --> 02:10:45.150]
So they had a picture there.

[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:46.250]
American Idol scandal.

[02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:48.310]
A bubble by, you know, I'm a big picture.

[02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:51.130]
And some of the pictures he looks really, really great.

[02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:52.690]
I mean, like a beautiful guy to look.

[02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:53.990]
And some of the pictures he looks very.

[02:10:54.090 --> 02:10:54.410]
Yes.

[02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:55.610]
A screamer, you know what I'm saying?

[02:10:57.090 --> 02:10:57.410]
Faaaning.

[02:10:57.670 --> 02:10:57.810]
What?

[02:10:57.970 --> 02:11:00.890]
As you know, when you go check your email, those are the stories that are right there in your face.

[02:11:02.110 --> 02:11:02.430]
Yes.

[02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:04.490]
So it's difficult to avoid something.

[02:11:04.630 --> 02:11:04.990]
Oh, I know.

[02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:06.770]
Once in a while, I'll check some of those out.

[02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:09.930]
I mean, you realize I do have like, I've got a pile of crap here all the way to the scene.

[02:11:10.090 --> 02:11:12.670]
I'm going to read one of these local papers or watch the local news.

[02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:13.270]
For the news.

[02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:14.050]
No, I would hope not.

[02:11:14.230 --> 02:11:14.750]
Or CNN.

[02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:16.470]
Oh, my God.

[02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:19.010]
For we saw Senator John McCain.

[02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:22.850]
I want to switch over right now to MSNBC and see if they got some of them.

[02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:24.650]
You know, who's a real idiot on MSNBC?

[02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:25.650]
She's in a simple thing.

[02:11:26.130 --> 02:11:30.030]
And every now and then, oh, it light up electronic board that we call all these states.

[02:11:30.210 --> 02:11:32.570]
We can put that to bed now.

[02:11:32.690 --> 02:11:34.610]
Chris Matthews talking politics.

[02:11:35.890 --> 02:11:39.290]
Chris Matthews is going to have, you know, he's like, like what's his name?

[02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.850]
What's his name?

[02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:45.830]
Gloria Vanderbilt's son, Anderson Cooper, you know, what about him?

[02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:49.510]
He talks with a speech defense party as we're honoring today.

[02:11:49.710 --> 02:11:50.650]
You can't even say politics.

[02:11:50.970 --> 02:11:52.070]
You know, he can't even pronounce it.

[02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:53.630]
He talks all the time about politics.

[02:11:54.090 --> 02:11:55.810]
How can you talk about it when you can't say it?

[02:11:56.710 --> 02:11:58.110]
And he talks out of the side of his mouth.

[02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:59.290]
He's good for the second try.

[02:11:59.490 --> 02:12:00.190]
The college try.

[02:12:00.370 --> 02:12:01.350]
I've got a college try.

[02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:03.290]
The old college, you had a good college try.

[02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:07.070]
And anyway, I don't want to wait on people, you know.

[02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:11.050]
Ohio, she went by 10% 54 to 44.

[02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:13.690]
Oh, Rhode Island, she went to Zastaf, he went to 40.

[02:12:14.150 --> 02:12:16.850]
He went for her ass in Vermont by 20.

[02:12:17.010 --> 02:12:17.490]
What was it?

[02:12:17.670 --> 02:12:18.950]
A lot, 22 points.

[02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:20.650]
And in Texas, she went by four points.

[02:12:21.850 --> 02:12:24.650]
And the caucuses, the Obama beat her 52 to 48.

[02:12:24.750 --> 02:12:25.110]
It was close.

[02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:27.590]
It was Nippentuck, Nippent Suds.

[02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:30.970]
And the Vermont beat her by 20 points, 59 to 39.

[02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:33.170]
Let me say it again.

[02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:36.310]
Well, we need, there are two things that we need.

[02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:40.910]
One is forced sterilization and two is a national primary.

[02:12:42.230 --> 02:12:42.990]
It's not available.

[02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.090]
Right.

[02:12:44.290 --> 02:12:44.850]
It's not, it's not.

[02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:48.030]
Then you wouldn't have the buckles like we had a Michigan Afroda this year.

[02:12:48.230 --> 02:12:49.270]
Oh, we want to be early.

[02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:51.210]
We want to help set the agenda.

[02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:53.450]
We want to be at a course they want of setting nothing.

[02:12:54.810 --> 02:12:59.310]
And if she and her, her henchmen there trying to try to like say,

[02:13:00.150 --> 02:13:01.670]
oh, and they're already saying it, you know.

[02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:03.410]
Oh, we got to get those delegates, you know,

[02:13:03.490 --> 02:13:04.730]
from Florida and Michigan, they got to come.

[02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:05.630]
Well, guess what?

[02:13:05.890 --> 02:13:07.090]
Have a real election then.

[02:13:08.590 --> 02:13:10.490]
Especially in Michigan, she's the only one on the ballot.

[02:13:10.490 --> 02:13:12.470]
She only got 55% against nobody.

[02:13:13.210 --> 02:13:14.850]
And she's saying all she wanted delegates.

[02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:17.410]
Give me a break, okay?

[02:13:17.810 --> 02:13:18.650]
Give me a break, honey.

[02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:19.430]
What do you want it?

[02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:20.830]
What was that?

[02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.550]
What?

[02:13:22.230 --> 02:13:22.770]
You hear that?

[02:13:23.090 --> 02:13:23.190]
Look.

[02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:26.510]
This thing is doing some funky stuff today, man.

[02:13:27.150 --> 02:13:30.410]
Maybe that's why we had, now was it porn cats and dogs when you came in?

[02:13:31.150 --> 02:13:31.310]
Look.

[02:13:31.650 --> 02:13:32.650]
Because we're able to show.

[02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:33.810]
Remember we have a no-sificant.

[02:13:33.930 --> 02:13:37.250]
And then in the early part of the show, when you have lost your eyes,

[02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:37.930]
it's very nice.

[02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:40.390]
And, uh, you said it's porn, you know, that,

[02:13:40.450 --> 02:13:41.750]
it's porn dogs at that point.

[02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:43.770]
No, this was before when we lost contact.

[02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:44.550]
Yeah, before, yes.

[02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:45.870]
When I was sitting here during the show,

[02:13:45.870 --> 02:13:48.710]
I was just wondering, is George ever going to show up on this thing again or what?

[02:13:48.850 --> 02:13:48.950]
What?

[02:13:49.230 --> 02:13:49.230]

[02:13:50.850 --> 02:13:52.390]
Jesus, K Christ, man.

[02:13:53.490 --> 02:13:55.170]
Patience, one, it's four of the good.

[02:13:55.770 --> 02:13:58.890]
I watch him, but I'm not so sure about him, you know.

[02:14:00.070 --> 02:14:00.710]
Prime victims.

[02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:04.210]
I mean, he's an okay news video.

[02:14:04.570 --> 02:14:06.410]
You know who oughta be the anchor on NBC News?

[02:14:06.410 --> 02:14:07.410]
You still don't know who he is.

[02:14:07.730 --> 02:14:08.130]
Lester Hold.

[02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:10.090]
Although they got your list funky new glasses.

[02:14:10.330 --> 02:14:11.270]
They look like 3D glasses.

[02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:13.270]
He was wearing last night in Texas somewhere.

[02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:14.550]
Maybe he was trying to disguise himself.

[02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:17.990]
Lester Hold would be a great anchor on NBC.

[02:14:18.090 --> 02:14:19.190]
They would kick everybody's ass.

[02:14:19.330 --> 02:14:19.790]
He's great.

[02:14:20.170 --> 02:14:21.550]
He's got a sensational voice.

[02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:22.490]
He's articulate.

[02:14:22.890 --> 02:14:23.790]
He's a good news reader.

[02:14:24.090 --> 02:14:26.890]
He looks good on the air, except with the stupid 3D glasses.

[02:14:26.890 --> 02:14:29.330]
He oughta be the NBC News anchor, not Brian Williams.

[02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:32.190]
Why don't they consult with me?

[02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:34.030]
I mean, I have to say CBS a ton of money.

[02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:38.250]
I would've taken just for consulting about a 10th of what they're paying Katie Kirk, that bitch.

[02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:42.210]
You can find her numbers with a Magnivision reading glass.

[02:14:43.590 --> 02:14:45.330]
So anyway, let's get back to the pool here.

[02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:49.070]
Okay, such as it is, love, lums, eh, tubs.

[02:14:50.050 --> 02:14:51.650]
Yeah, take some tubs when you go to lums.

[02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:56.210]
Next time I'm down there, I think we're going to go to a lums on Davy Road Extension.

[02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:58.210]
Okay, what?

[02:14:58.610 --> 02:15:01.470]
Nothing but, you know, Davy Road Extension is very close to where my used to live.

[02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:02.890]
You do know that she was on Sterling Road?

[02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:03.990]
I do know.

[02:15:04.850 --> 02:15:05.950]
You know where she lived.

[02:15:06.150 --> 02:15:08.070]
What else was she was in carriage hills on Sterling Road?

[02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:11.610]
Well, what's that restaurant across the street from where I think it's still there, the Ark?

[02:15:12.970 --> 02:15:16.010]
Oh my God, she always wanted to take us to the Ark.

[02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:19.550]
Oh, and they bring us soup by the order of the night.

[02:15:20.090 --> 02:15:20.410]
Okay?

[02:15:20.690 --> 02:15:23.290]
Because they want to get you in an out of their real fast, and I'm turning over the tables.

[02:15:24.650 --> 02:15:25.250]
The Ark.

[02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:26.210]
Every Dithy Ark?

[02:15:26.730 --> 02:15:26.930]
No.

[02:15:27.290 --> 02:15:28.070]
From past it.

[02:15:28.610 --> 02:15:28.870]
You have?

[02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:30.010]
Yes, I have.

[02:15:30.010 --> 02:15:31.930]
I mean, this is years ago, so maybe it's great.

[02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:36.290]
No, I shouldn't offer opinions on places that I haven't tried in a long, long time, you know?

[02:15:36.630 --> 02:15:37.010]
Or ever.

[02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:41.490]
I mean, like cheesecake factory, you can have it.

[02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:43.530]
No, look at that dessert.

[02:15:43.530 --> 02:15:44.870]
So, weaker to a go at all.

[02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:45.910]
Oh, the cheesecake factory.

[02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:46.930]
You can have it.

[02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.790]
You can have their cheesecake.

[02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:52.110]
And if they're on-trace, if you have the whole, the whole damn thing.

[02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:52.750]
The Chabang?

[02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:53.930]
The whole Chabang.

[02:15:55.070 --> 02:15:55.470]
Horrible.

[02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:59.870]
There's nothing worse than people making a big fuss about something.

[02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:01.550]
Oh, you're in 11, it's going to be great.

[02:16:01.670 --> 02:16:05.030]
And you go there, and it was, oh, just Kakka, man.

[02:16:05.330 --> 02:16:05.690]
Nasty.

[02:16:05.930 --> 02:16:06.310]
Kakka.

[02:16:06.490 --> 02:16:06.810]
Nasty.

[02:16:09.010 --> 02:16:10.990]
Which out of business restaurant you missed the most?

[02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:14.190]
Lums 52, Sizzler 36, Wolfies 31.

[02:16:15.190 --> 02:16:16.870]
Wolfie Cohen, I'm sure, long since dead.

[02:16:17.370 --> 02:16:20.330]
Wouldn't he be- wouldn't he be amazed to see that Rascal House code on the tube?

[02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:21.930]
Well, he sold it to an Epicure, right?

[02:16:22.890 --> 02:16:23.510]
Epicure is good.

[02:16:24.190 --> 02:16:27.490]
You can go there and get some stuff, cabbage, or maybe some gulf of fish like that.

[02:16:29.410 --> 02:16:32.330]
So all the old Jews holding that area, you don't have to get all of them out of shape.

[02:16:32.710 --> 02:16:34.270]
But Rascal House is closing next month.

[02:16:34.330 --> 02:16:35.150]
Less than a month, I think.

[02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:36.170]
Or maybe it's a little over a month.

[02:16:36.530 --> 02:16:37.330]
April 7, I believe.

[02:16:37.810 --> 02:16:38.090]
Okay.

[02:16:38.550 --> 02:16:39.110]
Not soon enough.

[02:16:41.690 --> 02:16:42.910]
Taco Viva 23.

[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:44.770]
B. State Charlie's 22.

[02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:46.550]
The Winnie the Noisder House 21, man.

[02:16:47.130 --> 02:16:48.250]
I sure wish they had that, Charlie.

[02:16:48.250 --> 02:16:49.930]
And I don't want to tell you this.

[02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:55.810]
Anybody who likes Manhattan Clan Chowder, better than New England Clan Chowder, doesn't like Clan Chowder.

[02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:56.690]
I agree.

[02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:59.530]
I mean, Manhattan Clan Chowder is like vegetables soup.

[02:16:59.950 --> 02:17:00.150]
Correct.

[02:17:00.470 --> 02:17:02.030]
I mean, let's find it a pitch, but hey.

[02:17:02.350 --> 02:17:07.170]
It's like ministerially without the noodles and with like a couple of clams swimming around in it.

[02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:07.610]
Right up.

[02:17:09.950 --> 02:17:17.990]
Corkeys 20, Ragn 16, Wolfies 15, Ragn Chowves 15, Pumperd X-14, all the oldsters man.

[02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:19.290]
They put those places out of Venice.

[02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:21.330]
They stole the silverware.

[02:17:21.510 --> 02:17:22.490]
They stole the sweet and low.

[02:17:22.670 --> 02:17:25.730]
They stole, I'm never as long as I live for, get back in those days at INC.

[02:17:27.150 --> 02:17:31.650]
And some old coup, he calls me up in the air, because I was talking about people stealing the silverware.

[02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.970]
And he says, why not?

[02:17:33.550 --> 02:17:34.070]
Why not?

[02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:35.430]
We're paying for the meal.

[02:17:35.570 --> 02:17:36.190]
Why can't we take it?

[02:17:36.490 --> 02:17:37.850]
You're not paying for the silverware.

[02:17:37.930 --> 02:17:39.590]
We're not saying, pick up the damn table.

[02:17:39.710 --> 02:17:40.730]
Or can't take it out of the two.

[02:17:41.550 --> 02:17:43.870]
Put it in the back of the civilian and take it home with you.

[02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:45.230]
God.

[02:17:47.470 --> 02:17:51.150]
So you won't see them no more, because they were put out of business by a bunch of barbarians.

[02:17:52.250 --> 02:17:53.590]
Black Anus has got 13.

[02:17:54.630 --> 02:17:56.310]
There's nothing like the old Black Anus.

[02:17:57.150 --> 02:18:01.970]
Manero's 10, Burton Jack's 9, Sambo's 8, Mr. Codialin's 6th, Fett.

[02:18:02.970 --> 02:18:09.490]
The Unicorn's 6 bow jangles for a near-state house for meals for Rudy's 3, Monks in only 3.

[02:18:10.350 --> 02:18:13.910]
Vito's pizza, 3-volodelli, 3 rocky grassy, 3 piccolos, 3.

[02:18:14.330 --> 02:18:17.110]
Joe's, Sonkins, Gold Coast's got 2, I told you, Chris.

[02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:19.290]
Legendary.

[02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:21.210]
Yep.

[02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:24.790]
The Sizzlin' 2, not the Sizzlin' but the Sizzlin' I don't know what that is.

[02:18:25.090 --> 02:18:25.230]
2.

[02:18:26.010 --> 02:18:26.710]
Got a pair.

[02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:28.770]
The clock 2, the studio only 2.

[02:18:29.090 --> 02:18:32.190]
For the studio restaurant, Freddy's studio, oh my god.

[02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:35.850]
Some of you people are tasting your Tush in your Black Anus.

[02:18:36.690 --> 02:18:39.590]
Hungarian Charter 2, Sizzlin' 2, and only 1.

[02:18:39.930 --> 02:18:44.170]
For Luther's Barbecue, Figaro's Turp Pub, Gigi's and Prince Hamlet.

[02:18:44.390 --> 02:18:48.470]
And none for Tyler's the painted horse sporting bruise or marries.

[02:18:48.690 --> 02:18:49.330]
Poor Mary.

[02:18:50.770 --> 02:18:53.870]
The best out of a T-reff is neurologist.

[02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:55.990]
Sport formula 5.62 AM.

[02:18:56.310 --> 02:18:57.870]
The sports leader.

[02:18:58.410 --> 02:19:00.330]
Guys are very handsome young men.

[02:19:00.570 --> 02:19:01.310]
Who can't see that?

[02:19:01.510 --> 02:19:04.030]
The purpose of the campaign is to build for the future.

[02:19:04.810 --> 02:19:09.870]
Not just to focus on 2008, to build alternative parties.

[02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:11.230]
Build new democracy.

[02:19:11.930 --> 02:19:12.990]
And involve more people.

[02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:17.450]
Here comes another presidential comment, Sizzlin' is known as a Moverettas sacred.

[02:19:17.730 --> 02:19:20.070]
We do include a statement to the race in the race later.

[02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:21.550]
Hey, well, the later.

[02:19:21.730 --> 02:19:25.170]
Because I get things done, I've got a 40-year record here in Washington.

[02:19:25.410 --> 02:19:29.090]
Big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevents

[02:19:29.090 --> 02:19:30.770]
from trying to improve our country.

[02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:34.950]
And everybody has to have the right to not change the improve of their country.

[02:19:35.350 --> 02:19:37.570]
Because we're sure government, you've got to go into electoral groups.

[02:19:37.650 --> 02:19:39.550]
And for many years, this consumer undercated.

[02:19:39.730 --> 02:19:41.970]
I was running in the race independent race leader.

[02:19:42.310 --> 02:19:44.330]
But we get the bonfire, both of the young and sacred.

[02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:46.010]
Hey, well, the later.

[02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:51.450]
On 18 at 5.60, speaking of gathering old fools, there's W.

[02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:53.410]
This is a say, age old question.

[02:19:53.570 --> 02:19:56.930]
And John McCain, who just turned 142, is standing there in front of the White House.

[02:19:57.090 --> 02:19:59.310]
But if he put a boob, put a way out, unbelievable.

[02:19:59.310 --> 02:20:01.770]
So then when I take back what I said about David Hernandez.

[02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:03.130]
Okay.

[02:20:03.450 --> 02:20:04.450]
I just did a little bit of research.

[02:20:04.770 --> 02:20:05.910]
He's a bizarre way.

[02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:08.310]
But what time of the spaceship plan?

[02:20:09.330 --> 02:20:09.530]
The what?

[02:20:10.290 --> 02:20:11.170]
The spaceship.

[02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:12.470]
Oh, what I said.

[02:20:12.910 --> 02:20:14.510]
And what's all this other stuff coming up?

[02:20:14.810 --> 02:20:17.330]
You'll be very disturbed to know, just like I am.

[02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:20.030]
That today I've had two calls from India.

[02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:25.210]
Soliciting postal visitors from India after that the thing yesterday would get my internet fixed.

[02:20:26.530 --> 02:20:27.410]
Is this the cause?

[02:20:27.850 --> 02:20:28.130]
No.

[02:20:29.810 --> 02:20:31.250]
Yeah, he's strange looking out.

[02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:34.650]
There are some people, I know this is a strange thing to say, but it's true.

[02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:37.470]
There are some people who photograph very well.

[02:20:37.970 --> 02:20:41.990]
And they take pictures and it makes them look really, really much better than they actually look.

[02:20:42.330 --> 02:20:44.650]
And there are some people who are very good looking and they photograph poorly.

[02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.830]
That's that strange at all.

[02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:47.690]
Oh, why is that?

[02:20:47.890 --> 02:20:48.350]
Rock-meach.

[02:20:48.730 --> 02:20:50.950]
Shouldn't the picture be worth a thousand, true?

[02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:53.210]
I mean, should the picture show you what somebody looks like?

[02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:58.290]
It should, but when you're looking at somebody not in the picture, they're always, you know, your point of view is always changing.

[02:20:58.490 --> 02:20:59.410]
Their head is moving, you know.

[02:20:59.850 --> 02:21:01.510]
A picture freezes a moment in time.

[02:21:01.650 --> 02:21:02.350]
They're having a movement?

[02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.750]

[02:21:03.690 --> 02:21:05.270]
Sometimes it just happens to be a bad moment.

[02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:07.810]
Go ahead, buddy.

[02:21:07.970 --> 02:21:08.610]
I'm serious.

[02:21:08.730 --> 02:21:10.930]
There are some people who photograph very, very well.

[02:21:11.010 --> 02:21:11.190]
Yeah.

[02:21:11.490 --> 02:21:12.450]
What do they say?

[02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.950]
What do they say?

[02:21:13.010 --> 02:21:15.570]
They're photogenic and they always look really, really hot.

[02:21:15.970 --> 02:21:20.050]
And there are some people that are really great looking and you look at the picture like, oh, so I don't know about that.

[02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:21.190]
And I know what I'll pass.

[02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:22.490]
And I'm sure he will, too.

[02:21:23.530 --> 02:21:24.550]
It's 24, though.

[02:21:25.250 --> 02:21:26.170]
He's on American Idol.

[02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.830]
Yeah.

[02:21:27.390 --> 02:21:28.250]
He can belt it out.

[02:21:30.250 --> 02:21:31.950]
Where do they find all those queens on there?

[02:21:32.050 --> 02:21:33.330]
By the way, is that prerequisite?

[02:21:34.050 --> 02:21:34.870]
It just so happens.

[02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:35.830]
It just happens, though.

[02:21:36.010 --> 02:21:36.610]
It's just an accident.

[02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:38.130]
380 votes on the pool.

[02:21:38.490 --> 02:21:40.350]
And Lombs is still leading the way with 52.

[02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:42.750]
Lombs 52 is just going to 36.

[02:21:43.290 --> 02:21:44.050]
Wolfies 33.

[02:21:45.790 --> 02:21:48.610]
Wolfies was good, man, if you didn't have to be Jewish to like Wolfies.

[02:21:48.610 --> 02:21:52.230]
You're like a good, uh, Ruben sandwich and like a bowl of mosa ball soup.

[02:21:52.270 --> 02:21:52.650]
Mm-hmm.

[02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.910]
I do.

[02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:54.770]
What's not to like?

[02:21:56.430 --> 02:22:02.850]
Slowly fresh off a campaign setting, come back hinted today at the possibility of sharing the Democratic presidential ticket with Barack Obama.

[02:22:03.250 --> 02:22:04.090]
And with her at the top.

[02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:10.330]
Obama played down his losses, stressing he still holds the lead in delegates and referred to a talk of a joint ticket as premature.

[02:22:10.770 --> 02:22:11.910]
George would like a joint ticket.

[02:22:12.070 --> 02:22:12.330]
Sure.

[02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:13.430]
I could take it for a free joint.

[02:22:13.570 --> 02:22:14.130]
Or a ticket joint.

[02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:15.270]
Right.

[02:22:15.430 --> 02:22:17.810]
Or a ticket to ride, depending on who he was going to ride.

[02:22:19.390 --> 02:22:21.590]
On night, they failed to clarify the Democratic race.

[02:22:21.730 --> 02:22:23.490]
John McCain, Clinton's the Republican nomination.

[02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:28.430]
While switlery won primaries in Texas, Ohio and Rhode Island, holding Obama's winning streak, who won in Vermont?

[02:22:29.210 --> 02:22:34.890]
Both Democrats insisted today to head the best credentials they go ahead to head against McCain or his Clinton put a toe to toe.

[02:22:35.090 --> 02:22:36.950]
How about ass to ass on the spectrum?

[02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:38.810]
Like in Requiem.

[02:22:39.050 --> 02:22:40.310]
I gotta watch that again.

[02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:41.830]
I haven't watched that in a long time.

[02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:42.250]
You know what?

[02:22:42.470 --> 02:22:43.610]
Do you think we need to see it again?

[02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:44.430]
Regularly.

[02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:45.810]
You want to get depressed.

[02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.590]
It's a very good move.

[02:22:46.750 --> 02:22:51.170]
Or if you are depressed, watch it and you feel better because you think, boy, I got problems, huh?

[02:22:52.690 --> 02:22:54.730]
Sarah and, uh, what was his name?

[02:22:55.690 --> 02:22:56.150]
I forgot.

[02:22:56.810 --> 02:22:57.750]
I don't know what his name is Jim.

[02:22:59.450 --> 02:23:00.130]
Oh, yeah, Jim.

[02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:02.790]
His name wasn't really Jim.

[02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:03.610]
You just call them that.

[02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:05.050]
I don't.

[02:23:05.050 --> 02:23:06.110]
Let's see how many of you that I remember.

[02:23:06.290 --> 02:23:07.450]
When he showed him that purple vein.

[02:23:07.570 --> 02:23:08.870]
Ooh, thank you, Jim.

[02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.590]

[02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:11.690]
Maybe he just called all white guys.

[02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:12.230]
I don't know.

[02:23:12.310 --> 02:23:12.570]
Why not?

[02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:14.370]
Especially if they had a purple vein.

[02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:15.110]
They all look the same.

[02:23:15.610 --> 02:23:15.930]
Wow.

[02:23:16.210 --> 02:23:17.430]
I never thought I'd get to see Jerod Lee.

[02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:18.570]
There was purple vein, but I did.

[02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:19.450]
I feel like Loyla.

[02:23:20.350 --> 02:23:24.070]
I asked on CBS the early show whether she and Obama should be on the same ticket, Clinton said.

[02:23:24.450 --> 02:23:25.510]
That made me wear this his head.

[02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:27.990]
But of course we have to decide who's on top of the ticket.

[02:23:28.290 --> 02:23:29.190]
I think the people of Ohio.

[02:23:29.610 --> 02:23:30.490]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:23:30.810 --> 02:23:33.270]
I think the people of Ohio very clearly said it should be me.

[02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:34.950]
How about all the other states who lost, bitch?

[02:23:35.790 --> 02:23:36.510]
How do you like that?

[02:23:38.450 --> 02:23:42.550]
Obama who had hoped to knock her out yesterday said he would prevail against a tenacious candidate.

[02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:43.590]
Who just keeps on ticking.

[02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:45.930]
She takes a looking and just keeps on ticking.

[02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:47.570]
What a grotesque thought that is.

[02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.930]
Oh.

[02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:49.670]
What should I do?

[02:23:50.350 --> 02:23:50.590]
Clinton.

[02:23:50.590 --> 02:23:50.590]

[02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:51.610]
Hey, how'd you go?

[02:23:52.050 --> 02:23:56.650]
Clinton acknowledged the race was closed instead of it coming down to her credentials on national security and the economy.

[02:23:56.930 --> 02:23:58.730]
Well, it's going to come down to hosting delegates as well.

[02:23:58.810 --> 02:23:59.710]
It's going to come down to high.

[02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:05.650]
New presidential content has made the rounds of the more network TV shows this morning declaring only one thing certain

[02:24:05.650 --> 02:24:10.230]
that the campaign would go on and next day showed Obama to career April 22 in Pennsylvania.

[02:24:11.430 --> 02:24:14.410]
Before catching a flight back to Illinois from Texas, Obama told the press,

[02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:16.230]
we're just focused on winged denomination.

[02:24:16.390 --> 02:24:16.890]
That's my focus.

[02:24:17.130 --> 02:24:18.410]
I respect Senator Swarovich.

[02:24:18.470 --> 02:24:19.530]
He's been a tenacious opponent.

[02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:22.030]
It's premature to talk about a joint ticket.

[02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:26.550]
McCain, whose grasp on denomination won't seem to be just in reach.

[02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:28.850]
What do you know why he won, don't you?

[02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:29.870]
Did he fall?

[02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:30.510]
I got a fault.

[02:24:32.170 --> 02:24:33.070]
I won't buy a fault.

[02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:34.970]
Look at the field of goofballs.

[02:24:35.550 --> 02:24:37.890]
Juliannie, who at one time everybody thought was a shoe-in,

[02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:41.650]
who I didn't bother to run a campaign because he was busy eating deli in Hollywood,

[02:24:43.310 --> 02:24:45.150]
who didn't make any impact at all,

[02:24:45.470 --> 02:24:47.710]
a Huckaberry who finally last night got the message,

[02:24:48.290 --> 02:24:52.750]
Mitt Romney, who people are, people are, they may enjoy cartoon characters in the cartoons,

[02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:53.910]
but not like in real life.

[02:24:56.190 --> 02:24:57.950]
So, who is he running against?

[02:24:58.490 --> 02:24:58.710]
You're better.

[02:24:59.570 --> 02:25:00.210]
Ron Paul?

[02:25:00.610 --> 02:25:02.270]
Oh, Neil, are you scared of Ron Paul?

[02:25:02.270 --> 02:25:03.230]
He's a scary guy.

[02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:05.230]
He's like Luca Brassi's a very scary guy.

[02:25:06.310 --> 02:25:08.710]
McCain, whose grasp was once, uh, distant reach,

[02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:09.890]
was headed for the White House today.

[02:25:09.890 --> 02:25:11.230]
Well, he's there right now as a matter of fact.

[02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:13.010]
Chris Matthews is talking about politics.

[02:25:13.170 --> 02:25:14.650]
He could venture his country over there.

[02:25:15.090 --> 02:25:17.750]
He made an investment in America, alone in that cell,

[02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.990]
when he was being tortured,

[02:25:19.430 --> 02:25:21.550]
and afraid of being put to death at any moment,

[02:25:21.850 --> 02:25:23.430]
and turning down a chance to come home.

[02:25:23.850 --> 02:25:25.370]
And those are non-political facts,

[02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:26.910]
which I think do work for him.

[02:25:27.130 --> 02:25:28.790]
And when this gets closed, come November,

[02:25:28.970 --> 02:25:30.830]
when it will be, I think, you probably agree,

[02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:33.750]
likely to be a very close contest between him,

[02:25:34.570 --> 02:25:36.350]
and whoever wins the Democratic fight.

[02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:38.550]
And I think people will look at that bat,

[02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:40.410]
that here's a man who has a,

[02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:42.450]
who has a, here's a man who said one thing,

[02:25:42.450 --> 02:25:44.530]
when I did something else like Wayne would say, you know.

[02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:47.170]
The president had a five-star ceremony

[02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:49.210]
with a formal welcome to the White House's North Portico,

[02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:50.970]
lunch in Bush's private dining room,

[02:25:51.010 --> 02:25:52.370]
and a formal endorsement in the Rose Garden.

[02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:53.690]
We just saw that in one of the vomit.

[02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:56.270]
Clinton's victory's last night, tonight in Alabama,

[02:25:56.310 --> 02:25:58.370]
a rare, a ripe opportunity to drive her

[02:25:58.370 --> 02:25:59.750]
from the Democratic presidential race.

[02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:00.330]
It was ripe.

[02:26:00.850 --> 02:26:01.730]
Can you smell it?

[02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.850]
I smell something.

[02:26:03.310 --> 02:26:05.130]
It's like three cheese, man, really ripe,

[02:26:05.370 --> 02:26:05.970]
and really, ooh.

[02:26:06.470 --> 02:26:08.410]
But a bomb came away with a large-yard delegates too,

[02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:09.750]
and counting that continued today,

[02:26:10.010 --> 02:26:11.830]
meaning he's got a lead that's going to be tough to overcome.

[02:26:12.290 --> 02:26:14.010]
We still have an insurmountable lead, he said.

[02:26:14.570 --> 02:26:16.010]
We're very confident about where we're going to be,

[02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:17.910]
and that we can win the nomination in the general direction.

[02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:19.350]
Clinton owned bomb.

[02:26:19.430 --> 02:26:21.090]
It's been most of the past two weeks in Ohio and Texas,

[02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:22.150]
but it beat the boot, but it went on,

[02:26:22.390 --> 02:26:23.230]
and it goes on.

[02:26:23.370 --> 02:26:24.470]
And we don't care about it all.

[02:26:25.730 --> 02:26:27.610]
Happy to have Karen Finney,

[02:26:27.610 --> 02:26:30.430]
it's folks falling for the DNC with us.

[02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:31.190]
Oh, God.

[02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:33.830]
Margot said stick with CNN, okay, at least.

[02:26:34.050 --> 02:26:35.590]
At least once in a while, you get somebody on there

[02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:37.290]
who's good for laughs like Candy Cowley,

[02:26:37.950 --> 02:26:39.250]
or Wolflet's Creek, you know?

[02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:44.690]
You're the game will watch it, though, isn't it?

[02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:45.230]
No, hardass.

[02:26:45.610 --> 02:26:46.210]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:26:46.370 --> 02:26:47.690]
Busy Washington, Tellanovela.

[02:26:47.810 --> 02:26:48.050]
Sure.

[02:26:48.350 --> 02:26:49.970]
Exactly, but no, I'm working on a Sunday.

[02:26:50.470 --> 02:26:52.190]
It's a big, big, land-American boobies.

[02:26:52.290 --> 02:26:52.630]
That's right.

[02:26:53.690 --> 02:26:54.930]
Now, where are most of those shows from?

[02:26:54.930 --> 02:26:57.750]
From like Juvenile Fueyla, or various places, but yes.

[02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:59.650]
That is way less of Mexico.

[02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.790]
Mexico.

[02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:02.730]
Mexico.

[02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.110]

[02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:04.350]
You got a few white people in Mexico.

[02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:07.430]
They keep them locked up in the movie studio.

[02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.630]
Argentina.

[02:27:11.310 --> 02:27:12.130]
Get some poignant here.

[02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:15.210]
Even some Brazilian ones, which are dubbed in Spanish.

[02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:16.230]
So, I'm really guessing.

[02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:17.030]
Because it's portugacy?

[02:27:17.310 --> 02:27:17.430]
See.

[02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:19.850]
Now, why do you think that is?

[02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:21.730]
Don't let the team rather strange to you?

[02:27:21.970 --> 02:27:22.070]
What?

[02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:24.150]
That would be like the people in Quebec speaking French.

[02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.790]
Yeah.

[02:27:26.090 --> 02:27:28.390]
That would be like the people in the county, no speaking English.

[02:27:28.690 --> 02:27:31.090]
But then again, consider where the people in the county came from, see.

[02:27:31.390 --> 02:27:32.190]
I can understand that.

[02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:34.330]
So, where did the people in Brazil come from?

[02:27:34.470 --> 02:27:34.690]
Hunger?

[02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:36.150]
A lot of them came from Italy.

[02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.510]
Did they?

[02:27:37.970 --> 02:27:38.310]
Oh, yeah.

[02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:39.070]
I didn't know that.

[02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.690]
I was in a town in Brazil.

[02:27:40.530 --> 02:27:40.870]
I didn't know that.

[02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:41.710]
I thought I'd ever been there.

[02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:42.410]
It's too damn far.

[02:27:42.690 --> 02:27:43.990]
I was going to go to São Paulo.

[02:27:44.970 --> 02:27:46.050]
But it was from Miami.

[02:27:46.270 --> 02:27:47.070]
It's nine hours.

[02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.630]
Nine hours.

[02:27:48.810 --> 02:27:50.350]
You can go to Europe for nine hours, you know?

[02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:51.510]
You want to go to São Paulo?

[02:27:53.010 --> 02:27:53.370]
No.

[02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:55.410]
How about Rio?

[02:27:55.710 --> 02:27:56.330]
Want to go to a county?

[02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.810]
No, thanks.

[02:27:57.010 --> 02:27:57.790]
I don't want to go to Rio.

[02:27:57.970 --> 02:27:59.130]
You may dress up a little bit.

[02:27:59.290 --> 02:28:00.450]
I can just see you for real.

[02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:01.290]
Oh, sure.

[02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:02.830]
That is the one in my house.

[02:28:03.250 --> 02:28:04.050]
I'll just go there.

[02:28:04.170 --> 02:28:04.850]
You're very modest.

[02:28:05.850 --> 02:28:06.030]
You're smart.

[02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:06.430]
You're smart.

[02:28:06.690 --> 02:28:07.050]
You're right.

[02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:08.510]
You can go there.

[02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.130]
You can go there.

[02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:14.970]
Now, in addition, Senator McCain, thanks for the interview.

[02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:19.810]
I can honestly say I prepared my entire life for this moment.

[02:28:19.810 --> 02:28:22.050]
Are you being sarcastic?

[02:28:22.290 --> 02:28:23.290]
The idea.

[02:28:23.730 --> 02:28:24.210]
What?

[02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:25.270]
The idea.

[02:28:25.450 --> 02:28:26.510]
I didn't say those words.

[02:28:26.850 --> 02:28:27.930]
They weren't even words.

[02:28:28.530 --> 02:28:28.990]
Say that again.

[02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:30.410]
The sounds they came out of you.

[02:28:30.670 --> 02:28:31.090]
Never mind.

[02:28:31.310 --> 02:28:33.810]
I'm blessed with such personal greatness.

[02:28:34.470 --> 02:28:38.650]
History has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need.

[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:39.490]
Okay.

[02:28:39.890 --> 02:28:40.370]
Whatever.

[02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:42.690]
How long do you want to keep the troops in Iraq?

[02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:48.410]
I don't think Americans are concerned if we're there for a hundred years or a thousand years or ten thousand years.

[02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:49.570]
And what about Iran?

[02:28:49.930 --> 02:28:52.570]
I'm very confident that we're going to...

[02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:54.270]
...murand.

[02:28:54.610 --> 02:28:54.910]
Ha ha ha.

[02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.550]
Fantastic.

[02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.350]
Okay.

[02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:58.050]
We're going to cut to commercial here.

[02:28:58.370 --> 02:29:02.190]
I will never surrender and wait for white flag to surrender.

[02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:03.690]
I will never do it.

[02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:05.250]
Dude, you're not surrendering.

[02:29:05.430 --> 02:29:06.530]
We're just going to go to commercial.

[02:29:06.850 --> 02:29:07.930]
I will never do it.

[02:29:08.070 --> 02:29:09.650]
You're totally crazy, aren't you?

[02:29:09.850 --> 02:29:11.310]
I am committed to it.

[02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:13.390]
In suffocation, we'll be right back.

[02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:17.350]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:17.890 --> 02:29:18.910]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:20.090]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:20.290 --> 02:29:21.590]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:22.530]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:22.930 --> 02:29:22.930]

[02:29:23.390 --> 02:29:24.310]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:24.550]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:25.210]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:25.730]
I'm a prince.

[02:29:25.730 --> 02:29:26.390]
So anyways, 132QM.

[02:29:27.310 --> 02:29:28.890]
I mean, you know, the idea of a crazy president.

[02:29:28.890 --> 02:29:29.850]
Why not continue, right?

[02:29:30.050 --> 02:29:31.710]
Now, how come I'm getting this week's schedule already?

[02:29:32.470 --> 02:29:34.710]
It's this week's schedule.

[02:29:35.230 --> 02:29:36.390]
So there must have been a change.

[02:29:36.930 --> 02:29:37.530]
Oh, you're...

[02:29:37.530 --> 02:29:37.910]
You know something?

[02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:39.670]
If you could hear the sound quality of your voice.

[02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:41.310]
So...

[02:29:41.310 --> 02:29:41.750]
The...

[02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:42.050]
The...

[02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:43.490]
The city rating in the like...

[02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:44.830]
What can I say?

[02:29:45.770 --> 02:29:47.330]
It's because of the webinar, right?

[02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.930]
I'm sure.

[02:29:48.110 --> 02:29:48.610]
I'm under the...

[02:29:48.610 --> 02:29:49.070]
I'm under it.

[02:29:49.350 --> 02:29:50.370]
Oh, it sounds bad.

[02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:52.230]
It sounds like, um...

[02:29:52.230 --> 02:29:53.350]
Like, you know, a pitted speaker.

[02:29:53.530 --> 02:29:55.390]
And a blown speaker sounds like...

[02:29:55.870 --> 02:29:56.610]
That's where you sound.

[02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:57.770]
Hey, hey, hey.

[02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:59.250]
And the level seems really normal.

[02:29:59.430 --> 02:30:00.850]
Maybe Chris Pyt is Chris the lair?

[02:30:01.090 --> 02:30:01.390]
I'm sorry.

[02:30:01.810 --> 02:30:02.410]
Why is that?

[02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:05.770]
Well, I figured, you know, just wait out and leave it to...

[02:30:05.770 --> 02:30:07.850]
I think we're going to need to reset or something like that.

[02:30:07.950 --> 02:30:09.310]
I mean, I can hear you, but it sounds...

[02:30:09.850 --> 02:30:10.930]
Or we need to recess.

[02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:13.690]
Yeah, let's have recess for about 20 minutes.

[02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:15.010]
I'm leaving today at 135.

[02:30:17.230 --> 02:30:18.270]
And then Joe can come in and say,

[02:30:18.290 --> 02:30:19.390]
How come Neil left today?

[02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:20.390]
You know, whoa!

[02:30:21.390 --> 02:30:24.350]
Well, what's the change on this schedule that we had to make a big cynus about?

[02:30:24.450 --> 02:30:24.690]
What's that?

[02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:27.430]
I see a board op change or something here.

[02:30:27.430 --> 02:30:29.670]
A couple of John Lindor instead of the beast or whatever.

[02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:30.270]
But what?

[02:30:30.370 --> 02:30:31.790]
So what's, uh...

[02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:32.910]
What's the deal, Slimuel?

[02:30:33.090 --> 02:30:33.590]
Don't out of care.

[02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:35.070]
The...

[02:30:36.350 --> 02:30:36.710]
The...

[02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:37.790]
Whatever happened down there, man.

[02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:40.230]
On your end, on the SNL near its span.

[02:30:41.730 --> 02:30:42.090]
You're on your...

[02:30:42.090 --> 02:30:42.970]
Now, can you reset it?

[02:30:43.390 --> 02:30:44.450]
I can go reset it, you understand?

[02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:46.390]
You know, we lose your connection when you do that.

[02:30:46.770 --> 02:30:47.290]
I beg your pardon?

[02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:48.630]
We lose you when we do that.

[02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:49.950]
When we do that.

[02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:51.950]
You go out, you can't talk.

[02:30:52.270 --> 02:30:53.510]
I have to play music or something.

[02:30:54.050 --> 02:30:54.750]
Or read the schedule.

[02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:56.670]
Oh, in other words, when you were...

[02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:57.090]
Oh, I see.

[02:30:57.430 --> 02:30:58.230]
It's a two-way thing.

[02:30:59.130 --> 02:31:02.150]
So in other words, you can't talk and fill it only taste like ten seconds.

[02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:03.570]
I was just saying.

[02:31:04.410 --> 02:31:04.750]
Yeah.

[02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.770]
We lose...

[02:31:05.770 --> 02:31:06.570]
I should shut up.

[02:31:07.850 --> 02:31:10.670]
Well, we can reset it, but we lose you while that happens.

[02:31:10.770 --> 02:31:11.810]
We're gonna have to reset it.

[02:31:11.850 --> 02:31:12.870]
I'm telling you, you found...

[02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:13.710]
Go, go, go, go, go.

[02:31:13.710 --> 02:31:15.430]
We set the road test more so than ever.

[02:31:16.650 --> 02:31:17.310]
Is he resetting it?

[02:31:17.490 --> 02:31:18.350]
He's going to reset it.

[02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.990]
Okay.

[02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:20.090]
I'll give you a second.

[02:31:20.090 --> 02:31:21.410]
We'll let you know when we're back, okay?

[02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:23.430]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:25.290]
Well, at the moment, a silent meditation,

[02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:26.370]
but he's having school.

[02:31:26.370 --> 02:31:28.590]
And he can't have a school prayer, but we have to do something

[02:31:29.530 --> 02:31:32.890]
to promote God and clergy.

[02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:35.390]
I didn't mean to know I'll come back.

[02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:37.770]
Well, I was very productive today while you came here.

[02:31:38.970 --> 02:31:40.350]
We did my my space a little bit.

[02:31:40.610 --> 02:31:41.270]
New pictures up there.

[02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.730]
For us front guests.

[02:31:45.610 --> 02:31:48.970]
Misaki and Mindy Kim from Cocoa, Martha.

[02:31:49.170 --> 02:31:49.850]
New pictures of Martha.

[02:31:50.610 --> 02:31:51.130]
Mm, Martha.

[02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:52.330]
You back here?

[02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:53.690]
You're back, but you're still sound bad.

[02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:54.370]
All right.

[02:31:54.370 --> 02:31:54.750]
What can I do?

[02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:59.130]
Well, it's everything that didn't happen earlier.

[02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:00.610]
Indeed.

[02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:03.250]
Should I reset mine again?

[02:32:04.350 --> 02:32:04.650]
If you want.

[02:32:06.570 --> 02:32:09.790]
I mean, you sound like you're under, um, what?

[02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.130]
Water?

[02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:11.570]
No, not underwater.

[02:32:11.810 --> 02:32:13.910]
Like you're under some kind of like a foam mattress or something.

[02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:15.350]
Like you're buried underneath it.

[02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:16.630]
Oh, like that.

[02:32:17.290 --> 02:32:17.910]
Maybe I am.

[02:32:18.190 --> 02:32:19.210]
Maybe you're under a muffler.

[02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:20.450]
Should I be out there?

[02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:21.330]
It feels some good time.

[02:32:22.050 --> 02:32:22.230]
Fine.

[02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.490]
Whatever.

[02:32:22.490 --> 02:32:23.690]
Go for it.

[02:32:25.070 --> 02:32:26.730]
I want to do it.

[02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:27.130]
Big trash.

[02:32:27.470 --> 02:32:29.210]
I don't think it's on this end, though, but I'll try it.

[02:32:29.770 --> 02:32:30.570]
I think it's the line.

[02:32:30.690 --> 02:32:31.910]
Do I sound queer, actually?

[02:32:32.290 --> 02:32:33.630]
You sound queer, but very clear.

[02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.870]
Yes.

[02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:36.030]
I think it's the line because of the weather.

[02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:38.090]
That's just something that's going to be happening today.

[02:32:38.430 --> 02:32:40.490]
Oh, but in case I don't want to posky with it then.

[02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.770]
All right.

[02:32:40.810 --> 02:32:41.690]
I'll lose you all together.

[02:32:41.850 --> 02:32:42.570]
I won't know if I'm on.

[02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:43.270]
That's right.

[02:32:43.330 --> 02:32:44.510]
I have to clog you again in my brain.

[02:32:44.970 --> 02:32:46.290]
And my cross-me-40 center.

[02:32:46.390 --> 02:32:46.970]
I don't know.

[02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.890]
Yeah, you don't want to do that.

[02:32:48.750 --> 02:32:50.050]
I sure as hell don't want to do that.

[02:32:50.050 --> 02:32:53.210]
I'm going to get those glasses fixed today.

[02:32:54.490 --> 02:32:56.530]
I'm going to get a new arm on my glasses.

[02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:57.450]
What do you call those?

[02:32:58.270 --> 02:32:59.250]
That's what I always call.

[02:32:59.350 --> 02:32:59.610]
A leg.

[02:33:00.270 --> 02:33:00.570]
A what?

[02:33:01.250 --> 02:33:01.650]
The legs.

[02:33:03.090 --> 02:33:03.450]
Legs?

[02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.930]
Uh-huh.

[02:33:05.210 --> 02:33:06.870]
Are you a crazy person or what?

[02:33:07.170 --> 02:33:07.430]
Uh-huh.

[02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:07.870]
You might be right.

[02:33:08.370 --> 02:33:09.250]
Glasses have legs.

[02:33:09.410 --> 02:33:10.190]
No, it's not what they're called.

[02:33:10.350 --> 02:33:11.390]
I never heard that in my life.

[02:33:12.690 --> 02:33:13.050]
Legs?

[02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:15.890]
I don't know.

[02:33:16.090 --> 02:33:16.970]
I'm taking his word for it.

[02:33:17.330 --> 02:33:17.810]
You're not.

[02:33:20.530 --> 02:33:21.770]
I'm going to check out the radar.

[02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:22.110]
Okay.

[02:33:22.490 --> 02:33:22.650]
All right.

[02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:29.710]
I mean, something's going to be.

[02:33:30.450 --> 02:33:30.550]
Why?

[02:33:31.690 --> 02:33:35.030]
I'm googling the parts of glasses for checking out the radar.

[02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:37.670]
Okay, you go ahead and I'll check out the radar.

[02:33:38.030 --> 02:33:39.010]
Here's the image from Miami.

[02:33:40.190 --> 02:33:41.750]
Market, the down 50 by the way.

[02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.450]
Oh, look at that.

[02:33:42.490 --> 02:33:42.970]
There's some rain.

[02:33:44.390 --> 02:33:45.270]
An offshore man.

[02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:46.790]
I must be the stuff that blew through before.

[02:33:47.250 --> 02:33:48.490]
Let's put the loop on here.

[02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:49.530]
Let's do the loopty loop.

[02:33:50.350 --> 02:33:51.310]
Let's loop it, baby.

[02:33:51.810 --> 02:33:54.170]
Yeah, all the heavy duty stuff ran through there.

[02:33:55.470 --> 02:33:56.190]
It's offshore.

[02:33:56.370 --> 02:33:57.650]
It's by like the Bahamas now.

[02:33:58.250 --> 02:33:58.650]
Mm-hmm.

[02:33:59.770 --> 02:34:02.270]
And the way down by the keys, man, we really weighed out.

[02:34:02.370 --> 02:34:02.970]
Well, soft days.

[02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:04.050]
Pretty heavy duty, too.

[02:34:05.730 --> 02:34:08.410]
But it's still, but most of the heavy duty stuff is gone.

[02:34:08.410 --> 02:34:10.330]
And once it's gone, it don't turn around and come back.

[02:34:10.450 --> 02:34:10.850]
It's gone.

[02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:13.270]
But it only something must have happened.

[02:34:13.350 --> 02:34:14.670]
And maybe we took a lightning strike again.

[02:34:14.770 --> 02:34:16.430]
Maybe Luke Christie will do lightning strikes.

[02:34:17.730 --> 02:34:19.030]
Maybe we took a lightning strike.

[02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:20.450]
I don't know.

[02:34:21.350 --> 02:34:23.850]
I think Chris made me crank up the level a little bit

[02:34:23.850 --> 02:34:25.430]
to compensate for the fact that you sound...

[02:34:26.510 --> 02:34:26.830]
Err.

[02:34:27.350 --> 02:34:27.790]
There you go.

[02:34:27.890 --> 02:34:29.610]
He still sound like that, but at least I can hear it now.

[02:34:30.170 --> 02:34:32.030]
Or I could crank this up and get some loopty back on.

[02:34:32.570 --> 02:34:33.070]
Or we could just...

[02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:33.090]
Oh, he just...

[02:34:33.090 --> 02:34:33.490]
He just...

[02:34:33.490 --> 02:34:33.570]
He just...

[02:34:33.570 --> 02:34:33.670]
He just...

[02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.910]
He just...

[02:34:33.910 --> 02:34:34.430]
He just...

[02:34:34.430 --> 02:34:35.830]
He just...

[02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:38.030]
He just...

[02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:42.150]
Oh, he was there, wasn't he?

[02:34:42.450 --> 02:34:44.050]
Yeah, there's something definitely screwed up in the line.

[02:34:44.170 --> 02:34:44.470]
Did you hear that?

[02:34:44.910 --> 02:34:45.910]
No, I didn't hear it.

[02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.990]
What?

[02:34:47.350 --> 02:34:47.990]
I didn't hear it.

[02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:48.530]
You didn't.

[02:34:48.570 --> 02:34:48.850]
I did.

[02:34:49.170 --> 02:34:50.270]
Because it's coming from there.

[02:34:50.570 --> 02:34:50.750]
Just.

[02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:52.270]
Boy.

[02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:55.250]
Anyway, let's get back to David Hernandez.

[02:34:57.150 --> 02:34:59.950]
You know, I really missed my chance because last night it was on

[02:34:59.950 --> 02:35:01.470]
and I was watching the Elisha Returns.

[02:35:01.470 --> 02:35:02.510]
I couldn't have been watching the American Idol.

[02:35:03.050 --> 02:35:03.830]
Like millions of other...

[02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:04.050]
Yeah.

[02:35:06.810 --> 02:35:07.170]
No.

[02:35:07.810 --> 02:35:08.070]
No.

[02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:09.530]
Oh, you're still...

[02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:10.910]
You know something I am going to tape this.

[02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:12.010]
I'm going to play it back to you.

[02:35:12.390 --> 02:35:12.650]
All right.

[02:35:13.650 --> 02:35:14.650]
So you can hear me.

[02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:15.010]
Let me say something.

[02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:16.110]
Yeah, go ahead.

[02:35:16.430 --> 02:35:16.590]
Speak.

[02:35:16.830 --> 02:35:19.650]
To be or not to be, that is the question whether it is noble in the mind to suffer

[02:35:19.650 --> 02:35:22.450]
the slings and arrows about rageous fortune or to take arms against the

[02:35:22.450 --> 02:35:22.570]
ac

[02:35:23.690 --> 02:35:24.010]
Okay.

[02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:28.870]
I will in a second.

[02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:30.050]
Oh.

[02:35:30.570 --> 02:35:31.330]
But, rewind.

[02:35:31.650 --> 02:35:31.810]
Rewind.

[02:35:31.810 --> 02:35:32.330]
Rewind, you idiot.

[02:35:34.590 --> 02:35:35.150]
Here we go.

[02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.430]
I think.

[02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:35.850]
Speak.

[02:35:36.310 --> 02:35:37.330]
To be or not to be that.

[02:35:37.330 --> 02:35:37.850]
Oh, wow.

[02:35:37.930 --> 02:35:38.450]
That's brutal.

[02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:41.910]
Mind to suffer the slings and arrows about rageous fortune or to take arms against the

[02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:42.250]
acouple.

[02:35:42.410 --> 02:35:43.830]
See, that's what I'm hearing on this end.

[02:35:43.950 --> 02:35:45.110]
And you're like, oh, how come he's good?

[02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:46.150]
Because that's what I'm hearing.

[02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:48.210]
It doesn't sound like that over here.

[02:35:49.970 --> 02:35:50.950]
What do you mean by that?

[02:35:51.050 --> 02:35:52.370]
In other words, it's not on the ear like that?

[02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:52.750]
Correct.

[02:35:53.550 --> 02:35:54.890]
It's just the return going back to you.

[02:35:55.090 --> 02:35:56.670]
Well, the return is a F-duck man.

[02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:58.130]
The return is really bad.

[02:35:59.690 --> 02:36:00.650]
But again, we're almost done.

[02:36:00.690 --> 02:36:01.830]
We only have twenty-two minutes to go.

[02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:06.210]
Assuming that the group there can get the next show on the corner of the jerk.

[02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:07.410]
It's a great attempt.

[02:36:12.190 --> 02:36:17.170]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:17.310 --> 02:36:18.450]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530]

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530]

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530]

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530]

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530]

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530]

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.530]

[02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.810]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:18.810 --> 02:36:18.970]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:18.970 --> 02:36:19.870]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:22.310]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:22.310 --> 02:36:22.310]

[02:36:22.310 --> 02:36:22.310]

[02:36:22.310 --> 02:36:23.050]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:23.050 --> 02:36:24.450]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:24.450 --> 02:36:25.510]
Who's the candidate?

[02:36:26.010 --> 02:36:28.310]
The African-American think is great.

[02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:31.810]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:32.930 --> 02:36:35.250]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:35.310 --> 02:36:36.190]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:53.410]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:53.410]

[02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:53.410]

[02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:53.410]

[02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:53.410]

[02:36:53.430 --> 02:36:53.430]

[02:36:53.430 --> 02:36:53.430]

[02:36:53.430 --> 02:36:53.430]

[02:36:53.430 --> 02:36:53.430]

[02:36:54.770 --> 02:36:55.490]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:55.490 --> 02:36:55.490]

[02:36:56.450 --> 02:36:56.670]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:56.670 --> 02:36:56.710]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:58.410]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:36:58.970 --> 02:37:01.710]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:01.710 --> 02:37:02.470]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:02.470 --> 02:37:03.430]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:03.430 --> 02:37:03.750]

I'm not going to say anything.

I'm not going to say anything.

I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.690]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:11.690 --> 02:37:11.690]

[02:37:11.690 --> 02:37:12.450]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:13.370]

I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:28.030 --> 02:37:30.090]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:31.450 --> 02:37:34.890]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:35.730]
I'm not going to say anything.

I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.550]

[02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.550]

[02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.550]

[02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.550]

[02:37:44.430 --> 02:37:44.930]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:44.930 --> 02:37:44.970]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:44.970 --> 02:37:45.470]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:46.050 --> 02:37:47.030]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.670]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:49.350]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:49.350 --> 02:37:49.410]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:49.410 --> 02:37:50.170]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:50.170 --> 02:37:51.890]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:51.890 --> 02:37:52.770]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:53.890 --> 02:37:55.390]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:59.810]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:02.710]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:05.070]
I'm not going to say anything.

I'm not going to say anything.

[02:38:05.490 --> 02:38:05.710]
I'm not going to say anything.

[02:38:06.850 --> 02:38:08.130]
Oh my God.

[02:38:08.450 --> 02:38:08.830]
You're free.

[02:38:09.550 --> 02:38:11.030]
He had the look in fact that people

[02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:12.330]
actually made pretty good money here.

[02:38:12.410 --> 02:38:12.950]
Brian said.

[02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:15.090]
A spokesperson for the show

[02:38:15.090 --> 02:38:17.110]
to climb MTV News' request for comment

[02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.590]
on the report.

[02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:18.430]
But first and

[02:38:18.430 --> 02:38:19.670]
close to the show, he's not authorized

[02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:20.470]
to comment publicly.

[02:38:20.850 --> 02:38:21.830]
And that's not to be identified

[02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:23.230]
to all APO yesterday.

[02:38:23.670 --> 02:38:25.050]
That the show's got no pants to remove.

[02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:26.370]
Hey, Hernandez from the competition.

[02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:29.250]
Brian can be reached for further comment

[02:38:29.250 --> 02:38:30.490]
at press time, but he told the AP

[02:38:30.490 --> 02:38:33.110]
that Hernandez worked at Dixt steadily for three years

[02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:34.690]
until September 30th.

[02:38:34.690 --> 02:38:36.630]
Well, after he auditioned for I don't send

[02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:37.950]
he went to live 30th.

[02:38:38.010 --> 02:38:39.690]
Brian said that Hernandez did not renew his licensing

[02:38:39.690 --> 02:38:41.470]
with the state, which is why he hasn't performed

[02:38:41.470 --> 02:38:43.150]
at Dixt since that date.

[02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:46.010]
You have to have a license to be a stripper.

[02:38:47.210 --> 02:38:47.650]
Yes, can I?

[02:38:48.210 --> 02:38:50.470]
For you sound, if you could, what do you hear it?

[02:38:51.050 --> 02:38:51.070]
Sorry.

[02:38:51.070 --> 02:38:51.230]
I did.

[02:38:51.330 --> 02:38:52.750]
The end of the thing is the last segment, man.

[02:38:52.850 --> 02:38:54.130]
It's something important to say too,

[02:38:54.130 --> 02:38:55.230]
as soon as you're done with that hazard,

[02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:56.310]
I'll have that gay guy.

[02:38:56.650 --> 02:38:56.930]
Go ahead.

[02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:59.510]
The part of the frame that extend over and or

[02:38:59.510 --> 02:39:00.990]
behind the ears to help hold the frame

[02:39:00.990 --> 02:39:03.290]
in place or called these herpals.

[02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:04.670]
The temples?

[02:39:05.010 --> 02:39:07.230]
There are skull temples for most popular kind.

[02:39:07.470 --> 02:39:09.810]
Comfort cable temples, riding bow temples,

[02:39:10.090 --> 02:39:13.090]
spring hinged temples, and the library

[02:39:13.090 --> 02:39:14.830]
or paddle temples, which are not for you

[02:39:14.830 --> 02:39:16.190]
because those are the straight ones.

[02:39:16.770 --> 02:39:17.230]
Straight temples?

[02:39:17.550 --> 02:39:17.650]
Yes.

[02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:19.910]
I'm ready to go to the temple myself.

[02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:23.670]
The alcohol-free club Dixt was named the best game

[02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:25.890]
made review in 2004 by the Finnish Newtoms,

[02:39:26.270 --> 02:39:27.610]
which said the cabaret's dancers fit a

[02:39:27.610 --> 02:39:30.150]
flurry of fantasy rules, performing as sailors,

[02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:32.670]
construction workers, cowboys and whatever else

[02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:34.230]
are the best vehicles they're fancy.

[02:39:34.490 --> 02:39:35.410]
It says here.

[02:39:36.250 --> 02:39:38.170]
Tickles they're all for a fancy what?

[02:39:38.310 --> 02:39:39.210]
Hey, sailor.

[02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.790]
Yeah.

[02:39:39.950 --> 02:39:40.970]
Oh, you beat me to it.

[02:39:41.430 --> 02:39:42.410]
Hey, sailor.

[02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:43.590]
I must have played already, you know,

[02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:44.530]
maybe effort to get there.

[02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:45.770]
Your powers are equal, man.

[02:39:46.210 --> 02:39:49.550]
For you sound really bad.

[02:39:51.150 --> 02:39:52.010]
I think it should lead.

[02:39:52.430 --> 02:39:52.790]
Why?

[02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:54.110]
I think I should lead.

[02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:55.670]
I'm out of my try to re-re-

[02:39:56.090 --> 02:39:56.750]
Stop, no.

[02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:57.970]
Don't try to re-jigger it.

[02:39:58.370 --> 02:39:59.110]
Come on, Ed.

[02:39:59.370 --> 02:40:00.330]
It'll waste time.

[02:40:00.430 --> 02:40:01.210]
I want to re-jigger it.

[02:40:02.050 --> 02:40:02.770]
Go figure.

[02:40:03.890 --> 02:40:04.990]
Go Hernandez has never discussed

[02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:06.830]
this stripping past on the show.

[02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:08.810]
Rumors of his past were posted on the vote

[02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:10.170]
for the worst.com last week,

[02:40:10.370 --> 02:40:12.310]
including images of a barely clothed,

[02:40:12.390 --> 02:40:14.670]
or, I think, pronounced as working as a bartender

[02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:15.730]
at the gay club, burn.

[02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:17.350]
Burn, baby.

[02:40:17.610 --> 02:40:17.750]
Burn.

[02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:21.030]
It was like moss to a flame vote for the worst

[02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:23.390]
founder Dave Della Terza told AP of the rumor.

[02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:25.070]
As soon as I posted that, we started getting

[02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:26.790]
10, 20 letters every single day from saying,

[02:40:27.270 --> 02:40:28.930]
uh, yeah, he's a stripper in Phoenix.

[02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:31.730]
Grind told the AP that the idol

[02:40:31.730 --> 02:40:33.170]
contested never sang at Dix,

[02:40:33.530 --> 02:40:34.970]
and then he now believes Hernandez stopped working

[02:40:34.970 --> 02:40:36.530]
at the club because of his idol connection.

[02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:39.070]
After getting high marks on the judges'

[02:40:39.270 --> 02:40:41.030]
last two difers, rendition of the temptations,

[02:40:41.410 --> 02:40:42.630]
Papa was a rolling stone.

[02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:45.350]
Hernandez was, was slighted a performance-

[02:40:45.350 --> 02:40:46.870]
last night for a shot making to the top club.

[02:40:47.130 --> 02:40:48.130]
I don't really get in or not.

[02:40:48.430 --> 02:40:49.270]
Oh my God.

[02:40:53.290 --> 02:40:54.110]
Did he get in?

[02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:55.490]
Who else could press?

[02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:56.070]
Hey, hey, hey.

[02:40:56.430 --> 02:40:58.010]
I'm just, I'm asking how loud.

[02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.950]
That's a loud, loud.

[02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.330]
Really?

[02:40:59.630 --> 02:41:01.210]
Well, I'll ask somebody to watch that show.

[02:41:01.470 --> 02:41:02.430]
Yeah, that's not a loud.

[02:41:02.850 --> 02:41:03.370]
How loud.

[02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:05.290]
Maybe, uh, Bill, what's his name?

[02:41:05.410 --> 02:41:05.830]
What's his name?

[02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.650]
That's the, uh, loud.

[02:41:07.930 --> 02:41:08.290]
Tech?

[02:41:08.810 --> 02:41:09.350]
Bill, no.

[02:41:09.570 --> 02:41:10.250]
Was that his name, Bill Tech?

[02:41:10.470 --> 02:41:10.590]
Yes.

[02:41:11.730 --> 02:41:12.350]
Bill Drek?

[02:41:12.570 --> 02:41:12.810]
Yes.

[02:41:13.270 --> 02:41:14.610]
Or does his live drek walk in a minute?

[02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:15.630]
I know that we got Todd Drek.

[02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:16.530]
Is he still working there?

[02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:17.550]
Yes.

[02:41:17.890 --> 02:41:19.330]
He hasn't been anywhere near the show,

[02:41:19.490 --> 02:41:21.630]
and, uh, oh my God, since before Jesus

[02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:23.190]
was a little infant, and you know something?

[02:41:23.370 --> 02:41:23.810]
That's a good thing.

[02:41:23.810 --> 02:41:24.630]
That's a good thing, too.

[02:41:25.570 --> 02:41:26.430]
Let's keep it that way.

[02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:29.670]
And you want to know why, because you don't have a screw

[02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:32.310]
anoron anymore to come in holding his, uh, holding her

[02:41:32.310 --> 02:41:32.850]
coat tails.

[02:41:33.150 --> 02:41:35.290]
Oh, gee, would you please do this spot for Todd?

[02:41:35.470 --> 02:41:37.310]
You know, it's a piece of crap, but would you please do it?

[02:41:38.250 --> 02:41:38.910]
Remember those days?

[02:41:39.330 --> 02:41:39.890]
I've sure do.

[02:41:40.130 --> 02:41:42.090]
I always had to come in powering behind her,

[02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:43.550]
because she was scared to death of me.

[02:41:43.650 --> 02:41:45.710]
And I'm, uh, what kind of a jerk is scared of me, okay?

[02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:47.010]
A lot of people are.

[02:41:47.770 --> 02:41:48.250]
Why is that?

[02:41:48.990 --> 02:41:50.410]
I would run the acid about me,

[02:41:50.430 --> 02:41:52.570]
I'd never saw such a soft person in this whole life.

[02:41:53.250 --> 02:41:53.510]
Right?

[02:41:53.690 --> 02:41:54.750]
Such an old mama-la?

[02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:56.510]
No, I'm standing there.

[02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:57.230]
I'm breaking up.

[02:41:57.250 --> 02:41:58.450]
That's because my, you know,

[02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:59.070]
don't cry.

[02:41:59.730 --> 02:42:00.850]
My post-nasal drip.

[02:42:02.450 --> 02:42:04.510]
Dennis Quessettich may not be a presidential contender,

[02:42:04.650 --> 02:42:06.430]
but he's still under among his Cleveland constituents,

[02:42:06.690 --> 02:42:07.090]
little Dennis.

[02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:10.770]
The liberal Ohio politician got 50% of the vote

[02:42:10.770 --> 02:42:12.850]
in a five-way Democratic congressional primary yesterday,

[02:42:13.330 --> 02:42:14.590]
beating back critics who said he ignored

[02:42:14.590 --> 02:42:16.830]
business at home to travel to country in his silly

[02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:17.690]
quest to be president.

[02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:21.690]
The six-term incumbent, 61-old face former state representative,

[02:42:21.810 --> 02:42:24.790]
Jim Trackis, who won 80% of Republican votes cast in the

[02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:26.090]
state, Northeast Ohio District.

[02:42:26.410 --> 02:42:28.890]
He joins a parade of incumbents returning challengers and

[02:42:28.890 --> 02:42:31.030]
state lawmakers who went in November's election thought

[02:42:31.030 --> 02:42:31.870]
we answered his victories.

[02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:33.930]
Around Paul, one in Texas again, by the way.

[02:42:34.450 --> 02:42:35.830]
And I know you're afraid of Ron Paul.

[02:42:35.970 --> 02:42:36.370]
Are you scared of him?

[02:42:36.370 --> 02:42:37.430]
Oh, yeah, very, very.

[02:42:37.490 --> 02:42:37.790]
Me too.

[02:42:38.050 --> 02:42:38.570]
Fear of afraid.

[02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:40.670]
Yeah, he scares the hell out of me.

[02:42:41.410 --> 02:42:42.890]
Not as much as my cufflaborary though,

[02:42:42.990 --> 02:42:45.530]
because he's a, he's crazed you then McCain.

[02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.890]
If that's possible.

[02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:50.470]
Well, tomorrow's going to be plus two, maybe 36.

[02:42:50.770 --> 02:42:52.110]
Maybe some of this crap is going to melt.

[02:42:52.350 --> 02:42:53.190]
Oh my god.

[02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:55.250]
I'd go for a good patty melt right now.

[02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:57.170]
I think that's what I'm going to have for a lunch today.

[02:42:57.250 --> 02:42:57.710]
That's so good.

[02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:59.130]
Have a patty cake for dessert.

[02:42:59.550 --> 02:43:00.950]
No, no patty cake, patty melt.

[02:43:02.290 --> 02:43:03.350]
And did I mention on the air,

[02:43:03.370 --> 02:43:04.310]
or did I just say off the air?

[02:43:04.350 --> 02:43:06.430]
Red lobster was off the air.

[02:43:07.450 --> 02:43:08.530]
Oh, I didn't say it on the air,

[02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:09.130]
that I wanted to be.

[02:43:09.130 --> 02:43:10.150]
You've been there several times,

[02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.970]
it was always very good,

[02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:12.570]
but that's because that were the same thing every time.

[02:43:13.470 --> 02:43:15.170]
But I had some crab cakes the other day,

[02:43:15.170 --> 02:43:16.790]
and Paco had the lobster.

[02:43:17.050 --> 02:43:19.030]
I mean, it was nasty.

[02:43:19.770 --> 02:43:21.030]
The time child was great.

[02:43:21.170 --> 02:43:21.810]
It's a guy for it.

[02:43:21.810 --> 02:43:23.490]
I was good as a window of the oyster house, but then again,

[02:43:23.810 --> 02:43:25.250]
I guess they're not going to reopen for me, huh?

[02:43:26.670 --> 02:43:27.030]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:27.210 --> 02:43:28.670]
Princess spaghetti house in Boston,

[02:43:28.770 --> 02:43:29.990]
I wish they would reopen for me.

[02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:31.130]
Man, oh man.

[02:43:31.650 --> 02:43:33.870]
You talk of a place with great food Boston.

[02:43:34.010 --> 02:43:34.630]
You've ever been there? No.

[02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:35.010]
No.

[02:43:35.390 --> 02:43:36.010]
Chris has been there.

[02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:36.950]
No.

[02:43:37.310 --> 02:43:37.550]
Oh, no.

[02:43:37.710 --> 02:43:37.710]

[02:43:37.730 --> 02:43:38.050]
Nothing, yes.

[02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:39.010]
Not to the place.

[02:43:39.630 --> 02:43:41.010]
And maybe that's where you parked up.

[02:43:41.070 --> 02:43:41.810]
That's what I got fat.

[02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:45.550]
Early 60s, baby, after I got kicked out of college

[02:43:45.550 --> 02:43:46.550]
for not attending class,

[02:43:46.610 --> 02:43:48.030]
because I was busy sleeping after

[02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:49.350]
a drink and then I'm right to borrow all night.

[02:43:49.350 --> 02:43:51.910]
And I went off to Boston

[02:43:53.210 --> 02:43:54.290]
and parked up, man.

[02:43:54.890 --> 02:43:57.470]
I went from about $155 to $212,

[02:43:57.610 --> 02:43:58.330]
a year and a half.

[02:43:59.610 --> 02:44:00.550]
And do I regret it?

[02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.830]
No.

[02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:02.090]
It was damn good.

[02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:03.810]
Every bit of it, the Brigham's ice cream in the

[02:44:03.810 --> 02:44:05.510]
Princess spaghetti house and the Joannemos

[02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:07.390]
and the great grinders, sub sandwiches.

[02:44:07.750 --> 02:44:07.970]
Mmm.

[02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:10.270]
What's out of business restaurant?

[02:44:10.510 --> 02:44:10.930]
You missed the most.

[02:44:11.050 --> 02:44:11.830]
That's our poll.

[02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:13.110]
Today, our second poll of the day.

[02:44:15.130 --> 02:44:15.490]
425.

[02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:17.030]
Now, so I guess we got over a thousand

[02:44:17.030 --> 02:44:18.330]
as we started with about a thousand.

[02:44:18.330 --> 02:44:19.110]
And we got the other poll.

[02:44:19.450 --> 02:44:19.730]
Right.

[02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:21.690]
And we got 98.

[02:44:22.410 --> 02:44:23.150]
So we got 1100.

[02:44:23.310 --> 02:44:24.550]
So we got over 1,500 total.

[02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:25.090]
That's pretty good.

[02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:26.330]
That is smoking, baby.

[02:44:26.570 --> 02:44:27.730]
That's more votes on the poll than

[02:44:27.730 --> 02:44:29.090]
food he got in seven months.

[02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.730]
In seven years.

[02:44:31.470 --> 02:44:33.430]
Well, I can't wait to Friday to see how good he's doing.

[02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:35.210]
Of course, we don't get the houries and the trends.

[02:44:35.390 --> 02:44:38.750]
But nevertheless, he's doing squat.

[02:44:41.930 --> 02:44:43.630]
The country out there imagines your mind, then.

[02:44:44.090 --> 02:44:44.770]
I'm trying to let it.

[02:44:45.030 --> 02:44:46.030]
What's out of business restaurant?

[02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:46.670]
You missed the most.

[02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:47.710]
The most long is 56.

[02:44:48.130 --> 02:44:49.350]
The Sizzler 39.

[02:44:50.090 --> 02:44:52.890]
Wolfies 38, where the waitress is used to tear off their apron.

[02:44:53.210 --> 02:44:53.830]
I'm out of here.

[02:44:53.950 --> 02:44:54.870]
This is a crazy place.

[02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:55.750]
I'm out of here.

[02:44:56.390 --> 02:44:59.170]
I would take the silverware and heave it, looking against the wall and run out.

[02:45:00.730 --> 02:45:01.450]
Wolfies 38.

[02:45:01.570 --> 02:45:02.570]
Taco B with 33.

[02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:04.390]
Beef Fake Charlie's 24.

[02:45:05.130 --> 02:45:06.390]
The England Oyster has 24.

[02:45:07.350 --> 02:45:08.090]
Korky's 20.

[02:45:08.450 --> 02:45:09.150]
Wags 19.

[02:45:09.650 --> 02:45:10.870]
The black anus has got 18.

[02:45:12.090 --> 02:45:13.050]
Branch House 17.

[02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:14.830]
Poverty 16.

[02:45:15.390 --> 02:45:16.310]
A Wraff 15.

[02:45:16.510 --> 02:45:17.390]
Burton Jacks 14.

[02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:18.530]
Monero's 11.

[02:45:19.690 --> 02:45:21.010]
Mr. Coney Island 8.

[02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:24.670]
And if you're right there and you're still alive, either.

[02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:28.030]
They had good winners, but boy, a schmootsie place, man.

[02:45:28.770 --> 02:45:29.250]
Schmootsie.

[02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.870]
Sambo's 8.

[02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.730]

[02:45:35.810 --> 02:45:36.890]
Finally, the start and make move.

[02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:41.190]
Vito's pizza, four-year steakhouse, four needles on Alton Road 4.

[02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:42.930]
It's had four votes ever since we started.

[02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:45.810]
You have to be really ancient to remember needles.

[02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:47.270]
Rudy's 3.

[02:45:47.430 --> 02:45:48.250]
The ones in the tree.

[02:45:48.450 --> 02:45:49.530]
But we've got a lot of money, don't we?

[02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:52.470]
Villabelli 3.

[02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:53.650]

Size Rivergate 3.

[02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:55.730]
Piccolo's 3.

[02:45:56.130 --> 02:45:57.790]
Joe Sockin's Gold Coast is that up here.

[02:45:58.130 --> 02:45:59.890]
And the crystal does that's a legendary place.

[02:46:01.410 --> 02:46:03.230]
Thanks for, by the way, Standle 2 o'clockers.

[02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:03.990]
That was really whitey.

[02:46:04.350 --> 02:46:04.950]
Hey, welcome.

[02:46:05.370 --> 02:46:06.190]
Good luck with your thing.

[02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:07.270]
The Sizzlin' 2.

[02:46:07.370 --> 02:46:08.410]
The clock 2.

[02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:09.090]
Mary's 2.

[02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:10.150]
Hungry and Charter 2.

[02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:12.990]
One for Luther's barbecue, figuros, the turf pub,

[02:46:13.450 --> 02:46:15.090]
Gigi's and Prince Hamlet, and none.

[02:46:15.570 --> 02:46:19.570]
Zipety Duda for Tyler's, the painted horse, and sporting grooves.

[02:46:21.130 --> 02:46:22.790]
Almost brings a tear to my eye.

[02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:25.410]
So when's the Wayne reopening the Royal Castle?

[02:46:26.290 --> 02:46:27.250]
The biggest name.

[02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.970]
The best.

[02:46:28.090 --> 02:46:29.550]
The final plan is no-one.

[02:46:29.970 --> 02:46:30.590]
The show's the best.

[02:46:30.750 --> 02:46:31.350]
I'm going to get my bally.

[02:46:31.530 --> 02:46:33.890]
You am the sports leader.

[02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:38.770]
It's very high on Miami Towns.

[02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:42.930]
And white six o'clock WQA.

[02:46:50.890 --> 02:46:53.730]
Now the good boys pack their gold.

[02:46:55.630 --> 02:46:58.750]
If you can Tyler's a daughter of the pack two gold.

[02:47:01.290 --> 02:47:04.150]
He's a funny guy, but it goes in blue.

[02:47:05.970 --> 02:47:09.010]
Oh, when you make them a bag, hit the driver's seat.

[02:47:10.950 --> 02:47:12.130]
Will it be a job?

[02:47:14.110 --> 02:47:14.790]
A job?

[02:47:16.350 --> 02:47:17.310]
A job?

[02:47:18.250 --> 02:47:20.030]
That's an easy way.

[02:47:24.430 --> 02:47:26.450]
Take your clothes off, Gigi.

[02:47:29.050 --> 02:47:31.950]
I'm going to hold you in town, but I can't do much things.

[02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:38.050]
Take it up a big pool with all this fun.

[02:47:39.690 --> 02:47:42.330]
You only buy the straight will get you a little better at that.

[02:47:44.370 --> 02:47:45.550]
Hey, hey.

[02:47:46.930 --> 02:47:47.690]
Hey, hey.

[02:47:51.290 --> 02:47:52.430]
Let's take it down.

[02:47:57.470 --> 02:47:58.130]
The best.

[02:47:58.370 --> 02:47:59.990]
The handle will be fat guy.

[02:48:02.350 --> 02:48:05.450]
She know how to make the ball inside.

[02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:10.310]
That can take you to the shower now.

[02:48:12.270 --> 02:48:15.550]
We need to stick like on the towel.

[02:48:17.430 --> 02:48:18.030]
Oh, wow.

[02:48:19.810 --> 02:48:21.050]
Oh, wow.

[02:48:22.390 --> 02:48:23.630]
Hey, oh, wow.

[02:48:24.430 --> 02:48:25.930]
That's an easy way.

[02:48:28.450 --> 02:48:29.890]
Hey, hey.

[02:48:30.210 --> 02:48:31.930]
Hey, hey.

[02:48:35.370 --> 02:48:36.090]
Hey.

[02:48:36.090 --> 02:48:36.770]
Hey, hey, hey.

[02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:39.430]
The biggest names of the best colors.

[02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:51.790]
I am a tortulante.

[02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.070]

[02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.070]
