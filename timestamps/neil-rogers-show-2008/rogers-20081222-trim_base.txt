[00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.800]
The music's pressed on the top.

[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.340]

Even the button came to life in the North. Can't they?

[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.640]
It's that great.

Yep, what's up? Tell me.

But only one will make it as a mall Santa Claus.

[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.460]
All right!

[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.740]
But we're still here at Georgia's on vacation this week, he got a good deal.

[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.220]
So it's just Tubby and me, aren't you lucky that we got these two weeks of vacations?

[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.260]
Aren't we all lucky that we still have Tubby with us? But of course after the first of the year, well, off to the low bye-bye.

[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.040]
You never know, they might have a change of heart. If they had a heart, oh guess who died?

[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:51.920]
Who? Former Major League pitcher, dies at the age of 63, Pittsburgh pirates pitched an oh-hitter for the pirates under the influence of acid, LSD.

[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.240]
Doc Ellis, oh I've heard him. What? I thought I've heard of him. You've heard of him. Yeah. Never saw him play, but you know.

[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.240]
He later after pitching the oh-hitter under the influence of acid later fiercely spoke out against drug and alcohol eviction.

[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.840]
He died Friday, he was 63. He died at the USC Medical Center in Los Angeles, his wife, HJORDIS, Hurtis.

[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.620]
Is that how you say that? Sounds good to me. How else would you say? I have no idea.

[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.820]
Oh, that's a strange. It's a tremendous loss to the family. She said he's been struggling for about a year with the end stages of liver disease, liver disease.

[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.960]
Sounds like booze to me and drugs. Oh, poor Doc. Those are the days, man. Doc Ellis.

[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:49.000]
1968 to 79. He went 139, with a 3.46 year race. But most of his career were the pirates. He went 19 in the eye and 71 were the Pirates won the series.

[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:59.560]
Well, I was such a big, big Pirates fan those days because I used to listen to all the games on KDKA with Bob Prince and Ellie King and Jim Woods.

[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.140]
In 1970, Ellis overcame eight walks to pitching oh-hitter in the first game of a double-header against San Diego.

[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.680]
Seven years after he retired, the right-hander said he was high on LSD during the victory. So while you pictures out there having a tough go,

[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.340]
and drop a little acid, a little sugar cube in the in the throat. At a time when drugs raised, other issues in American society were colliding with baseball.

[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.600]
Ellis was off at the forefront. He spoke his mind and stood by what he said while playing with likes of Willie Starrgill, Dave Parker, more drugs and Roberto Clemente.

[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.240]
He didn't take nothing from nobody right. Said he was very much ahead of his time. Who's right? Right. Whoever that is.

[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:45.660]
No, he's a former agent, Tom Reich. He played on four Pirates teams that won the NL East, also pitched for the Yankees, Oakland, Texas and the Mets.

[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.620]
The Yankees hired Ellis in 1986 to offer guidance to their minor leagueers on drugs and alcohol abuse. Well, his liver.

[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.440]
His liver gave out. It was only 63, just a young, young man. And now he's dead.

[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.580]
We got a little something for the holidays and thanks to whoever sent me the link to it. I usually don't do links as you know.

[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.240]
But this one, it's called what? This one is definitely worth it. This one was definitely worth the price of emission.

[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:22.600]
Sock and awe. It's called you'll find it on our website on theorages.com. Right beneath the cartoons and right above Brady Quinn taking the shower.

[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:30.240]
It's called sock and awe. And it gives you the opportunity to throw have a whole bunch of chances to throw a shoe at the evading George Bush.

[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.880]
It's beautiful. It's a wonderful thing. Sock and awe. Click on it and have a good time with it.

[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.360]
Now this week, you think, I mean, does anybody really think there's going to be like a regular show this week?

[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:48.940]
Not that we have regular shows anymore, but even more irregular. No. It was kind of moving in that direction more and more toward the end of last week.

[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:57.520]
And then of course, Friday, it really, it really blew. For example, on our emails, thanks to Charlie B in a couple of other people for some polls, by the way, but that's all we got.

[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.700]
I think I got one or two here in my very small pile. And after that, that's it.

[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.260]
Because they're busy, man. They got the holidays. They're busy. Everybody's busy.

[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.420]
Son of China. Oh, man. Oh, did we have snow here on Friday? We had a big snow storm. There's about a foot of snow on the ground.

[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:23.340]
Yeah, cold here. This weekend. You had what? It was kind of cold here too. I think it was going to say, oh, and the windshield like Friday night was minus 25 Celsius. Wow. Yeah.

[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.920]
It's been freezing and we have another snow storm coming tomorrow night. I think, but you don't care about that. Cast your novel. We'll tell you all about Toronto weather.

[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:40.780]
People so is the original. What? Oh, it's serious. I got open at 12 cents this morning. Let me go. What? Let me go buy some. Yeah.

[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.500]
So I'm looking at the schedule for this week. And it's a good thing that you know your crap.

[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.640]
Because I see on Thursday, which is Christmas day. And of course, none of us are working on Christmas day.

[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.620]
From 10 to 2. We got Jesse Agler and Spectre. What's his name? Bush Inspector.

[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:09.140]
Brian Spectre. Brian Spectre. And then from 2 to 415 before the Celtics Lakers backsyball game. We got Mike Levine. Well, I thought it was Mike Levine.

[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.700]
See, that's just like Goldstein and Goldstein. I must have person tells you how they pronounce it. You really just by the spelling.

[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.080]
You don't know how to pronounce it could be Levine, but it could be Levine. So I said to Tubby before the show. I said, who the hell is Mike Levine?

[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:31.760]
Because back in 1977 when I was a K. A. T. early days in South Florida radio. Mike Levine didn't have to know the show. He followed me.

[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:44.060]
He was a Katie Hay and Pittsburgh. He was the forerunner to that one. He was like Mo only with with real hair. You've been throught by them for a while. Huh? What? Oh, yeah. They follow me.

[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:59.540]
And ego the size of Mount Rushmore. I mean, just a humongous and a very pedantic way of speaking. It's the Mike Levine show. He was a very bizarre guy. Strange. Strange. And now he's dead. I googled it. So anyway, it's Mike Levine.

[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:10.260]
Who's one of our upcoming budding sportscasters. So Tubby tells me. Yep. Very good guy. Very good on the air. Well, good. We actually have somebody who belongs on the air. Let's hear it. Mike Levine. Welcome to QA. Mike.

[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.980]
Although if you're like a real broadcast, you probably won't stick around too long.

[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:22.460]
So he's going to be on Thursday from two to four 15. I might actually come in here and listen to you. Think no. You should. I'll tell you I'm going to be doing another joy.

[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:39.500]
I'm going to be doing a repeat performance here momentarily. Well, I just leaned into, you know, the little experiment. Luckily, nothing.

[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:52.280]
Sock and awe on our website. Take a look at it and throw as many shoes as you wanted. I'll present a. Here's the poll from. Oh, look at that. We did a thousand five votes over the holiday weekend. How do you like that? That's not too shabby. You know what?

[00:08:52.460 --> 00:09:03.300]
All right. Oh, yeah, but we're doing 45,000 here on the Jorge Siddano show you. Just keep making up stupid numbers. Okay. Why not say 20 million. What would you miss or what do you miss the most?

[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.760]
Full service gas stations on a pat myself on the back. That was my choice. I added to the poll. Right? Yes. Yep.

[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:16.560]
Had you put it on there right to the start of the show and it was hands down your pants. 198. Full service gas stations.

[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:27.000]
New Jersey still has us. What? New Jersey still has us. I want to go to Jersey. They can take their service and their gas and stick it. Not a horrible place.

[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:37.460]

[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:19.720]
Mike Levine. The Dow's down 41. Do I dare take a look before we get into this pool. By the way, don't expect here too much from me or tubby all week long.

[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:28.080]
I'm digging out just like that first bit. I don't think anybody ever heard that one before the Santa Claus bootcamp. I hadn't. I hadn't either. I don't think I ever played that.

[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:37.360]

[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.160]
haven't had one real email from one real listener so far. I have Jimmy Cifilist, though.

[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.020]
The fake Jimmy Cifilist is we're still rejoicing in the great trends that came out on Friday

[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.440]
and another Miami-Dolphin's victory. We won eight out of nine and are soon to be

[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.440]
ASEE's champions. Yeah, sure. Is your tail still between your legs? No. Patriots

[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.680]
won 47 to seven yesterday. They thrashed a demolished Arizona. Are you gonna play

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.760]
the wreck again today? Yes. Jimmy, who's listening religiously lucky does like she does

[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:33.020]
every day. You fairy. You fairy. That AQYM. Hello. Yes, Neil. Yes. When are you gonna start talking about cruising in the 80s and in the 70s?

[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.680]
Why not? Because you're an idiot. You're an idiot. Turn off.

[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:45.460]
WDQYM. Hello. I think you, sir, and Mary Christmas. Oh, no, not you. You want to buy

[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:52.400]
a more of you? Mario from Hialeah Lunatic. I think you. Yeah. I think you, sir.

[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.660]
Hey, sir. Yeah, sir. Remember him, Mario, crazy person. Unfortunately, death threat.

[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.660]
Crazy. But he's still listening. See, one thing about those trends that came out on Friday

[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:11.380]
approves conclusively that Jolly Jo Bell is gonna finish the job before they finally boot his fat ass

[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.960]
out of here. He'll give us all down to a point. Nice, even the number. You know, we get those bigger

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.460]
numbers they're hard to work with. But he gets those real, tiny numbers. It's easy to figure out

[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:29.220]
because divided by anything, it still comes out zero. Antiboy, Jolly Jo, you're doing it. I

[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.860]
think we get no diaries on this station. We just, you know what I'm saying? And of course,

[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.080]
across the street, they're making a big stimulus out of the fact they got two one nine's,

[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:42.400]
you know, I mean, nobody is doing a number. Nobody doing sports is doing a number. I wonder

[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.900]
why that is. You think maybe because the format is finito, you think that possibly could

[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:55.940]
be it? No, it's got to be something else. Oh, Q. I. M. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil,

[00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.880]
just wanted to say happy Hanukkah. George, Mary Christmas. George isn't here. Oh, George

[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.920]
is not there. Well, George is on vacation this week. Oh, he's on vacation. He's a splatter

[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.440]
this week. Very good. That's all I wanted to say. Just have a good holiday. Enjoy yourself. Keep

[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.460]
warm. Well, back to you. Okay. Keep warm. Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. What's the temperature?

[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:25.880]
Minus 11 Celsius right now. The high is going to be minus six. Oh, but the sun is shining. It's

[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.380]
sitting inside and you look out the window and oh, my God. Looks like a picture perfect day.

[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.520]
And you walk outside and you absolutely turn into a, but you know what? I'm not complaining. I have

[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:42.080]
no complaints. It's fine. Oh, we're fine. WQ. A. M. Hello. You're fine. I'm your friend. I like you. You're my

[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:50.260]
Q. A. M. Hello. Hello. Yes. I'm coming. Yes. How are you? Great. How are you?

[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.600]
Uh, you know, getting through a pretty horrible year, but we got through it. And

[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.340]
this is going to be I guess the standard call today just to wish you. I know George is out there

[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:06.200]
and track Chris there. He's there, right? Yes, there. Wish you all happy holidays. Let me ask

[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.180]
your question. Are you listening to the show? I just put it on right now as we stick. Okay.

[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.660]
Right now as we stick, I put it on. Okay. I'll be whatever you're celebrating. Likewise, and

[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:26.080]
hopefully someday we'll get the real Neorodger show back. Never happen. Never. Real wishful thinking.

[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.580]
Yeah, exactly. See you. Yeah. Never going to happen. Well, what is with these people? I keep

[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.660]
telling you what you hear now. This is it. This is what they will allow us to do. This is Joe

[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.360]
Bell's version of the Neorodger show. Joe Bell and Jolly Joyce and the Beasley's edited version

[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:45.500]
of the Neorodger show. This is it. Okay. And all these people. Oh, gee, the body of fallen.

[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.060]
You know, if you can only do this is where we are. And I came here to collect the paycheck

[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:56.080]
twice a month. And believe you me, I will continue collecting it for another week and then five

[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:03.640]
years more after that. Every single check I will collect. How do you like that for determination

[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:09.560]
and stubbornness? Sounds good. Because I'm a fat old stubborn, fat Jew. That's why. And I will be

[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.500]
here. Oh, gee, but it's. And some of these people having nervous breakdowns over the fact that we

[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.460]
can't play that you know something life goes on. Unless, of course, I have no life. Unless that's

[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:26.120]
your problem. I have no life. Q. I. M. Hello. I need a plan. I do. W Q. I. M. Hello.

[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.840]
Good morning. Good morning. When is this? The pads are great. Yes, they are. The easiest

[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.940]
win I've ever had in a thousand years yesterday. I don't know how they're doing it though. I mean,

[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.060]
are they really this good? I just I don't understand it. Well, I bet you their record in the cold weather

[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:48.140]
and snow is like 90% or something like that. But you know, this show your show, unfortunately,

[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.440]
when they got rid of that, he's to play once a year Christmas that farting thing. Yeah,

[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.680]
that was the end. The farting post. I think that's when they started cutting it. It was like a 20-minute

[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.160]
routine. It was the bad. Yeah, we're cutting it. Yeah. All right. Thanks, Dale. Okay.

[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.760]
Well, what did he just say? Do you have any idea? I've no idea. Alan and Woodbridge, Virginia,

[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.180]
sent me the only email over the weekend Sunday, 3.33 pm right in the middle of all-in football games.

[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.680]
And by the way, nobody's mentioning the fact that the dolphins just they they tried to give it away.

[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.900]
Nice go on Ricky Fumble it again, you idiot. Oh, that was a fumble. It was a fumble. And the reason

[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.020]
it was a fumble because it was called a fumble on the field and the replay official upstairs,

[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:33.800]
they couldn't find the evidence. Yeah, it was a coincidence. The well, there you go. I know. The fact

[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.180]
of the matter is the ball was on the ground. They tried to lose the game. They tried to blow to a

[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.860]
little girl's team Kansas City, which actually had them down. What was it like? 31 21 or

[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:50.020]
some like one point or they had them down. Yes, it did. That I think 31 24 or whatever the hell it was.

[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.920]
And they tried this way and the same thing with Oakland. There's a team. The Patriots beat by

[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.040]
600 points and the pay in the dolphins just sweet. And I grant you, I'll get you out. I'll give

[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:09.400]
you a five is a hell of an improvement over one 15. However, JETS UCK or are they bad? Wow. What

[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.240]
have I been telling you all year long about the national media? I mean, he'll be Jets are O and

[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:20.300]
four against the AFC West, which it's a one just to lose to Seattle to lose to a little girl's team.

[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.780]
Brett Farve, man, I'm to you know something they had a better your fendington would have stayed

[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.680]
there. And of course the dolphins, you know, two and three two and thirteen.

[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:35.440]
I mean, with John Dreck, but they locked out that they they ought to kiss Brett Farve's ass when they go to

[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.680]
New York next week before the game they ought to make him take his panties down all the

[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:43.160]
dolphin people the organization should kiss his ass. Well, hopefully Netflix they'll sack Brett

[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.500]
Farve a couple times and each time they sack him, I think the Jets are going to kick their ass.

[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.980]
Not I'm sure they're not, but I just want to say that because then the pants have got a real chance.

[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:57.000]
They still got a chance for the Ravens to lose. What? And you got to be Buffalo. Oh, get out of here. Buffalo.

[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000]
Oh, please, please. Anyway, Alan Woodbridge Virginia said I can't the last hour of the show.

[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.040]
Let me tell you it was a gem, especially the continued loop of musical parodies that was great.

[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.700]
Play the rack many of them I had never heard, even though I've been listening for

[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.740]
when I can for more than 20 years. And since I don't live in Florida anymore, the internet keeps

[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:21.360]
me connected that back in jail again ball into basket. Joyce won't let me slam in Duncan donuts.

[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.800]
Police got my pot sequence and puffed the magic crap for everything else that rounded out.

[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.800]
They always want it should be for sale release part of the talk radio hall of fame and one day how to be a master of entertainment.

[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.280]
And even reaffirmed in my mind, you were a genuine talent unmatched by anyone anywhere.

[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:43.000]
Even though a big fan of Russian lean toward the side of conservative politics, you've taught me to ignore politics

[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.300]
when it comes to many aspects of life and accept them for what they are by adding appropriate humor, criticism to make them more understandable.

[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.580]
Whatever that means. Unlike other on your personalities, you buy far off for a wider range of hilarious

[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.240]
commentary and parody than anyone I've ever heard and likely will never be equal. That's right. I be the greatest.

[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.660]
So thanks very much for the great afternoon of radio being your tell in an unabashed self.

[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.020]
All hail Neil Allen Woodbridge, Virginia Allen. Oh my god.

[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.020]
It's not putting us down by.

[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.500]
You don't have no right to throw.

[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.580]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.380]
The sports leader.

[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.780]
The biggest name.

[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.240]
The best talent.

[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.140]
It's the mad dog Jim Mandit.

[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.580]
Afternoons 4-7.

[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.700]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.080]
The sports leader.

[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.260]
And I'll put it down again.

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.400]
Afterhearts 35, most men experience decreased levels of testosterone.

[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.120]
But if you're like most men, you don't want to take risky pills or harmful injections.

[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.160]
Now you can renew your mad hood the all natural way with testosterone.

[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.020]
Testosterone is the one hormone enriched pasta that really sticks out.

[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.100]
That's right.

[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.120]
Now there's a way to increase your sex drive and endurance.

[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.100]
Hey honey, you cook up the testosterone.

[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.080]
I'll provide the sun to meatballs.

[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.900]
And best of all, testosterone can benefit the whole family, like mom.

[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.280]
Oh my god.

[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:04.700]

[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.220]
Oh yeah.

[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.960]
Even grandpa.

[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.600]
No, nothing yet.

[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.800]
Testosterone.

[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.560]
It'll do wonders for your noodle.

[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.060]
Still nothing.

[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.620]
Go wait some more day.

[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.840]
No, Paul Shilar.

[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.500]
Oh god, he come on.

[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.140]
1032 at 560 WQ.

[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.060]
What kind of a hazard?

[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.220]
I mean, what kind of great line of what we got for you today?

[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.680]
Looks pretty pristine to me.

[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.740]
We got the big O2 mad dog at 4.

[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.760]
Dolphin divided 7 unfortunately.

[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:36.920]
8 to 9.

[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.080]
We got Dolphin divided high school gridiron report.

[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.640]
On a Monday?

[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:41.660]
Wow.

[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.620]
And then 9 to 11.

[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.640]
We've got the beast.

[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.440]
I'm sure it'll probably be one of his last shows.

[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.820]
When you think?

[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.060]
Who knows?

[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:49.840]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.700]
I don't want to put you on a spot.

[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:52.340]
Say what?

[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.240]
Here's one.

[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.440]
A couple of emails.

[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.180]
Nothing exciting.

[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.920]
Oh, this was very nice.

[00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.040]
Not getting many of these.

[00:24:59.240 --> 00:24:59.960]
Not getting any of these.

[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:00.460]
This one.

[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.940]
Couple of them.

[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.840]
Barbara says, happy holidays.

[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.700]
You've been a part of our life since 1978.

[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.360]
And still are.

[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.960]
We wish you a happy and healthy 2009.

[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.740]
And say to you, Barbara, Vabs.

[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.840]
Don't forget go to one of your rangers.com

[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.640]
and click on that thing.

[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.100]
What do we call?

[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:17.600]
Sock.

[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.600]
Sock it to me.

[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:20.940]
Sock.

[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.300]
Oh, let me go back to the top.

[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.760]
Sock you mama.

[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.520]
Sock.

[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.400]
Sock.

[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:27.700]
What is it?

[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.780]
Sock and all.

[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.460]
Sock and all and all.

[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.000]
And it's right under the pole.

[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:33.740]
It is.

[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.620]
Yeah, we moved it up.

[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.620]
Took the cartoons out of there.

[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.560]
Good right under the pole.

[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.780]
You'll find Sock and all.

[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.140]
And see how many times you can hit George W with a shoe.

[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.460]
Michael says, why does WQM let mad dog take time off at the end of the year when the dolphins are in the middle of a playoff race?

[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.080]
Well, usually, Michael, I hate to break the news to you.

[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.980]
The dolphins aren't in the middle of a playoff race at the end of the year.

[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.480]
In fact, this is the first time in a long time.

[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.780]
They've done that for years and it doesn't make sense.

[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.460]
Let me say it again.

[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.120]
For years, the dolphins generally are not in a playoff race.

[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.980]
Come late December.

[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.000]
And plus it's in his contract where he only has to work so many days.

[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.880]
He has to work like 20 days a year.

[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.360]
And he's not going to work during the holidays.

[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.940]
Like they're getting rid of Zinfra for mode and make sense.

[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.080]
Lister in West Palm.

[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:15.920]
Well, guess what?

[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.860]
The station didn't doesn't pick the play by play people.

[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.940]
The teams pick like the hurricanes picked their guy and the dolphins picked their guy.

[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.020]
That's why Jimmy Cifilis, even though they broadcasted the dolphin games,

[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.700]
came over from 790 last year to us again this year.

[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.040]
They brought Jimmy Cifilis back because the organization wanted Miss Cifilis to win the games.

[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:38.140]
God only knows why, but then again, maybe they have bad taste.

[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.200]
Maybe they just wanted all X Dolphin Jocks.

[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.600]
All guys used to shower together in the booth.

[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.780]
That must be it.

[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.500]
And I had a spy report about Jimmy's broadcast yesterday.

[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.500]
Quintetubby here.

[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.040]
He said it was one of the all-time worst misidentifying players,

[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.060]
wrong names of players, all of these things.

[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.060]
Is that what you said?

[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.380]
Simple math is not his friend.

[00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.780]
And he don't even know it.

[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.840]
It would be like first in 10th of the 25.

[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.080]
They have an eight yard run.

[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.800]
He'll say, oh, it's the balls on the 38-yard line.

[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.040]
Jimmy, get some help, Miss Cifilis.

[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.620]
Cifilis affects your brain, you know.

[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.000]
Fake emailer says, do you need a Rogers?

[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.720]
I finally decided to take your advice after years of hearing you were ranting rave about liquid soap.

[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.000]
It's not called liquid soap.

[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.500]
It's called body wash, fool.

[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.140]
As I brought it up to the register, the cashier snickered.

[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.520]
When I asked why, she said it was rare for a non-game man to buy liquid soap.

[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.700]
Wasn't that interesting?

[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.820]
How does he know you're not gay?

[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.080]
And when I, why would she say that it's rare for a non-game man?

[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.600]
This is just fake.

[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.380]
Oh, okay.

[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.260]
It says fake emailer.

[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.060]
And at the end, it says note the preceding email was completely fake.

[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:46.780]
Oh, I got you.

[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:47.600]
Would you relax?

[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.880]
Did somebody try to be funny?

[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.020]
Well, they're trying.

[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.480]
At least they sent me something.

[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.500]
And it was several sentences.

[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.320]
Took a little effort on their part.

[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.220]
When I brought it home, my wife asked why I had bought fags.

[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.840]
So then I said jokingly that I should go in for a sex change operation.

[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.160]
It didn't help that my mother-in-law was there at the time.

[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.720]
It kept calling me a fag all week long.

[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.300]
Then proceeded to tell my nine-year-old son not to grow up to be a fag like your father.

[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.580]
My family looks down on me for all this.

[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.000]
We'll never see me in the same way again.

[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.640]
Thank you, Neo, for ruining my life.

[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.760]
I just hope that any listeners out there heed my advice.

[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.320]
And never do what Neo tells you.

[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.980]
Note the preceding email was completely fake by the audio.

[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.560]
Somebody tried to be funny like, uh, uh, like that, you know.

[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.620]
Hey, at least they're trying.

[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.520]
You know, they could really tell me.

[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.900]
At least they made the effort to send something.

[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.940]
As opposed to all these people are too busy.

[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.440]
And by the way, Barry Jackass, fake or real, go away.

[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.020]
Although this might be interesting.

[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.720]
NBC announced next week's Jets' stuff in the showdown,

[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.600]
which lost some luster after the Jets' loss to Seattle,

[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.740]
will not be flexed into the A15 slot.

[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.480]
Instead, the Chargers Bronco showdown for the AFC West will be the night game.

[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:53.900]
Wow.

[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.660]
Jets will be, it's scheduled for 105.

[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.080]
Maybe move to 415 today.

[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.340]
Well, thanks a lot, Barry.

[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.760]
You're very, you idiot.

[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.360]
Oh, that's true.

[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.180]
What that?

[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:04.540]
Oh, yeah.

[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.700]
Who knows it could be the real, Barry?

[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.820]
And by the way, Barry, what a, what a lame duck you are, man.

[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.560]
He, he puts into calm over the weekend to think about Ken Mulder getting blown out.

[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.920]
Yeah, all he does, all he does is quote what Joe Bell told him, don't you have an opinion?

[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.100]
Don't you have something to say about such a great guy?

[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.060]
Yeah, don't you have the balls to write an opinion about anything.

[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.280]
Barry, you just sit there and write whatever that whatever.

[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.380]
It was the same way when Greg Reed was here.

[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.100]
Same thing.

[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.820]
Whatever these management holes tell him, he just puts it in the paper.

[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.800]
And that's Barry's job.

[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.680]
He's like a stenographer.

[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.700]
That's all you do, Barry.

[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.680]
Got no opinion, no commentary on a guy like Ken Mulder getting blown out of here.

[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.340]
I still can't get over that.

[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.600]
And of course, as always, right before the holidays, look at all the people around the country,

[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.980]
around North America, getting canned, getting screwed over.

[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:52.900]
Happy holidays.

[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.160]
And by the way, your fire did it, did it.

[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.880]
Kind of bull crap is that.

[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.400]
QAM, hello.

[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.440]
Any other going?

[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.140]

[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.940]
I just want to wish you a happy quanta and all the best.

[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:04.820]
OK.

[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.320]
Yeah, that's stories on the NFL.com.

[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.040]
What?

[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.300]
That's stories on NFL.com now, charges, broncos.

[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:12.300]
Yeah.

[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.240]
That they're going to be the late night game.

[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.580]
They're going to what?

[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.980]
That they are the late night game.

[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.060]
So I guess that's the way we're speaking of a girl's team, Denver.

[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.860]
How are they going to wind up in a playoffs anyhow?

[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.400]
That's what I'm going to understand.

[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.820]
Neadiocity rules.

[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.260]
Oh my god, losing to the bills yesterday.

[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.960]
I saw a lot of that game and I couldn't believe my eyes.

[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.360]
The bills, of course, the bills got trended words back.

[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.840]
He ain't no JP lose man.

[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.560]
Let's start with that football crap now because I can't believe you even watch football,

[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.140]
you fairy.

[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.660]
That was a great call on Friday.

[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.760]
That really cracks me up.

[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.020]
Can't don't even believe you're watching.

[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:51.500]
I watched enough football yesterday to fill your earlobe, you jackass.

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.560]
And boy, those patriots man, they were, they were, it was just like the open game.

[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.040]
They were hit like by three touchdowns before they even, uh,

[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:58.860]
Rookas sweat.

[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.980]
Yeah, I looked up, uh, it's kind of hard to hold her and I was like,

[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.380]
what is he below zero in the snow?

[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:03.780]
But what?

[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.500]
I looked up in the second quarter and I saw that score and I was like, wow.

[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.280]
Barbara from Hollywood, Barbara, I love you and all that other, but she's got,

[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.580]
she's sending me all this stick.

[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.740]
First she sent me a long W library thing and now she's got a long poem.

[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.380]
Oh, hey, Barbara, have a wonderful holiday, honey.

[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.800]
And thanks for the memories, but no more stick lock, please.

[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.560]
Happy Hanukkah to our 10 Jewish listeners.

[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.920]
Go out there and light the menorah via, uh, give every way some Hanukkah guilt.

[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.060]
Now all we got is charity me polls.

[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.220]
We don't have anybody making the effort.

[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.020]
So here's today's poll I never even got to it yet.

[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.460]
It's because we're so, we're so tied up with all this important stuff.

[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.740]
If you could live during any time in the US,

[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.880]
30 years old, comfortable means I would, it would be during what period of time.

[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.060]
Do you understand that poll?

[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:57.880]
Yes.

[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.540]
If you'd be 30 with, uh, plenty of money.

[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.520]
About 30, man.

[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.600]
One would you want to be low?

[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.840]
Psyched Alex 60s to early 70s.

[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.820]
The sexual revolution, the perversion drugs, 194.

[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.820]
2050, 89.

[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.620]
Today, 87.

[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.200]
Rowing 20s, 47.

[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.260]
Uptight martini swilling,

[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.660]
Kami chasing bomb, sheltering 1950s to the early 60s, 42.

[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.280]
50s weren't so bad, okay?

[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.120]
Charlie B.

[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.200]
I think this is his poll.

[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.380]
50s weren't so bad.

[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.080]
We had

[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.220]
ASEAN Harriet,

[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.420]
flipper,

[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.820]
Reagan years, the 80s, 35,

[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.280]
Wild Wild West, 1827, the gay 90s,

[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.440]
11, and the gold rush, 1850s, only eight.

[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.260]
The gold rush.

[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.560]
I

[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.400]
I agree with that.

[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.400]
I voted for the 60s.

[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.600]
Knowing what I know now, see back then, I was like, uh, a naive

[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.160]
weight.

[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.460]
Like Jim and like, Miss syphilis, a naive little wave, you know.

[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.180]
So he was, uh, blowing all the calls in the game, Mr.

[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.200]
Neha.

[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.480]
I'm like, no, it's long gone, but he's consistent.

And then that because they're necessarily bad people all the time they might be

[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:40.200]

even though it was never totally yeah because like he's the head of the media

[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:44.000]

This is your brain

[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.420]
All

[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:28.020]
write

[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:34.840]
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.360]
I guess I can't say cheese is gonna be going for it for a minute.

[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.080]
Hold your mountain, I move it to the line, marks off the signal, takes the slab,

[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.280]
Which ripples the slab, finds Taylor and the other touch the die!

[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:53.360]
I want a lady, I want just pointball, can't take his eyes off his TV,

[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:57.860]
He changed the world for first and goes.

[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:05.200]
When his team wins, he goes crazy, high fives the dog,

[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.080]
Only moves from the couch when he needs a beer.

[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:22.360]
When a man watches for it more, he screams and drops and yells and pops.

[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:29.660]
Only razes the heat gets his story in the halftime show.

[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:34.740]
That's when heads up for the cat.

[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:42.720]
When a man watches for it more, he has to have a remote control

[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.740]
And no other way to watch TV.

[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:55.140]
Go from one game to another, you know he's gotta see.

[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:00.060]

I don't understand the story, neither.

[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.360]
I wish they'd do one on push call.

[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:19.200]

[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.760]
People just, you know how it is, like on Black Friday.

[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.740]
How come we can't have a Friday called White Friday?

[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.720]
I mean, is it a racial thing or what? Would that be bad?

[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.820]
Here's a stop and think about that.

[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.120]
Oh no, I have, but you know, but I know.

[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.660]
Don't say it though, it's not PC.

[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.720]
This email or first time emailer, well, is partly correct.

[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:51.060]
Says, thing you should probably root for would be that often Jets came to end up in a tie.

[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:55.060]
And for the Patriots to be Buffalo, that would vault in the wingland with an 11 on 5 record.

[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.940]
Over the 10, 5 on 1 dolphins and Jets for the division championship.

[00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.220]
Keep up the good work of fan.

[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.680]
Oh, a fan, but a different fan.

[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:02.420]
I hope.

[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.100]
No, I mean, tie, yes.

[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.300]
If the Patriots went on Sunday, which they will be Buffalo easily.

[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.360]
And the Jets beat the dolphins over the game and it's an tie.

[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.020]
Either way, the Patriots win the division.

[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.140]
Right?

[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:17.620]
Yep.

[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.860]
And the game is not going to end in a tie.

[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.940]
I mean, once in a blue moon, like that Eagles game, we were talking about once in a, you know,

[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.020]
like once every 20 years are game ends in a tie.

[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.780]
Just don't happen much no more.

[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.000]
Play for a tie, play for a tie.

[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.580]
It's an old Michigan state knock against Notre Dame, play for a tie.

[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.140]
But that's, that goes back 100 years.

[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.160]
I don't want to bore you with that.

[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.540]
I'll bore you with this instead.

[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.560]
No, this is pretty interesting.

[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:52.020]
Our good buddy, Kenny Grammar, a radio guy in OLS, has the spy reports were absolutely correct here.

[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.460]
I was halfway through this one.

[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.020]
You mentioned the minutes ago.

[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:01.980]
Listening to the first half of the first quarter on the radio yesterday, my way to go watch the game.

[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:05.160]
I had the pleasure to listen to the radio broadcast of the dolphins game.

[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.020]
Jim Madison Joe Rose, aren't the best ex-jogs on the air, but they are generally likeable.

[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.660]
Add personnel to the call of the game.

[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.960]
I have no quarrel with them.

[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:18.120]
Nor do I with Jimmy Cifilis, who may be, no, no, absolutely is the worst play by play sports and answer.

[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:18.900]
I've ever heard.

[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:19.560]
Wow.

[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.100]
You hear that, Jimmy Cifilis, the worst he's ever heard.

[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:23.980]
And he's heard a few.

[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.100]
Kenny's been around a long time.

[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.020]
He's a grammar gamer.

[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.540]
But a person is who they are.

[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.400]
I can't begrudge him for trying, even if he fails and miserably.

[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:39.340]
This, of course, not taking into consideration his what I'm sure Rotten show on WIOD, which I'm proud to say I will never listen to.

[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:41.880]
It's right wing.

[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:42.500]
It's right wing.

[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.500]
All right wing all the time.

[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.640]
All the Anatsi's got the diaries in their last trend.

[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.600]
Scare America got nothing.

[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:48.180]
I got nothing.

[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.080]
All the right wingers got the diaries.

[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.400]
And QM doesn't get any diaries anymore.

[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.500]
We're just, we just vanished.

[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.740]
We disappeared.

[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.260]
It's the jolly joebell syndrome.

[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.160]
Oh, we know what ratings anyway.

[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.280]
It's a sports station.

[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.040]
We don't, you're right.

[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:08.600]
Anyway, Kenny goes down to say my problem lies with a person who's responsible for putting Jimmy Cifilis in a position he's in.

[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:14.960]
I want to know who the person is who hired Jimmy Cifilis as the voice of the dolphins and who is responsible for keeping him on the broadcast.

[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.740]
You know something and this is my own commentary.

[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.000]
It really makes you miss Moe.

[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:20.400]
You know what?

[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.560]
I mean, Moe is way past his prime and doing play by play.

[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.060]
And once upon a time was really good at it.

[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:25.540]
Excellent.

[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.960]
And by the time he started doing the dolphins, he, he was also calling wrong play.

[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.560]
He didn't know who was on first.

[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:33.960]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.340]
In the short time I listened to dolphins came out blazing according to Jimmy Cifilis.

[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:44.240]
The opening kickoff sounded something like he's out to the 35, 40, 45 past the 50 to the 55.

[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.620]
Into the dolphin's territory.

[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:49.480]
Down the Chiefs 38, 32, then he's pushed out of the boundaries.

[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.100]
He was then mercifully interrupted by Joe Rose who said, wow, what a start.

[00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:01.740]
The very nice play where Chad Pentington ran a play action fake then handed Tedgian Jr. on reverse one something like this.

[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:05.660]
Chad heads into the line who is he handed it back weight.

[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.620]
Chad still, he gives it to a guy coming the end who gets it.

[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.360]
It's number his number is he runs to the 30 into the end zone.

[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.720]
It was Tedgian Jr. There wasn't a chief within 20 yards of him.

[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.900]
When I saw the highlights later, there were three or four opponents within arms reach.

[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:20.800]
Says Kenny.

[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:26.820]
Jimmy Cifilis has no ID is broadcasting the game on radio, which is an entirely different set of skills than for TV.

[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.620]
As a listener, you truly have no idea what's transferring on the field while the play is going on.

[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:36.880]
You have to wait for Jimmy to shop, stop shouting, and yes, he shouts or what is his pathetic attempt at an excited tone on every single play.

[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.360]
Every single play.

[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.280]
Jimmy sounds like an amateur radio student who heard that speaking in monotone is boring.

[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:47.660]
So a purposely and far too evidently changes the volume pitch and timber of his voice in a natural way.

[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.500]
It's terrible. I mean, it's terrible.

[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.880]
But the villain is not Jimmy Cifilis really.

[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:56.280]
It's the person who is in a position to remove Jimmy Cifilis from duties on the dolphin broadcast,

[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.760]
but rather continues to allow him to work.

[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.820]
That's the real enemy instead of having a real broadcast.

[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.240]
Well, well said Kenny.

[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:06.600]
I used to have a bill's infer and then we had more Howard David.

[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.560]
And then now we got this, this here.

[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.760]
Oh my God.

[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.900]
Starting to get some emails here.

[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:14.760]
That's how we've been playing.

[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:15.980]
Yeah, fake it.

[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.040]
Fakes it one way. Hands it back to number 19.

[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.540]
Ted Kim has got a call down the side line.

[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.460]
The end zone on the reverse.

[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.680]
One play 31 yards.

[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.660]
The worst call and then just be in the national football.

[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:29.340]
You stop it.

[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.620]
Number 19.

[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.980]
Now you were talking about the very beginning.

[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:35.880]
Let's check out the very beginning.

[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.400]
Chad Pennington under center.

[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:39.920]
Yeah, fake it.

[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.980]
Fakes it one way. Hands it back to number 19.

[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.500]
Ted Kim has got a call down the side line.

[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.420]
And he's into the end zone on the reverse.

[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.920]
Even I, even heartless old,

[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.880]
bag-backed Neil, even I just feel almost sorry.

[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.720]
Although he took the job, you know what I'm saying?

[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.660]
He took the job.

[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.960]
He shows up there every weekend does the game.

[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.500]
Like pretending like he belongs there.

[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.720]
Just like he pretends he belongs doing a talk show on Nazi radio.

[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.700]
Which I guess I'll fit right in because boy, he sure he sure bought the whole,

[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.020]
the whole deal.

[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.220]
Lockstock in the swastika.

[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.060]
585 votes on the poll.

[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.980]
If you could live during any time in the US,

[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.760]
30 years old with comfortable means it would be during the second Alex 60 to early 70s,

[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:35.800]
116, overwhelming.

[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.160]
They want their sex and drugs, baby.

[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.520]
2050, 94.

[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.860]
Today, 93.

[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.300]
Rowing 20s, 50.

[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.780]
Uptight, martinis, willing, comedy chasing, bomb,

[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.700]
shoveling 1950s to early 60s, 47.

[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.120]
And by the way, I want to correct myself.

[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.440]
This was not a Charlie B poll.

[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.700]
SR Buckley, Steven New Jersey.

[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:57.100]
Synthesis in.

[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:57.580]
Thanks, Steve.

[00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.540]
Sorry for the mistake.

[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.460]
Reagan years the 80s, 40.

[00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.400]
Wild Wild West, the, uh,

[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.580]
Ladder 18, 100th, 27th.

[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.800]
The gay 90s, 11.

[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.500]
And the gold rush, eight.

[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.160]
I'm living in the gay 90s.

[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.260]
In fact, if I make it to 90, I'll be gay 90,

[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.080]
590 on the poll 590.

[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.400]
Our goal is 600, then we're calling it quits.

[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:19.660]
Retire.

[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:21.340]
What do you say?

[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.600]
No, you can, you can retire because you're,

[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.800]
well, you're still going to be around.

[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.880]
Can I still be hanging around?

[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.960]
Oh, we, uh, weekly, you know, weekends.

[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.280]
And then maybe once, maybe once a week,

[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.140]
we can have the, uh, check with fat boy,

[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.180]
a segment on the show and you can come in and give us all the,

[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.060]
all the dope what's going on in the building.

[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:40.860]
Hey, sounds good.

[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.160]
Not that you're going to get paid for that, but nevertheless,

[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.000]
maybe on Thursdays when the food comes in.

[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:46.620]
Oh, okay.

[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.520]
That would be a good incentive for you to come in.

[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:50.160]
Free lunch.

[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.480]
Our good friend Lawrence, who, uh,

[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.840]
I don't want to call him Larry.

[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.020]
He, he's Lawrence.

[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.060]
Hope you make the most of your holiday time with the

[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.360]
Duke Christmas or Hanukkah or not.

[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.300]
No, I don't do any of them.

[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.800]
To you and Chris and the absent lucky him.

[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.400]
And I'm sure he's nowhere near the radio today, George.

[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.700]
No, he don't, he's like me.

[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.220]
He doesn't listen to the radio when he's not working

[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:07.540]
in the either.

[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:08.760]
Why I'm sure he's listening to it.

[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:09.040]
Entently.

[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.140]
No, yeah, he's sitting there glued to the radio.

[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.220]
Hey, George, you suck.

[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.300]
He doesn't listen when he's not working in either.

[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:17.680]
Why?

[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.540]
Why there would be great to get the old version of the near

[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.380]
Roger show, the pre-joy show.

[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:25.260]
Uh, what does this say?

[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:27.320]
If I believed in hell, I only hope that Joyce wants to

[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.420]
and soon maybe would Joe Bell carrying the water down there.

[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.280]
Back a water-deferred version is better than none at all.

[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.620]
And a whole lot better than the Drek offered on the other

[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.460]
stations and on your station during the rest of the day.

[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.940]
Sounds like a knock on the sports segments to me, Larry.

[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.360]
Lawrence, some of us are stuck at work this week and so no

[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:41.960]
calls for me.

[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.160]
Nothing I call anyway.

[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.320]
We took a few calls in that first hour.

[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:46.940]
They were something.

[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:47.900]
I can't say the word stellar.

[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:52.260]
Oh, I begin with an S, but it wasn't going to be stellar.

[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.500]
SH something.

[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.660]
I think all this picking on Jimmy Cifalus is, um, perfect.

[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.940]
I just don't understand where she came from.

[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.760]
You know, I mean, I just, I mean, I know and he did some NBC

[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.840]
stuff and you had me as a guest on his channel 10 show 100

[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.000]
years ago and I had him and his co-host on my show on the radio

[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.080]
and I and Z and yada yada yada.

[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.180]
We always got along just fine, but you know, it's one thing when

[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.300]
you start doing things that you're not qualified to do and you

[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:21.600]
make an ass of yourself, Jimmy.

[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.560]
That's the problem.

[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.460]
I mean, we had Bill Zimper.

[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.220]
There wasn't a damn thing wrong with Bill Zimper.

[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:28.720]
Zimper was just fine, you know what?

[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:31.760]
Right.

[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.020]
Well, except for that.

[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.480]
And then there was always.

[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.080]
And no luck yet, Jim.

[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:45.400]
Now he's still locked in the closet down there.

[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:46.360]
With dance.

[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.060]
Yeah, Zimper and man, it was a good team.

[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:51.400]
And then it was moke.

[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.160]
Moke came to town.

[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.220]
One of the first things he did is he laid down the law.

[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.000]
He let it be known.

[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.680]
Well, when I'm doing the broadcast, I don't need anybody else

[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.100]
talking over me and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:55:59.100 --> 00:55:59.740]
And I'm the star.

[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.900]
In other words, he was trying to like intimidate Mad Dog, you know,

[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.340]
and shutting up, dumbing him up.

[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:05.120]
Remember that?

[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:06.940]
Unfortunately, I do.

[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:07.180]
Yeah.

[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.960]
In fact, he even didn't print before he got to town.

[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.240]
He was like making threatening.

[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.780]
Well, I'm going to be doing the game.

[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.660]
And when I do the game, I don't need anybody joking and yucking in the interrupting me.

[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.500]
Like anybody gave a crap about him in that horrible piece, that her piece.

[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.500]
By the way, for those people who want guests on the show, we're going to be having

[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:33.400]
a great day.

[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:39.660]
I'm going to be doing a great day.

[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:39.660]

I'm going to be doing a great day.

[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:39.740]

[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.000]
I'm going to be doing a great day.

[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:40.160]

[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:40.200]

In fact, I got a really good suggestion.

Oh, that's nasty.

[00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:58.380]
Santa's still dead.

[00:59:58.840 --> 00:59:59.200]
Oh, that's nasty.

[00:59:59.200 --> 00:59:59.200]

[00:59:59.200 --> 00:59:59.200]

[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.500]
How can Santa be dead when there never was no Santa in the first place?

[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.620]
Oh, you're wrong, Neil.

[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.720]
His name is Chris Kringley.

[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:04.660]
He lives in the North Pole.

[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.140]
And Mama Claus in there.

[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.040]
Yeah.

[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:07.720]
Mama Claus.

[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.760]
Yeah, Mama.

[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:10.200]

[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:10.820]
That's it.

[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.300]
I clicked that thing on.

[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.960]
I thought there'd be a whole bunch more emails.

[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:20.200]
And by the way, Barry Jack has quit bugging me with biographies of Jimmy Cifalus and Alice Rantell

[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:20.940]
and all these other...

[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.120]
Nobody cares, Barry.

[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.720]
Nobody cares, fake Barry.

[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.280]
I think it's the real Barry.

[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:30.180]
He's enough of a quizzling that he would like, you know, play along.

[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.660]
Nothing but simple to him.

[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.040]
I mean, there's a guy.

[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.000]
Oh, brother.

[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.400]
Talk about having nothing to say.

[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:42.040]
Where's the fake Jim Sarni when we need him badly?

[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.240]
With more Anita Marks reports?

[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:43.840]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.060]
I think we're going to sneeze.

[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:49.600]
Wow.

[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.560]
Because I think it's a miracle I don't have pneumonia or something.

[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:54.880]
WQAN, hello.

[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:54.880]

[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.420]
Well, almost again.

[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.300]
You're on the road over here.

[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:58.760]
What is it?

[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.180]
Good morning.

[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.020]
Good morning to you.

[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:00.680]
Good morning.

[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:01.680]
Happy holiday.

[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:02.700]
And back to you.

[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.580]
I had the...

[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:08.140]
This pleasure of listening to Joe's The Gacky about a month ago.

[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:08.940]
I had no choice.

[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:09.820]
I'm so sorry.

[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.040]
Oh, my God.

[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.900]
That's the first time I ever really listened to one of his games.

[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:14.880]
Uh-huh.

[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.820]
I listen to Chick Herndt's going over the kid.

[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.200]
I don't know if you're over the kid.

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:19.380]
Oh, my.

[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:20.360]
Oh, my.

[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.680]
Yeah, Northwest Coast, of course.

[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.260]
Yeah, I was listening to him doing the Laker game.

[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:27.620]
Why would you compare Chick Herndt to Joe's The Gacky?

[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.100]
No, no.

[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.580]
I'm just saying, listening to Chick Herndt and the kid and then listening to Joe's The Gacky

[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.680]
was like listening to a...

[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.880]
a Geldie seeing the spank of...

[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.520]
start single better.

[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:39.280]
Right.

[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.000]
But, uh, I didn't know the person.

[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:41.860]
Yeah.

[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.260]
But, uh, I mean, we're all the Black Crossers now.

[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.780]
I mean, Matt Dogg, you know, he's a play-by-play guy.

[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.480]
I call it a guy.

[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.060]
He's kind of stepped down a little bit.

[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.040]
He's not doing the same to the usually.

[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.140]
It's like last year.

[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:57.920]
But, uh, we've got to get better at that, man.

[01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.240]
Yeah, okay.

[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.340]
I love good one.

[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.320]
Say how to Chick Herndt.

[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.680]
He's still dead, by the way.

[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.860]
Yeah, let's pick a name and compare him to Jimmy Cifilis.

[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.100]
Pick a name.

[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:10.640]
Hmm.

[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.140]
I mean, isn't that silly?

[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:12.700]
Yeah.

[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.640]
Why would you do that?

[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.320]
How about the late-grade Dan Kelly?

[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.560]
St. Louis Blues Montreal, Canadians, huh?

[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:20.800]
That rookie!

[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:21.780]
He was great.

[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.060]
He was fat and now he's dead.

[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.140]
Just a little warning for you.

[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.780]
He was very, very fat and now he's dead.

[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.380]
W.D. Q.A.M. Hello.

[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.480]
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?

[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.320]
I'm good. How are you?

[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.400]
I'm good.

[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.940]
I'm so glad you mentioned Dick Enberg.

[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.840]
You know, at least in his day, Dick Enberg was terrific.

[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:39.420]
He was.

[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.420]
And now there's shoe-horning three people in work.

[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.200]
Two would be fine.

[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.460]
I think Dick Enberg and Dan Foulford find.

[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.500]
They put that cheating moron with his bad dentures,

[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.200]
Randy Croft in between them.

[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.340]
And hasn't he blodbed that quite a bit?

[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.240]
And I think, you know what?

[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.880]
Watch go like with your grandmother.

[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:57.800]
Jerk.

[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.640]
You know, I'm saying, you're so right about the ex-Jocke thing.

[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.560]
You know, it doesn't stop my life.

[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.200]
Everybody who ever wear a Jocke strap is a broadcaster.

[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:06.320]
Everybody.

[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.240]
Yeah, okay.

[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.300]
Well, maybe not so much.

[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.140]
I will tell you that, oh, God, I know this is going to be simple.

[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.360]
Or I before Christmas, whether he's, and I don't watch CBS pregame,

[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.260]
it's because I think Burino as a broadcaster was a good quarterback.

[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:19.820]
Okay.

[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:21.480]
I'm sorry.

[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:26.020]
He just, I mean, he's gotten better, but he's still, you know, he's still got to.

[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.080]
He's no Shannon Sharp.

[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:27.760]
I'll tell you that.

[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.540]
Well, you know, at least Shannon tries to say other things.

[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.800]
Oh, get out of here.

[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:33.540]
Oh, get out of here.

[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.280]
Get out of here.

[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.940]
And he can't even speak.

[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.260]
Well, that's genetic.

[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.980]
The sharp family is all important.

[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:40.180]
I see.

[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:40.800]
Okay, great.

[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.300]
Well, that's good.

[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.060]
Good excuse for it.

[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.880]
That's all a reason to put him on the air.

[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:44.980]
He can't speak, but it's genetic.

[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.440]
Do you ever hear anything so ridiculous in your whole life?

[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:48.960]
It's genetic.

[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:49.480]
No.

[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:51.380]
It's in his genes.

[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.960]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5.

[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.700]
I wasn't going to take any calls this week at all.

[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.680]
I was going to play the rack.

[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.560]
I had Jimmy suggested a threatened to do.

[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.480]
Wouldn't, it wouldn't surprise me if it's the real Jimmy's, you know,

[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.540]
I mean, what else is he going to do?

[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.340]
Finish with that awful morning show on IOD on all Nazi radio.

[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.280]
Oh, they sure got the diaries in that last trend though.

[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.560]
Wow, good, good for them.

[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.120]
You know, this weekend I had the pleasure of sneezing and

[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.400]
smitting my pants ever happened to you.

[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.760]
Yeah, as a matter of fact, not a big load, you know, but

[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.200]
you ever sneezed and dropped a little or a big number?

[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.320]
I sneezed at a party, but that's it.

[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.060]
Yeah, oh, be careful on that.

[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.220]
Be real careful on that to you because you think it's only going to be a fart.

[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.800]
Hey, Neil, happy Hanukkah.

[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.540]
Next, Mr. Chris.

[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.080]
I had to listen to the dolphins on a radio yesterday and boy was it bad.

[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.900]
It's the same with UM games.

[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.680]
Too bad we can't listen to the radio on mute.

[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:49.100]
Oh, woo.

[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.480]
Have you ever sneezed farted and burped at the same time?

[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.540]
No, I had to bring that up work one time and that was interesting.

[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.640]
I'm going to work on it right.

[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.240]
Oh, I can't do the other one.

[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.160]
What is this?

[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:05.880]
Oh, this is great.

[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.520]
Here's a good story for all you right winners out there for all of you.

[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.280]
I don't know how to do radio about Miss Foley.

[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.260]
Mark Foley.

[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.400]
Thank you whoever sent that.

[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.120]
I'm printing it out.

[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.640]
Oh, the fake Larry King is back.

[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:19.000]
I vote for Myron Copen Edwin Pope for the Alphan radio broadcast.

[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.820]
Jimmy Joe Mandage suck their bush league spelled wrong.

[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.780]
Get your spelling right, Larry.

[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.720]
And don't be knocking the little dog and big dog.

[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:26.880]
You idiot.

[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.340]
Why not bring Hank Goldberg back to the dolphin broadcast?

[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.200]
Because Hank Goldberg doesn't do play by play.

[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.120]
That's why.

[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.600]
See, you know, it's really interesting to me that all these jocks and the jocks

[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:37.820]
differ.

[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.500]
All these people think they know something about sports casting.

[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.760]
They don't have the difference between a play by play guy and a color guy.

[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.500]
Like Shannon Sharp, he's a color guy.

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:48.980]
He's bad.

[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.600]
He just is not belong on here.

[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.360]
And but then he's got a lot of company.

[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:54.380]
He ain't no jerk, jerk street.

[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.000]
I'll say to that.

[01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.480]
This great former US representative Mark Foley has been throwing out a better place

[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.040]
as I'm sure.

[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.540]
And that's just because of the heinous plaid jacket he wore that that's heinous, not heinous.

[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:12.580]
Foley and his lover dermatologist Lane Nisenbaum were on ceremoniously bounced from the Cartier Christmas party

[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.220]
on Palm Beach's Worth Avenue earlier this month.

[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:21.800]
Two eyewitnesses told Page 2 live, whatever that is, that Foley who resigned from his congressional seat two years ago

[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:26.020]
after he was got emailing sweet nothings to the young pages was actually just an innocent bystander

[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:30.500]
in a scrawl between society's skin and smoother Nisenbaum and unidentified party gore.

[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:34.660]
But since Foley had come in with Dr. Lane, he too was taken out by security guards.

[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.640]
I wonder if they yelled at him.

[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.180]
You fairy.

[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.740]
The party won't have many in the famed street of Christmas time, double to say fundraiser for the Palm Beach Opera.

[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:42.560]
So what happened?

[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.000]
This must be a Josey Lambie.

[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:51.860]
I'm told Nisenbaum, this submerged guy's wife, not the smartest thing to do, when things escalated Nisenbaum through champagne at the guy

[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:55.540]
and the guy put Nisenbaum in a headlock over a jewelry counter before the guards intervened.

[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.040]
Besides, he goes, no one was hurt.

[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.720]
It was an accident but nobody got hurt.

[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.060]
Neither Foley nor Nisenbaum returned calls.

[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.240]
Stor director Craig Bigman said he didn't witness the incident but he was told about it.

[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:08.460]
Miss Foley, she and her boyfriend are added again.

[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:11.000]
It's only one thing to say about that.

[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.820]
Oh my, oh my!

[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.900]
What could get named?

[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:15.940]
The best talent.

[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.360]
You're his new Rajas.

[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.060]
Sport Radio 560 QAM.

[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.400]
The fourth leader.

[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.760]
Don't tell me that's it.

[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:24.980]
Yep, apparently it is.

[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.060]
Another stunt rejoin?

[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.120]
Howard David's a bitch.

[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:37.680]
I wondered around the malt to see what gets that I could get.

[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:42.460]
I almost gave up till I found the quarry of secrets.

[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.700]
Oh, browse and panty see through roads.

[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.620]
She won a place to browse.

[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:52.480]
It was only a minute till I felt someone a rouse.

[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.220]
Oh, I think I could buy the whole warehouse.

[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.540]
So I grabbed for a carter, built a pushover.

[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.420]
Oh, yes.

[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:07.280]
I overspent my limit on American Express.

[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.100]
I spent a lot of money but there's one thing I forgot.

[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.840]
My girl left me for a guy named Scott.

[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:21.200]
My budget is shot and these panties show right up and off for lots.

[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.620]
Dead dead dead.

[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.200]
Someday you'll be dead dead dead dead dead.

[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:37.600]
Someday we'll all be dead.

[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:43.020]
The minute we're born we start dying.

[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.280]
We die a little more every day.

[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:51.380]
Younger old Richard Poor, there's nothing we can do to stop it.

[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:57.840]
So to look long at that Christmas tree it may be the last one that you see.

[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.280]
Dead grave your house in green and red because someday you'll be dead.

[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.580]
Oh, dead dead dead.

[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:09.020]
Someday you'll be dead dead dead dead dead.

[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.600]
Someday we'll all be dead.

[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:19.360]
It might have been then a couple months or 50 years from now.

[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.000]
But no matter when it happens it will seem too soon to you.

[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.640]
So be sure on Christmas Eve when you snuggle into dead.

[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.380]
That you thank God for your family because someday they'll be dead.

[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.560]
Dead dead dead.

[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.120]
Someday they'll be dead dead dead dead.

[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.320]
Someday we'll all be dead.

[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.660]
All right.

[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.320]
Who knows how many Christmas is left in their short life?

[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.860]
Nobody knows that's my point.

[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.640]
Enjoy the while you can.

[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.220]
And so on Christmas morning let good tidings fill your head.

[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.740]
What a festive season.

[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.720]
Someday you'll be dead.

[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.060]
Oh, dead dead dead.

[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.560]
Someday we'll be dead dead dead dead dead dead dead.

[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.660]
Everyone you know dead.

[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.600]
A very Merry Christmas to you.

[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.460]
Dead dead dead.

[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:31.720]
Someday we'll be dead.

[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.860]
Merry Christmas everybody.

[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.780]
1134 or 26 till noon at 560 WQAM.

[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:39.780]
Son of Shinin' Man is beautiful.

[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:41.520]
Looks like a great day for wood buy.

[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.140]
Oh, there goes the old man again.

[01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.600]
Going to sit that slot machine.

[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.360]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.800]
I'll do whatever the hell I want to do.

[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.400]
I do like that.

[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.220]
Without any assistance from all the anonymous idiots out there.

[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.560]
I'm not getting too much of that.

[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.600]
And some of the people that I blocked, they keep coming back on there again.

[01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.060]
Realtor, Jr., he can't, you know, because I look and they deleted ones, you know.

[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.400]
And I see the email addresses and I don't bother reading them.

[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:06.260]
And I just delete them a second time and they vanish.

[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.120]
So keep, you know, keeps you off the street.

[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.060]
Some real, real sick bastards out there.

[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:14.060]
I'm sure you're worth that.

[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:14.920]
Oh, yeah.

[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.340]
WQYM, hello.

[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.380]
Hey, Nei, how you doing?

[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:18.920]
Okay.

[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.700]
The absolute worst, an answer.

[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.880]
I mean, the worst is beyond Sanders.

[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.580]
He's on the NFL network.

[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.080]
He was on a Baltimore Dallas game.

[01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:33.380]
If you had a tape of beyond Sanders and played it against Jimmy Cephalo,

[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.560]
it's just, it's not even a comparison.

[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:36.260]
Yeah.

[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:42.740]
He, he, I, he, the big difference being that Dion Sanders doesn't do play by play.

[01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.000]
He does, he just, it's there and makes stupid comments.

[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.940]
Well, personally, we're albums, we rooting for Dallas on a national broadcast.

[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:49.680]
That's ridiculous.

[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:50.300]
Yeah.

[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.960]
I mean, that's, that's ridiculous.

[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:55.940]
Now, the other question I have is, you know, radio consultants.

[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.300]
Do these guys, do the consultants come in and go,

[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:05.320]
you have to have a high school fake affect like Cephalo and, you know,

[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.860]
these guys have, they don't have any consultant over there.

[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.780]
Are you kidding me?

[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.340]
But do they have like these guys that teach these guys,

[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.900]
you have to be fake and phony?

[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.760]
No, they learn it on their own.

[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.680]
And then they're all fucked, too, by the way.

[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.220]
Okay. Well, thanks for the summary.

[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:21.560]
Wow.

[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.460]
A lot of sucking going on.

[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.040]
I've had you that.

[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.160]
Kenny Gramer is back again.

[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.280]
He's really whipped up today.

[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.700]
Jimmy Cephalo is to fland, is flanders from the Simpsons.

[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:32.900]
There goes number 19.

[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:33.920]
Look at the dickety-dickety-do.

[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.480]
As Shannon Sharp is much more from the old Bill Cosby, a cartoon.

[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.800]
I'm not going to read what he wrote because it has like a little racial overtone.

[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.200]
You know what I mean?

[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.040]
I don't want to do that.

[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.140]
It's not the fact that Shannon Sharp is black.

[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.520]
It's the fact that he's illiterate.

[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.640]
And he just, he, he looks bad, you know?

[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.140]
He looks bad on there and he can't speak.

[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.840]
And he just, he doesn't belong there.

[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.000]
He doesn't belong, Shannon.

[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.040]
And that James Brown, one bullet right through that fat gutter,

[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.600]
and he's going to say his would to solve that problem.

[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:01.340]
Shannon!

[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.200]
It's like a fraternity of dummies.

[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.140]
How do you really feel?

[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.600]
I don't watch that crap.

[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.960]
I mean, you know, I'll, I'll channel surf and I'll see that it's on

[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.100]
and then take about 30 seconds of it.

[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.320]
But third, man.

[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:12.860]
And move on.

[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.380]
I'll move back to the racing network or something you're citing like that.

[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.200]
I'll move out of that guy from Chicago.

[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:22.760]
Oh wait a minute.

[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.160]
Here we go.

[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:23.860]
Here's Gary Guy.

[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.320]
The incredibly affected Gary Guy.

[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:26.900]
What a guy.

[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:27.860]
A flamboyant down.

[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.800]
He's a hamlet of me.

[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.540]
He's a little bit close to the face.

[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:30.900]
He's a little bit close to the face.

[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.480]
You want to say to your, and the trailer is Foxbound.

[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.440]
It was Johnny Muboy.

[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.600]
Yeah, Gary Guy.

[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.660]
Looks like a cheap drunk to me.

[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.060]
I don't know.

[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.700]
So you're awfully negative and nasty day for the holidays.

[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.440]
And you're like, that's right.

[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.760]
I'm getting it all out of my system.

[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:43.800]
I'm cleaning it out.

[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.480]
I'm having like a big brain douche for the new year coming.

[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.520]
Isn't that a good idea?

[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.520]
Sure, why not?

[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.800]
The fake Mahatma Gandhi sends me a really interesting article here.

[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.320]
Companies that won't make it through 2009.

[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.680]
And guess what one of them is?

[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.060]
I'm serial when I say it.

[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.580]
I agree with that one.

[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:02.540]
Serious.

[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.380]
A lot of fairly well-known public companies who disappeared

[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.980]
or went bankrupt this year, circuit cities on the list,

[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.520]
based on the most recent news GM may be added soon.

[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:16.180]
24-7 Wall Street looked at some of the largest most well-known companies

[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.360]
reviewed the RSCC findings.

[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.380]
If their public, analyst reports and media observations about their business

[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.740]
and picked 10 that probably won't be around by this time next year.

[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.620]
And one of them was serious.

[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:27.020]
Oh, go to serious, Neil.

[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:27.800]
Go to serious.

[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.480]
WQA M. Hello.

[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:31.820]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.800]
You know, the local channel here, you've got Kim Boe,

[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.880]
Camper, you've got Seth Felo, you've got Joe Rose.

[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.640]
And you know, out of the ex-Dolphin, Jack Sniffer is it on there.

[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.800]
The only one who has a personality is Joe Rose.

[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:44.740]
I have to give him credit.

[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.820]
The guy is kind of funny.

[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.900]
I do like watching him.

[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.940]
For the audience and a gigantic head, that's right.

[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:50.860]
Yeah, but when it comes to Seth Felo,

[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.420]
I heard that he's doing a personal appearance promoting his six-ten show.

[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:58.280]
He's going to, there's a white Aryan race, white supremacist.

[01:14:59.560 --> 01:14:59.920]
QAM.

[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:00.140]
Hello.

[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:01.860]
Neil.

[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:02.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:06.420]
With some money, a woodbind for me, man, I can't even pay my electric bill.

[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.360]
Hey, don't get me started about the electric bill.

[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.160]
Don't get me started.

[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.500]
That was the way he had a whole bunch of lines lit up there.

[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.920]
And all of a sudden, when I won't guide me, that disgusting remark,

[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.140]
whatever was I forget, they all vanished.

[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:20.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:21.800]
Yep.

[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.900]
That in temperate remark that he made.

[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.760]
Some village of stadiums.

[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.620]
Well, that's okay.

[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.720]
We got a couple emails here.

[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:35.580]
How about those Pat fans, even with such a blowout against all of them stayed to the third quarter?

[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.480]
Have you ever seen Arrowhead stadium so empty?

[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.660]
They deserve to be empty.

[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.120]
They suck.

[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.600]
I don't understand drummers on the old pool.

[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:45.300]
Please explain.

[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.060]
I don't either.

[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:51.300]
I hope you, in fact, Chris have a great holiday and take it easy on the egg nog.

[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.160]
You know, I haven't had egg nog in years.

[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:53.980]
Thanks, Jason.

[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:55.960]
Haven't had it in years.

[01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.200]
Have you?

[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:00.240]
Nope.

[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:00.800]
Never been able to.

[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.720]
I love egg nog.

[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:06.080]
So now he put that in my in my mind, in my head.

[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.960]
And you know me what a pig I am.

[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.200]
He's a truck.

[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.140]
I know he's, huh?

[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:12.960]
He's a truck.

[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:13.060]

[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:18.020]
He's probably really fattening when you think a lot of carbs, a lot of calories.

[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.820]
And then of course, real good at egg nog.

[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:23.840]
He's got to have a lot of nutmeg.

[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:26.080]
Right?

[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.120]
You never had egg nog.

[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:28.720]
You never had egg nog.

[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.940]
You didn't even know what that it is.

[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:31.320]
I mean, I know what it is, but just not into it.

[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.080]
But what do you mean you're not interested?

[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.320]
It's the delicious man.

[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.720]
Don't you like something that tastes good or what?

[01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:38.000]
Of course.

[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:45.780]
Rudy says the NFL had announced that Sunday's Duffing and Meant Suggestive Mental Anzoli played.

[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.900]
Has announced that should say at 415 on CBS.

[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.000]
They decided to make a 10% Diego 815.

[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.880]
By the way, my shana hand is he looked always confused or what?

[01:16:55.740 --> 01:17:00.780]
I know the Humper would tell me what a great coach he is, but he always looks be fuddled and confused and you know.

[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:04.580]
In fact, a lot of the coaches like that, Moran and Buffalo, Dicturon.

[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.680]
Oh my God.

[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.540]
He looks like he's been dead 20 years at least, isn't he?

[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:11.160]
Yeah.

[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.480]
He was a Giants coach.

[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.640]
Giants coach, Father Codlander, he looks a lot like Dicturon.

[01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.200]
Yeah, but he's kind of like an awake corpse though.

[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.180]
He's like actually moves around.

[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.000]
He's just nearly white.

[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.940]
He's a little more animated whereas Dicturon looks like a dead man.

[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.500]
I still say Rick Weaver, bring him back, baby.

[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.620]
Do them up and sit him up in that queue.

[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:29.840]
Do them up and sit him up in that queue.

[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.120]
436-QAM.

[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:32.860]
Naked.

[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:33.840]
4th lead.

[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:35.100]
The biggest name.

[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.260]
The best talent.

[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:36.700]
Yes.

[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.460]
It's the big dog, Joe Rose.

[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.060]
We're demorting 7 or 10.

[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.280]
We're South Florida sports always matters.

[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.780]
Sports radio 560-QAM.

[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.920]
The sports leader.

[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.460]
Buffalo blows and soda.

[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.160]
Bam.

[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:52.920]

[01:17:54.060 --> 01:18:00.700]
Ooh, my little candlestick.

[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.840]
My candlestick.

[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.300]
Layin' in new and every night.

[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.640]
Who are you?

[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:06.900]
Is it Daring Hormica?

[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:10.780]
Honnica is the festival of lights.

[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.860]
And I'm never gonna quit doing it.

[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.300]
It is funded by your abolish.

[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.120]
Celebrate.

[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.320]
And it's cultured too.

[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:29.280]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:59.260]
longest two twenties and now these questions are filled with everything

[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:01.220]
let's hear it. Let's hear it for your

[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.320]
ski. Let's hear it for Abraham.

[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:03.920]
Let's hear it for Abraham Solomon.

[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.260]
Rest in peace.

[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.220]
Then Z says the reason that drummers

[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.660]
was on that pool is because

[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:11.280]
recording artists now use mostly

[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.240]
drum machines that are programmed

[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.100]
in our real live musicians.

[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.160]
I didn't know that. Did you?

[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.220]
I mean, I knew about it, but to me

[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.980]
it was the machine. Yeah, most of

[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.640]
those machines bands. Yeah.

[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.740]
I mean, like, you know, single

[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:25.140]
let's just singers maybe, but like

[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.200]
if you listen to a band, they have

[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.120]
a real drummer. I see. So I

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:28.120]

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:28.120]

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:28.120]

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.000]
hello. Hello. I was a drum

[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.560]
band. Hey, Neil. How's it going?

[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.540]
Okay. Hey, these guys are

[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.140]
right. Sipless is the worst.

[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.260]
He's just so milk toast and

[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.460]
boring. But manage is great.

[01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:42.000]
Jeroz is good, but they kind of

[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.080]
talk over each other. Yeah. I

[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.060]
kind of like to have the street

[01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.560]
man. I say let's get six people

[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.420]
in the booth. It would be good.

[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.440]
And bring back Henry Bell for the

[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.840]
sideline, right? And the

[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.480]
Humper and the big. Oh, and

[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.820]
Larry. Uh-huh. Only $50.

[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.380]
Okay. See you. Miami

[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.920]
Weatherman still maintains he

[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.220]
was framed by false claims. You

[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.160]
see, even in my deleted stuff, I

[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.420]
find once in a great while or

[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.840]
something worthwhile as opposed to

[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.040]
which is most of what is

[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.920]
deleted. Miami, Miami weatherman.

[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.500]
Oh my god. All I can say to

[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.000]
Miss Kamal. You're fair. When I asked

[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.460]
about the toys in his trunk, he

[01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:20.520]
says the toys in the truck of my

[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.740]
car, the alleged toys I was

[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.780]
bringing to this young man, where

[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.020]
my trunk for almost a year and a

[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.000]
half. I wonder if that includes

[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.460]
the condoms in the Loub. You

[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.800]
don't have to ask that. What?

[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.000]
You're not supposed to ask about

[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.960]
those. Oh, we TV and radio people

[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.000]
get stuff mailed. There was all

[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.160]
the time in work, hats, sunscreen,

[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.300]
UV indicators. The big guns are

[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:46.980]
all arranged now in the pool. So

[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.320]
what about the Loub and the, uh,

[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.900]
tube and the condoms and the red

[01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:54.680]
rubber ball? When asked why he was

[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.240]
even on the boys from Ann website,

[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.100]
Kamal says it was not boys for

[01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.900]
men. It was dads and sons or

[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.280]
sons and dads. And I said, well,

[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.960]
this is an odd chat room. I don't

[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.020]
remember seeing this chat room. I

[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:06.540]
was sick that day. I had some kind of

[01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.200]
poisoning, food or bacteria. It was

[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.040]
in a bad frame of mind. Yeah. You

[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.920]
fair. Board alone at home was just

[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.420]
playing on the computer and went into

[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.780]
this chat room. And I wanted to

[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.980]
if it's like somebody you can be a big

[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:19.540]
brother to. That's what first got me

[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.980]
into the chat room and I'm thinking if

[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:22.560]
AOL allowed this chat room, then they have

[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:24.400]
parental control and then everybody in

[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.100]
here should be an adult 18 years and older.

[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:27.720]
And so I'm playing around. I see this

[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.220]
email, the screen name that I email. I

[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:31.660]
know that I instigated the email. That's

[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.640]
in the record. And the guy says he's 14. I'm

[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.520]
thinking, yeah, right. I'm 48 and I lie

[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.460]
about my age on the computer too. Millions of

[01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:38.660]
people do that. So I started playing

[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.160]
around. Sure. Always a good idea. If

[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.100]
somebody, if some kid on the internet says I'm

[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:46.180]
14 years old, always a good idea to assume that they're lying

[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:49.880]
in there at least 18. Miss Kamal, born and

[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.260]
nosy and just playing on the computer and I'm

[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.600]
so damn naive, I don't think this could even be

[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.680]
a possible felony because I'm talking to somebody

[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.740]
who could be under 18. Oh, come on. Is that

[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.360]
lame or what? You fairy. Very bad. Is that

[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.300]
something to lay in? Lay Miss Krat? How many years

[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.480]
has he had to come up with the new, you

[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.160]
know, reason why he was there? And he can't

[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.260]
think of anything. He's had a lot of time to

[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.440]
think about it. He's working on it. So

[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.360]
anyway, the Jets Doffin game will be

[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:20.940]
415 on CBS. The bills and the Patriots

[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.580]
game is at one o'clock. The bills would need

[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:26.120]
to win that game for the Jets that have a

[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:32.000]
chance to win the AFC East. If the dolphins

[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.260]
lose and the Patriots win or if the Doffin

[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.080]
game is a tie, the win will win the AFC East

[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.440]
title. Baltimore can clinch a wildcard

[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.080]
brick by defeating the anxious Jacksonville

[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.200]
Jaguar, who really sucked 415 p.m. That's

[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:48.500]
a schedule. You got it? Got it. Got

[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.920]
Patriots and bills at one. Doffins and

[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.760]
Jets at four, 415. Jacksonville Baltimore

[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.220]
415 and then the anitemium Denver San Diego.

[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.280]
My Shanahan will continue walking around with his

[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.480]
bug eyes. Eyes look like they're going to pop

[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.920]
out of his head on a sideline. Looking very

[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.080]
confident and darting up and down a sideline. Have you ever

[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.900]
watched him during a game? I try not to be

[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.400]
out. He does have a kind of weird eyes.

[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.820]
Raine, strange dude and he always looks like

[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.060]
oh, so what's going on out there? Whatever it is,

[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.740]
it's not good. It wasn't video yesterday Mike.

[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.900]
Oh my God, the freaking bills no less. That was

[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:25.520]
that was amazing. Don't start with the sports

[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.980]
stuff. We got 20 hours in that crap the

[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.620]
rest of the day. Don't start tuning out with

[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:30.380]
sports garbage, like talking about Miss

[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.900]
Cifalus WQAM. Hello. It's Joey

[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:40.360]
Joe Bell Q. I am hello. Hey, good

[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.620]
morning. Good morning. That combo is my

[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:47.380]
good. What? That combo is that? No,

[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:51.520]
okay, good. Who cares? Q. I. Am hello.

[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.480]
Q. I. Am hello.

[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.680]
Hello. Hello. Hello.

[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.460]
Hello. I'm not sure if it's

[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:07.860]
hold on. Reverend. Oh, I'm holding it.

[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:12.200]
Q. I. Am hello. I like to talk about

[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:19.260]
Q. I. Am hello. WQ. Am hello. Hey,

[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:23.000]
Neil. Yes, sir. Two things. I got

[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.760]
a credit to trade in my car. I had a

[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.560]
2,800 court. Got 10,000 miles on it. I

[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.860]
know after about a year, a year and a

[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.320]
half, I don't. I'm tired of it. I just

[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:33.100]
bought it when it first came. I'm

[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:36.440]
$8,000 upside down and it's saying so. I

[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.120]
said, how can this be so well? These

[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.340]
cars are depreciating rapidly and you

[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.060]
know, there's no market to use cars.

[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.000]
But it's stand that is also you know

[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.820]
that three way buddy booth they got up

[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.380]
there for the office. There must be a lot of

[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:51.280]
condoms on the ground. Take care, Neil.

[01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.700]
OK. What did you just say? I wasn't

[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.600]
paying any attention. You didn't miss

[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.360]
anything. No, what do you say? He was

[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.840]
making fun of the booth and then saying

[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.740]
that his car is $8,000 under the price

[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:07.800]
or whatever. Making fun of whom? Of the

[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.000]
dolphins saying that there's a lot of

[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.060]
the playboost saying there's a lot of

[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:12.360]
condoms in there with a three of them

[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.200]
there. Well, what is that supposed to

[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.160]
mean? That the three of them were playing

[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:22.080]
with each other. Oh, I hope it's carrying

[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.720]
worth four cents. I don't like that. You didn't

[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.440]
miss anything. No, I wasn't paying any

[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.620]
attention. I was printing out some crap.

[01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.040]
No, I could just tell by the general

[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.100]
tenor of the call that it was not going to

[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.080]
be anything I wanted to hear about. Maybe the audience was

[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.960]
interested in that. I doubted. Mahadmogandi is

[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.080]
back again. Did you happen to catch Larry

[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.160]
King last week? I don't watch Larry King. Once in a

[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.760]
while if I'm channel surfing in this interesting

[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.820]
guest, which is almost never I might stay in the

[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.840]
watch a little bit. I don't watch Larry. You know what

[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.520]
I mean? Oh, yeah, I did see this. He had

[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.660]
friend Resheron and kept referring to her as

[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:54.980]
a Randresher over and over again. Yeah. I

[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.400]
used to think this was funny, but now it's just

[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.740]
sad to see someone slowly go senile while on

[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:01.760]
the air. Well, I'm doing it. A Randresher.

[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:04.180]
I read about that someplace else. So I guess

[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.520]
he wasn't reading the prompt or right. It said

[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:09.240]
friend. He read it a Randresher. Well, you know,

[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.740]
when you get an old. Wow.

[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.320]
Here's a list of companies that go bankrupt

[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.860]
2009. Serious is number two. I got it. Thanks

[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:21.580]
already, Mahatma. He says, here's the clip. I know

[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.600]
you don't can't play your against links. I'm not

[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.100]
against links. I don't have time to patch your

[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.740]
route with them. Mahatma doesn't even make candy.

[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.760]
Mahatma candy. I thought that was rice. Oh,

[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.080]
that's right. Mahatma rice is nice. I don't like

[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.280]
rice. I like rice with stuff on it in it, you know.

[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:41.740]
You know what I mean? The rest needs. What do you mean?

[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.780]
That's what I mean because I know. Oh,

[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.200]
gee, I just snotted all over this email. Oh,

[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.360]
Rose. That's okay. It's my own.

[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.820]
Horace is please tell me why your station

[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.440]
would put on two high school games on the

[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.780]
over the weekend. Give me an F and break. Here's

[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:03.080]
hoping that the black guy outside my public

[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.460]
ring in the bell. I'm begging for money for

[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.380]
the salvation army gets hit by lightning. What time

[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.040]
is this make of it's a black guy? It's usually an old

[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:11.260]
a some old Creighton, some old white guy or some

[01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:14.320]
old white lady. So let's spread it around. Black

[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.120]
guys can go out there and PSU always seem to think I'm not a real

[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.120]
person because of my signature. My employer is located in

[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.440]
Georgia, which is an awful God for a second place.

[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.740]
Dawsonville, Georgia. I live in South Florida,

[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.260]
another horrible place. Happy holidays and thanks for 18

[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:31.060]
years. Thank you, Jorge. His employer is in Dawsonville,

[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.260]
Georgia. Oh my God. Right downstream from Aintry.

[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.520]
I was not one of everybody's favorite movies,

[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.020]
Deliverance. You know it was actually on a past week or

[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.860]
something like that. And then that little banjo playing

[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:48.520]
goofball. He just died. Oh, it's going around. That's

[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:51.040]
the Lord. He gives you this. He gives you life and he takes it

[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.300]
away. Engine giver is what he is. As a matter of fact,

[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:58.640]
maybe he's kind of defo. Maybe he's also a. I don't know.

[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.900]
664. What are you going for? 700 800? What? I'm not

[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.020]
going to read it. It's too ponderous reading this,

[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.880]
you know? It's a good poll. You like it? It's fine.

[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:13.060]
Oh, you like it. It's okay. I got the other one.

[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.080]
Eric's got the other one up there loaded and ready to go.

[01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:18.680]
Let me know when you're tired of this one. Well,

[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:22.740]
the New York football giants win Super Bowl.

[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:26.700]
The piss off the dolphin fans. A lot of peeing going on this

[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:34.980]
email. Bring back homo David. What? What does this mean? Well,

[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.880]
I'll print it out during a break. The way things are going today.

[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:39.880]
I'll take anything we can get. You know what I'm saying?

[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.940]
Neil at neorodges.com for your

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.700]
perspicacious emails. And of course for your wonderful

[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.820]
emotional heartfelt holiday wishes to all of us.

[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:56.680]
What about that? The best talent. You don't get new

[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.940]
to the world. This is Mark Morgan. It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q

[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:01.740]
8M.

[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.920]
Well, hang on the tree, but don't give one

[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:22.220]
a knee candy cane. It's a hell of a pain when you

[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:29.020]
need to sell a thing candy cane. I don't

[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:34.160]
suck. I won't suck. I can't suck. Candy cane.

[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:41.260]
Yeah, don't chase down a sweet bunch of good raw

[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.220]
Joe G candy cane.

[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.920]
Well, the season is done.

[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.680]
I can't live. Candy cane.

[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.000]
Candy cane.

[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.720]
1065 series is going to go out of business this coming years

[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.640]
with all the experts are saying, oh, Neil, go over to serious.

[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.660]
That's where you belong on serious. Yeah. All the experts

[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.880]
all the time. You know, some of those people are now

[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.560]
saying, oh, maybe that wouldn't have been such a good idea if they

[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.500]
would have wanted to pay you like 50 cent. Of course not.

[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:27.100]
Which they didn't. I think we're done with the emails.

[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.460]
And of course the calls speak for themselves. You know.

[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.280]
What do you think? Play the rack? Sure. Why not? I was going to play the

[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.800]
rack the whole four hours every day. Because Thursday we're not

[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:40.960]
here. And then Friday. I mean, forget about that.

[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.300]
What's going to be nothing Friday? What? Friday is going to be

[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.760]
a nothing day. What do you mean by that? Everybody's going to be

[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:49.780]
out returning gifts and doing everything else. So I'm over.

[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.680]
I got an email from somebody hung over just a minute ago.

[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.600]
The one I started to read totally in coherent.

[01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:00.940]
About the peeing dolphins and pee off this and pee off a lot of

[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:05.980]
peeing, you know. I guess when you drink that much WQ AM.

[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:09.000]
Hello. Hi there. Yes, sir.

[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.240]
I call to talk about Cincinnati. Bingo.

[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.300]
Third and you know what? But ever call. Don't ever call.

[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.060]
Make that. Make that resolution right now for the New Year.

[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:21.120]
Reverend Puts. Don't ever call us again.

[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.820]
You the boyfriend and of course all your other partners in crime.

[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:30.380]
God is he boring. And does he realize how boring he is? Of course not.

[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:36.280]
WQ AM. Hello. Hello. Yes. Is this no waters? Yes, sir.

[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.480]
Hey, how you doing there? Okay. How many years you on the radio now?

[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:44.280]
Too many. More than 20. Yeah. Okay. So every after 20 years you

[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.080]
got to change it up a little bit. Throw something at the wall. Feel

[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.300]
it sick. You know something like your underwear after a panther's game.

[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.740]
That was um special. Yeah. That wasn't just your ordinary

[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:05.700]
pedestrian every day piece of turd. That was a special turd.

[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:10.460]
Okay. Like I said.

[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.020]
There's a new prescription drug whose name says it all.

[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:20.320]
Zidafax. Finally, a prescription medicine that always gives you

[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.580]
more than you'd expect. Zidafax. Isn't it time you experienced

responsible for the mysterious, postulent growth under your left arm fit.

[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:12.760]
Zidafax! There we go!

[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:25.540]
What they say about Santa Claus is true

[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:33.540]
Without that little dude on Christmas we'd be spooned

[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:43.980]
Oh, Owen, how are we trying to see his reindeer fly?

[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:51.640]
In it could the stilt a season to believe

[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:59.900]
in all of deathness could not you own your butt,

[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:05.400]
recommend that to the hell, give it a try and still do

[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:11.640]
and there's so much to give you can't do it all by yourself.

[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:18.440]
I know Christmas time can be a grind

[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:25.440]
but I think of Santa and his big old fat behind

[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.180]
Rackdom!

[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:38.180]
Oh, Owen, I can't count all the stars that I tried

[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:45.600]
till it's cold, there's still a season to believe

[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:54.080]
I'm so happy this still a season to believe

[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:55.480]
one more time.

[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:03.760]
I'm so happy this still a season to believe

[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.300]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart

[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:18.120]
Trapped on your shoppers, pretty feet

[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.840]
Get out of my way you curvered

[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.240]
It was on the day after Thanksgiving

[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.240]
Poor Grandma didn't know she'd be dead meat

[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.300]
Every year we know we're trapped

[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:30.180]
All she wanted was a player

[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:30.940]
Congratulations!

[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.340]
You ruined Christmas or the DVD she owned

[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.960]
Merry Christmas, kiss my ass

[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.340]
But when those faithful doors swung open

[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:39.080]
What was the moment?

[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:42.060]
She was stepped on and begged up straight to the bone

[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.240]
Grandma's now quite out of action

[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:50.380]
And her hospital she sits

[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:54.320]
After her body is in traction

[01:35:55.300 --> 01:35:58.160]
And she even needs a nurse to take us better

[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:02.320]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart

[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.460]
Even brought

[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:06.460]
Trapped on your shoppers, pretty feet

[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:10.160]
It was on the day after Thanksgiving

[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:14.100]
Poor Grandma didn't know she'd be dead meat

[01:36:15.340 --> 01:36:18.440]
Grandma got run over at the Walmart

[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.440]
Trapped on your shoppers, pretty feet

[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:26.300]
It was on the day after Thanksgiving

[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:30.140]
Poor Grandma didn't know she'd be dead meat

[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.520]
No operator, give me the number for 9-1-1

[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.920]
Merry Christmas everybody, what's your ass?

[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:39.780]
Randolph the Brown knows reindeer

[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:42.980]
You fall, always wound up last in line

[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.800]
That's how he got up around nose

[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.560]
Following to close behind

[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.200]
All of the other reindeer

[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.920]
Love to make him calm and sneeze

[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.400]
They all would stop abruptly

[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.540]
And one of them would cut the cheese

[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:06.140]
One day Randolph got better

[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:09.020]
He said this job stinks

[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:12.900]
Find yourself a new caboose

[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:15.820]
Gave them all a Christmas goose

[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:18.560]
Santa and all the reindeer

[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.660]
Laving at your shot and plea

[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:25.020]
Randolph the Brown knows reindeer

[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:27.460]
You should drive patology

[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:32.460]
Nothing can prepare you for the onslaught

[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.860]
No one slows the relentless pursuit

[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:39.400]
Oh give Daddy a chance to rest, Malthus

[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:44.460]
She's the sixth year old with a Christmas list

[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.940]
And she wants to say, you got to run

[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.020]
Run and she will follow

[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.480]
And she will find you

[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.600]
Find everything on their list

[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.800]
And she will break you

[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:06.340]
The sixth year old with a Christmas list

[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:08.400]
Now showing in homes everywhere

[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:13.960]
No single actor has mastered dialects quite like Sean Cutterie

[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.200]
From his roles in the hunt for red October

[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.080]
I am a Russell Submarine Cups

[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.260]
A Toothy Untouchable

[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.020]
I am a Chicago police bump

[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:28.240]
And now the master of ethnic character acting can teach you his secret techniques at the Sean Cutterie Academy of Accents

[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.460]
Good morning students

[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:32.200]
Today we'll work on sounding French

[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.720]
Repeat after me

[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.120]
Bonjour, would you have any consults, civil play?

[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.740]
Bonjour, would you have any consults, civil play?

[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:41.220]
Well done!

[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.940]
At the Sean Cutterie Academy of Accents, you'll learn the best accent is the one you were born with

[01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:50.180]
Now class, guess what's accident I'm doing this type?

[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:51.900]
A Scottish guy?

[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.860]
Close, that was my Mexican guy

[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.760]
Ah, I'll show you my amigos

[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:03.220]
So whether you want to do a Scottish Chinese accent, a Scottish German, a Scottish Iraqi, or a Scottish rapper

[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:07.280]
I'd like to take this opportunity to give a shout out to all my homies

[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.620]
In role today at the Sean Cutterie Academy of Accents

[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:15.660]
And soon you'll be able to do any accent imaginable as long as it's Scottish

[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:18.760]
What's the biggest name?

[01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:23.540]
The best talent, you'll have no rejects, sport radio 560 QAM

[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:25.360]
The fourth leader

[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.520]
The biggest name, the best talent

[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.600]
It's the mad dog

[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:32.780]
Manage after New Orleans, 4 to 7

[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:35.060]
Sports radio 560 QAM

[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:36.960]
The sports leader

[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.700]
I know that the Lord even loves neo-rodgers

[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:43.560]
Sports the day before Christmas and all through the mall

[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:47.380]
Last minute shoppers were stirring procrastinators all

[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:51.100]
I should have planned ahead just like Santa's elves

[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:55.100]
Now I hope and pray, something's left on the shelves

[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:59.680]
In a panic I run into every last store, the place is a mess

[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:01.780]
Poise all over the floor

[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:05.080]
They've sold out of everything I needed to buy

[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.600]
So I bought my daughter a Barbie

[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:10.440]
That's missing one eye

[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.100]
Next on my list was my poor little wife

[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:18.160]
She wanted a necklace but she's getting steak knives

[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.660]
Because that's all that was left in the store I was in

[01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:24.840]
It was either steak knives or a pair of swim fins

[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.420]
The next thing to get was a gift for my boy

[01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:30.820]
He wanted a brand new video toy

[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:34.320]
But they were all out so I got something better

[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.360]
A pink polyester cardigan sweater

[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.800]
Now mother, now father, now uncles, now aunties

[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.000]
I got them all seen through edible panties

[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.880]
I'm sure that they'll think I'm the world's biggest creep

[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.360]
When they find out I've already lost the receipt

[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.540]
Every year I resolve that I won't let this happen

[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:00.660]
Because it's nearly midnight and I still have to wrap them

[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:05.340]
So at 2 AM I yelled all tired and surly

[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:08.520]
Merry Christmas to you jerks

[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.400]
Who did your shopping early?

[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:12.120]
God for you

[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:21.560]
Alcatam

[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:25.840]
Alcatam

[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:30.820]
Siss them on fire

[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:33.080]
Alcatam

[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.320]
Saw it on the TV

[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:42.240]
The planet more intact

[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:44.980]
Of those laundry heads

[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:47.940]
My office smoking crack

[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:53.400]
I've got a funny feeling

[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.980]
It won't be too inject

[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:03.920]
If we take out all those maniacs

[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.400]
So I'm singing Alcatam

[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:11.580]
Alcatam

[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:21.300]
I'm so damn tired of Alcatam

[01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:25.320]
Blow on my phone, drop on drop on bomb now

[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.140]
Blow on my phone, drop on now

[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.980]
Blow on Alcatam

[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.320]
Anyway

[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:37.960]
Alcatam

[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.100]
Alcatam

[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.880]
Ready, aim, fire

[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.240]
And Alcatam

[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.840]
angry

[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.380]
Entirely

[01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.040]
Come here

[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.000]
Let's this goes

[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.240]
This is a nightmare

[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:27.100]
I had to buy a Cadillac, a pig sticking to the pool.

[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:34.200]
I wish I had more money back, it's not too much good standing still.

[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.500]
Those red heads have a perfect way.

[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:45.680]
Those greedy, shallower sloths, a good deal with the boiled man.

[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:49.540]
And now we're getting robbed.

[01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.720]
Look at these Cadillac prices.

[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.120]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.880]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.280]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:01.980 --> 01:44:03.460]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.160]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:07.660]
His weight, his throat, his power falls.

[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.920]
We could stop this crop to live.

[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:14.680]
Fire up the jet, fight up.

[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:17.780]
And blow those cowards hands away.

[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:21.620]
I ain't no Cadillac prices.

[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.200]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.980]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:28.800]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:34.300]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.320]
Look at these Cadillac prices.

[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.800]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:46.200]
Fossies, hey, right.

[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:52.660]
Silent bark, deadly bark.

[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:53.180]
Sack!

[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:58.600]
It can tear your nose apart.

[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:04.660]
It can't be refut, it can't tell.

[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:11.200]
Someone did it by that awful smell.

[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.980]
What the hell did you eat?

[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:21.260]
It smells just like rotten meat.

[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:22.620]
Absolutely.

[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:28.500]
Silent bark, deadly bark.

[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:34.640]
I cut one and came out.

[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:40.620]
I watched a woman's head swivel all around.

[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:46.440]
She was wearing a terrible crown.

[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:53.020]
I walked right out of that place.

[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:57.780]
With a big smile on my face.

[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:04.600]
Silent bark, deadly bark.

[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:10.800]
Doing it is quiet and arty.

[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.460]
Glad one go, but don't look back.

[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:22.400]
I thought victims of your gas attack.

[01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:27.000]
If you're in church when you do,

[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.920]
you'll have to stay in your pub.

[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:41.520]
In your red blood, it's better to some tea.

[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.500]
I want to know who cut the cheese.

[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.660]
Too bad the old days we could have found a lot of interesting effects in here.

[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:51.980]
Well, I mean, well, we can't do nothing normal.

[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:52.860]
But that's the way it goes.

[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.560]
22 past noon at QAM.

[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.460]
Just helping you through the holidays, that's all.

[01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:58.580]
They're not helping us much.

[01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.260]
$6.99 in the pool when we get to $700.

[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:04.220]
You got $700 yet?

[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:05.280]
Let me check.

[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:06.820]
No.

[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:08.860]
$700.

[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:09.680]
All right.

[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:13.340]
Let me swish the pool before I even read this result.

[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.480]
Biggest winner of 2008.

[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.220]
And I bet you we have some other people added to the list.

[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:22.580]
Sure wasn't Jimmy Cifalus.

[01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:23.220]
I'll tell you that.

[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:27.520]
Besides Barack Obama and Joe Biden,

[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.020]
who is the biggest winner of 2008,

[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:31.740]
and then this must be a Charlie B1.

[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.420]
Tina Fey is on there.

[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:36.160]
Well, she sure fell into a bucket of crap, didn't she?

[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:38.540]
Why?

[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:39.720]
When Sarah came along?

[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:40.340]
Oh, yeah.

[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:43.740]
I mean, that was just fodder for the mill.

[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:44.520]
For your fodder.

[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:48.360]
700 votes on the pool if you could live any time during any time in the US,

[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:52.060]
30 years of age with comfortable means it would be during what period of time.

[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:54.800]
Psych in the last 60s to early 70s, 253.

[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.700]
Want that sex and drugs, man?

[01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:59.200]
Lots of love and lots of drugs.

[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.700]
And lots of good music too, by the way.

[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:08.420]
Today, 115, 2015, 14, roaring 2060,

[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:10.320]
uptight martini swilling,

[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.220]
commy chasing, bombshellering,

[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.740]
1950s to early 60s, 53.

[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:18.120]
The Reagan years, the 80s, 45, the me years.

[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:19.040]
Oh, I got mine.

[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.080]
I got a Rolex and I got this and I got that.

[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.300]
And I'm a selfish son of a bitch in whatever else.

[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:25.400]
That's the Reagan years.

[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:27.940]
But of course, he forgot.

[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:30.240]
Wild, wild, rest, the latter 1836.

[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.700]
Then you can go out and get pissed off at somebody,

[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:35.300]
like living in downtown Miami to shoot him.

[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:38.660]
Like living in Detroit, pissed off, shoot somebody.

[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.740]
Gain 90s, 15.

[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:42.940]
15 people would rather live in the 90s.

[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.000]
They probably live in the, uh, gay, present.

[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:49.600]
And the gold rush, 1858, the gold rush.

[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.420]
Now, did you ever see that movie?

[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.620]
By the way, there will be blood.

[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.820]
No, thankfully, apparently, what I've here.

[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:56.620]
Let me warn you, don't do it.

[01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:59.080]
Your eyes will bleed.

[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.460]
That's how bad that movie is.

[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.700]
Your eyes will bleed from the pain.

[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.900]
They will be blood.

[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.020]
Another pseudo-electual piece of third.

[01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:12.160]
Okay, here's the new poll besides Obamac by who is the biggest winner of 2008.

[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.500]
We got Michael Phelps under.

[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.140]
He is from another planet, you know?

[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:16.940]
He's a great swimmer, but he's strange.

[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.300]
He is, isn't he?

[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:18.700]
Yep.

[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:20.040]
Something about him.

[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:20.940]
He's just, I don't know.

[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:23.240]
NBA Champion Boston, Salis.

[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:24.580]
Too much sports stuff on here.

[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.320]
Super Bowl Champ, New York Giants.

[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:28.080]
Wimbledon Champ, Rafi Elnadeau.

[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:29.000]
He's also strange.

[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.440]
Wimbledon Champ, Venus Williams.

[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:32.860]
Venus with the penis.

[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:34.800]
US Open Champ Tiger Woods.

[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:35.820]
See how many sports things?

[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.180]
World Series Champ, the Filth and Alphia Phillies.

[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:40.380]
Stanley Cup Champ, Detroit Red Wings.

[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.380]
Screw them.

[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:42.640]
Best to ask you a winner.

[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:43.640]
No country for old men.

[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:44.700]
That's another piece of third.

[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.360]
And I still don't know what it's all about.

[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:48.640]
I can, did you see that?

[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:49.700]
No.

[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:50.580]
Don't.

[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:51.900]
Right there.

[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.320]
You're saving your eyesight with two.

[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.660]
About five hours of crap.

[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:59.840]
Can I enter Hillary, under consultation prize and, and cabinet job.

[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.120]
Sarah Palin going from obscurity to fame.

[01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:05.780]
McCain winning the GOP nomination or Tina Fey.

[01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:07.060]
I'm putting Tina Fey.

[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.020]
Something else, but we don't have Brock on here.

[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:14.200]
It says besides Obama and you know, I totally skipped it.

[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:15.140]
Oh my god.

[01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:15.780]
Did I hear you?

[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:17.240]
I'm just following the believability show.

[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.080]
This is the biggest name.

[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.420]
The best talent for his new Roger.

[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:21.860]

[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:22.240]
Fourth, right?

[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:23.040]
You'll find me.

[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.040]
I'm on fourth.

[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:25.660]
Leader.

[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.360]
So take your name.

[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:28.580]
The best talent.

[01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.060]
It's the G.N. Joe.

[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.420]
Wing Knights from A to L.M.

[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:31.920]
And here on.

[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:32.600]
Fourth, right?

[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.280]
You'll find me.

[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:33.480]
Six feet.

[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.580]
You'll find me.

[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.380]
The sports here.

[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:37.640]
Floridians.

[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:39.000]
Dunn as dirt.

[01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.920]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.640]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.320]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:04.320]

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:04.320]

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:04.320]

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:04.320]

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:04.320]

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:04.320]

[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:04.480]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:04.480]

[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.280]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:05.400]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:05.400]

[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:05.900]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:09.440]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:12.080]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:14.660]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:15.240]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.320]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:16.720]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:17.220]
I'm on the street.

[01:51:27.580 --> 01:51:28.740]
Thou hast not far managed.

[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:28.740]

[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:29.920]
I'm on my street.

[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:31.560]
I'm on my street.

[01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:32.420]
I get tired of my home Development.

[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:33.620]
I took my home to UmaWatchman.

[01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:33.620]

[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.620]
I want to play.

[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:34.980]
Extraordinary I get tired of my homeimentos.

[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:34.980]

[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:34.980]

[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:35.180]
It's not gone without me.

[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.320]
My own freedom is taking care of me.

[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:41.140]
So I feel like taking care of you.

[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:41.140]

[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:41.140]

[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:42.620]
You're a great actor.

[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.320]
You're a great actor.

[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:46.080]
Aessie Theme Girls.

[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.200]
Aessie Theme Girls.

[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:47.200]

[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.480]
I wanna spin my life loving you

[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:23.960]
And lift my tongue or a part

[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:26.020]
We just want love too

[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.420]
And when it's time to head south and rest

[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.560]
I wanna go where the living goes the best

[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:38.780]
I wanna die

[01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:43.580]
It's what I want

[01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:46.460]
I wanna die

[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:49.300]
It's what I want

[01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:50.940]
It's what I want

[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:54.400]
I wanna die

I wanna go where the living goes the best

[01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:59.080]
I wanna die

[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:10.960]
I wanna go where the living goes

[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.460]
Singra, singra, fast

[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.140]
We're hard to decide for

[01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:16.920]
Cause we are so high for

[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:18.420]
Catch us if you can

[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:20.500]
Singra, singra, fast

[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:22.180]
Our vocal quidness

[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:23.840]
Gives you motion sickness

[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.340]
Cause we sing so just to get my lips

[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:27.000]
The re blur

[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:27.900]
When I sing

[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:29.820]
Can't make out a thing

[01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:31.460]
All the notes that I hit

[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:33.200]
Make the sonic boom

[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.040]
Cause they go

[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.120]
Stick it in the slid

[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.800]
The way this song came out

[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.320]
Make it seem like our own caffeine

[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.180]
Some might say the way

[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:42.080]
That we sing is a joke

[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:45.460]
But it's not funny when my tongue starts to smoke

[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:47.280]
And we're just warm enough

[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.200]
Check it out

[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.140]
Here we go

[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:50.800]
If you hold onto your hat

[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.640]
What about the singra, fast

[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:53.820]
Cause if it's a hard one

[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:54.600]
We'll be fine

[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:56.420]
Might as a line if you blink a rhyme

[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.040]
Bet you'll never bother to think so fast

[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.720]
Grab a mic and we hit the gas

[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.280]
Yeah, this part goes so rapidly

[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:03.480]
Take a mouth to soak with faith

[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:05.040]
The re we sing is quite a good

[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.340]
But all's hard to talk and do my tunes

[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.520]
Singra, fast, singra, fast

[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.820]
You are to decide

[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.860]
But cause we are so hyper

[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.420]
Catch us if we pay

[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.500]
In real fast, singra, fast

[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.220]
Our vocal quidness

[01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:19.880]
Gives you motion sickness

[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:21.460]
Cause we sing so fast

[01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:23.580]
In real fast, singra, fast

[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:24.880]
You are to decide

[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:26.560]
Cause we are so fast

[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.340]
He would never say

[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.720]
What made it read

[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.320]
Oh why his nose was bigger

[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.580]
Than his head

[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.960]
When he switched it on

[01:54:55.960 --> 01:55:00.880]
You was like a midnight sun

[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:03.060]
See it glow

[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.940]
Right through the snow

[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:16.680]
Goodbye, we're the brave deer

[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.040]
We will miss your Christmas light

[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:26.180]
Hope those chit-plates don't stop you here

[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:28.900]
With Santa's eyes of kite

[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:30.460]
You're fairy

[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:34.400]
One day you wondered too far

[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:36.680]
From the snow

[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:43.660]
That's when a guy in flannel

[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.440]
You hear the wave

[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:53.520]
Now he's in repose

[01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:58.180]
You can see that his

[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:00.640]
Humanist nose

[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:05.700]
No longer glows

[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:13.780]
Goodbye, good off-ranging

[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:18.800]
Hunting season came to soon

[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:23.800]
Now your head is self-demounted

[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.760]
In somebody's recrooch

[01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:36.200]
Welcome

[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:44.760]
You depressed me

[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:49.560]
You say I'm right and then you always second-guess me

[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:55.000]
You feel so water left down

[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:01.240]
You call my hand before I even get my back down

[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:09.200]
And when I'm always on the make

[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:14.680]
You seem to get a bad wedded

[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:18.200]
You and you do depressed me

[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:23.620]
So why am I in love with you

[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:28.960]
Oh

[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:29.960]
In a kitchen

[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:32.720]
Never thought

[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:34.520]
Re-course meals so

[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.080]
With your vision

[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:41.600]
When there's trouble

[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.880]
I can count on you

[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:48.420]
To lead me on the lullaby

[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:53.320]
When I see you

[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:56.140]

He's got a barf bag

[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:26.020]
In case he gets sick he's had too much milk

[02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:30.100]
And all those cookies too

Here's a list of people who are fed up

[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:08.920]
It is rather long

[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:16.240]
And a furlough pass and her fanculeo

[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:21.420]
Sweetly changed the station when the song's on the radio

Sing along its dream

They don't think it's funny

[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.820]
You're a man

[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:06.480]
You're a man

[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:12.480]
You're a man

[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:16.480]
You're a man

[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:19.400]
Hey don't forget that

[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:20.840]
Okay try not to

[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:22.960]
How do you like the selection so far?

[02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:24.720]
Pretty good couple of them hadn't heard before

[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:26.960]
Many of my even I haven't heard before

[02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:29.800]
Can you believe that?

[02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:32.520]
Sure there's a lot of them out there

[02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:35.460]
Of this ACN thing I bet like eight million discs

[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:37.600]
Sounds good for the rest of the week

[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:39.740]
In fact sounds good for the next five years

[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:40.720]
Oh yeah

[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:46.620]
How long before you think I'd be getting a call saying

[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:50.740]
Well you know when you're a lot of money you know how you do is sit there and play the rack every day

[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:51.340]
What do you think?

[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:56.180]
Hmm now the thing of it is I was just thinking during the last segment

[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.020]
We certainly couldn't drive the numbers much lower than they are right now

[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:04.840]
I mean in this station you can't complain about the ratings of QM because we don't have any

[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:05.880]
We used to

[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.400]
And then long came jolly joe

[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:11.500]
That would be a good bit for a chicken neck to the tune of a long came Mary

[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:15.900]
A long came jolly joe and just drove us

[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:19.480]
Or maybe the night they drove the ratings down by a Joan Baez

[02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:20.900]
Remember that?

[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:22.480]
No

[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.640]
Don't remember the night they drove old XC down?

[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:27.180]
Nope

[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:28.720]
I mean I heard it maybe

[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:29.360]
What?

[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:31.620]
Even if I heard it but not off top of my head now

[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:34.660]
Well we got that Dan Quill but I played it just the other day wait a minute

[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.480]
The night they drove

[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:39.360]
Um

[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:40.840]
Is it under coil?

[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.660]
Or maybe it's under Murphy Brown

[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:44.960]
I bet you it's under Murphy Brown

[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:45.760]
There it is

[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:48.840]
She had herself a kid with that ain't it

[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.280]
I don't know what it's under

[02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.040]
I'll sing it to you later on

[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:57.880]

[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:17.720]
Oh I mean that that's getting a little bit carried away isn't it

[02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:24.040]
Flying to South Florida to see if my show is on the year I mean I appreciate the compliment but boy that that is suction so heavy duty

[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:29.060]

Well he's not a frog but he lives with him in Montreal

[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:35.980]
Don't go to Montreal by the way

[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:37.320]
You've been there?

[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.060]

[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:04.240]

You want fries with that?

[02:18:50.250 --> 02:18:52.090]
It's ridiculous.

[02:19:22.490 --> 02:19:29.550]
Fives call a GX. Yes, Michael performs all of his greatest hits from oldies with the Jackson 5.

[02:19:29.890 --> 02:19:38.330]
Stand up in the ABCs. I'm gandown on my knees. Removing the dumb girl race. ABC, sat on me.

That's right. From the timeless tunes of the Jackson 5 to the classic filler work, Michael Jackson's benefits who are aims to please.

[02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:52.190]
The people I surround my soul, proof of you've been niled. Some call me big brother, some are better.

[02:19:52.450 --> 02:19:55.090]
Files, and there's no one to defy a lie.

[02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:58.430]
Just sit for a while and beat it, beat it, beat it.

[02:19:58.510 --> 02:19:59.530]

[02:20:00.010 --> 02:20:01.890]
I hate beat it, beat it, beat it.

[02:20:01.970 --> 02:20:03.090]
Michael Jackson.

[02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:10.510]
Sometimes I'm so depressed that I just sit around so can wait and pull a call from a call you call again.

[02:20:10.510 --> 02:20:15.550]
When I'm home alone, sitting naked by the phone, I beat it, beat it.

[02:20:15.550 --> 02:20:23.230]
And be one of the five lucky boys to receive backstage passes to hang out in Michael Jackson's dressing room.

[02:20:23.390 --> 02:20:24.970]
Michael Jackson's benefits.

[02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:28.390]
Hey, yeah, Michael. Yes, Bobby.

[02:20:28.930 --> 02:20:30.790]
Is that your real skin color?

[02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:33.290]
It's inside with counts.

[02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:36.210]
But I know a game that we can play to find out.

[02:20:36.210 --> 02:20:39.850]
And if you fly, you know, it's kind of free willy.

[02:20:40.210 --> 02:20:46.830]
Say, say, say what you want, but you know who I give affection.

[02:20:46.990 --> 02:20:54.150]
I may don't know how to read, but then don't always give me your action.

[02:20:54.350 --> 02:20:58.310]
And here's the rousing finale. Yes, Michael sings the song he wrote for the show, Under the World.

[02:20:58.530 --> 02:21:01.290]
With the Vienna voice choir backing him up.

[02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:03.290]
I don't like girls.

[02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:04.950]
You're fair.

[02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:07.310]
I like me children.

[02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:12.950]
They are the ones who turn me on and hate.

[02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:15.190]
I hope they're willing.

[02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:20.290]
It's a choice of making.

[02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:27.010]
I like school very nice, but it's true.

[02:21:27.370 --> 02:21:31.450]
They make the greatest thing when they just fight.

[02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:34.370]
Here are other great Michael Jackson classics.

[02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:36.230]
Like Billy's James.

[02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:39.270]
And of course smooth criminal.

[02:21:39.610 --> 02:21:43.890]
Just Michael Jackson's tour to benefit the cargo classy school for wayward boys.

[02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:48.230]

[02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:50.390]
They're white. They're real. They're real.

[02:21:50.730 --> 02:21:53.030]
They're black. They're white.

[02:21:53.450 --> 02:21:54.450]
They're real. They're real.

[02:21:55.230 --> 02:21:55.950]
What are you guys?

[02:21:56.010 --> 02:21:58.410]
You got some disturbing MJ news coming in a second.

[02:21:58.410 --> 02:21:59.450]
Although before that.

[02:22:00.130 --> 02:22:01.570]
Kenny Raymer, you're really slipping.

[02:22:01.570 --> 02:22:03.630]
I appreciate it. I guess he's trying to help me out.

[02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:04.590]
You know, sending me some crap.

[02:22:05.350 --> 02:22:07.790]
Because it's, you know, it's so close to Christmas day, man.

[02:22:08.090 --> 02:22:09.610]
They're in not a creature is stirring.

[02:22:10.110 --> 02:22:11.090]
Not even a laus.

[02:22:12.210 --> 02:22:14.450]
He sends me this story that we had on Friday.

[02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:17.810]
No less police suspicious wife who demands to smell husbands,

[02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:20.050]
generals, beaten in port St. Lucie, remember that?

[02:22:20.610 --> 02:22:21.350]
Yes, I do.

[02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:26.330]
She wanted to smell his penis to determine whether he was cheating with another woman.

[02:22:27.930 --> 02:22:29.570]
And he beat the crap out of her.

[02:22:30.010 --> 02:22:31.710]
Don't be sniffing my goods, bitch.

[02:22:32.930 --> 02:22:34.910]
Anyway, you want to hear the Michael Jackson disturbing news?

[02:22:35.130 --> 02:22:35.290]
Sure.

[02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:40.650]
Michael Jackson is suffering from a rare lung condition needs to undergo a transplant

[02:22:40.650 --> 02:22:43.050]
a biographer of King of Pop tells the London newspaper.

[02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:48.610]
He may even be fighting for his life author Ian Halperin tells in Touch magazine

[02:22:48.610 --> 02:22:50.510]
and the British Sunday Express newspaper.

[02:22:51.290 --> 02:22:53.030]
Halperin is just completing the biography of the singer.

[02:22:53.350 --> 02:22:57.110]
He says Jackson has been diagnosed with alpha-1 antitripsin deficiency

[02:22:57.110 --> 02:23:00.310]
and occasionally fatal genetic condition.

[02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:03.710]
He's had it for years, but it's gotten worse Halperin told in touch.

[02:23:03.910 --> 02:23:06.310]
He needs a lung transplant, but maybe two weeks to go through with it.

[02:23:06.750 --> 02:23:10.410]
He also has emphysema and chronic gastrointestinal intestinal...what is it?

[02:23:10.930 --> 02:23:13.350]
Gastrointestinal bleeding, which is Dr. Isavade-Loud of trouble stopping.

[02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:15.610]
It's the bleeding that's the most problematic part.

[02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:17.170]
It could kill him.

[02:23:17.170 --> 02:23:17.850]
Oh my God.

[02:23:18.250 --> 02:23:19.290]
Oh my God.

[02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.790]
Oh my God.

[02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:22.710]
According to Halperin, Jackson can barely speak and is having trouble seeing.

[02:23:23.170 --> 02:23:25.130]
The vision in his left eye is 95% gone.

[02:23:26.410 --> 02:23:28.570]
Jackson's spokesman was unavailable for comments on it,

[02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:32.150]
but the singer's brother, Germain, didn't deny the report telling Fox News

[02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:35.270]
he's not doing so well now. This isn't a good time.

[02:23:36.650 --> 02:23:39.190]
Well, let's see. He's almost blind in one eye. He needs a kidney.

[02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:44.410]
And he's got emphysema and chronic bleeding, but other than that, it's eight of good time.

[02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:48.510]
What a master of understatement that Germain, huh?

[02:23:49.850 --> 02:23:52.090]
You think his comments were germane to the situation?

[02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:54.350]
So look at that pole, Mr. Fat.

[02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:57.590]
I think we've done okay today. I think, you know,

[02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:58.990]
although what's going to happen to rest of the week?

[02:23:59.450 --> 02:24:00.190]
I guess we'll have to see.

[02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:03.070]
Well, I got a lot of stuff we haven't ever played.

[02:24:04.690 --> 02:24:07.250]
I mean, one week out of the year, what's wrong with playing the rack?

[02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:09.430]
Plus it's tomorrow Wednesday, then Thursday's Christmas day.

[02:24:09.430 --> 02:24:11.790]
We're off and then Friday. Oh, forget about it.

[02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:18.290]
Friday, the sounds of silence 110 and 114.

[02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:21.210]
Sounds like 117 or 704 sounds like 815 to me.

[02:24:21.430 --> 02:24:22.050]
Yes, it does.

[02:24:22.350 --> 02:24:24.790]
We did it. I think we can get that out of here.

[02:24:24.970 --> 02:24:25.990]
The biggest name.

[02:24:26.250 --> 02:24:27.090]
The best talent.

[02:24:27.370 --> 02:24:30.070]
You know, his new projects, 480 or 560 QAM.

[02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:32.670]
The fourth leader.

[02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:38.050]
Wonderful WQA.

[02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:41.070]
What face?

[02:24:49.130 --> 02:24:50.930]
It's always something.

[02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:54.650]
It's always something.

[02:24:54.650 --> 02:24:54.870]
It's always something.

[02:24:55.170 --> 02:24:56.890]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:24:57.890 --> 02:25:03.030]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:10.830]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:10.830 --> 02:25:12.830]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:12.910 --> 02:25:16.890]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:16.890 --> 02:25:18.890]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:18.890 --> 02:25:19.830]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.830]

[02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:22.610]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:26.870]
It makes something out of nothing.

[02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:29.490]
I can't even...

[02:25:58.310 --> 02:26:03.510]
I can't even...

[02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:56.850]

[02:28:58.090 --> 02:28:58.090]

[02:28:58.090 --> 02:28:58.090]

[02:28:58.090 --> 02:28:58.090]

[02:28:58.090 --> 02:28:58.090]

[02:28:58.090 --> 02:28:58.090]

[02:28:58.090 --> 02:28:58.090]

[02:28:58.090 --> 02:28:59.310]
If you wanna make it world,

[02:28:59.590 --> 02:29:03.570]
then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world, then make it world-

[02:29:03.570 --> 02:29:24.350]
The thing that I'm out of change for once in my life

[02:29:25.450 --> 02:29:26.570]
the things that I'm out of change for once in my life

[02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:33.330]
She'd a panda head put up the laundry to tomorrow night

[02:29:35.730 --> 02:29:43.590]
And I wanted some melancholy so I can be by the mother-in-law

[02:29:44.770 --> 02:29:49.390]
I put my car on the street with a minute to feed

[02:29:49.390 --> 02:29:54.490]
And let the king should have seen the used up of a ginger leaf

[02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:59.830]
She'd have realized then she'd have broke her tent

[02:30:00.490 --> 02:30:07.870]
She'd have known that there'd be a tofu on the way back home

[02:30:08.490 --> 02:30:14.070]
But I got nowhere to go that's why I'm asking you, Joe

[02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:17.590]
I'm talking to the land in the tofu

[02:30:18.470 --> 02:30:21.930]
I can hear from my sunshine

[02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:26.870]
But he and her, look but I just want you

[02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:31.570]
If you want to press a fridge use the other link or this link only at that

[02:30:31.570 --> 02:30:33.090]
J-D-U

[02:30:33.090 --> 02:30:36.150]
Leaving with the land in the tofu

[02:30:37.330 --> 02:30:40.690]
I'm begging him to write from time

[02:30:40.690 --> 02:30:45.590]
But he and those look how I just told you

[02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:47.890]
No, he got away, he got through another lane

[02:30:47.890 --> 02:30:51.310]
If you can't go up with a slagginger slayer leg

[02:30:51.310 --> 02:30:55.670]
And I'm out of the dark I have possibly all I need is a dime

[02:30:55.670 --> 02:31:00.290]
A dime, a dime, a dime, a dime

[02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:03.770]
Come on, someone, hey Joe

[02:31:03.770 --> 02:31:07.450]
A dime, a dime, come on

[02:31:07.450 --> 02:31:10.890]
Come on, a dime, a dime

[02:31:11.490 --> 02:31:12.890]
It makes a change

[02:31:16.050 --> 02:31:20.130]
Tonight on Extra, it's the Michael Jackson Rabbi Schmooly tapes

[02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:22.890]
So what you're telling me is that you can't live without data thoughts

[02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:24.890]
I cannot live without him

[02:31:25.450 --> 02:31:30.190]
It's you told me right now that Michael you could live it

[02:31:30.190 --> 02:31:32.330]
It's okay Michael, I would come home

[02:31:32.330 --> 02:31:36.070]
I swear because I have nothing else left for

[02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:37.950]
You got bubbles, he's a nice chimp

[02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:39.230]
And he can be my queen

[02:31:39.230 --> 02:31:42.390]
Be your friend, does that mean that I can't take record our phone conversations?

[02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:47.450]
Return to Santa

[02:31:49.350 --> 02:31:51.150]
Return to Santa

[02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:55.350]
I got a sweater from my grandma

[02:31:56.330 --> 02:31:58.730]
It was pink and black

[02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:03.470]
But don't worry, be a happy girl

[02:32:03.470 --> 02:32:06.070]
Was printed on the bench

[02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:07.550]
He wrote a pocket

[02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:09.910]
Return to Santa

[02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:13.830]
Just send me cash

[02:32:15.070 --> 02:32:17.770]
Your tank is wet

[02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:21.310]
Okay, me or Ash

[02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:26.070]
I got a fruit cake and some plant plants

[02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:28.850]
Where it's lit before my nose

[02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:33.130]
Another bottle of old spice

[02:32:33.130 --> 02:32:36.130]
For a dead iron hose

[02:32:36.130 --> 02:32:37.630]
He wrote a fondant

[02:32:37.630 --> 02:32:39.770]
Return to Santa

[02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:40.710]
Huh?

[02:32:41.650 --> 02:32:43.490]
Who needs this job?

[02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:47.410]
This is Christmas

[02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:50.810]
A real Easter

[02:32:50.810 --> 02:32:52.590]
He wrote a fondant

[02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:54.870]
Return to Santa

[02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:58.670]
Don't mean to be rude

[02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:02.330]
What is Christmas?

[02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:06.350]
I got scruched

[02:33:06.350 --> 02:33:09.770]
Return to Santa

[02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:13.670]
Return to Santa

[02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:27.130]
Heart of the early days of the day

[02:33:27.130 --> 02:33:30.270]
For he told her new morning

[02:33:31.130 --> 02:33:34.830]
Who'd believe her heaven said

[02:33:34.830 --> 02:33:38.950]
With their speech impediment

[02:33:38.950 --> 02:33:43.290]
Christmas joy, their belly braining

[02:33:43.290 --> 02:33:47.190]
Carol's food and nose as singing

[02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:51.110]
Jesus truly did us wrong

[02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:55.230]
When he made the same dress song

[02:33:55.230 --> 02:33:57.650]
When he made the hair lift

[02:33:57.650 --> 02:33:59.630]
They'd tell sing

[02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:03.710]
For me, those are new morning

[02:34:05.730 --> 02:34:07.050]
What's his name?

[02:34:07.330 --> 02:34:08.150]
The best talent

[02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:09.450]
You know his new reject

[02:34:09.450 --> 02:34:11.370]
4th leg of 5.60 km

[02:34:11.370 --> 02:34:13.690]
I think 4th leader

[02:34:13.690 --> 02:34:15.410]
Oh another star rejoin

[02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:17.030]
New

[02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:33.790]
Yeah

[02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:47.010]
I don't work hard

[02:34:52.470 --> 02:34:54.350]
I don't work hard

[02:34:54.350 --> 02:34:54.350]

[02:34:54.350 --> 02:34:54.350]

[02:34:54.350 --> 02:34:54.350]

[02:34:54.350 --> 02:34:54.390]
I don't work hard

[02:34:54.390 --> 02:34:55.090]
I don't work hard

[02:34:55.090 --> 02:34:56.610]
I don't work hard

[02:34:56.610 --> 02:34:56.610]

[02:34:56.610 --> 02:35:00.910]
I don't work hard

[02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:05.210]
I don't work hard

[02:35:05.210 --> 02:35:05.870]
I don't work hard

[02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:06.890]
I don't work hard

[02:35:06.890 --> 02:35:07.890]
I don't work hard

[02:35:07.890 --> 02:35:15.230]
I don't work hard

[02:35:15.230 --> 02:35:16.010]
I don't work hard

[02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:16.010]

[02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:16.010]

[02:35:16.010 --> 02:35:17.770]
And drinking Billy Beer

[02:35:17.770 --> 02:35:21.850]
A bomb fly

[02:35:23.170 --> 02:35:26.950]
A bomb fly

[02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:28.450]
Smoke and drink

[02:35:28.450 --> 02:35:30.150]
Cause we're all gonna die

[02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:32.350]
Shed it here for peace

[02:35:32.350 --> 02:35:35.110]
Because we all are gonna die

[02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:37.150]
Were you dumb enough to think

[02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:39.230]
One day we'd all become allies

[02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:48.750]
One, two, three, four, more bombs drop.

[02:35:48.890 --> 02:35:51.590]
Five, six, seven, eight, more bombs drop.

[02:35:52.050 --> 02:35:54.470]
Nineteen, eleven, twelve, more bombs drop.

[02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:55.970]
We're gonna drop in the bomb.

[02:35:56.310 --> 02:36:00.130]
Around the clock, we're gonna drop them bombs and make them dead.

[02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:02.990]
Loan that rag right off their head.

[02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:05.810]
We're gonna bomb around the clock tonight.

[02:36:06.110 --> 02:36:08.750]
We're gonna bomb, bomb, bomb, knock out their lights.

[02:36:08.970 --> 02:36:12.270]
We're gonna bomb, gonna bomb around the clock tonight.

[02:36:12.270 --> 02:36:14.410]
Oh, right.

[02:36:15.870 --> 02:36:18.550]
I can't believe it's gonna go.

[02:36:19.210 --> 02:36:21.630]
I can't believe it's gonna go.

[02:36:22.370 --> 02:36:24.330]
I can't believe it's gonna go.

[02:36:24.330 --> 02:36:26.890]
I can't believe it's gonna go.

[02:36:26.890 --> 02:36:31.650]
I can't believe it's gonna go.

[02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:34.590]
Here's a real bomb, so have a blast.

[02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:35.830]
We're gonna shut up, Pat.

[02:36:36.030 --> 02:36:37.550]
I'll up your ass.

[02:36:37.690 --> 02:36:40.310]
We're gonna bomb around the clock tonight.

[02:36:40.310 --> 02:36:43.290]
We're gonna bomb, bomb, bomb, knock out their lights.

[02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:46.910]
We're gonna bomb, gonna bomb around the clock tonight.

[02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:51.510]
I can't believe it's gonna stop the bomb.

[02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:52.870]
It's gonna be crazy.

[02:37:05.310 --> 02:37:06.450]
No startups hiding.

[02:37:07.450 --> 02:37:09.330]
A lot more than guns.

[02:37:10.610 --> 02:37:12.230]
They say they're weapons.

[02:37:13.210 --> 02:37:14.250]
A mass destruction.

[02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:20.710]
I say recently, a couple megatons.

[02:37:21.310 --> 02:37:22.390]
Bomb me a rock.

[02:37:28.250 --> 02:37:31.970]
In the Gulf War, letting them off the hook.

[02:37:33.550 --> 02:37:37.770]
I think it's time to give this butter wool.

[02:37:39.430 --> 02:37:45.470]
So it's time to load those B ones up on their rock.

[02:37:49.090 --> 02:37:51.330]
On your rock.

[02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:57.370]
Till there's nothing left to see on your rock.

[02:37:58.610 --> 02:38:01.430]
Till Saturn 6BD.

[02:38:01.810 --> 02:38:02.870]
Bomb me a rock.

[02:38:04.850 --> 02:38:06.350]
Blow up the cream.

[02:38:07.570 --> 02:38:09.370]
Bomb me a rock.

[02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:15.830]
And that's me, it's got some junk.

[02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:18.350]
And chemicals that burn.

[02:38:18.850 --> 02:38:21.270]
And I love them up on scours.

[02:38:24.330 --> 02:38:29.670]
If we land, we're gonna be wet.

[02:38:30.290 --> 02:38:34.310]
Because this planet is clouds won't be dust.

[02:38:36.330 --> 02:38:37.610]
I'm here up.

[02:38:39.390 --> 02:38:41.530]
Bring it to an end.

[02:38:42.330 --> 02:38:43.290]
I'm here up.

[02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:47.130]
Blow it up again.

[02:38:48.070 --> 02:38:49.090]
I'm here up.

[02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:52.690]
I'm on scours.

[02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:54.710]
I'm here up.

[02:38:55.110 --> 02:38:55.910]
Absolutely.

[02:38:59.030 --> 02:39:00.690]
Bomb me a rock.

[02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:04.750]
I'm toast to the people.

[02:39:05.710 --> 02:39:06.450]
Bomb me a rock.

[02:39:08.270 --> 02:39:10.590]
I'm here to take them home.

[02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:12.270]
Bomb me a rock.

[02:39:13.970 --> 02:39:16.050]
The heart of the world.

[02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:23.290]
I wanna bomb a summer.

[02:39:24.010 --> 02:39:26.190]
I wanna bomb a summer.

[02:39:26.190 --> 02:39:27.730]
They took it to age.

[02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:30.550]
Bomb a summer.

[02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:33.550]
Bomb a summer.

[02:39:34.370 --> 02:39:36.930]
I wanna lose those diamonds.

[02:39:37.690 --> 02:39:39.610]
Should a tower fill the city?

[02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:41.570]
You better run faster.

[02:39:42.490 --> 02:39:44.470]
You go up and faster.

[02:39:45.210 --> 02:39:46.390]
We will not turn.

[02:39:47.090 --> 02:39:48.190]
We will not falter.

[02:39:48.690 --> 02:39:49.990]
And we will not fail.

[02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:51.950]
Bomb a summer.

[02:39:53.010 --> 02:39:54.690]
Bomb a summer.

[02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:56.110]
Wanted.

[02:39:56.590 --> 02:39:57.550]
Dead or alive.

[02:39:59.910 --> 02:40:03.370]
All I can tell you is that Osama Benlana is a prime suspect.

[02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:05.050]
America wants him brought to justice.

[02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:06.030]
That's what we want.

[02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:08.150]
We're gonna find those for the tactile country.

[02:40:08.450 --> 02:40:09.570]
And we're gonna hold them accountable.

[02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:11.230]
The men and women who wear uniforms.

[02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:14.550]
Love, activity, and reservists, and national guard people.

[02:40:14.990 --> 02:40:18.310]
Are ready to respond to the call of the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of Defense.

[02:40:18.310 --> 02:40:19.530]
Make no mistake about it.

[02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:23.250]
I want justice to get them running and to find them and to hunt them down.

[02:40:23.390 --> 02:40:24.270]
But we're gonna smoke them out.

[02:40:24.350 --> 02:40:27.870]
The U.S. military is ready to defend freedom at any cost.

[02:40:28.170 --> 02:40:32.290]
They used to put out there in the old west by water posters that wanted dead or alive.

[02:40:32.510 --> 02:40:35.170]
This is a fight to say to the freedom-loving people of the world.

[02:40:35.310 --> 02:40:37.810]
We will not allow ourselves to be terrorized.

[02:40:37.950 --> 02:40:43.270]
Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to your enemies, justice will be done.

[02:40:43.270 --> 02:40:49.270]
The entire world has seen for itself the state of our union, and it is strong.

[02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:51.210]
I want a bomb of Zalma!

[02:40:51.350 --> 02:40:52.830]
Make no mistake about it.

[02:40:52.850 --> 02:40:55.590]
I want a bomb of Zalma back to the wave.

[02:40:56.590 --> 02:40:58.810]
I want a bomb of Zalma.

[02:40:59.710 --> 02:41:01.930]
I want a bomb of Zalma.

[02:41:02.370 --> 02:41:04.930]
I want a new group of Zalma.

[02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:08.270]
It is a bomb of Zalma.

[02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:11.770]

Let's turn them into charcoal

[02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:27.550]

Bum to dog bum bum bum bum to dog

On their ass, loser ass away, you two retaliate.

[02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:42.190]
And wipe that smile of the camel,

[02:42:42.350 --> 02:42:47.450]
John says, on their ass, on their ass, on their ass.

[02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:50.690]
On their ass, on their ass, we're fed up with the draft.

[02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:55.770]
In a start, we gain a battle, on their ass, on their ass.

[02:42:56.170 --> 02:42:58.770]
Give them what they want, leave the greasy spot.

[02:42:59.250 --> 02:43:01.190]
Send them up to be with Cooke the prey.

[02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:06.110]
Give them all the rage, on their ass, they're brave.

[02:43:07.170 --> 02:43:09.970]
On their ass, loser, they're trepid.

[02:43:10.310 --> 02:43:13.250]
In a start, we gain a battle, on their ass, on, on.

[02:43:13.490 --> 02:43:19.890]
On their ass, on their ass, on their ass, on their ass.

On their ass, on their ass, on their ass, on their ass, on their ass.

What biggest name?

[02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:27.270]
The best outstreet.

[02:43:27.270 --> 02:43:28.490]
There's no Rajas.

[02:43:28.490 --> 02:43:32.490]
Fort Radio 560 QAM, the Fourth Leader.

[02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:37.210]
The poof, the biggest names, the best talent, it's the madard.

[02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:46.090]
Jam Mandage, Jam Mandage, Jam Prenouge, Fort Radio 560 QAM, the Sports Leader.

[02:43:46.510 --> 02:43:47.870]
The physical fact in the church.

[02:43:51.450 --> 02:43:55.850]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded

[02:43:55.850 --> 02:44:00.290]
to dominate people killed with the gas that we sold him.

[02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:04.190]
First time aggressor nation and the only one that's going.

[02:44:04.670 --> 02:44:08.590]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:19.970]
Forget about Korea and the nooks they're totem and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our head.

[02:44:20.970 --> 02:44:26.390]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:44:37.970 --> 02:44:41.310]
3000 people killed are now forgotten.

[02:44:41.890 --> 02:44:43.170]
Let's exploit them instead.

[02:44:52.350 --> 02:44:56.370]
The North American government has been in a state of emergency.

[02:44:56.370 --> 02:44:56.370]

[02:44:56.370 --> 02:44:56.370]

[02:44:56.370 --> 02:44:58.490]
The North American government has been in a state of emergency.

[02:44:58.590 --> 02:45:13.150]
The North American government has been in a state of emergency.

[02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:19.710]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:45:30.210 --> 02:45:34.610]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.

[02:45:34.990 --> 02:45:38.610]
We're all suspects now, not the ash crop is saying.

[02:45:38.610 --> 02:45:40.590]
I have nothing to hide.

[02:45:40.990 --> 02:45:42.770]
Tables, hawkers, all are saying.

[02:45:43.270 --> 02:45:46.670]
Blind obedience, cattle don't have any reservation.

[02:45:47.490 --> 02:45:50.610]
Bout a provoked battle, then world annihilation.

[02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:57.110]
Old regimes must fall and have a burden and stoke with no objection at all.

[02:45:57.510 --> 02:46:07.330]
Democrats don't have the balls and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our parade wash pants.

[02:46:07.330 --> 02:46:12.650]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:20.890]
Only Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:46:33.690 --> 02:46:43.510]
The North American government has been in a state of emergency.

[02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.510]

[02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.510]

[02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.510]

[02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:43.510]

[02:46:43.510 --> 02:46:46.830]
The North American government has been in a state of emergency.

[02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:50.870]
The North American government has been in a state of emergency.

[02:46:51.870 --> 02:46:58.850]
They said he's the one to be again.

[02:46:59.170 --> 02:47:04.310]
Now they have only one vehicle.

[02:47:05.810 --> 02:47:10.710]
Take the land, don't put your guard so down.

[02:47:11.350 --> 02:47:14.730]
We got a battle we're all hoping and saying.

[02:47:15.530 --> 02:47:18.990]
We got a, we want to track this no more.

[02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:25.210]
We got a waste for striking guns.

[02:47:26.370 --> 02:47:31.490]
We say 9-11 is what they got you to believe.

[02:47:34.730 --> 02:47:39.790]
Can't get any double but a whole party got a degree.

[02:47:41.930 --> 02:47:53.990]
You believe what they say like a girl, a little fool, as they use the state.

[02:47:54.490 --> 02:47:58.790]
So they're cool with truth.

[02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:07.790]
Well the election of we got a push is running in with we got a,

[02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:23.090]
we got a good fight.

[02:48:23.090 --> 02:48:28.430]
This holiday season, the spirit of peace on earth and good welds towards men is alive.

[02:48:29.010 --> 02:48:33.930]
The sci fi channel proudly presents a Whitney Houston crack house Christmas.

[02:48:34.410 --> 02:48:35.110]
Crack is wack.

[02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:39.030]
Live from a burnt out dilapidated storefront in the alley behind Freeland,

[02:48:39.030 --> 02:48:43.530]
Heisen Avenue in Newark, New Jersey, it's a Whitney Houston crack house Christmas.

[02:48:43.850 --> 02:48:44.510]
Crackers whack.

[02:48:44.890 --> 02:48:49.930]
With special guests, Yasmeen Bliefs, Life Garrett, Nick Nolte, and Mary and Barry.

[02:48:50.130 --> 02:48:53.810]
To the night before equipment, I be parked in my car,

[02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:57.210]
Stought in some coke and drinking gin from a jaw.

[02:48:57.750 --> 02:49:02.290]
It's a Whitney Houston crack house Christmas with a surprise appearance by the Newark Undercover

[02:49:02.290 --> 02:49:06.390]
in Arcontics Division, and Whitney's bipolar husband, Bobby Brown.

[02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:08.570]
Crackers cheap.

[02:49:08.990 --> 02:49:11.650]
Brought to you without commercial unorruption by Jamal and Kehme,

[02:49:11.930 --> 02:49:13.530]
Who supplied the MacArthur Highway Hood.

[02:49:13.790 --> 02:49:14.450]
Crackers whack.

[02:49:14.850 --> 02:49:17.110]
It's a Whitney Houston crack house Christmas.

[02:49:17.390 --> 02:49:17.850]
Oh, gosh.

[02:49:18.470 --> 02:49:20.810]
Okay, and the better late to never guess what I got.

[02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:22.230]
Would you get an email?

[02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:24.390]
Oh, about Mike Levine.

[02:49:24.970 --> 02:49:25.150]
Oh.

[02:49:25.690 --> 02:49:27.150]
Wasn't that like right at the beginning of the show,

[02:49:27.250 --> 02:49:30.170]
I was talking about that Mike Levine on the station and Mike Levine.

[02:49:31.230 --> 02:49:31.370]
Correct.

[02:49:31.370 --> 02:49:34.770]
Seamass in Weston says, thanks for making me feel like more of an old fart than ever.

[02:49:35.350 --> 02:49:38.250]
I used to listen to Mike Levine on KDK and Pittsburgh as a kid.

[02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:40.350]
Also listen about Prince and the pirate games,

[02:49:40.650 --> 02:49:41.930]
Back when I had an interest in sports.

[02:49:42.610 --> 02:49:44.670]
Now I'm more like George Maticu towards sports.

[02:49:44.990 --> 02:49:46.570]
I don't watch other people play games no more.

[02:49:47.610 --> 02:49:50.590]
Getting back to Levine, he had a talk radio show called Open Mike,

[02:49:50.830 --> 02:49:52.830]
where people call in and discuss different topics.

[02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:54.990]
He had a great radio voice, and as you might say,

[02:49:55.290 --> 02:49:56.270]
talent is a broadcaster.

[02:49:56.770 --> 02:49:58.450]
Many years later, when I was living in Tampa,

[02:49:58.450 --> 02:50:00.350]
Mike Levine showed up on radio there.

[02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:01.810]
I think he was on WFLA.

[02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:05.990]
He did the exact same format in the late 80s as he did 20 years plus earlier.

[02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:09.810]
He often mentioned Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania in his Tampa broadcast,

[02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:11.350]
which was a bit of a kick for me.

[02:50:11.470 --> 02:50:14.490]
You know how we Northerners never tired comparing Florida to our home state.

[02:50:15.210 --> 02:50:16.450]
I didn't know that he died.

[02:50:16.770 --> 02:50:17.190]
He died.

[02:50:17.950 --> 02:50:20.090]
But since I'm 55 now, unless a new man's a kid,

[02:50:20.090 --> 02:50:22.150]
he must have been getting way up there in age 180.

[02:50:22.970 --> 02:50:24.470]
Thanks again for the walk down memory lane.

[02:50:24.850 --> 02:50:25.750]
Seamass in Weston.

[02:50:25.950 --> 02:50:26.750]
Well, thanks, Seamass.

[02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:29.010]
I think somebody actually responded to Mike Levine.

[02:50:29.410 --> 02:50:29.830]
That's cool.

[02:50:30.390 --> 02:50:31.570]
Mike Levine, isn't that great?

[02:50:33.570 --> 02:50:34.390]
Well, there's one.

[02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:38.410]
Okay, let's take a look at the pole thing and we'll get...

[02:50:38.410 --> 02:50:41.730]
This was, I feel like an Arthur Fiedler, like I'm conducting, you know?

[02:50:42.890 --> 02:50:43.550]
Do you believe that?

[02:50:44.270 --> 02:50:44.870]
Of course.

[02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:45.730]
No, it's pilot cramp.

[02:50:45.790 --> 02:50:46.510]
I just made it up.

[02:50:48.370 --> 02:50:49.010]
Conducting one.

[02:50:50.250 --> 02:50:52.510]
Okay, so we had what, 704 on the first pole?

[02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.790]
And 165.

[02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:57.810]
And 165 is 869.

[02:50:58.090 --> 02:50:58.630]
You know something?

[02:50:58.730 --> 02:51:01.010]
We could have made 900 if you really pushed it,

[02:51:01.010 --> 02:51:01.950]
but you know what it's the holidays.

[02:51:02.130 --> 02:51:02.390]
Relax.

[02:51:03.150 --> 02:51:03.550]
Relax.

[02:51:05.450 --> 02:51:06.650]
At ease, disease.

[02:51:08.050 --> 02:51:10.270]
Okay, let me change these numbers to bring them up today, okay?

[02:51:11.870 --> 02:51:12.310]
Got them.

[02:51:12.330 --> 02:51:13.230]
We get those numbers right.

[02:51:13.430 --> 02:51:15.570]
He's mailing in with the numbers, pole numbers.

[02:51:17.330 --> 02:51:18.110]
Rating numbers.

[02:51:18.290 --> 02:51:20.090]
Well, we can't do those anymore because we don't have any.

[02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:23.690]
Got nice numbers on my paycheck, though.

[02:51:23.690 --> 02:51:25.750]
Like I said yesterday, those are the only ones that count.

[02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:27.030]
Or whatever day it was Friday.

[02:51:27.250 --> 02:51:29.030]
You know something, the weekend goes by so fast.

[02:51:29.150 --> 02:51:29.930]
It feels like yesterday.

[02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.650]
Yep, it does.

[02:51:30.970 --> 02:51:31.670]
Is it just me?

[02:51:32.010 --> 02:51:32.870]
No, it's not just you at all.

[02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:35.170]
Every Monday, I wake up and think, okay, that's it.

[02:51:35.270 --> 02:51:36.110]
That's the end of the weekend.

[02:51:36.290 --> 02:51:36.690]
It's over.

[02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:41.710]
Besides Obama and Biden, who is the biggest winner of 2008.

[02:51:41.990 --> 02:51:44.290]
And don't forget, by the way, to throw some shoes and bush on it.

[02:51:44.390 --> 02:51:44.790]
What is it called?

[02:51:45.630 --> 02:51:45.990]
Sho...

[02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:47.510]
Shoeply pie?

[02:51:48.850 --> 02:51:49.590]
Whatever it's called.

[02:51:49.830 --> 02:51:50.570]
Right out of the pole.

[02:51:50.970 --> 02:51:51.610]
Sock and all.

[02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:52.490]
Sock and all.

[02:51:53.050 --> 02:51:53.530]
Hmm.

[02:51:54.250 --> 02:51:56.950]
Michael Phelps 51, Tina Fey, 52, I'm sorry.

[02:51:57.330 --> 02:51:58.010]
Tina Fey 42.

[02:51:58.290 --> 02:51:59.230]
They got a good race going on.

[02:51:59.810 --> 02:52:01.690]
I voted for Tina because he's too strange.

[02:52:02.330 --> 02:52:04.610]
Sarah Pailin going from obscurity to fame 27.

[02:52:05.070 --> 02:52:06.610]
Super Bowl champion, New York Giants 14.

[02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:09.150]
Hillary and her consolation prize, the cabinet job.

[02:52:09.530 --> 02:52:09.630]
Six.

[02:52:10.450 --> 02:52:12.070]
Stanley Cup champion, throughout Red Wing 6.

[02:52:12.370 --> 02:52:14.270]
US Open Champ, Tiger Woods 6.

[02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:17.850]
World Series champ, Philadelphia Phillies 3.

[02:52:18.350 --> 02:52:19.950]
Wimbledon Champ, Raphael Nadal 3.

[02:52:20.290 --> 02:52:21.970]
McCain winning the Republic of nomination 1.

[02:52:21.970 --> 02:52:24.270]
NBA champ, Boston Celtics 1.

[02:52:24.690 --> 02:52:27.530]
And none for Best Oscar winner, no country for old men.

[02:52:27.530 --> 02:52:29.310]
A real piece of turret if there ever was one.

[02:52:29.610 --> 02:52:32.110]
And Wimbledon Champ, Venus Williams, she ain't got no votes.

[02:52:32.250 --> 02:52:33.570]
And Venus ain't got no penis.

[02:52:34.390 --> 02:52:36.030]
I don't know what's the biggest name.

[02:52:36.350 --> 02:52:36.770]
So be round.

[02:52:37.290 --> 02:52:38.830]
You don't have no rejects.

[02:52:38.970 --> 02:52:40.830]
4th radio 560 QAM.

[02:52:41.090 --> 02:52:42.650]
The 4th leader.

[02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:44.330]
So, big day.

[02:52:44.590 --> 02:52:44.970]
That talent.

[02:52:46.030 --> 02:52:47.030]
It's the D.A. Show.

[02:52:47.250 --> 02:52:47.870]
We're not dreaming.

[02:52:47.890 --> 02:52:49.790]
Sarah is stocked back down to 12 cents.

[02:52:50.230 --> 02:52:50.910]
All right.

[02:52:51.930 --> 02:52:54.530]
See sports here in New York, Dad.

[02:52:56.350 --> 02:52:57.190]
All righty.

[02:52:57.630 --> 02:52:58.350]
Wake up very much.

[02:52:59.530 --> 02:53:01.150]
This area is the king.

[02:53:02.410 --> 02:53:04.330]
I know I haven't been around for a while,

[02:53:04.890 --> 02:53:07.410]
but I want y'all to know what up here in Rock and Roll Heaven.

[02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:09.750]
I'll be thinking of you, Miss Christmas.

[02:53:10.990 --> 02:53:14.310]
And I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message.

[02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:15.870]
A message of peace.

[02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:19.950]
Like, uh, how about a little piece of that high gold bar?

[02:53:19.950 --> 02:53:20.710]
Thank you.

[02:53:20.730 --> 02:53:21.130]
I got a lot.

[02:53:22.030 --> 02:53:23.890]
A lot of whole sand.

[02:53:24.850 --> 02:53:26.490]
Christmas is a time of hoot.

[02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:27.570]
Time of joy.

[02:53:28.290 --> 02:53:28.950]
A time of eleven.

[02:53:29.830 --> 02:53:32.510]
And I share with a little takes lies that feature you got there.

[02:53:33.390 --> 02:53:33.670]
Okay.

[02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:34.390]
Or more.

[02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:36.090]
No worry about it.

[02:53:36.330 --> 02:53:36.950]
Or you got Christmas.

[02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:40.030]
They're Christmas to me means family.

[02:53:40.990 --> 02:53:41.930]
They're family means friends.

[02:53:42.690 --> 02:53:44.030]
The friends means getting together.

[02:53:44.490 --> 02:53:46.890]
And getting together means eating.

[02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:48.830]
Oh, pass me that drumstick.

[02:53:48.930 --> 02:53:49.210]
Which please?

[02:53:49.550 --> 02:53:50.150]
Oh, flaky.

[02:53:50.390 --> 02:53:50.650]
I got a lot.

[02:53:50.970 --> 02:53:51.190]
Okay.

[02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:54.370]
Now, I just want to say to you right now,

[02:53:55.190 --> 02:53:56.570]
you know, I'm maybe a big star.

[02:53:56.890 --> 02:53:57.470]
Maybe too big.

[02:53:58.350 --> 02:53:59.310]
But ain't nobody so big.

[02:53:59.430 --> 02:54:00.670]
You can't reach out a helping hand.

[02:54:01.250 --> 02:54:03.450]
Or a helping hand.

[02:54:03.890 --> 02:54:04.430]
Oh, would you?

[02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:07.010]
Can't be helping those mashed potatoes over there.

[02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:07.530]
Which please?

[02:54:07.970 --> 02:54:08.230]
Flaky.

[02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:09.070]
Flaky, very much.

[02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:13.170]
Now, like I was saying, ain't nobody so big.

[02:54:13.330 --> 02:54:14.970]
You can't stoop to help a friend of neat

[02:54:14.970 --> 02:54:16.130]
over the holiday season.

[02:54:16.910 --> 02:54:17.830]
Speaking of season,

[02:54:18.150 --> 02:54:19.650]
you won't pass me that soft sugar

[02:54:19.650 --> 02:54:20.390]
when you get the chance.

[02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.830]
Flaky.

[02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:22.810]
Yeah, just, just unscrew the cover.

[02:54:22.970 --> 02:54:23.230]
That's right.

[02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:24.030]
Flaky, I remember it.

[02:54:24.670 --> 02:54:25.570]
So this Christmas,

[02:54:26.090 --> 02:54:28.810]
why don't y'all take a tip from old A.O.S.

[02:54:29.490 --> 02:54:31.690]
Now, I don't leave those steak tips right where they are.

[02:54:31.830 --> 02:54:32.230]
You know what I mean?

[02:54:32.310 --> 02:54:33.050]
I appreciate it.

[02:54:33.130 --> 02:54:33.310]
Flaky.

[02:54:33.690 --> 02:54:34.650]
I want you to remember,

[02:54:35.090 --> 02:54:37.210]
we're all part of God's great big family.

[02:54:37.770 --> 02:54:39.990]
And you know God made man unto his own image.

[02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:41.470]
And look at the mirror.

[02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:43.750]
I'd have to say God must be a big,

[02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:45.010]
big son of a gun.

[02:54:45.170 --> 02:54:45.630]
You know what I mean?

[02:54:46.430 --> 02:54:46.830]
I like you dear.

[02:54:47.570 --> 02:54:49.990]
But I expect to make a lot of remember this one last thing.

[02:54:51.130 --> 02:54:52.690]
When y'all at home as Christmas,

[02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:54.610]
stringing that popcorn up on the tree,

[02:54:55.570 --> 02:54:57.870]
save a big, big bowl for the king.

[02:54:58.670 --> 02:54:59.770]
Extra butter to what I mean.

[02:55:00.290 --> 02:55:00.810]
I like you dear.

[02:55:01.410 --> 02:55:01.670]
I like you.

[02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.590]
I like it very much.

[02:55:04.150 --> 02:55:05.510]
Night, night, night, night.

[02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:08.290]
The biggest names of the best callin'

[02:55:09.190 --> 02:55:12.310]
at your home for Miami Dolphins football.

[02:55:12.310 --> 02:55:13.870]
Hey, I got justice.

[02:55:14.250 --> 02:55:17.510]
Born straight, 0560 WQAM.

[02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:19.290]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:55:19.430 --> 02:55:20.310]
Miami, Ford Lauderdale.

[02:55:21.250 --> 02:55:21.770]
What are you going to do?

[02:55:22.410 --> 02:55:23.350]
Nice college boy, huh?

[02:55:23.970 --> 02:55:25.650]
They want to get mixed up in a family business.

[02:55:25.950 --> 02:55:27.290]
And now you want to gun down a police cap?

[02:55:27.370 --> 02:55:28.770]
Come on, because you slapped your face a little bit.

[02:55:29.130 --> 02:55:29.230]
Huh?

[02:55:29.690 --> 02:55:30.270]
What do you think this is?

[02:55:30.330 --> 02:55:31.630]
The army where you shoot them a mile away?

[02:55:32.050 --> 02:55:33.150]
You're going to get them close like this.

[02:55:33.290 --> 02:55:35.130]
But a bing, your bloodhead brains will over your nice side

[02:55:35.130 --> 02:55:35.630]
relief suit.

[02:55:36.390 --> 02:55:36.670]
Come in.

[02:55:37.650 --> 02:55:38.730]
You're taking the sparing part.

[02:55:38.930 --> 02:55:40.570]
Yeah, but wait, yeah, but wait a second.
