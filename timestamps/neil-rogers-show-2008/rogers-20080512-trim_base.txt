[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.200]
All right.

[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.220]
I'm going to see the audience.

[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.280]
It is so great to be here as a transgender.

[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.480]
Now, when did you make the decision to be a woman?

[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.360]
2002.

[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.880]
You kept your reproductive organs because you thought maybe one day I'll need to.

[00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.620]
Absolutely.

[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.980]
Your gender told me.

[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.620]
Now let's get to the penis.

[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.640]
I'd love to.

[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.160]
Wow.

[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.680]
Yeah.

[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.740]
What's wrong with this picture?

[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.660]
You look like a man.

[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.800]
And I don't mind.

[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.000]
You don't mind me touching.

[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.500]
No.

[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.280]
That is unbelievable.

[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.980]
I have never seen anything like that.

[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.740]
One hundred and eight inches all the way around.

[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.500]
Obviously I'm very proud.

[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.600]
Thank you for sharing your story again with us.

[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.440]
Thank you so much.

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.160]
Bye everybody.

[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.240]
Peace and may end.

[00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.120]
Peace and hello, guys.

[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.800]
Seven-plot 8 earthquake in China.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.860]
So there's a bunch of dead Chinese and a bunch of dead Chinese.

[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960]
I think the Lord has pissed off of the ease.

[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.920]
And then they're having like a Hezbollah's shooting all kinds of people.

[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.140]
Yeah.

[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.780]
They're lesbian on.

[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.800]
They're lesbian ease.

[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.180]
Hmm.

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.620]
Anybody who's an ease.

[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.200]
Wow.

[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.920]
Am I leaving anybody out?

[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.220]
No.

[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.620]
It's a good thing that some of us areites.

[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.120]
Chinese, Burmese, Levy, Lelebanese.

[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.620]
Mm-hmm.

[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.160]
Anybody else?

[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.840]
Caracas.

[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.280]
Caracas.

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.480]
Yeah.

[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.800]
God's missing the French man.

[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.280]
Your English bad, as usual.

[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.340]
He's got just got bad name.

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.360]
Religion exists for two purposes.

[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.060]
Making money.

[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.980]
Well, three purposes.

[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.800]
Brainwashing.

[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.260]
Making money and justifying hate.

[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.620]
Sure.

[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.740]
All of these things.

[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.560]
But nevertheless.

[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.520]
All of these things.

[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.240]
Like slavery.

[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.520]
Slavery was always a good thing.

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.380]
The Lord likes slavery.

[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.320]
We're in fact, we need to give instructions to his

[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.220]
elemings on how to treat the slaves and how many you could have and where you should do them and where you should throw them and stuff like that.

[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.080]
Here's our poll.

[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.700]
Now let's see.

[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.120]
Wait a minute.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.660]
Or by the way, thank you, Mr. President, for those great gas prices.

[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.440]
Price of gallon of gas.

[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.960]
It's a new, how record, $371.8.

[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.440]
Woo!

[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.900]
Wow.

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.040]
Retail gas prices increased for the sixth grade day and hit their fifth consecutive record out of groups.

[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.420]
Triple A website show today.

[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.600]
The National Leverage Price for Galon of Gas Unleaded Regular.

[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.960]
Regular rose to an all-time new high of $371.8 upon an intense cent from the previous day.

[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.400]
Drivers now pay 21% more for gallon of gas than a year ago when a gallon of gas on average cost $306.

[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.460]
Consumers have been pinced at the pump as the price of a barrel of crude oil is doubled in the past year.

[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.280]
Let's see how that crude is doing today.

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.280]
You think it's still pretty crude?

[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.300]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.100]
Well, let's take a few-cats.

[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.680]
B-

[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.460]
I'm waiting for the thing to come up.

[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.500]
Okay, let's still look out with a mustache on BNN.

[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.480]
Let's still look out with that big handlebar mustache.

[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.300]
125.27.

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.020]
That's a bargain, Matt.

[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.920]
It's down sixty-nine cents.

[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.020]
Down seventy cents.

[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.680]
125, $125.26 for a barrel.

[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.840]
What a bargain.

[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.460]
Are you happy about that?

[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.360]
Thank you, Mr. President, on your Saudi lunatic friends for those low-gas prices.

[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.400]
You boaters, you rapists, you murderers.

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.620]
Okay, here's the appell from Friday and Eric didn't get back while he was away for the weekend, which he warned me.

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.440]
So the one for today we got on late last night.

[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.180]
Now, Chris isn't with us because he's still stuck in traffic, is that the deal?

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.960]
That's what he says.

[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.880]
So Josh Cortes is here briefly until he has to go back and take care of important stuff.

[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.880]
How are you?

[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.220]
Like eating the food.

[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.460]
You got free food coming?

[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.280]
Yes, I do.

[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.600]
Good.

[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.820]
But from how he's?

[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.080]
Yep.

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.020]
Well, that's good.

[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.100]
At least he'll be there long enough for the food to be there.

[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.500]
Now, I don't know where Chris is today.

[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.540]
He's out and allegedly stuck in traffic somewhere for like an hour.

[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.680]
He called back again or not.

[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.620]
No, it's since the last time I told you.

[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.540]
I don't think he's going to be here for the show.

[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.560]
Well, what do you mean by that?

[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.800]
He's going to be stuck in traffic for four hours?

[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.820]
I'm just telling you what he said.

[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.900]
Wait a minute.

[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.640]
That's how he told me he said before enough that it makes a big difference.

[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.900]
But Josh Cortes is going to be doing the first two segments and then Greg is going to do the rest of the show.

[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.760]
I believe is what I said.

[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.800]
I remember saying that.

[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.640]
Maybe it wasn't to you.

[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.040]
Maybe I had the mic.

[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.440]
How do you know you're going to be stuck in traffic for four hours?

[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.820]
I don't know that I'm going to be stuck in traffic for four hours.

[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.280]
How do you know?

[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.580]
Maybe he does.

[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.700]
Maybe he has a crystal ball right next to his lead one.

[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.400]
He told me that it was shut down.

[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.340]
He's not moving.

[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.440]
And where is he?

[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.420]
A turnpike.

[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.660]
I believe is what he told me.

[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.660]
There's something to that.

[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.460]
Somebody said that Okachobi and the turnpike is.

[00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.760]
Whatever.

[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.620]
Shut down.

[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.240]
Wow.

[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.000]
Well that'll teach him to live in Dave County.

[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.700]
What a shmuck.

[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.580]
Ok, here's the pull from Friday.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.040]
How many votes did we wind up with on this thing before I finally?

[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.060]
1115.

We left off Sean Hanover here.

[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.780]
Only so many slots for right wing lunatics.

[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.880]

[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.160]
Oh, we didn't leave Sean Hanover.

He's in fourth place with 72.

[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.640]
Somebody said you left off Sean Hanover.

[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.820]
Whoever the hell that was.

[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.680]

Late addition to very well tied Oprah.

[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.060]
Isn't that much of a thing that's symbolic?

[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.740]
Since he invented him.

[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.280]
Yep.

Arsini Hall, Emery LaGassee, close to Flockhard and Bob Costa, each had two, each had a pair.

[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.120]
Bob Costa should have been left better.

[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.540]
He's annoying.

[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.640]
He's just annoying.

[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.120]
He's a little twerp.

[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.040]
A little jock sniffing twerp.

[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.200]
One each for Jim Kramer, Bobby Banks, Morton Downey Jr., Gretavant Suston Drew, Kerry Carson,

[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.360]
Daily Martin Lawrence of Inspec Man, Ed McMahon didn't have any.

[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.540]
Neither did Morrie Prove, it's Maria Bartoromo, all you so lovely today Maria, those lovely

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.760]
bags, those big hefty bags under your eyes.

[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.740]
Louis Anderson, Christopher Laurel, Ann Robinson, Ted Trappold, Jenny Jones, Susan Lucci, Ricky

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.520]
Lake, and Joan Riversdale, all ahead.

[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.060]
Oh!

[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.800]
I'm surprised you don't ever get any votes, aren't you?

[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.300]
No.

[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.560]
Why not?

[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.400]
She's not nearly as obnoxious as a lot of those people on the list.

[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.060]
Yeah, but should have gotten something.

[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.340]
And not as funny as you think you are is nothing compared to some of those people under.

[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.720]
Oh.

[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.780]
They're just evil.

[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.920]
I do like those guy co-spots that she's in though.

[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.100]
I can't feel my face in that.

[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.520]
That's good.

[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.140]
I like that.

[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.260]
She's only had like what?

[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.340]
745 face jobs.

[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.820]
That's it.

[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.400]
None of them helped.

[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.780]
A lot of the spastic surgery on that bitch.

[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.820]
The most important person in the history of porno industry is, now this is a really, you know,

[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.660]
we've done this before, so I just read it out of the history there.

[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.880]
Although it seems to be getting a lot of votes.

[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.880]
Considering it only went on there late last night.

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.960]
I'm a fat Jew.

[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.540]
That's why I voted for Al because I feel so bad for right.

[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.020]
I did to him.

[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.660]
I feel really bad.

[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.700]
Outgoedstein, the establishment destroyed him, man.

[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.000]
They just absolutely killed her.

[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.760]
We can, while they shot Larry Fluncte, tried to kill him and done their did.

[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.500]
They put him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.740]
And Fat Al, they just destroyed him.

[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.320]
They sent him to Rector's Island with a bunch of murderers and lunatics in May.

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.760]
I bet he had a good time in there, though.

[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.200]
The most important person in the history of the porno industry is,

[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.120]
Hugh Heffner 107, could there be any doubt?

[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.380]
Oh wait a minute.

[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.080]
First time we did this, Larry Fluncte won.

[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.180]
Beat him big time.

[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:45.900]
And you're like that.

[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.740]
I was siding out of mind, I guess, huh?

[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.420]
I reckon.

[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.340]
Hugh Heffner 110, Larry Fluncte 95.

[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.960]
I don't watch porno 39.

[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.340]
Well, too bad.

[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.160]
What do you do?

[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.580]
We know what you're doing in your spare time.

[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.880]
You're looking for glory hole.

[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.360]
Probably.

[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.800]
Linda Lovelace 27, Al Goldstein 21 for Fat Al.

[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.240]
It used to be.

[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.660]
I was finding the guy that called Friday.

[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.200]
He saw Al on somewhere recently.

[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.360]
And about how we always thought that was a big fat guy.

[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.020]
He's not anymore.

[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.060]
And like I told him, he's on the starvation diet.

[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:17.860]
Right.

[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.400]
The forced starvation diet.

[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.220]
John Holmes 15, Ron Jeremy 14.

[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:24.700]
Fat.

[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.500]
Tracy Lorde 11, Jenna Jameson 11.

[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.080]
Seika 10, Jeff Striker 7.

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.900]
Christie Canyon 6, Peter North 5.

[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.580]
Bob Butchie only 3.

[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:35.440]
Now that's interesting.

[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.260]
He's only got 3.

[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.500]
I guess they don't we've 10 house anymore.

[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.360]
I don't know if that is.

[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:43.620]
Really?

[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:44.880]
I don't think so.

[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.900]
Victoria Pierce 1.

[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.460]
And one for Nina Hartley.

[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.800]
Randy West didn't have any.

[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.640]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.140]
All right.

[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.440]
Randy West had the big O.

[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:53.860]
Atta Boy.

[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.440]
Randy Schmutzie.

[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.080]
Really nasty looking.

[00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.800]
Anyway, 276 vote.

[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.820]
Deputy QA and Bruce Ross Marr-Holly Davidson and South

[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.900]
Day Dodge presents the 105 days of Holly.

[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.840]
You could be one of 56 winners of a 2008 Holly Davidson

[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.200]
motorcycle, a registered with any Bruce Ross Marr or

[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.540]
South Day Dodge or any hooters location logger or logger on

[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:20.000]
two, Josh's website wqm.com with which he's doing such a

[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.860]
magnificent job.

[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.080]
Are you doing a magnificent job with it?

[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.400]
That's what I hear, man.

[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.040]
I know it's your kissing Marlon ass on there.

[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:27.860]
Let me say it again.

[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.320]
If they play Washington and Milwaukee every day, which they do.

[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:30.600]
Yeah, okay.

[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.360]
They're the best team in the Bay.

[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.300]
They'd be almost undefeated.

[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.300]
They don't let me say it again.

[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.520]
Yeah, depending on who they're playing.

[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.020]
They're playing girls teams every day.

[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]
I don't want to pee on their parade.

[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.340]
And they still don't draw flies to their home games.

[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.880]
That isn't their fault, but they don't.

[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.380]
There's no one for interest.

[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.560]
Now what are you trying to say?

[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.620]
You kissing up is that video?

[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.020]
No, they suck, man.

[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.960]
I didn't say they suck, but I'm just saying.

[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.540]
Yeah, you do.

[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.560]
They play girls teams every day.

[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.040]
That means they suck.

[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:56.520]
No?

[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.600]
No, well, let's see.

[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.960]
When the schedule kind of evens out, they start playing real teams.

[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.160]
We'll see how they do against them.

[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:02.920]
That's all I'm saying.

[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.480]
Okay.

[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240]
You think that's fair?

[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.540]
That's fair.

[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:07.580]
Good.

[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.640]
Well, you sound like really down today.

[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.020]
Now he's not too happy about having to have this sprung in

[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.060]
the first part of the week.

[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.320]
No, no, no, no.

[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.960]
You're in that place.

[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:15.720]
What?

[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.700]
It's just Monday.

[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.280]
That's all.

[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.440]
Fat Chris has got some real issues out there.

[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.700]
Man, he's always stuck in traffic.

[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.480]
He's always having issues.

[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.660]
He just can't get from point A to point B.

[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.340]
He has difficulties.

[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.900]
You hear him again or not?

[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.100]
No, lately.

[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.020]
Really?

[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.920]
That last update.

[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.160]
No.

[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.980]
So in other words, he told you he's not going to be able to get here today.

[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.480]
Get there?

[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.500]
Yeah.

[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.160]
How does he know that?

[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.840]
Maybe he's psychic.

[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.620]
I just never heard that.

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.720]
That would be like my send you a message at three o'clock this afternoon saying,

[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.200]
I feel fine right now, but I know I'm going to be sick when I wake up tomorrow morning,

[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:53.800]
you're on tomorrow.

[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.520]
I don't like that.

[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.040]
Do you see the similarity?

[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.260]
Well, no.

[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.680]
Probably it's after 10 to 5, 60 WQM.

[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.400]
In fact, I might just send you that message.

[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:06.860]
Oh, okay.

[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.820]
Things are going so far.

[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.800]
I feel like I'm talking into a tin can, into a tomato soup can.

[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.520]
You know, hurricane season is just around the corner.

[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.640]
So make sure your home is properly protected with hurricane panels, shutters or impact windows

[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.200]

[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.180]
To be safe, all the windows and doors need approved protection.

[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.240]

The best tower here, the D&D rocket, the 456 QAM.

[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.100]
The fourth leader.

[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.740]
It's been about 30 years since his last pubic appearance.

[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.240]
Before catching a plane to Canada, D&D to escape South Florida, D&D aluminum.

[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:24.740]
But now, after discovering that Canada Dry Soda is aptly made in Plano, Texas, Niel Rogers is back Saturday, May 17th.

Don't miss Niel Rogers and George Rodriguez Saturday, May 17th, 3-5pm at Gulfstream Park in Casino.

Are you or someone you know spending too much time, energy or money gambling?

[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.000]
Is gambling interfering in a personal relationship?

[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.080]

[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:21.040]
The most important thing is to have a good time.

[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.600]
I wonder who that could be on line 9.

[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.580]
That's our first call.

[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.580]
Who that could be?

[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.680]
Hey, cowboy.

[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.740]
How are you?

[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.820]

I want to see you, man.

I'm going to get a big kiss before it.

[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.340]
Yeah.

[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:58.880]
Like I said, there are going to be a lot of people there that nobody wants to see.

[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.660]
And that's where they're going to show up to be seen.

[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.720]
56670560, something I may have to go back to my old style here if these people don't want to respond here today.

[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.360]
Trying to recaptured the glory days of a year's gone by.

[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.460]
I'm just otherwise fading.

[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.200]
I've also been reading about some of the signal problems we're having too.

[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.960]
We have Spanish interference from Acuba and popping and puking.

[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.920]
We have some real issues here, but then again, don't be bothered with management with stuff like that.

[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.740]
They can't be bothered, but then they got important stuff like selling.

[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.800]
They're selling and selling and selling and selling and that's it.

[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.380]
It's all we care about.

[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.420]
You have a lot of spots on there.

[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.440]
Everything else is secondary.

[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.300]
Liberty QAAM, hello.

[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:43.760]
Good morning.

[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.900]
The internet feed is down.

[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.260]
Just a little bit.

[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.600]
No, it is not.

[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:50.640]
No, it is not.

[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:51.400]
Have a night's day.

[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.120]
See, that's how it's thrown before.

[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.560]
Just try it for aggravation sake.

[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.640]
The internet feed is not down.

[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.560]
It's got green lights.

[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.400]
If it was down, I'd already branded what have already given me a heads up and heads down.

[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.780]
I would have had plenty of red service about that already.

[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.400]
When we've had plenty of, I notice you guys.

[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:08.720]
You know it.

[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.060]
But there's a guy who just calls to try to start the week off on a really sour, negative, nasty note.

[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:14.480]
As if.

[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.960]
You know, like that's going to change my life.

[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.760]
The internet feed is fine as wine.

[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.560]
You jackass, you moron.

[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.620]
You typical stop for it to lose or you.

[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.900]
Liberty QAAM, hello.

[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.380]
Father Neal.

[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.000]
Yes.

[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.860]
What about when these accrues in the 80s, want to talk about?

[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.700]
Yeah, let's hear about.

[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:31.820]
Yeah.

[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.000]
I'll cruise this moron.

[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.480]
32 way and hello.

[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.640]
Hey, Neil.

[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.400]
I'll see.

[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.300]
Can anyone save the status conquer for the porn?

[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.020]
He's got the boringest magazine in the boringest point I've ever been invented.

[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:47.540]
Yeah.

[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.480]
Well, I just think that's not very exciting.

[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:51.900]
You see what?

[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.680]
I don't think it's very good.

[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.920]
I don't think people can vote for that.

[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.680]
It's kind of watered down the porn.

[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.420]
Wouldn't you be George?

[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:00.960]
Hello.

[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.620]
Is this thing on?

[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:02.140]
Hello.

[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:02.400]
No.

[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:02.900]
It's on.

[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.700]
You're here now, but it's on.

[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:05.940]
I have a good day.

[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:06.960]
Hello, it's on drugs.

[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:08.960]
Liberty QAAM, hello.

[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.080]
I'll be the other side.

[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.400]
QAAM, hello.

[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.160]
It's better now.

[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:12.500]
It's better now.

[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.160]
I'm sorry, pretty bad.

[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.360]
Don't make me nervous.

[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:14.840]
Okay.

[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.180]
I want to ask you a question about.

[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:17.780]

[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:18.620]
Yeah.

[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.420]
Come on.

[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.120]
I told you to do the same.

[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:20.660]
Thanks, settler.

[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.300]
No, you don't.

[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.560]
No, I didn't do the same, but I'm trying to talk to you about something.

[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.180]
Yeah, sure.

[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:26.540]
Okay.

[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:26.900]
What?

[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.140]
Go ahead.

[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.800]
Please, I want to know, when are you going to be in Gulf Stream?

[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.780]
When the cow jumps over the moon.

[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.040]
Oh, God, I think that the people creep.

[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.380]
Liberty QAAM, hello.

[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.480]
Hello.

[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.100]
I heard a boom to pick what you nailed.

[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:45.920]
Yes.

[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.560]
This must be a hotel pharmacy, guy.

[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:57.400]
Now, every time I listen to you, I throw all you do is brush the collar, brush my asses, brush everything.

[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.880]
Let me ask you something.

[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.840]
You got a machine you're offering, a teeth on a sidewalk somewhere.

[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.380]
What's the story?

[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.620]
I can't understand what you're saying.

[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.100]
Feet on the side.

[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.160]
Well, where do you go?

[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:06.780]
Yeah.

[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.780]
Nothing positive to bring things in.

[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.280]
You're on a radio show.

[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.960]
So here's the authority to make people happy.

[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.220]
And you'll spend it.

[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.660]
Make the miserable life.

[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.700]
No, you're already miserable.

[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.280]
I don't need to do anything to make you miserable.

[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.280]
You got the head start.

[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.340]
No, I'm not miserable.

[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.380]
Put your teeth in and act like a man.

[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.260]
Okay, and quick to talk in like some cemetery village retard.

[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:28.940]
Okay.

[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.580]
I didn't realize it was retarded on Monday.

[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.000]
You didn't get that memo?

[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:33.920]
No, I meant that.

[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:34.080]

[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.040]
Let me go ahead.

[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.400]
Liberty QAAM, hello.

[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:37.820]
Oh, you?

[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:38.560]
Yes?

[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.900]
You don't know where near is hateful of Steve Cainy argue.

[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.760]
You're going to ponder.

[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.980]
He pains a hateful anger.

[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.320]
Nobody would know, though.

[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.040]
Maybe if he had an audience, somebody would know.

[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.680]
On a radio station with color that even he doesn't know.

[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.720]
But nevertheless, Liberty QAAM, hello.

[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.880]
I see it's hard.

[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.480]
Liberty QAAM, hello.

[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.940]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:06.680]
Yes, sir.

[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.260]
I have something positive to offer.

[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.060]
Yeah.

[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:17.300]
If any of your listeners have any old crappy cell phones laying around the house,

[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.960]
if they go to cellphones for soldiers.org,

[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.240]
they will send them a plastic envelope post-pitch paid,

[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.060]
and they recycle all the old crappy cell phones

[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.540]
that they buy phone cards for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:40.600]
Great.

[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.080]
In case they want to do that,

[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.200]
it helps them in Afghanistan and Iraq.

[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.260]
Great.

[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.100]
In case they want to do that, it's self-proclaimed.

[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.340]
That thing's going to show up on Friday.

[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.380]
I said, I hope not.

[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.960]
Then I'm living in your capable hands, by the way.

[00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.160]

[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.920]
We're going to have lots of goons around there.

[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.040]
That's what I meant.

[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:03.720]
Mm-hmm.

[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.320]
We're cattle.

[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.520]

nobody else even close,

[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.360]
nobody else even close,

[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.000]
seem more butts than even make the list.

[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.760]
You're the biggest name.

[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.560]
The best house here in the United States,

[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.540]

The fourth leader.

[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.420]
Fourth weight.

[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.880]
And there will be an antihara.

[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.240]

Rejected by joys.

[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.360]
But of course they're discussing a Rotescan smelly 1035-60WTQAM.

[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.580]
Saturday should be a banner day, shouldn't it?

[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.560]
I thought it'd all stream.

[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:21.300]
It'll be great.

[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.840]
And fire sound in those picture cards.

[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.220]
And the talk to all these nice wonderful people

[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.000]
we're going to stop by.

[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.020]
And also some retards and idiots that we don't ever want to see again.

[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.240]
See that's the one thing for sure.

[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:32.880]
And you know this.

[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:33.960]
And you can count on it.

[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.420]
If there are people who know that you don't want to see them,

[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.700]
they'll be there.

[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.080]
Oh yeah, count on it.

[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.480]
Like the guy with the eyes.

[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.520]
The guy with a fanny pack.

[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.660]
That one, that thing.

[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.240]
That creature.

[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.460]
And probably his boyfriend too, moron.

[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:52.520]
Moron.

[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.560]
Yeah, he'll be there.

[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.920]
What happened to George?

[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.340]
He's dropping a goose apparently.

[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.140]
Is he really?

[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.160]
He's dropping a goose.

[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.060]
Boy, you sure have a way with words, don't you?

[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.940]
He's dropping a goose again.

[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.780]
Maybe he's playing acid goosey.

[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.720]
32 AM, hello.

[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.560]
Great to hazing, startle.

[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.900]
32 AM, hello.

[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:12.860]
Here?

[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:13.740]
Yes sir.

[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:14.860]
I was going today.

[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:15.600]
Okay.

[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.800]
Good, good.

[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.760]
And you know, uh, what's the best airlines in the South of Toronto?

[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.680]
Do you have any recommendations?

[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.240]
What is it?

[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.340]
What's the best airlines to buy from, uh,

[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.600]
like, shape of order or mining to Toronto?

[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.600]
Why are you coming here?

[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.700]
Uh, well yeah, I'll be landing next Wednesday about 3 o'clock.

[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.440]
I was wondering if you could go pick up the airport.

[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.740]
Yeah, okay, no problem.

[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:38.640]
Huh?

[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.520]
Well, I hear it.

[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.680]
I pick stoats, isn't it?

[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.380]
I don't want to go to the base and stay cars.

[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.800]
I've got to go to Morton.

[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.660]
Now here, they've got to get from there to Toronto.

[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:47.720]
You're right here.

[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.720]
I hear you need help.

[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.180]
How many two AM, hello.

[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.620]
I don't need to play junior program.

[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.740]
Oh, the Westboro is back.

[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.980]
The Westboro is back.

[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.280]
But, uh, it was a new segment.

[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.740]
What George's doing, like, uh, pre-recorded interviews?

[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.440]
No, it's a spot.

[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.020]
It's a hole.

[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.340]
Yeah, right it down on your ass, okay?

[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.840]
Have somebody read it in Magic Marker on your left cheek.

[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.100]
You moron.

[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.520]
Somebody cue way in, hello.

[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.360]
Hey, now I'd like to dominate the airport for your poll.

[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.340]
The poll is not, we're not building the poll, okay?

[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.960]
I got a favorite to a fantasy.

[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:21.760]
Why, why should we?

[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.340]
The airport to build my poll.

[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.000]
Yeah, but I'm sure she does, yeah.

[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.180]
I mean, next we're going to put the Bambi Woods on there.

[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.920]
You know, I mean, let's put all of them on there.

[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.040]
What, what are you laughing about?

[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.300]
Uh, just thought that was funny.

[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.680]
That because Del Rey.

[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.320]
Bambi, whatever happened to her, well, she disappeared real fast.

[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.740]
She was a real hot number.

[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.620]
Bambi Woods.

[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.140]
They all do.

[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.060]
They're all ugly guys in that movie.

[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.720]
But then again, that's my biggest complaint with porn movies.

[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:50.300]
Both straight and gay is that the overwhelming majority of the guys are really, really ugly.

[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.780]
And they're like Ron Jeremy, for example.

[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.200]
Although most of them know this ugly, is that that's a bad example.

[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.080]
What's his ugly people having sex?

[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.860]
Nobody, QAM, hello?

[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.000]
We paid care.

[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.300]
QAM, hello.

[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:06.900]
QAM.

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.060]
Yeah, I wouldn't be seriously if it stopped the meal.

[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.420]
I'm a good friend.

[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.600]
I want to be serious if it stopped the meal.

[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.340]
Yeah, okay.

[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.000]
Go ahead.

[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.140]
Hello.

[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:17.780]
Yeah, Neil.

[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:18.840]
Hey, yeah, I'm sorry.

[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.860]
Hey, listen, first of all, I was talking to a couple of weeks ago on a show.

[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.460]
And I just brought up a question to him, which would be a good poll.

[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.520]
And, you know, the question was what?

[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.280]
The question is, here's the poll.

[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.460]
Here's the poll question I was supposed to use.

[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.780]
And that is, what did African Americans do to America?

[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.240]
That is so bad that makes people feel the way they do.

[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.300]
You know, like with our river and right and all the stuff that has happened, you know,

[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:56.180]
a lot of people have a lot of negative things to feel about African Americans for maybe just

[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:00.000]
also maybe some minority-uncommon African Americans.

[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.120]
Yeah, and I just want to know in a poll like if you just had a poll,

[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.720]
what if like people do to make people feel that way?

[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:12.500]
And then you would just have to convince them that's just what the time is.

[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.520]
Okay, great.

[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.380]
Well, I'm being honest to things, I guess.

[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.220]
Oh my God.

[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.080]
What?

[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.480]
Oh, I was falling asleep there a little bit.

[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.100]
He wants to know what dark folks do.

[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.060]
I know what he wants to know.

[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:22.720]
He wants to know what dark folks do.

[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.580]
Like nine times.

[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.400]
Well, he didn't understand the first eight.

[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.680]
Footies a little bit slow and old.

[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.480]
And his nose glows when he gets a question like that because it has nothing to do with,

[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.400]
where can you get the best Cuban sandwich?

[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.760]
Where can you get the best Ruben sandwich, stuff like that?

[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.760]
That's the real heavy local intellectual crap that footy deals in.

[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.480]
As opposed to what's the deal in these intellectual calls.

[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.340]
I got a text message from George.

[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.640]
He said he's stuck in a traffic jam on the throne.

[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.380]
And he has no one here to be back.

[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.820]
Well, he might miss the whole show then.

[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.140]
Yeah, evidently, there are some people who are opting out of the show today.

[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.660]
I'm sure that Frank Chris was one of them.

[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.260]
Now, George's, he's taken ill on the throne, I guess.

[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.900]
The king of QAM, he's permanently on the throne.

[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:06.560]
Hello.

[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:07.880]
Oh, there he is.

[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.920]
Hi, here.

[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:09.920]
Yeah, good.

[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.460]
By the way, it was a pile-up paramedics.

[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.020]
There were injuries, jaws of rattles when I had a job of life.

[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.080]
QAM, hello.

[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:19.600]
Hi, here.

[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.000]
I'm here.

[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.580]
It's pretty good.

[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.020]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.920]
Yeah, I will talk to you about Kickball Game on Saturday.

[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.040]
My friends says you have the radio show.

[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.540]
So, if you have an hard time and on, I feel like it's on Sunday's fine.

[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.320]
Because you will play on Saturday.

[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.800]
So, it's Kickball for Jesus.

[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.700]
And if your wife's divorced in here and your father loves Mr. Moneybag,

[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.300]
and you try and kick you out of your house, and just become through it in a kid's age.

[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.280]
You are, man.

[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.620]
Just come and put some kickball and serve the crow-head and help both guys and go over it.

[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.140]
Okay, great.

[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:54.900]
Have a great time.

[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.860]
Kickball for Jesus.

[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.360]
All right.

[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.160]
All right.

[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.960]
Kick Jesus in the ball.

[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.680]
5.670 if I only had one of them I understand.

[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.400]
Really?

[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.400]
One big nut.

[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:05.060]
I'd say.

[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.620]
Kind of like Moriah Curie with that one breast in on the middle of her chest.

[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:08.920]
5.670.

[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.720]
Oh, she got married recently, Moriah Curie.

[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.060]

[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.060]

[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.060]

[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.060]

[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.940]
I don't know what happened back in criques.

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:18.940]

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.880]
Or did you make a train learning lesson first?

[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.100]

[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.160]
I was a little patient.

[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.160]

[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.160]

[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.160]

[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.160]

[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.200]
I was a little patient, but you made my father Mine.

[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.800]
That's my father's.

[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.780]
It's my father's.

[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:33.100]
It's his son's.

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:33.740]

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:33.740]

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:33.740]

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:33.740]

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:33.740]

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:33.740]

[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.040]
Ladies andуется.

[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.040]

[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.440]
He's from Daddy.

[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.140]
He's from Daddy, Ladies andrics.

[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.340]
I mean, I would have anything.

[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.940]
Have a good weekend?

[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.180]
Yes, it was a very good weekend yourself.

[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.800]
No, I know, it was born, everybody.

[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.640]
Everybody's shined me this weekend.

[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.600]
Everybody that said that they wanted to do something.

[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.000]
Yeah, me too.

[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:52.720]
They didn't do it.

[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:53.940]
I guess he's out there.

[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.160]
He sure makes a big racket when he polices those knobs.

[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:57.680]
Yeah.

[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 Rock to a tremendous start to do.

[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.480]
This is more of what I had in mind.

[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.020]
But he accepts me of a deron and his boyfriend there.

[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.000]
We will kill them both if they show up on top.

[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.200]
What are you arguing about?

[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.960]
I'm just thinking what a fantasy, it is.

[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.840]
Just like Michael said, I'll kill them both.

[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.020]
Set a meeting.

[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:16.820]
Mm-hmm.

[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:17.960]
Well, I'll be safe.

[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.980]
Fomens are can plan a gun and I'll shoot them both.

[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.500]
WQAM, hello.

[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:25.600]
Where are you?

[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:26.400]
QAM, Hola.

[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:27.900]
Hello.

[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:31.660]
Hello.

[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:37.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:38.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.060]
I got a question for you.

[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.040]
Did you see the first auto-wetting?

[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.340]
No, I did not.

[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.520]
There were some pictures out there and they were...

[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.580]
Why would I care about that?

[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.280]
Well, I'm not that you've nothing to care about.

[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.920]
There was something interesting I saw.

[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.380]
There were some pictures released and there were some pictures released.

[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.920]
There was a black priest that I've owned.

[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.700]
I guess that uh... did the ceremony.

[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.160]
I thought that was a little strange.

[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.320]
What was that?

[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.760]
Well, what turns is make what Racer's priest was?

[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.920]
Well, why does that make a difference?

[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.420]
I don't know.

[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.980]
It just didn't expect it that way, I guess.

[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.700]
Yeah, well, I'll get a life.

[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.240]
Why something a little more interesting than whether the first daughter is getting married or not?

[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.240]
Okay, if that's interesting to you, that means it's time to exit the planet.

[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:20.600]
Okay?

[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.500]
Make some space for somebody useful.

[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.200]
Which you ain't.

[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.480]
5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.680]
We love the Marlins.

[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.860]
They're on fire.

[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:32.940]
Oh yeah, they're on fire.

[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.800]
They're flaming is what they are.

[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.000]
FAMING!

[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.520]
You know, so Alan...

[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.120]
What's his name?

[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.800]
They're sure it's Alan Cohen.

[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.520]
He destroyed the panthers and these clowns are like putting on a dog and pony show and they got their new stain.

[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.720]
They cried and they cried.

[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.760]
We're gonna leave.

[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.840]
We're gonna leave.

[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.440]
We're gonna leave.

[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:50.660]
We're gonna leave.

[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:50.680]

[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.280]
And now they're playing like little league teams every day, winning a whole bunch of games

[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.520]
everybody's been all whipped up into a frenzy about it.

[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.180]
Why does Joe continue kissing their ass?

[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.720]
Is that his word?

[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.040]
Seriously?

[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.000]
Why does Joe keep sucking up to them?

[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.540]
I don't know.

[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.320]
I know it's part of it's supposed to be sarcastic, but it just I don't know.

[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.140]
It doesn't hold any water.

[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:10.700]
I don't get it.

[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.260]
But nevertheless it's better in the beast.

[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.820]
The one who about the beast needs to lose a lot of weight or he's going to die.

[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:16.860]
Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.140]
So how's Jerkstein when you run a name-laving or what?

[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.480]
Are not today?

[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.820]
I know that the Josh is a big fan of that show last week.

[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.760]
How many QA and hello?

[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:28.760]
Eight.

[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:29.640]
Me, sir.

[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.240]
Yes.

[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.900]
I'll just tell you that you think to offset the whole racial balance, you know, make the racial

[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:41.000]
balance down in the whole presidential election would be a, uh, would be a game kind of

[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.080]
lethal right-stickin.

[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:43.820]
That one?

[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.020]
That's McCain.

[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.280]
McCain for President Cundleito Rice for-

[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.220]
Yeah, that would be wonderful.

[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.440]
Somebody QA and hello?

[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.500]
Hey, pal.

[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.240]
Yeah.

[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:54.580]
Two things.

[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.180]
Uh, you, you're going to be security around you?

[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.560]
Lots.

[00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.000]
Yeah.

[00:36:59.580 --> 00:36:59.820]
Yeah.

[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.120]
Okay, listen to the other thing.

[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.320]
Can I make a comment?

[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.100]
Let me answer this.

[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.300]
Why would you ask if there's going to be security?

[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.040]
I don't know.

[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.020]
There's a lot of crazy people out there that don't do you too much.

[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:09.660]
Mm-hmm.

[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:10.520]
Listen.

[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]
Honestly, Neil, can I make a comment please?

[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.060]
I'm listening.

[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.320]
We're waiting for it.

[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:15.820]
Okay.

[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.460]
Uh, we're in a real bad catch 22 here.

[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:25.520]
If Obama does win, there's going to be something possibly negative that could happen.

[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.600]
And Reverend Wright, but his all his pontification, he'll be riots in all these cities.

[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.120]
No, but say the-

[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.260]
There'll be riots in any cities.

[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:35.740]
Okay, listen.

[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.480]
Neil and Neil, mental health.

[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:37.660]
Yes.

[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.740]
The biggest name.

[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.220]
The best tower here.

[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.540]
The largest sport in the 550 quam.

[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.360]
The fourth leader.

[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.660]
Ian's dumb ass dirt.

[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.420]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.620]
This is what I was just doing.

[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.160]
Just surprising is about to speak what, listen in.

[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:01.340]
Across our country, many Americans are understandably anxious about issues affecting their pocket

[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:01.660]
books.

[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.300]
Gas prices have gone up by $1.40 per gallon every day.

[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.600]
Congress needs to drive up prices even further.

[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.500]
Congress needs to make energy even more expensive.

[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.340]
Higher prices at the pump and even bigger electric bills.

[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.560]
I don't think it's as too much to ask.

[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.820]
Now, I'll be glad to take some of your questions.

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:21.760]
John.

[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.980]
Mr. President, can I ask you, are you high?

[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:25.860]
A John?

[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.240]
That was three questions.

[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.480]
No, it wasn't.

[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.160]
The second part of your two-per-question.

[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.160]
Are you fake?

[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.520]
When you ask four or five questions, it's hard to remember every question.

[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.800]
So whatever medication you run, break the pills in half.

[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.280]
Drug use is fun.

[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.000]
And I love to smoke my-

[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:43.460]
10.

[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:43.460]

[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:43.520]

[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:43.640]
10.

[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.380]
10.

[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:45.200]

[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:45.300]

[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:45.420]

[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:45.460]

[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:45.580]

[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:45.580]

[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:45.700]

[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:45.700]

[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:46.920]

[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:46.920]

[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:46.920]

[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:47.680]

[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:47.680]

[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:48.360]

[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.080]
10.

[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.340]
10.

[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:52.920]
10.

[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:55.520]
10.

[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.820]
I was looking on the Hill website to see if there was something about that crash on the

[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.380]
turnpike, where Chris is allegedly stuck all day.

[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:02.200]
Yeah.

[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.920]
And there's still nothing on the 8-bodies website.

[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.960]
I checked channel four, channel six, channel seven, channel 182.

[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.480]
And I can't find nothing.

[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.540]
The Hill ain't got nothing, the Sun simply ain't got nothing.

[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.160]
Eyes got plenty of nothing, but never less.

[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.800]
A 78-year-old legally blind man nicknamed the hammer.

[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.060]
Oh, so many hammers for so little time.

[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.000]
So many mad dogs and so many hammers.

[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.940]
Has build a perfect game, Dale Davis of Alter Iowa, Neil Trump in seconded

[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.200]
strikes him each 300 on Saturday night during replay.

[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.860]
It's a great sport.

[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.540]
It's something the only old and the handy crap can do, Davis said Thursday.

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.680]
I guess I call it the old and the handy crap.

[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.000]
Davis has suffered from macular degeneration, a chronic eye disease for the past

[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.460]
decade.

[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.520]
He can't see out of his left eye and has limited peripheral vision in his right eye.

[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.720]
Davis's perfect game came at a rule off to conclude the league season at a

[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.480]
full lane alley in a small Northwest Iowa community of about 1800 people.

[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.260]
Century lanes owner Kremlin did so Davis is game didn't do much attention until he

[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.440]
reached 10 strikes.

[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.460]
That's when folks poured out of the bar to watch his final two shots.

[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.580]
Davis who stands five eight and weighs just on the 15 pounds through a Brooklyn where

[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.380]
a white-hander strikes on the left side of the head pin for his final strike.

[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.780]
The feet brought wild cheers from Davis's fellow bullers and armlookers.

[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.460]
It went down there in some of the Howard Brooklyn.

[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.560]
It was just a solid sound in the pockets of Davis who was average scores

[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:17.940]
180.

[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.120]
It was quite a thrill.

[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.260]
For just a few minutes I felt like a pro.

[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.300]
Davis who weren't as unique Monica was a child from his blacksmiths father moved from

[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.680]
California to live with his sister in Iowa shortly after losing his sight in his left

[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.260]
eye 97.

[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.240]
She encouraged him to start bowling again.

[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.460]
He now bowls twice a week and his fellow bullers help him with pin placement and making

[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.740]
sure he picks up the right ball.

[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.300]
Oh yeah, always make sure you're handling the right ball.

[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.060]
Sure.

[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.760]
That would be really bad if you're handling balls and put it right out there.

[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.580]
There's somebody else's.

[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.000]
All depending on who they are.

[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.340]
Former Republican representative Bob Barr is expected to announce that he's running for

[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.440]
prison is libertarian.

[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.400]
Bob Barr was a little bit of Hitler mustache, you know?

[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.000]
Uh-huh.

[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.960]
Member Bobby Barr from Joja.

[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.840]
His candidacy would be a wild card in the White House race that many believe would hurt

[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.160]
Republican Senator John McCain.

[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:05.780]
Good.

[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.480]
All right.

[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.360]
Barr had scheduled news conference.

[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.380]
He's got a schedule for this morning 11 o'clock.

[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.600]
He must first win the libertarian nomination at the party's national convention that begins

[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.220]
May 22.

[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.980]
Party officials consider him a front runner thanks to national profiled who developed as

[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.600]
a Joja Congressman 95 in 2003.

[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.100]
Bill Abar helped lead Bill Clinton's impeachment.

[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.880]
Equipped with Republican Party two years ago saying it grown disillusioned with its failure

[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.300]
to shrink government and toward the scaleback civil liberties and fighting terrorism.

[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.800]
Maybe he can be the Ralph Nader of the Republican Party.

[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:33.680]
Wouldn't that be sweet?

[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.860]
Political justice.

[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.140]
All of these things.

[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:37.980]
Bobby Barr.

[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:38.740]
Mm-hmm.

[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.340]
5 6 7 0 5 6 E were up to a tremendous start in the phone this morning.

[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.700]
I mean, really even I'm shocked.

[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.440]
Aren't you?

[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.080]
Yeah.

[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.560]
Lot of real old retards this morning so far.

[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.440]
I mean, really, really old.

[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.400]
Oh my gosh.

[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:52.780]
Equal.

[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.760]
That's a little bit easy today.

[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:54.940]
Oh yeah.

[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.480]
Well, it is not much of Monday.

[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.320]
5 6 7 0 5 6 E and pound 5 6 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.300]
Somebody QA in.

[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.540]
Hello?

[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:04.720]
Hello, Neil.

[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:05.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:10.900]
Hi, who wants it in the 80s that says that reading off the air is bad radio?

[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.340]
Was that you or Steve King?

[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.320]
It is.

[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.280]
It's boring.

[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.760]
How many two in?

[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.060]
Hello?

[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.040]
I know.

[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:22.860]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.060]
Do you or George need to have serious electem?

[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.140]
Do we have what?

[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:28.800]
No.

[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.700]
He's serious or SM?

[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.620]
No, I'm sorry, because we have SM.

[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:33.000]

[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:33.660]
Are you?

[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.480]
The reason I asked what they're doing is because they're not doing it.

[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.060]
The reason they take existing channels for some reason.

[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.140]
They burn them at the single artist's channel.

[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.000]
Most recently, they have an old Neil Diamond channel now.

[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.040]
Oh, God.

[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.020]
Obviously, they can't get enough material.

[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:48.960]
They've got 24 hours.

[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.120]
I actually just heard a cover of Starway to Heaven, which is absolutely nauseated.

[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.940]
I was curious about that.

[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.100]
If you're looking for things for Chris, you can always look on far to turnpeg.com.

[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.560]
Well, don't you find it funny if the whole turnpeg is blocked off?

[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.440]
And wouldn't this be something on somebody's website?

[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.580]
Yeah, but probably.

[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.600]
No one of those guys down here probably not.

[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.560]
But if you do go to far to turnpeg.com, they use Dave.

[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.660]
You're pretty good about updating it.

[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.400]
Okay, thanks.

[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.960]
Florida Turnpeg.com.

[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.820]
I'm going to it right now.

[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.360]
Turnpeg.

[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.460]
Turnpeg.

[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.380]
I was just Florida or XLA?

[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.000]
I don't know.

[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.400]
I did Florida Turnpeg.com and I'm not at the right place.

[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.060]
LordTurnpeg.com.

[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.160]
Thank you for stopping by creative web design.

[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.080]
Yeah, that's what I got.

[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.940]
Yeah, it must be SLA.

[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:37.540]
I don't know.

[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.420]
I mean, this guy's trying to be helpful.

[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.660]
He's giving me a son to ask about.

[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.740]
Some website that doesn't exist.

[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.220]
Sure.

[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:44.800]
How many QAM?

[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.040]
Hello.

[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.260]
QAM.

[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:51.120]
Yeah, and then can you play that, um, them shady?

[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:51.840]
Can you play that for me?

[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:52.440]
No.

[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.560]
Hey, we'll hold on a minute, my girlfriend.

[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.800]
How many QAM, hello?

[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:00.600]
Stay kneeled, good morning.

[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:01.760]
Good morning, sir.

[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.960]
Hey, there's a brand of Hall of Oz called Hall of Oz.

[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.340]
I don't know if you knew that.

[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:07.400]
And?

[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.600]
Question, my duty is in Clubman Dreard, all right?

[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.000]
Clubman Dreard?

[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.120]
Yeah, likely story.

[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:14.740]
I don't know how to do that.

[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.260]
I have to be a Jew.

[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.000]
That's the same idiot.

[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.160]
Clubman Dreard.

[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:18.380]
Wow.

[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.400]
Like I said, all the Goyam all the time.

[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:27.140]
560-560, and they've risen in singular wireless line.

[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.520]
We used that bend-stein until we found Scientology.

[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.000]
So we've already got enough problems without your schmuckers.

[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.460]
That's WDQ-A-M, hello?

[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.720]
Hi, we're playing.

[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.620]
With that bow tie. WDQ-A-M, hello?

[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.440]
I think the room's here, Ron.

[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.140]
WDQ-A-M, hello?

[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.540]
It's Florida's turnpike at an exit at the end of Florida.

[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.880]
And there's no mention of any traffic tie up.

[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.560]
What did I tell you?

[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.920]
I think you're getting screwed with today, OK?

[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.240]
How can somebody call you at 9.25 in the morning and say,

[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.820]
I'm going to be stuck on the road all day?

[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.180]
Well, not that I want to be the devil's advocate,

[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.220]
but I will be anyway.

[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.400]
Maybe he feels like he's not going to get off there in time

[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.120]
to make it worth the slump all the way up here.

[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.340]
And so I'm going to wait down here?

[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.520]
All the way up here.

[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.800]
Because he's coming from the deep south.

[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.500]
Deep, deep south.

[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.700]
And so he decided to bag it, as we say.

[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.660]
Wouldn't you think somebody would call if they were stuck on the turnpike

[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.440]
if there were some contra time school and I?

[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.060]
Do you think somebody in his vast audience that we used to have would call and say,

[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.060]
oh, yeah, the course ain't making that up.

[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.640]
There's like a 85-car crash on the turnpike.

[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.440]
It's been shut down for hours or like that.

[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:42.980]
Maybe.

[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.820]
I don't see nothing.

[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.600]
I don't hear nothing.

[00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.040]
Well, I hear something.

[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.360]
Let me QA in.

[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:49.600]
Hello.

[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:50.540]
Hi, ground.

[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.580]
QA in.

[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:52.820]
Hello.

[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.240]
Hi, Neil.

[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:54.700]
Good morning.

[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:00.000]
On the news this morning, as all they were talking about as a construction from last night,

[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.400]
laying over till this morning, and the turnpike is basically down the line.

[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.620]
Turnpike is what?

[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.220]
Yeah, from the construction last night.

[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.000]
All right.

[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:10.440]
That's all.

[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.320]
Have a good day.

[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.100]
Do you understand anything you just said?

[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.520]
There's construction and they were talking about it on the news this morning.

[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.800]
That's all they're talking about.

[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:18.980]
That's what he said.

[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.040]
WDQA in.

[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:21.280]
Hello.

[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.660]
On the road.

[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.100]
QA in.

[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.740]
On the road.

[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.220]
WDQA in.

[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:28.460]
Hello.

[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.160]
Hey, Mr. Rogers.

[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:30.960]
Yes, sir.

[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.520]
Yeah, they did have two lanes blocked off at the Okotobi turnpike.

[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.100]
But that's why the traffic went back up from Okotobi to all plaza.

[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.660]
I'll be back past the bird road to all plaza.

[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.560]
Just want to get dark.

[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.740]
Is it still our blood backed up?

[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.160]
Yeah, the toll backed up.

[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:47.460]
Ok, thanks.

[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.340]
There we go.

[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.080]
One guy, a con, who knows what's going on.

[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.820]
And the rest of these people...

[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.340]
Of course, I say the rest of these people, which they're only two now.

[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:55.740]
Right.

[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:57.460]
How's that?

[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.360]
Hi Ron.

[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.220]
That's just that's what we got.

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:00.760]
There you go.

[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.720]
That's Jolly Jo for you, man.

[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.180]
He's done a heck of a job on his show.

[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:04.920]
I'm going to tell you.

[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.740]
I want to personally thank him right here on the year.

[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.900]
For the phenomenal job he's done an assisting this show.

[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.500]
And making it what it is today, a pale shadow of what he used to be.

[00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:18.820]
How we doing on the pool, the most important person in the history of the opponent industry is...

[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.980]
We have 494 votes.

[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.440]
We're going to make over 500 a day.

[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.040]
How do you like that?

[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.020]
After a really slow start, Croseric was out to the screen around all weekend.

[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.740]
You have to be 141, Larry Funt, 124.

[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.960]
I don't watch Porn 049.

[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.900]
You're likely story.

[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:39.860]
Lindler Obley's 32, Goldstein 27, John Holmes 23, Ron Jeremy 20, Groke Tessk, Tracy Lords 18,

[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.540]
Saka 14, Jenna Jamison 12, Kristi Canyon 9.

[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.260]
How come we don't have a Debbie Woods on here?

[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:48.980]
A Baby Woods.

[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:49.620]
You want it?

[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.980]
No, just a deal.

[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:51.360]
All right.

[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.580]
Well, let's name Court of Sec Chuck a little bit before when I said it the first time.

[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:56.360]
Oh.

[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:58.940]
Jeff Striker 9, Peter North 7.

[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.120]
He didn't chuckle this time.

[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:05.940]
Onina Hartley 4, Bob Gucci only 4, Victoria Peris 1, and Randy West still has the big O.

[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.620]
In a 0 second name, the best talent you've ever seen in the Rogers, 40, and you're 5.

[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:12.740]
52 AM.

[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:14.560]
Maybe fourth leader.

[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.920]
You got that cut-out again, started just on this break.

[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:18.920]
Cut-out-mup shoot.

[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.720]
That's enough like that.

[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.020]
Any questions?

[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.700]
I will see you on the next one.

[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.860]
Welcome back to the retake of the Moe Habitat David in the show.

[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.840]
With none other ear than my most hated colleague, Gugugu, Gugugu Deldi.

[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:34.300]
Hi!

[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:40.200]
I'd like to thank everyone for the massive letter writing campaign to get me back on the air.

[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.160]
You're not lying.

[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:42.460]
What do you want, Mullethead?

[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.300]
Can't you see I'm talking over here?

[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.060]
Oh, yeah, but we're really not out of here.

[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.580]
What about the letter writing campaign?

[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.780]
I mean, it will let us buy the thousands.

[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.020]
I told you not to use the same retina dress.

[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.020]
Why didn't you use mine?

[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.680]
Yeah, but they returned them all to me and best had done.

[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:00.600]
You're right.

[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.900]
And that jacks guy is still on the air.

[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.880]
He absconded my dick in you, and he never got right.

[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.620]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:08.520]
I hope so.

[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:09.700]
Hey, we're going!

[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:41.220]
I'm here, don't you get that old girl?

[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.240]
You're the one who's little girl for the abuse?

[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.960]
Hey, old homie, what are you, who's liar me?

[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.140]
I require her.

[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.680]
You take off those gangster pants.

[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:50.860]
I'll wait for it all.

[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:51.600]
Okay.

[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.360]
Now, bend over.

[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.500]
Hey, now who the hell?

[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.900]
I said bend over.

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.000]

[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.140]
You got it all wrong.

[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:05.060]
You go home, then I go do do do do.

[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:05.860]
You ready?

[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.160]
Okay.

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:25.380]
I'm sure.

[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.120]
Really?

[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.740]
Want me to harm woman, please?

[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:28.660]
You're in the last break.

[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.760]
No, you signed okay now.

[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.180]
But it started.

[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.860]
It happened one time last week, but then it came back and riddled the break.

[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.900]
And it's like, you know, that dropout stuff.

[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.860]
Speaking of dropouts, I did find the Florida's Turnpike.com and active incidents.

[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.380]
Action in Amal post-32.

[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.500]
Lowering cut it out.

[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.580]
Did you find a story?

[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.500]
Did you find a deal?

[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.020]
No, I found these.

[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:56.380]
I'm on a Sun Guide traveler information and it's got a little code here.

[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.940]
But it doesn't want like a code.

[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.840]
You know, like it's got a little mad code.

[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:07.380]
We're good with little symbols and things on it, but it doesn't say anything about the

[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:07.880]
Turnpike.

[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:12.000]
But, you know, that's just one site and I don't know you're not coming out.

[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:12.480]
Okay.

[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.320]
I think it's going to be intermittent.

[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.180]
It's going to be intermittent.

[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.580]
No, I don't find any story about any of this.

[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.720]
Now, we didn't have that one color minute ago who may have been making that up or not.

[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:22.360]
There's a case maybe.

[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:22.800]
I don't know.

[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.620]
Or maybe everybody just missed it, you know.

[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:30.260]
Maybe everybody in the media, everybody if they turn back website, whoever runs that, maybe they just missed it.

[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.120]
Or maybe they just don't care.

[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.100]
You know how that goes?

[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:35.260]
Somebody QYM, hello.

[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.000]
Daniel, I just want to call in and let you know that.

[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.280]
That'll be a long week for you.

[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.000]
I'll answer the question.

[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:42.600]

[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.400]
Oh, no.

[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.940]
Somebody QYM, hello.

[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:48.460]
Okay.

[00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:49.900]
Yes?

[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.700]
Oh, Neil, I'm sorry, sir, please hold.

[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.080]
You want?

[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.020]
I'm apologize.

[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.260]
I was in another world.

[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.400]
You do with, um, Kelsey finally grew up here.

[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.220]
He was really going after over the weekend.

[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.100]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:02.680]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:02.880]
Yeah.

[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.620]
I was very upset that he's finally gone.

[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:05.760]
What?

[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:15.900]
Well, he's saying now that the ratings and Sadanos beating you and it's garbage and, you know, we had a sign on and he only does mow bits and mow and I,

[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:21.540]
he didn't say mow, Howard and I have been on for five years and yeah, we're surprised he's usually pretty supportive.

[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:22.400]
Mm-hmm.

[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:23.300]
I'm supportive of it.

[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.280]
Like, I need his support?

[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.320]
No, not at all.

[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.960]
But no, he always says, he actually says that on Gladdy keeps being the, you know, the public eye.

[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.440]
Yeah, well maybe a nothing else to talk about.

[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.380]
I know, it's terrible.

[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.620]
Not well with the hockey team, you know.

[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:36.660]
Yeah.

[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:37.820]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:38.740]
Thanks.

[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.780]
Oh, he was going after you, man.

[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.120]
He's really, yeah, yeah, right.

[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:45.660]
Oh.

[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.920]
Little squeak, my stochastic.

[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.260]
By the way, I found out from Riverwood a backstab where you are.

[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.880]
Gildy, so you're not fooling me.

[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.340]
Maybe I've fallen some other people out there, but...

[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.380]
Man, man, what am I going to do?

[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.980]
Man, norms as I should do the morning show by myself.

[00:52:59.340 --> 00:52:59.500]
Man.

[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.360]
Nobody can queue in, ho.

[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.820]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:04.460]
How are you today?

[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.000]
Okay, sir.

[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.880]
I've had a talk from my services for you this Saturday to beat up anybody that comes within 10 feet of you.

[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:11.360]
For you.

[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.040]
For you.

[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:12.140]

[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:12.940]
For you.

[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:12.940]

[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.760]
Including these callers.

[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.620]
I couldn't this, man.

[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:22.900]
It's not too good for you, but it makes for a good listening out here just to believe what a function.

[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.440]
What do you mean it's not too good for me?

[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.280]
Do you think I get paid any more or less if I talk to people in the queue?

[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.700]
Larger than the sum or the y-car?

[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:29.740]
Oh, no, no.

[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.580]
I just think it's good for you to have to put up with all this.

[00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.020]
No.

[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:35.280]
I'm glad it's not done, sir.

[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.000]
Have a great day.

[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:36.600]
And you too.

[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.280]
I'm sure that there are people out there who wish it would be, oh, we just drove him crazy.

[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.260]
Like a hairy punk, that the five-year-old child I call a little bit of guy.

[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:44.500]
Right.

[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.800]
You're going to have a hefty week, but you know what, big deal.

[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.080]
All I care about is on the 10th and 25th, they're preferably a couple days early.

[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.060]
Wish lately it has been.

[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.620]
Thank you, Jolly Joe, even though you're an idiot.

[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:55.820]
But that the check shows up.

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.300]
That's all.

[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.000]
That's important.

[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.380]
All the rest is windowed resting.

[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.760]
Okay, whether we have brilliant calls, stupid calls, idiotic calls, moron calls,

[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.920]
yeah, that's kind of me doing anything.

[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:12.380]
With anything, plus to keep some of these batches off the street, public service.

[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:16.000]
So, tell me, tell me you never called your bank, did he?

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.160]
No.

[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.540]
There's a reason for that.

[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:19.320]
That.

[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.380]
Maybe he's back asleep again, I don't know.

[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.280]
All the road?

[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.440]
I don't know what his story is lately.

[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.540]
I don't know what, no, not on the road in the bed.

[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.520]
Wendee Q.A.M., hello.

[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.220]
No?

[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:33.620]
Hello?

[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:35.420]
Hello, Neil.

[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.200]
Yes sir.

[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:37.780]
Florida term bike situation.

[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:38.740]
Yeah.

[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:41.580]
You know, they only have a two or three lanes when there's an accident.

[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.800]
It backs up and, uh, but they clean them up pretty quick and it sounds like this guy just

[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.380]
gave up too early because, uh, he had sitting there and nothing happened.

[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:50.820]
I was out of hell that I'm not going to look.

[00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.700]
But, uh, he right, probably would have been arriving about now if he had to stuck to it.

[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.980]
There's no, there's no, uh, jam.

[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:57.920]
There's no blockage.

[00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:58.640]
There's no nothing.

[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.700]
No, if I clean it, what are we called?

[00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.600]
If I, uh, cleaned it up already, so he just probably just quits.

[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.780]
Well, maybe he turned around and went back home or somebody.

[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.540]
Maybe just walked away from his vehicle.

[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:11.060]
Maybe just left it there and, uh, locked it up and, uh, walked away.

[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.040]
You think?

[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.260]
It's possible.

[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.160]
Or maybe by hijacked, he just didn't want to tell you that.

[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:17.900]
I have no idea.

[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.720]
It's just where he bizarre.

[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:22.700]
His behavior lately, as far as showing up, has been somewhat bizarre.

[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:47.560]
But nevertheless,

[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.980]
32 a.m. Hello.

[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.000]
Hello, man.

[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.860]
Oh, boy. Here we go.

[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.080]
You want to do that during the break or how do you want to do that?

[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.720]
Well, yes, we should do it during the break.

[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.140]
I have to reset my end.

[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:01.980]
Yes.

[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.180]
You're in and million.

[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:04.500]
Okay.

[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:05.540]
And why is that?

[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:06.460]
Because that's how it's done.

[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.300]
It does happen at the start of the break.

[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:08.580]
Right.

[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.580]
Like, uh, the last break.

[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.760]
Because that's how it's done.

[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.740]
What do you mean that's how it's done?

[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.240]
When machines aren't doing what they're supposed to, you reset them.

[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.280]
That's planning.

[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.000]
No, but it just seems very strange.

[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.280]
It started at the beginning of a break.

[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:22.580]
I made a quarter stuck his fingers out of touch sometime.

[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.440]
And that go, what?

[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.380]
When things start going wrong, they got to start sometime.

[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.280]
Okay, well, let's do the break and we'll reset.

[00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.000]
The best tower key.

[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:31.960]
This is a rocket.

[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.440]
Forty-two-a-m.

[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.200]
The fourth leader.

[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:36.940]
The Roger.

[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.080]
The Downey.

[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.180]
And I'm the big O.

[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.880]
What's that stands for?

[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:41.840]
Or rather, the...

[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.100]
No.

[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.280]
That's just short for Orlando Blue.

[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:45.760]
You don't look, Joey.

[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:46.280]
No.

[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.280]
No.

[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:47.520]
No.

[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:47.680]
No.

[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:48.020]

[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:48.760]
No.

[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.240]
No.

[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.560]
Now Neil's gonna rip me for four hours.

[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.820]
I've been asked to keep distance.

[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.200]
Right confidence.

[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:59.520]
In case you wonder why we're here, Joe got suspended.

[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.380]
Joe got suspended.

[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.180]
Oh, that's a little fly.

[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.280]
Maybe we should take this call from our special guest.

[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:07.520]
Roberto Lohongo.

[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.800]
Hi, I'm Reboyto.

[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.340]
You know what I'm the voice of the painter's now?

[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:11.780]
Yes.

[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.940]
I'm sure that's Quiky Boy's guide that goes by all the time.

[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:15.600]
Oh.

[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.740]
You got me confused with a character on another show.

[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]
That's not me.

[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.040]
I have children, you know.

[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:23.960]
Do it, do it, do it.

[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.080]
You have a funny name.

[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:25.720]
Yeah!

[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:26.740]
What did you get?

[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:26.940]

[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:27.900]
Joey, what did you get?

[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.620]
Joey, I'm...

[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.720]
Joey, do it, do it.

[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.120]
We can't get into that right now.

[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.120]
Do it, do it, do it, do it.

[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.280]
Hey, Joe!

[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.060]
How do you want to walk in the high-level?

[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:40.520]
Just thinking in me.

[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.240]
I'm too old.

[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.340]
I'm too old.

[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.040]
I'm too old.

[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:44.560]
I'm too old.

[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:45.180]
I'm too old.

[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:45.560]

[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.060]
I'm too old.

[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:47.800]
I'm too old.

[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.980]
Oh, there's that Nazi Bob Bar.

[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:57.000]
The 59-year-old Bar must win the Libertarian nomination at the party's national.

[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:57.920]
Yeah, we already know that.

[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.840]
115 at 560 WQM.

[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.660]
Yeah, Geldy, you're a good one to be talking about rating.

[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.120]
Very impressive that one point that you had when you did two to four there.

[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.580]
At least it was consistent with Moe.

[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.520]
They both kept the one point.

[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:08.740]
Oh!

[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:09.440]
Good job.

[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.920]
Okay, 560 705 60.

[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.220]
Pound 560 and they Verizon's singular wireless line.

[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.960]
Monday is a difficult day for them to keep it up.

[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.780]
You know what, for four hours?

[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.000]
Oh, yeah.

[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.020]
And you're still cutting out.

[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:21.560]
Sorry.

[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.120]
Sorry, what?

[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.320]
Sorry, I'm cutting out and they know about it and he's, you know, stuff's here

[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.080]
and he's going to go call somebody like a person.

[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.500]
I just don't understand how that happens.

[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.220]
I mean, out of the blue, I don't know where we go.

[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.900]
Almost an hour, it might be a line problem between us having to do with, you know,

[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.020]
AT&T or whoever our provider is.

[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:39.640]
Yeah.

[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.120]
For the high speed up line.

[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:41.500]
Yeah.

[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.600]
Mm-hmm.

[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:43.580]
It's calling out.

[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.780]
Somebody QAM, hello.

[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:47.880]
Don't hurt me.

[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:50.040]
Oh, hello.

[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:51.360]
QAM, hello.

[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:52.120]
That's just how it is.

[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.080]
560 is.

[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.460]
I heard both of those.

[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:58.900]
Mm-hmm.

[00:58:59.080 --> 00:58:59.660]
Just fine.

[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:00.400]
Of course.

[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.340]
560, 560, 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:07.100]
Do you have any of these folks show up on Saturday?

[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:07.680]
Your appearance?

[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:08.760]
No, none of them.

[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.620]
No, you just disappeared.

[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.120]
Sorry.

[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:12.940]
No, none of them.

[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.460]
Normal people.

[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:13.820]
Nice people.

[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.640]
Hey, Darryl, how are you doing?

[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:15.660]
I said I'd shut out to them.

[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.220]
And Mark the Promotions guy wanted me to say something about him too.

[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.500]
So, hey, Mark the Promotions guy.

[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.300]
A new Promotions guy.

[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:23.980]
Oh, we got a new Promotions guy.

[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:24.560]
Yeah.

[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.500]
So, hey, Mark, we do got a loud voice.

[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:26.900]
How's that?

[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.140]
Darryl said something about him.

[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.340]
It's much worse than what's before.

[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.060]
So, the resetting really helped a lot.

[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.500]
Not really helped like Maggie.

[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.040]
If that's not, do anything, then it's got to be a line problem.

[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.460]
It's got to be a one.

[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.940]
A line problem.

[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.520]
But it always straightens itself out every time it at least it usually does.

[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:44.960]
Right?

[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.840]
Because, without them doing any of the company,

[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.600]
like AT&T straightens it out.

[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:49.720]

[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:50.560]
The one?

[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:51.660]
The company.

[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.460]
The people who provide us the line.

[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:54.260]
The company?

[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:54.860]
Yeah.

[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.920]
Whichever company it is, I'm just saying AT&T.

[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:57.800]
I have no idea who's starting to...

[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.960]
Yeah, you're just pulling it out of your ass.

[00:59:59.160 --> 00:59:59.360]
You ain't right.

[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.100]
No idea who it is.

[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:00.620]
No, no.

[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.040]
Could be Bel Canada.

[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.200]
Who the hell knows what kind of guy it is?

[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:03.540]
That's right.

[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.560]
Could be sabotage.

[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.800]
Could be mobbell on me.

[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.620]
WDQAM by this T-Send.

[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:09.720]
WDQAM, how are you?

[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.020]
I'm sorry, Ann.

[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:11.900]
WDQAM, how are you?

[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:12.260]
I'm sorry, Ann.

[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:12.260]

[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:12.260]

[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.560]
You're doing right because it sounds like it could be a...

[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.260]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:19.460]
You have a table report, Yale Southwest 72nd Avenue

[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.980]
between Pine's Boulevard and Sembrook Road.

[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.560]
They're going after everybody.

[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.580]
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.120]
Watch out!

[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.760]
So, where's Chris?

[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.520]
I don't know.

[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:42.820]
I'm serious.

[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.080]
I mean, this is out of nothing except major of a deal.

[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.640]
I'm going to call a story here.

[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:47.980]
I'm going to call him?

[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.440]
Yeah, call him up.

[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.100]
And see if he's still asleep.

[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.480]
In fact, I'm going to call him and tell him to call the hotline.

[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.060]
No, I don't want to talk to him on the air.

[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.400]
Why not?

[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.140]
With all these great calls we got?

[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.380]
Yeah, we could do that.

[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.460]
Then I'm going to call the badline.

[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.980]
I will put him on the air and have him explain himself.

[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:03.660]
Yeah.

[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.860]
I just don't get it.

[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.940]
I mean, seems to be in our everyday.

[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.440]
I sit down here and you come on and say,

[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.500]
oh, Chris isn't going to be here until he's in the middle of traffic somewhere here.

[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.240]
Well, that's what you get when you look down there and get him's built.

[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.280]
Well, he should be living in the enemy's vell.

[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.760]
Well, he can't afford not to.

[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.380]
We mean by that.

[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.260]
And they're calling the big bucks that they're paying him there.

[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:22.460]
Right.

[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.400]
He lives with his folks.

[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.280]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.120]
Yeah, I got nothing.

[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.400]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.240]
Needle.

[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:32.800]
Yes.

[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.780]
Would you marry me to make me legal?

[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.860]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.000]
QAM, hello.

[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:41.800]
Good morning, sir.

[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.000]
Two A.M.

[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.000]
Good morning, sir.

[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:45.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:46.940]
Quick question.

[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:47.940]
Get us one on one.

[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.500]
Is it the expression,

[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.420]
if you're in dreaded?

[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:53.520]
Or am I wrong?

[01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:55.900]
And?

[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.700]
That's the question I have.

[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.140]
Isn't the correct pronunciation, if you're in dreaded?

[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:00.500]
Yes.

[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.040]
Thank you very much.

[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.060]
You're so welcome.

[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.540]
Not jeered.

[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.500]
Okay, jeered.

[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.500]
We got a phony, Juna.

[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:11.240]
In fact, when he calls in, we got the quarter-shot guy.

[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.480]
We got the hotel pharmacy guy.

[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.660]
We have the phony, Juna.

[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:16.840]
Why not?

[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:17.620]
Let's have one of each.

[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.940]
That can be his tag.

[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:20.660]
The phony, Juna.

[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.880]
Everybody's got to have a tag.

[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.260]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.640]
I'm your friend.

[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:27.980]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:28.920]
I'm your friend.

[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.220]
QAM, hello.

[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.060]
I'm your friend.

[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.840]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.520]
I will bear it up with you.

[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.220]
You too.

[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.800]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.240]
Who's there?

[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:41.640]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.600]
I didn't think so.

[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.180]
You guys.

[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.060]
Now, you know.

[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:44.480]
Yes.

[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.060]
All of a sudden, the door in the compound.

[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.640]
I'm turning it up, come down to this.

[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:49.620]

[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:49.940]
Hahaha.

[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:53.460]

[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:54.640]
Hahaha.

[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.320]
Hahaha.

[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:57.580]

[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:57.820]
Hahaha.

[01:02:58.660 --> 01:02:58.840]
Hahaha.

[01:02:59.180 --> 01:02:59.460]
Hahaha.

[01:02:59.500 --> 01:02:59.500]

[01:02:59.500 --> 01:02:59.500]

[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.120]
Hahaha.

[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.900]
Deputy QAM, hello.

[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.720]
Hello, guys.

[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:05.660]
Hello.

[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:06.460]
Hello.

[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:06.880]

[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.160]
I need your.

[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:08.760]
Yes.

[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.460]
I'm the company meet you in George Saturday.

[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:14.700]
Yeah.

[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:15.820]
Can't wait.

[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.740]
My name's Clev.

[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.280]
I'm the meet.

[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.780]
I'm not the pool guy.

[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:21.820]
And.

[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:23.220]
Oh.

[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.580]
He's not the pool guy.

[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:25.640]
Thank you.

[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.080]
I'm from that.

[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.140]
So what's the story?

[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:28.860]
Do you know where I'm from?

[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:29.540]
The five Chris?

[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.820]
I sent him a text with a hotline number and told him to call it.

[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.820]
And for an added bonus, I can't receive taxes today.

[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.440]
I already got a couple of emails saying that the tax machine isn't receiving.

[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.300]
And also, we have now had a few or a couple of dropouts on our...

[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.340]
Everything is technical disaster this morning.

[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.260]
It's a disaster, Jolly Jovelle.

[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.260]
It's a technical freaking disaster.

[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.300]
Wow.

[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.860]
The tax machine ain't working.

[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:57.020]
The streaming is dropping out.

[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.440]
We got this boot, like that.

[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.380]
I don't see the bad line, Rick.

[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.680]
And I don't see fat Chris, so responding to your plea.

[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.060]
No.

[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.000]
Now you got the taxes I sent you this morning, right?

[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.880]
The log and the schedule and all that Michigan.

[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.120]
Never worked.

[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:11.420]
All right.

[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.560]
For some reason it ain't receiving.

[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.420]
How about a five-semio-facts?

[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.400]
We can try that.

[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.940]
It's a test facts.

[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:20.580]
Wow.

[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.100]
This is like a disaster today.

[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:22.940]
I don't have time for Monday.

[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:23.320]
For this.

[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.540]
Monday just practice anyway for the rest of the day.

[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.480]
So whether it is, it doesn't count.

[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.240]
Practice makes perfect.

[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:29.940]
We hope.

[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.140]
But I doubt it.

[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:31.620]
In our case.

[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.880]
Let me scribble something out.

[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.220]
This is a test.

[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.120]
Tastes.

[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:38.500]
Test.

[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.040]
Okay, I'm going to go over my fax machine, which works fine.

[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:43.580]
All right.

[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.980]
And on the fax number.

[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:46.620]
Good.

[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.780]
You don't have it on speed dial.

[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.280]
See you screwed me up.

[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.040]
Oh, geez.

[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.980]
One, two, three.

[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440]
Monday, Tuesday. Where's the?

[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:56.920]
Okay.

[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.100]
Four, eight, six.

[01:04:58.220 --> 01:04:59.580]
It's going to sit on to you there, man.

[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.080]
All right.

[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.720]
I'm going to keep an eye on it.

[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.540]
How do you know where you can't get any faxes?

[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.120]
How do you know that?

[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:04.940]
Oh, wait a minute.

[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.100]
I'm looking to who's on line 12.

[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:08.900]
Hello.

[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:09.800]
Hello.

[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:10.980]
Yes?

[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:11.980]
Yes?

[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.540]
Who's it?

[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:13.820]
Chris.

[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.320]
Who is it?

[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.240]
Chris.

[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.240]
George told me to call.

[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:18.700]
This isn't Chris.

[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.380]
Yes, it is.

[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.160]
Yes, it is.

[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.180]
This is Fab Chris.

[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.100]
Yes, it is.

[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:23.560]
Doesn't sound like you to me.

[01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:24.500]
Sounds like it to me.

[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.640]
So what's going on?

[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.560]
I'm after filing kind of your on half-hour later.

[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.540]
I'm almost finally home.

[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.460]
Where was this wreck?

[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:40.980]
I don't know if it was a record construction or what, but I was in traffic from the time that I got into the turn bike.

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.000]
You were what?

[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.500]
In traffic from the time that I got onto the turn bike.

[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.880]
From all the way down by Snapper Creek Service Plaza.

[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:50.520]
Yeah.

[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.260]
I still like to find a round a little bit before Okotobi.

[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.080]
By the way, you're a fax machine.

[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:54.880]
It doesn't work towards it.

[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:55.720]
It's ringing and ringing.

[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.480]
It's not going through.

[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:59.380]
We have a technical disaster, so it's a good day for you to have to go home.

[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.720]
You're the fax, fax, fax.

[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.040]
I know.

[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.940]
It says call pick up, but it's not.

[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.140]
That's all it says.

[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.920]
It just says call pick up, but it ain't picking up.

[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.460]
Here comes the sheet that will display what happened.

[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.220]
Why didn't go through?

[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.420]
From my end.

[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.080]
Excuse us folks.

[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.340]
We're having a technical breakdown.

[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.580]
I'm going to unplug it and plug it back in.

[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:24.920]
What?

[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:25.260]
Mine?

[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.720]
It's a busy.

[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.500]
I'm gonna go up these on plug your back

[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:34.860]
Why I'm gonna unplug mine and plug it back in oh yeah, just like that thing was gonna

[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.080]
Yeah, you're a maniac you're crazy first

[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.940]
I don't know what world you come from but that's the first thing you do when something ain't working it turn it off and on

[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:46.980]
Guess what it didn't work that doesn't mean that it doesn't always that's the first thing you have to do

[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:55.820]
The italos while we're on while we're on oh, that's gonna sound awful. I don't care better play some music

[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.040]
Wax over here

[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:09.080]
I was a little faster

[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.400]
We got new chemical brothers. I'm stuck on this song

[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.120]
I chemical brothers, right?

[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.180]
Yeah, I look something alright this is bad

[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.060]
Enjoy bell says

[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.160]
Okay, kill the music. Yo bell says what?

[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:35.180]
Tell me old equit bitching equipment fails from time to time to tell me the response I expect to hear

[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.060]
That's precisely what I'd expect to hear

[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:44.720]
In a technical disaster now have you died or something? What just happened there? I'm right here. What?

[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:47.480]
I don't know there. Oh, it's much worse than it was before bottom great

[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.760]
So I think if I can keep resetting it, I might it won't completely disappear. Well, let's contour with each other

[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.460]
Yeah, we're good

[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.600]
So I'm gonna keep resetting it during the break like 20 or 30 words and you're coming through you haven't dropped out or anything

[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.200]
No, I just stand there just as usually it is not on this end to understand

[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.880]
You know, he doesn't understand my frustration and the aggregation involved in this and you know

[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.200]
For getting about the quality of the calls the technical car like that. No except that it was on that end

[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:19.760]
I understand but I'm just making I'm just verifying I'm saying it for the record because it's always

[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.440]
99 and 910% of the time it's always on that end

[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.660]
I understand a call has exactly why should today be different from any other day. That's what they say in Ireland

[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.300]
And what what's he do a tell him to go to some management work?

[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.620]
Hope he and stuff worrying about this show you never worried about it before why shouldn't you start today?

[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.560]
We got some a dropouts on there two three but the green lights are on there now

[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.700]
We're streaming the facts machine now. How about if you try to send me a facts all right?

[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:52.340]
But your incoming is definitely not I think you have to unplug it because it's his busy. I think you got a jam on it

[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:22.600]
I'm going to make a tie tonight

[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.960]
This is that thing that's got that long bed in the middle which is good. Yeah, it's like a donut

[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.140]
Yeah, it's got a long big donut when a big hole in it

[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.360]
You could read a wetherie for your last thing is staying busy, but I know we're gonna work on that now

[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.780]
So that's okay. Well, we got 75 different problems. But don't be bitching out because jolly joey

[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.500]
He didn't really say that

[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:54.900]
He made it forward to the text he said he's saying with text message for writing it

[01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.720]
He wants I'm forwarding you the text yeah

[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:05.840]
Why did you just read it instead? I did and then you didn't believe me. So now I'm forwarding you the text

[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480]
Okay, here it comes

[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:15.320]
Tell me or the quit bitching equipment fails from time to time. That's great. That's what I read to you

[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.740]
Well tell Joe to a scu-rof you can reply what yourself possibly

[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:26.120]
God equipment fails from time to time. Yeah, see this is a real or I should say that is evidence

[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.820]
So stuff says yes

[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:33.620]
that you know having reset both of our units on each end twice and that not being

[01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:40.540]
You know the resolution that it has to be with AT&T and he put a call into them and if they start working on it

[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:44.380]
That means they're you know they'll take the line down so he's not going he's not

[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:49.200]
Oh, I just lost you in and last time I break for about a minute because I told me not to do that

[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.660]
Just a little two o'clock because in order for them to work on the line they're gonna have to bring it down completely

[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:59.520]
So I see what I'll do is I'm just not taking anymore calls which I know based on today will be had so far

[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.080]
Yeah, we're missing a lot very unfortunate

[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:08.040]
But no, I said also coming to you loud and queer yeah, and I've still got a pretty good pile of crap here a build up

[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.560]
Mm-hmm. I can probably just do my stories, you know

[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.800]
Mm-hmm. Oh you can spend some wax or both I got it going

[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.340]
Tell me other quit bitching

[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:22.980]
Equipment fails from time to time. This is a reflection of someone who has so little clue about what this is all about what we do

[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.200]
This is the part that's very sad. Well, it's one of the parts

[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.860]
Very very sad or going on

[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.620]
Like that. Gordon's helping

[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.320]
As supposed to saying we're doing something potentially constructive

[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.900]
You know, it's always the same

[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.900]
The same fat ass

[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.560]
Additive but that's okay

[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.520]
Because the thing on a pool of 10 days ago whenever was that was correct five more years of angst and grief

[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.880]
That's correct just keep the text coming. Oh, Jelly. Do you do a fabulous job on that?

[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.180]
I keep him coming nice and early and that's it

[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.700]
Quit your bitching. Quit your big number. In fact, what I'll do is I'll bid from now till two o'clock

[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.860]
Just as an active protest

[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:17.080]
Do you understand what that mean even means no, hey, of course now that he's got your your soft phone number and you do

[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.880]
We're such good buds. Oh, no, no, every time he wants to really a message to me

[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:27.080]
He he texts you on it or emails you right? Have you noticed that? Oh, yeah, like they're complaining about always a pick on

[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.980]
Mexicans there whatever that was a couple weeks ago

[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.460]
I actually got a chuck a lot of that he knew yeah

[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.280]
I was in an I run away

[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.700]
I'm supporting half of Mexico into Rotto when I was I know Mexican's I mean he can accuse me of a lot of things David

[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.980]
Fony David fake huh exactly

[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.780]
So anyway the the facts machine might be resolved. I don't know

[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:50.140]
Steps went over there and did something with it. He did it. He yeah

[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.700]
And we're gonna try to send it to fact me something or no no, no, I can facts out just fine

[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.600]
Or you can he says somebody over the weekend must have changed the

[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:04.400]
The receiving of some kind of change would change to the setting the receive vote somebody wasn't here pochking

[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.860]
And I know how unusual a QA is the door is what aggravates this and because what pray of the week is it?

[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.660]
It's Monday and what there is notorious when everything in the radio station is all screwed up and all the settings

[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.320]
They're on the risky and messed around with Monday

[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:25.100]
Happens from time to time that happens all too frequently here on Monday because it's a playground

[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.460]
It's a kitty court on the weekend even though I locked this studio door. I want to leave it was wide open propped

[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.960]
Sure Monday morning because everybody in their brother

[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:34.400]
I mean the way with it right when they're in have a field

[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.240]
They don't know how to say radio. That's what goes on a QA life was through my drawers and it doesn't even feel good

[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.140]
Oh, you just disappeared. Sorry. I'm right here. Oh

[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:49.120]
I mean it was bad before was like oh well and now it's like whole chunks of sentence are just dropping out

[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.280]
George is a dropout

[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.080]
No like that. That's it

[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:58.980]
That's what we got quit your bitching because Jolly dod all like it. Well, you know what we don't like it either

[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.120]
Like like we want to you know like we want to go through this every every couple of Mondays

[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.080]
Like when you came in this morning remember and I heard

[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:15.620]
You take the audio off from the station, but that I didn't hear anything and you hear me now I hear you

[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:21.200]
No, I'm talking this morning you had to do that. Yeah because of some setting with screwed up right

[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.580]
But you see when you start talking about things like this you're talking about

[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.220]
Languages that these people don't understand what's it got to do with the ball game for right?

[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:34.080]
What's it got to do with the draft? What's it got to do with the Marlins? What's it like that?

[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.360]
That's only language they speak and not only does it not do any good it just gets you laughed at

[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.300]
It gets what it gets you laughed at they just make fun of you for even trying

[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:50.920]
The most important person in the history of the Pono industry who have to 160 four very fun 139

[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.100]
They're really tight. They're close side by each they have 167 vote. I

[01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:04.420]
Don't watch Pono 59 sure Linda love lace 37-hour Goldstein 30 every after that everybody's kind of small taters including Ron Jeremy only 22

[01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:09.460]
How could Ron Jeremy be the most important person in history of porn while we're rubbing anybody vote other

[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.640]
Other than the fact he's on 400 TV shows

[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.420]
But you find that revenues are recognition

[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:23.320]
Remember that it people vote on the poll based on name recognition and whatever that he's double-rated me whatever they've heard of whatever name is most familiar to them

[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.420]
That's what they'll vote for

[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.380]
I see I

[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.460]
Not received a facts

[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.480]
You want I just received a facts so no yes

[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:36.560]
Mine no

[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.220]
What is it it's a poll suggestion?

[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:44.040]
I'm full for district just came through and a fax and are you gonna fax it to me and see if it's coming back?

[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.460]
I mean right it's actually not a bad idea. You're cutting out the way what what what it's a bad poll

[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.300]
No, I said not bad

[01:15:54.660 --> 01:16:00.000]
Not great, but I mean I mean what do you tell me what language you're spicking now? It's not a bad poll suggestion is what I said

[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.520]
Not my fault. You can only hear every other word. You know I only hear like every third word now

[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.240]
What I move bad move bad. Oh put your mission technical high-papens you know

[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.660]
Yeah, especially when you let a bunch of children run around and patch gear around with expensive equipment or even cheap equipment

[01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:18.940]
Okay, that's when it happens and why it happens, but oh no just took your shut up and dummy up about that's right

[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.220]
Okay, of course of what

[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.160]
Three suspended for not standing for a pledge of allegiance this story is enough to make me want to scream

[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.760]
So not to make me want to come down there and kill somebody in fact

[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.720]
Maybe Saturday when I'm down there for that appearance. Maybe I will kill some people

[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.480]
Sure make me feel a whole hell of a lot better

[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:39.900]
after the day

[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:46.620]
But you're not not a whole bunch of dropouts seven on one side and five on the other on the streaming and

[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.280]
I'm getting a facts. How do you like that? It must be the fact from George

[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.120]
I got it. It's a poll suggestion if I wasn't stuck in this dead end job

[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.780]
I probably would be blank a radio top show host a doctor

[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.940]
Aloya a sex therapist a drug dealer car salesman a rocket scientist a teacher a movie star an unemployed bum

[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:17.400]
I wouldn't do anything different than I'm doing now. That's not a bad poll. Why'd you say it was a bad poll?

[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:23.040]
It's from our good friends in Maruni dodget. I didn't you did then you say that

[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:24.600]
Greg

[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:29.580]
No, he said it would not be a bad idea to use this poll. I said it's not a bad poll

[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.380]
It's not my fault. I think it's a poll for tomorrow. I think that's a poll for tomorrow

[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:40.880]
What do you think sounds wait? I know if I faxed air kind of will go through and you want to know why because my fax machine works

[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.740]
Pretend I said whatever you want me to receive it farts it burps it

[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:50.280]
pukes it does it all man it takes a big smelly dump on the floor it does everything

[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.440]
So I'll get to that story at momentarily. Oh, here's another

[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.640]
What could this be?

[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:02.440]
Our city cards Madonna Priests I'll ticket access for a city card members. Don't you want to go see Madonna?

[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:08.360]
No, they're not you do. I'm good. No, no, thank you. Maybe Jeff Colton will take you to Rosemar Don

[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:22.380]
It's been about 30 years since his last cubic appearance before catching a plane to Canada

[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.280]
India to escape South Florida

[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:30.000]

Let me tell you something that comes to finishing the fight Rocky and I have a lot of comments don't write that any kid body

[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:45.320]
You stay with me. I never quit. I never get up and I know that we're going to make it together

[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.200]
This baby we're going to climb that mountain

[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.760]
You got to keep fighting you can't let him get you down

[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:54.920]
They are never old man you ever knew

[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.460]
You know why which people

[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:57.720]
Less

[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.400]
Don't give up now

[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.060]
You want any better? I like the man

[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:16.220]
Okay 14 to do in the five sixty-one we sound fine on this side everything on the center's right and fine is the I1 now you're in

[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:23.120]
Yeah, still cutting out. Yeah, anyway, so Clara's called and I explained the situation to him and he said okay

[01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:25.520]
You what he said okay

[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.340]
What does that mean?

[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.260]
Okay

[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:35.760]
It means an acknowledgement of whatever you just said I think and that's his

[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.420]
Here's what it didn't mean here's what it didn't mean

[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:47.880]
It didn't mean that he was going to get up and and go to wherever the wire is and and trace it

[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:52.860]
You know himself I told it's so bad right now, but it's just it enough to drive you insane

[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:59.540]
So in jolly jo and fat ass jolly jo since it obnoxious unacceptable text message like that tell me a quick bitch and

[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:03.380]
Equipment fails from time to time this to me is an indication that we're dealing with something

[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:07.600]
Much much much worse than ever dream we were in terms of that creature

[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.540]
Okay, you want me in terms of that thing the creature that

[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:18.440]
Thing I assume you've already got 500 copies about the rich pager article. No about clear channel

[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.260]
No, we'll then I'll send it right to you

[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:27.580]
Now for just a second there you sounded like you weren't cutting out. Oh, wouldn't that be something when that be a blessing and the higher

[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.300]
That's because I was holding my left hand you're cutting out all right

[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.700]
See if you say enough words and eventually that we see we have too much of this sure

[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.420]
I've been in the business for 500 years

[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:40.380]
So I know that there are technical things issues that come along. That's in a great while

[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:46.220]
Okay, and it probably maintained the situation once in a very while once every three months once every six months

[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:51.820]
I was every few weeks, but not every Monday or like several times during the course of a week not like that

[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:54.620]
fat ass jolly joe

[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.600]
What did he do before I was he like a sales guy is that what is

[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.720]
Jo I know aren't all managers don't they come from some pencil pushing position?

[01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:04.040]
Yeah, or another

[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.020]
Never from programming never from on air

[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:13.760]
Never from somebody that actually sat in a studio and did do what is that right what you doing somebody who knows how to add columns of numbers

[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.740]
Three is suspended for not standing for Pledge of Allegiance

[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.040]
Three small town eighth graders in Minnesota were suspended by the principal for not standing

[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.660]
Thursday morning for the Pledge of Allegiance

[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:30.200]
violating a district policy that the principal NOS's may soon be rewarded to protect three speech rights

[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:35.020]
My son wasn't being defied against America said Kim Dahle mother of one of the students branch

[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:38.340]
With ten silver with glimpsed in felton junior high school in northwestern Minnesota

[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:43.740]
Brand told the firm newspaper in felver that Thursday's one day in school suspension was kind of dumb

[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.800]
Because I didn't do anything wrong. It should be the people's choice

[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.380]
Adaboy grant brand whatever your name is he's right

[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:53.640]
Kim Dahle said the punishment didn't fit the crime if they wanted to know why he didn't stand

[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.780]
They should have made him write a paper

[01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:00.800]
She said her son has been declining to stand all school year offer no reason for sitting was not way to explain his actions

[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.420]
I got faxed is coming here

[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.100]
They are

[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:13.460]
Author argues to channel destroyed radio was there any doubt about that I thought this was going to be something new and

[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.320]
Groundbreaking well we know it

[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.060]
The school's handbooks says all students have required to stand but not required to recite the pledge

[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:26.440]
The same is true for all four schools in the district of school official said sounds like a bunch of fascism to me

[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.560]
So tough you got to stand and you got to put your hand over your heart and we said a bunch of mumbo jumbo sounds like a fascist bunch of cramps

[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.720]
These three students didn't and they got caught said mel Olson the district's community education director

[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:44.020]
He said he backs the punishment paying a federal and the US citizen absolutely Olson served in the Marines in Japan during the Vietnam war

[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.280]
Whatever that has to do with this

[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:52.100]
The head of the Minnesota AC and you said the school's actions against the students are unconstitutional

[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:55.520]
And his office and from the district of that today in a strongly worded letter

[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.100]
Hubs are in dread

[01:23:57.620 --> 01:23:58.620]
If they said

[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:03.880]
The school can't do that that's illegal said Chuck Samuel send these celebrity groups executive director wow

[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.120]
What does that mean wow well that's what it says that information oh

[01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:12.860]
But it's in quotes who said wow

[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.200]
Meach no

[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:23.760]
Samuelson said that numerous US Supreme Court released a into the 40s saying well-settle constitutional law that students have refused to participate in the pledge cannot be punished for refusing to participate

[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:32.160]
Samuelson said he surprised that any public school district would have such a pledge of requirement given that state law allows for students and teachers to decide not to participate

[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.560]
Most days have the same opt-out provision when it doubt he chooses to opt-out

[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:43.700]
So I'm not getting up for the invocation at the some stupid dolphin game like that like I stopped doing when some gets used on it

[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:49.220]
In Jesus name on man. Oh my god talk about insensitivity talk about grotesque

[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:54.760]
All these Jews and Broward are sitting in their room and paid through their nose what ever since was a religion about sensitivity

[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.360]
Now that's true

[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.300]
In St. Paul said district spokesman how a padea students can be respectfully not participate in the pledge of allegiance

[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:06.580]
Many after the schools treat pledge participation the same way is that padea or padella

[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:10.800]
Take a pick well after asked the other one the the suitcase bomber take your speak

[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:17.820]
Calling hold them the principal is suspended the three ignos in the same at late this morning the policy requirement all students will stand

[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:24.380]
They need to be modified to address the protected individuals from our expression. Oh, it's about time Colleen you queen

[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.860]
Kimball said hope and call to this morning and form worthy possible accommodation

[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:35.260]
I think they're handling it quite professionally Kimball said at him that whole room total that school officials are taking some steps to the

[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:39.720]
So take the suspensions off their records suspended assentants my ass

[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:46.680]
God for not standing up for the pledge of allegiance those kids ought to go to school and like beat somebody up like they're the teacher would be good

[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:52.260]
That possible shit was met with disappointment from ultimately said he'd fallen in line with whatever changed me a cure

[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:57.520]
I still have my beliefs he said well who cares that's male. That's the Amaring guy

[01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:02.060]
Early in the day Olson said that a very nice announcement was made at the start of the junior high school day

[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:04.480]
Reminding the students that they must stand for the pledge

[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:10.340]
Hope them said that all students this morning were involved in some fashion during the pledge adding that no additional suspensions were needed

[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:16.180]
Maybe they were like boosting each other during the pledge and said putting their hand over their parts hearts. That's right parts

[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:22.680]
How are the family of 14 year old Bishop Eden still the form that he was suspended from school Friday because he wouldn't stand for the pledge

[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:25.820]
But was quickly invited back once again because her homestead apologies

[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:29.520]
A policy change might be needed. That's what's going on inside America, baby

[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.080]
Suspending kids from school they bring weapons to school. That's okay

[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.060]
They bring drugs to school. That's even better

[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:41.460]
But if they don't want to stand up for the stupid ass pledge allegiance. Well, that's an American and that's a well

[01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.480]
Yeah, right

[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:48.040]
We don't have any rights anymore. By the way, you know who I saw yesterday and some I don't know what channel was on

[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:52.340]
Some local vehicle channel. There was a couple years old interview with Gord Vidal

[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.640]
Okay, was it Gord Vidal? I don't know when the last time you saw him was

[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:02.080]
I don't remember the first turn. I mean, I know he's 80 85 some like that. He doesn't look a day over 190

[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:09.000]
He was wearing a sweater that was up like to the bottom of a chin other and obviously to cover up his neck and all the drooping hanging

[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.780]
Right skin and wrinkly you know, I'm saying the sagging flesh and he was he wasn't talking that not craggy but like he could barely speak

[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:17.000]
He was having difficulty speaking

[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.380]
I'm afraid the growing could have been with us too long. I could be wrong. I hope I'm wrong

[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.540]
It's one of those things people are dying every day, man. There's an epidemic of it. It's going around

[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.260]
Just like us here on Q.A.M. Do you see that book?

[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.520]
Hey, I saw it. I'm trying to forget about it. Oh, you sounded good. I heard that whole sentence there. You didn't drop out

[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:41.560]
Give it a shot one bright day in the middle of the night two dead boys got up to fight back up you're coming out of your room

[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:47.780]
For just a second there I had a false and then of course I thought well if that's the case we'll take a whole bunch of calls today still

[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:51.340]
Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, I know what that was jolly Joe

[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:55.900]
That was a retard that was a retort to my I comment about his great job with the electronics

[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:59.680]
Yeah, that must be what that is maybe he's a little silly about that. Well, it's okay

[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.880]
If you put him on a home like I told him

[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.960]
Well, but that takes away all the fun from the calls, you know

[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:09.920]
Yep, I'm not interested in oh, let's talk to Tony in the mirror mar I don't want to go back and do that no more

[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.760]
That's garbage. That's bad. That is so boring

[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:17.920]
I mean I could be wrong. What do I know about it? You know that's right

[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:23.860]
586 on the pole. It's a real two-hospers who have their 169 Larry from 145

[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.900]
And here's this rich factor factor

[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.400]
Author argues clear channel destroyed radio. It's too long. I'll do it after the break afternoon

[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.200]
And then how come nobody is on this story as managers says oh Jay confessed to killing ex-wife

[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.420]
Why's nobody on that? How come I'm not seeing anything about that? I don't know

[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.140]
Here's a story camper crunch because of the price of gas. Thank you

[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:49.800]
Mr. Prisoners of great gas prices, but nevertheless nothing about oh Jay are confessed

[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:54.540]
Aren't you anxious to hear that say yes? Yes, pretend you are I'd pretend

[01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:01.520]
Rich Richard Pactor right of the dial the rise and clear. Oh, this is a brook

[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:03.980]
The

[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:08.560]
Rise of clear channel in the fall commercial radio although he didn't write it Alex Foggy wrote it

[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.440]
220 pages. I know rich Pactorshers. I'll invite no book

[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:29.040]
The coach Don Schueller and I sound like Bob Hope on acid and I want to tell you it's the 12-door power or whatever it is

[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:36.680]
There's no telling how high gas prices will go

[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:44.640]
Since nobody wants to tell big oil no one way to tell them that we've had enough is to spend

[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.480]
To spend on the pump

[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:49.140]
To spend

[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.640]
On the pump so what you think of those oil rich pumps?

[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:00.040]
We're getting tired of them gouging us to spend

[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.620]
Like the spent on the pump

[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:09.200]
Your gas station older will be with you

[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:13.180]
He has the same kind of trouble too

[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:17.280]
Lean his pumps all covered in cool and spend

[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.000]
Spend on his pump

[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:28.240]
Spend on the pump show them your gratitude when you fill up

[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:31.680]
In the Saudis of kickin their junk

[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:35.360]
Spend on the pump

[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:41.720]
Taking advantage as they gouging rain

[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:45.180]
Just how much of this could you tolerate?

[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:49.840]
Grow a big pair and expect the rain and spend

[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.540]
Spend on the pump

[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.980]
Spend on the pump

[01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:00.860]
Our leaders don't have the balls to step up

[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:05.200]
Grow a step further and take a big dump in this bed

[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.020]
Spend on the pump

[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:10.900]
Spend on the pump

[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:16.180]
Show them your angry and freely fed up

[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:20.600]
No one will help us as tight to get tough so spend

[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.220]
Spend on the pump

[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:26.620]
I know that you I am you know what this reminds me of

[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.860]
The more I think about that text message from your buddy fed

[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.640]
I strongly Joe Bell yes my pal it takes me back to what you were talking about last week

[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.840]
I believe we're reminiscing about boy Geary

[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.760]
Yes, saying to you if you can't get control of that show

[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.960]
We'll get somebody in there who can that's an exact quote

[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:40.680]
Yeah

[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:44.540]
See because I think he's confused maybe as you confuse with

[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:46.580]
Zack even there is about a 300 pound weight difference

[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:48.700]
What he thinks I'm gonna put the pump on the pump master

[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.500]
You're the puppet master and I'm the puppet right

[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:53.500]
Senior wits has held me to quit bitching at a quit talking about this

[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.040]
There you go that's not the way it works on this show

[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:59.140]
We're a ventriloquist act don't you know never did never will

[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.000]
So I want to inform him of that

[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.020]
I think it has your big meeting about your pay increase right

[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.880]
Well, maybe this part of your new duties you're not aware of yet

[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.200]
Take control of the show

[01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:14.260]
Oh you're the puppet master yeah you're dropping out so bad now it's like

[01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:17.840]
Maddening just insane well at this point I'm doing it on purpose

[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:22.960]
Not probably it was probably it like the uh that was the mic's way fat bag it

[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:27.500]
Richard Pankter writes author argues clear channel destroyed radio

[01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:31.160]
This is in the hero no less so consider that and considers from rich Pankter

[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:36.520]
The name clear channel became shorthand for everything wrong with terrestrial on satellite radio

[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:40.920]
lack of diversity, repetitions, music, boring programming, too many commercials

[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.600]
Sensorship Jingle wisdom, ad nauseam

[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.720]
In a previous life I was very familiar with radio first as a record promotion man

[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.960]
And later as a marketing executive at a trade publication for radio managers

[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:55.700]
Initially I encountered a variety of stations mostly independently owned or proud of small chains

[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.920]
Few companies held more than a handful of stations

[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.480]
Do mainly do the limitations imposed by federal law

[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:03.560]
But that all changed with the telecommunications act of 96

[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.940]
Which lifted most limits for corporate acquisition of broadcast properties

[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:09.640]
And allowed ownership of multiple stations in a single market

[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:12.740]
In the industry the resulting change was called consolidation

[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:15.660]
Writer Alex Fogge is an anthropologist

[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:16.280]
And old Fogge

[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.720]
Alex Fogge's interest in the subject of radio in general and clear channel in particular was piqued

[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:24.700]
When he became aware of the uniformity of radio stations programming during a long-ish family

[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.920]
Cartrop he wanted to know why the music was so blind and over familiar

[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.980]
He begins with a brief history of top 40 radio

[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:35.080]
The company that later became clear channel and its founder Texan Lauri Maze

[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:39.500]
He knew nothing about the broadcasting business according to Fogge was a shrewd and opportunistic

[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.440]
Binoceman who viewed radio as a unique industry with unparalleled potential for growth

[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:48.160]
As the story continues Maze builds his business and is pro-intake of energy sweeping

[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.300]
Pro-business trend toward deregulation

[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:54.880]
Acquiring numerous station G6 efficiencies by limiting various redundancies

[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.640]
Among them were physical facilities

[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.640]
So Fogge writes about how in markets where the company own several stations as in South Florida

[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.720]
All are based in a single building sharing a common management team

[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.900]
As well as the administrative and engineering staff

[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.600]
But the downside became apparent as the crosscutting continued

[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.740]
Indeed the company's nickname of cheap channel

[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:13.500]
was earned I wonder where he got that

[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:18.480]
Was earned by their elimination of incumbent talent on the promotion of lower paid employees

[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.820]
At the same time through automation and other tools

[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.420]
Live local announcers were replaced by pre-recorded programming or voice tracking

[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:29.880]
With the on-air content for a multitude of stations originating in a remote studio from a single announcer

[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:33.400]
The same voice and personality host to show in Orlando for example

[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:36.080]
If she's really sitting in a studio in San Antonio or Omaha

[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.700]
And the local news component of most clear channel stations had also been reduced or eliminated

[01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:45.140]
With several striking examples of the absence of reporting during local disasters set in the book

[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:49.000]
Fogge also writes about other issues such as the company's corporate culture

[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.780]
With the controversial practices and behavior of managers including Randy Michaels

[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:56.220]
Who came into the photos of his other clear channels purchase of the J-core chain

[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.960]
This recovers a lot of ground including the company's politics which are more expedient than

[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.280]
The ideological current of Fogge

[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.480]
But ultimately media consolidation has been a disappointment as evidenced by AOL time

[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.880]
Or in other failed mega mergers

[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.460]
Cleartaneless already starting to disassemble the result of this exercise the vitality

[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.400]
Radio with a local medium will likely never return

[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.680]
Right of the dial explains how this purchase culturally economic institution was exploited and destroyed

[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.520]
Well and we're all set rich fact. I gotta get the book now

[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.660]
I guess huh? I reckon right of the dial the rising third channel the rising third channel

[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:31.880]
The full commercial radio by Alice Foe G e Fogge Fogge

[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.820]
Farber and Farber 320 pages

[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:38.620]
I got an idea. Yes. I'll order it for you through Amazon Canada and then you get like you know

[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.820]
And if I live to be a hunter I'll get him come on the same life as a lot of books right

[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.880]
Maybe a quarter shot. I can show me that slot book

[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.180]
Maybe you can raise on book and give me some pointers although I have really a big weekend

[01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:51.740]
I'm looking on a lucky streak

[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:52.980]
Yes, I did

[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:01.100]
Okay, now I just I'm waiting for you to I'm just I thought a whole bunch of funny stuff right there

[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.660]
You must think of the dropout. No, it's still dropping out

[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:10.760]
And it does it's it's just very strange too because I hear like three quarters of a sentence and a bit like like somebody hit you in the

[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.180]
Adam's apple, you know, maybe they did

[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.720]
I'm gonna give you a whack in the sack

[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:20.940]
I see now I'm telling you to give the numbers out

[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.740]
Have a Q a m. Hello

[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.880]
Yes, sir

[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:28.600]
Yeah

[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:37.120]
The one building everything I think you really enjoy that book

[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:42.020]
It's a very good book. Okay. I'm gonna go out and get it George. I have something I have one request

[01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:46.540]
Yes, that's it. That's just a choice of proof and choice not approved

[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:52.860]
Yeah, that's a great thing whenever you can play it. I would really like to hear it. Okay. I think I think

[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.160]
I know he's not talking about no more fast. I rejected. Joyce's already talking about yes

[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.300]
STD lady Mr. Jones

Approved by Joyce Farts sounds

[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:08.940]
Rejected by Joyce online gambling scams

[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:13.400]
Approved by Joyce words containing the word bag

[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:18.760]
Rejected by Joyce erectile dysfunction spots

[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:25.300]
Resoundingly approved by Joyce to the sounds resembling Farts sounds

[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.400]
Rejected by Joyce Blake in sports related

Happily approved by Joyce Farts sounds

[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:46.280]
Rejected by Joyce rejected the whole world has been rejected by this because most people do fart and sometimes loud too

[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:52.020]
And boy that just gets through while when there's that alley fulching on CNN again the egghead

[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:59.100]
Linda Deutsch writes for the associate of press ex managers as OJ Simpson confessed to killing her swive how do you like that?

[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:04.980]
Mm-hmm. Now why are they screaming about this why are they like uh frying his ass right on TV right now as we speak

[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.180]
That's what I'd like to know

[01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:13.840]
A member B. Aditor who profited from OJ Simpson for many years is the latest former crony to write a tell-all book

[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.060]
This one alleging a groggy Simpson high on marijuana confessed to killing his wife after he was acquitted

[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:20.800]
Mike Gilbert

[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.620]
No wrong Gilbert Mike Gilbert also claims he up to his former friend we're all the murder charges

[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:29.480]
By suggesting how to blow his hand and festiny. There's no doubt in my mind

[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:36.180]
Simpson's career lawyer Yelga Lander said none of Gilbert's claims are true and that Gilbert is a delusional drug addict who needs money

[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:38.620]
He's fallen on very hard times. He's in trouble the IRS

[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.620]
I talked to OJ about it said geliner refused to Ross Simpson to come in directly because it was upcoming robbery trial Vegas

[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:48.080]
This stuff not only didn't occur, but it's not factually supported by the evidence

[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:50.500]
He said he had to go enter

[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:55.560]
The name calling in accusations on both sides so that deep wounds persist in a phone interview

[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.960]
Gilbert called gladder and ambulance taster and an abler and denier for OJ

[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.700]
I know I used to do the same thing. I understand the game. He said

[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:06.220]
He acknowledged he has IRS problems which he says were caused by Simpson

[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:10.000]
But said I could take a drug test and pass it. I highly doubt that OJ could

[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.660]
Gilbert is the second sports memorabilia delunde writer Simpson book this year

[01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:19.660]
Thomas Ritchie who arranged the Vegas memorabilia sail the load of Simpson's robbery arrest penned busted last month

[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:24.940]
Simpson and self participated in the controversial book if I did it which he claimed was not a confession

[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:29.420]
It was withdrawn by the publisher eventually the release last year by the Goldman family to help satisfy that

[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.640]
$33.5 million rump full-veth judgment

[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:33.700]
I wonder how many copies they sold

[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:39.300]
Gilbert said he continued to represent Simpson for another decade after the alleged confession

[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:45.220]
talking adamant with his autograph hiding the profits and helping Simpson shield his possessions so they couldn't be seized by the golden family

[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:50.560]
Gilbert also claims that he counseled the jail Simpson during his murder trial to stop taking his arthritis medicine

[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.380]
So his hands would swell up and not fit the bloody gloves in court

[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:56.360]
He offers no proof Simpson followed his advisor they was taking any medicine

[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.280]
But the drama that played out in court when the gloves didn't fit was central to Simpson's offense

[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:04.540]
If it doesn't fit then you're full of Schmidt and number Johnny Cochrane is dead by the way still yep

[01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:06.440]
If they don't fit your full of Schmidt

[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:11.180]
Well, we know you did it. Oh, Jay everybody with a brain knows that so I just come on you know

Do you have any senses in there? Maybe you could like attack Ricky with a knife on air

[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.900]
But with that not do anything serious. So there may be killing it other than that

[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:24.620]
wounded

[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.920]
Yeah, I moved him say you know fatally

[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.960]

But then again the juxtapher's you know. Oh, he was my hero. He was a great athlete. You know like that crap

[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:38.700]
And that's all accounts you've got to understand that I do understand it

[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:42.860]
Well, they they're they're wanting you to risk pick him one language and we're in another universe back to another

[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.940]
They're not even radio rush when worlds collide. Oh

[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.180]
Now you got through that whole sentence and didn't cut out. I keep hoping I'm against hope

[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.140]
For a dollar seriously. Yep

[01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.620]
You're doing that now I'm

To the fact me yeah, I do a reach your run so I heard I'd like to many a time and still you're not popular

[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.320]

Popular as y'all to be

[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.980]
Now you gotta tell you spin some wax to rest of the show and they are what

[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.720]
Oh

[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:17.240]
Dead is all around me everybody is broke

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.180]
The economy is brownies they got us by the scroll

[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.900]
Again

[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:32.520]

[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:40.000]
For the

[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.060]
Fishes

[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:45.300]
This country is the precious rose

[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:55.120]
After tiny unleavened, the stage was set

[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:59.480]
For the Leo comes to grab all the goods

[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:04.140]
They trickled it up to the one percent

[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:08.960]
It made us all a reckless birthday

[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:13.960]
With this beat of recession

[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.460]
The headlines for the news

[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:23.240]
There's people going concrete

[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:26.680]
You won't see that on the news

[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.100]
It's like the 1930s

[01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.460]
Under the waves of bad

[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.740]
We're just the rich of dirty

[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:45.120]
And afforded by gas

[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:53.360]
The corporate news paid first

[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.060]
They hit with a plan

[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:59.640]
The ones that I use for the sheets I'm hiding

[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.300]
You pay for the dirty, clean and feminine control

[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:09.360]
They got us blind and now we got it just for you

[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:14.000]
We really need the questions

[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.660]
But they don't want you to go

[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.280]
For the world's richest country

[01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.520]
This is the precious rose

[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.140]
Yet this is the precious rose

[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:35.580]
This is the precious rose

[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:38.640]
Probably T-560WQAM happy Monday too

[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.520]
We've had some technical issues today

[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.020]
But we're not going to bitch about it because

[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:42.660]
That's right

[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:43.880]
It fails from time to time

[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.640]
That's right

[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:46.840]
That's what Jolly Joe says

[01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:50.460]
That's fat as Jolly Joe's response to our plight

[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:51.540]
Who then fails from time to time

[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.300]
And I'm quit your bitch and quit your bitch and

[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:56.360]
Now is this something new that he's going to be starting here

[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.560]
As I interfering in the content

[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.940]
Why not?

[01:44:59.020 --> 01:44:59.560]
Why not?

[01:44:59.740 --> 01:44:59.780]
Why not?

[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:00.820]
Wait, you know what? Screw him

[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:04.060]
Keep your fat nose out of his show

[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:05.600]
Okay, that's my suggestion to you

[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:08.340]
With all the other problems

[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.060]
And the stories and the angst and the grief

[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:11.820]
That have gone on these last couple of years

[01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:13.020]
At least that's one thing

[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.700]
Of course as far as the censors you're bet another thing

[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:17.460]
Are you being censored?

[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.140]
I'm being, oh yeah

[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:24.920]
That's just, it's just, on a Monday no less

[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.440]
Right out of the box, right out of the bag

[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.520]
Right off the bat, right from the get-go

[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:34.840]
The new mayor of Rome has promised to purge the Italian capital of 20,000 legal immigrants

[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.940]
And to raise 85 gypsy camps

[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:37.680]
What are you talking about?

[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:39.240]
What I'm overdo, my god

[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:40.000]
Oh, right

[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.600]
Johnny Alamano, 50 of Firebrand Neo-Fascist

[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.280]
And the first right-wing mayor of the city since the Second World War

[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.620]
A Firebrand Neo-Fascist, wow!

[01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.160]
Sounds like a while ago what we got

[01:45:53.020 --> 01:45:56.700]
Vow to make Rome secure as he was sworn into office after his election on the weekend

[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.120]
He likes to Mr. Alamano confirmed a strong shift to the right-by Italians

[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.220]
Who have been sick and biased fate of violent crimes committed by immigrants

[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:06.960]
Earlier this month the center-wide leader

[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:10.740]
And one of the world's biggest crooks Sylvia Birloscone was realy through this Prime Minister

[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:15.900]
And the former government and partnership with Umberto Borsi, the leader of the anti-immigration Northern League

[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:20.120]
And a sign of things to come after Mr. Alamano's election, Mr. Birloscone declared

[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:21.560]
We have a new flange

[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:25.380]
The original flange or fail-axe was the Spanish fascist party

[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:29.020]
Thou did in the 1930s, whose doctrine was adopted by Francisco Franco

[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:29.900]
Great

[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.280]
Well least he's being honest now

[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.980]
About being a fascist

[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.600]
Mr. Alamano's election was celebrated by hundreds of supporters chanting

[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.220]
Duce, Duce, and raising their arms and whistling these fascist salute

[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:44.580]
Oh boy, how do you like that? Or maybe they're saying Ducey, Ducey

[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.540]
It'll Ducey is back

[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:53.340]
The new mayor said that his first action would be to begin immediate expulsions of the 25,000 immigrants in the city with criminal records

[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.120]
We cannot welcome them without discipline

[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.560]
He said we will chase out the delinquents

[01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.620]
There are 85 abusive nomad camps to destroy

[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:08.420]
The other that he would visit the widower of Giovanna Regiani, 47-year-old woman who was beaten raped and killed by a Romanian immigrant who lived at such a camp last November

[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:12.100]
I want to promise him that what happened to his wife would never happen again

[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:20.980]
He said, Walter Veltroni is left for impredecessor, was widely criticized for paying more attention to ancient monuments and film festivals than the problems with the city's infrastructure and security

[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:28.960]
Mr. Alamano was the youth leader of the fascist Italian social movement, and was a Celtic cross, a symbol of the extreme right

[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:33.300]
Is that how you say it or you say Celtic like the Boston South?

[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:34.880]
I like to mix it up, keep people guessing

[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:35.960]
No, mix and match?

[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:36.840]
That's right, mix

[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:45.140]
However he said he wore the cross-own as a religious symbol and attributed to Apollo V in LA, if I write activists to a stone to death in a Roman street protest 25 years ago

[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.420]
Mr. Alamano said he was sick of the continuing search for

[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:52.660]
For my dark side, adding I'm bitterly upset from a personal point of view with his demonization

[01:47:53.560 --> 01:48:02.340]
He promised to be a mere for all Romans and immediately send letters to the Vatican and the Romans Jewish community, Graziano Halaholovic, a spokesman for one of Rome's biggest settlements of Rome at Gypsy

[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:08.260]
He said, we fear there will be nighttime raids on the camps we want to save city too, some of our members have heard their parents' stories of fascism

[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:14.800]
Mr. Bosse said that once the immigrants had to be hunted out and that if reforms were not forthcoming his followers would take up arms

[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.840]
Let's go kill some Gypsies they need

[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.160]
We have no fear of taking things to the piazza as we have 300,000 martyrs ready to come down from the mountains the life was always smoking he said

[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.380]
This smoking baby

[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:32.340]
Mr. Alamano was promised to tear down a twelve million dollar pond, it's twenty-five million dollar museum around the Alap

[01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:36.860]
Apaches and all the time your emperor Augustus Apaches and toughest

[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:37.840]
That's what I thought

[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:45.360]
The sleek modernist building designed by US architect Richard Meyer looks more, took more than a decade to build was immediately labeled by one critic as resembling a pizza real

[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:47.460]
Oh for me!

[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:52.180]
A twenty-five million dollar pizza real, oh mama mia spicy meatball

[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.120]
Wow

[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:58.420]
That was crazy Italians man they ran it again, that's good get those gypsies running down router right on

[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.820]
Get in the hell out of there

[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.460]
Believe me I know from personal experience right at the time I was mugging they took my credit cards

[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:05.200]
That's right

[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:07.620]
Now we need him over here to do the same thing

[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.120]
You don't kind of know gypsies except the ones that want to like do your driveway

[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.520]
They're gypsies

[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.140]
Why?

[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.320]
I got gypsy neighbors

[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:16.720]
Do you really?

[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:17.340]
I really do

[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:19.780]
The wheel deal

[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:22.100]
Maybe I ought to play gypsy women by Brian Highland

[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.240]
Or the gypsy cry by Lucriste

[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:25.260]

[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:35.620]
Oh tell Neil to quit playing wax, spin and wax

[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:39.860]
Oh gypsies tramsting there, I can share too

[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:40.820]

[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:45.460]
Let's find out

[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:51.640]
Yeah, from safety and questions here but what was that?

[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:53.900]
It's not so bad I can't even hear it

[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:56.240]
I can't find that

[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.160]
Okay, good luck

[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:03.000]

[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:17.700]
Jenna Janison 17

[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:18.780]
Sake the 17

[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:20.240]
Christy Canyon 11

[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:21.600]
Jeff Stryker 10

[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:22.360]
Peter North 8

[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.060]
Nina Hartley 7

[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:25.540]
Bob Bucci only 7

[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:26.720]
Victoria Perris 1

[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.000]
And Randy West finally got a vote

[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.360]
Somebody with that eyesight

[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.040]
Maybe they got it, build a perfect game

[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.860]
Voted for Randy West

[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:40.320]
So I guess it's going to be this way to 2 o'clock right?

[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:41.860]
Yes, at least

[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:44.800]
And Chris, he's home

[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:45.660]
Yes

[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.460]
Now wouldn't you have thought that he would have called in

[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:51.900]
And said I'm going to allow maybe he told you that you just, huh?

[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:53.060]
He did and I told you

[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:53.980]
And you forgot

[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.300]
I was just in such shock that I couldn't believe it

[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.920]
Now I'm giving up, I'm turning around and going home

[01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:02.040]
Of course for A.O. he would waste more money and gas

[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:04.280]
I'm coming away all the way through that mess

[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.460]
And he would make our week

[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:07.720]
So that was a good choice Chris

[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:09.980]
We'll let him off the hook for all time sake

[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:11.320]
What are you saying?

[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:12.340]
Sure, when I

[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:14.580]
Yeah, sure

[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:19.360]
25 pass known at 560 WQA and your home of weekly

[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:21.420]
A technical incompetence and of course Jolly Joe

[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:22.240]
The Quirky mention

[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.080]
What was the line?

[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:26.780]
Equipment, favors, happen

[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:32.120]
By the way I got a message from someone offering to give me a copy of that book to give to you when I see it

[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:32.640]
Ooh, great

[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:33.260]
Okay

[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:34.980]
The one about a Quirky channel?

[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:35.680]
That one

[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:36.760]
Hmm

[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:39.060]
That is fantastic news

[01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:41.140]
Thank you so much whoever I was generous enough to enrich

[01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:43.520]
Rich Packter himself?

[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.260]
I don't know

[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:45.900]
A bigger burn?

[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.520]
I don't know if it's the Rich Packter

[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:49.500]
I'm sure it is

[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:50.980]
Thanks Rich

[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:53.340]
In spite of what chicken exes about you, you're okay

[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:55.300]
Why do they hate each other so much?

[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.540]
I'm sure it's a long story that I don't want to remember

[01:51:57.540 --> 01:51:59.260]
It was way way back

[01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.300]
It was way way back

[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:03.340]
Pass known at Q&A

[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:04.500]
Floating balls

[01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:08.960]
This Friday night on NBC's to catch your predator

[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:12.160]
Roger Clemens, sweet so 15-year-old

[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.660]
What is your bring me?

[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:16.980]
Got your baseball autograph by me and a hamburger

[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:19.060]
I love hamburgers

[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:21.520]
Yeah, me too and I like 15-year-olds

[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.320]
Oh cool, cool

[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:23.520]
So what do you want to do?

[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:25.380]
Let's go with karaoke bar

[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.980]
Okay, so do you bring the condoms?

[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.560]
Yep, the date was going fine

[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.500]
Until Chris Hanson showed up

[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:30.800]
How are you?

[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:33.080]
Fine, fine, but listen, I'm not giving all of your regards today

[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.880]
I just want to see it right over there and give a sentence

[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:35.760]
Why, who are you?

[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:37.400]
I'm Chris Hanson with Bayline NBC

[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:40.300]
And we'll do a mystery on adults who try to meet teens online

[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.600]
That's great, pal, but listen

[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.600]
I'm Roger Clemens and you're kind of a block of me still

[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:45.820]
Why don't you just get out of here?

[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:47.440]
Don't miss, too catch your predator

[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:49.000]
Featuring Roger Clemens

[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.560]
This Friday night on NBC

[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:51.940]
I can't wait

[01:52:51.940 --> 01:53:21.920]
It's 12,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:51.840]
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, for this new beginning of the war, in American poetry.

[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:51.840]

[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:51.840]

[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:51.900]
I've talked about what we probably called solidoutheast joy matter,

[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:51.900]

[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.020]
to be delivered with editions of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette newspaper.

[01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:01.000]
Sinny researchers, Pittsburgh, a program with a Colorado Springs, Colorado-based International

[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.480]
Bible study, hopes to send the new testaments to the paper and subscribers now in the

[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.400]
county and support our communities on September 7th.

[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:13.500]
I can just interrupt the reading of this very depressing story just to point one thing

[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:13.680]
out.

[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:19.760]
And that is that the people who peddled this garbage never, ever talk about the people

[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.000]
who wrote the Bible.

[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:21.420]
No.

[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.320]
They never talk about what kind of people they were, what kind of mentality they had.

[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:27.580]
If their IQ is large enough, they're a thumbnail.

[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.100]
Don't talk about how they had slaves in a whole bunch of lines.

[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:35.340]
No, in the fact that there were a time there was a clap of thunder or a bolt of lightning.

[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.120]
Oh God, it's right there.

[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:37.400]
Right.

[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.840]
His wax is rafting that, et cetera.

[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:39.760]
They believed it in practice.

[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.180]
Jetta's side, human sacrifice.

[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.900]
His wax is rafting.

[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:47.620]
The group has delivered custom designed by us to newspapers and subscribers and several

[01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:48.860]
other cities across the country.

[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.740]
An effort to find innovative ways of spreading a Christian message.

[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:56.580]
Last month, the group distributed 140,000 new testaments in Philadelphia and Chester counties.

[01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:00.780]
It plans to set up another 260,000 in Montgomery, Boxing, and Eleborr counties in November.

[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:05.760]
In Pittsburgh, the Bibles will have a front cover showing the city's golden triangle where

[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:09.600]
the Menonga Hill and Allegheny Rivers from New Ohio River and a photograph of Seedless

[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.520]
Football players kneeling in prayer on the back cover.

[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.660]
It will also include testimonies by well-known Pittsburghers.

[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:18.320]
A representative of the Post-Kissette couldn't be reached for comment.

[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:24.920]
Susan Smith of Sewickley, who co-chairs City Reachers Pittsburgh with her husband Tom, said

[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:29.680]
the books title, Our City Gods World, Our Designed or Gods Word, excuse me, are designed

[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:31.720]
to entreat people so they'll open them and read them.

[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.480]
Oh a bulletin from Inside Radio.

[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:37.280]
Clear Channel Buyout Now a $36.

[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.660]
The Wall Street Journal says the settlement appears imminent in the Clear Channel Buyout

[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.300]
Rob by Bain Capital and Teed.

[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:44.960]
Who cares?

[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.500]
Okay, just like that guy said.

[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:48.860]
They've destroyed the Abinus.

[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:50.160]
They're going to stay about it.

[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.760]
So far the organization has raised just 250 grand of the 625,000 out of need to distribute

[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:58.300]
the new testimonies to 250,000 households.

[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:01.680]
It hasn't until May 31 to raise the remaining money to meet a printing deadline.

[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.220]
I'm sure George will kick in over the towel, kick it.

[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:10.220]
City researchers, Pittsburghers, we see large relations from the Thomas J. and Sandra

[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:14.320]
Usher Foundation and the Wagon Morning Star Foundation is well a 16 grand from a local

[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.080]
Christian radio station, W-O-R-G-F-M, the word.

[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.560]
I'm listening to the word, baby.

[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:21.500]
The word of...

[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:22.680]
That's it.

[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:23.160]
Word.

[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:26.860]
A steering committee working on the project includes several local high profile religious

[01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:27.200]
figures.

[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:31.140]
The International Bible Society is one of the world's largest trans-life business distributors

[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:31.720]
of scriptures.

[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:35.400]
You have merged with England based on the light one largest distributors of Christian

[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.700]
literature last year.

[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.200]
As they continue, they won't stop the Giskeys.

[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:45.020]
Now, those brainwashing and brainwashing and converting and twisting arms and bending

[01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:47.540]
legs and bending on, on vended knee, etc.

[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:50.120]
Those are going to be King James versions of the Bible.

[01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:50.980]
Who knows?

[01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:51.960]
Oh, that's important.

[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.620]
King Schwartz, right.

[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:58.520]
Take your free Bible, by the way, and read it because the Christians don't...

[01:56:59.280 --> 01:56:59.620]
Yeah.

[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:02.840]
And that's the only way that you can argue with them is to throw the Bible back at them.

[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:04.420]
What do you mean the Christians don't?

[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:05.300]
How about the Jews?

[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.440]
You think the Jews are reading the Bible?

[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:08.020]
They don't want to say the people that are beating over them.

[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:08.720]
The Muslims are...

[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:10.560]
You think the Muslims are busy reading the Quran?

[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.260]
They're busy schooling their brains out.

[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:15.200]
That's why these Muslim families all have 750 kids.

[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.920]
You want to see in my building here, man?

[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.160]
All these future suicide bombers.

[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:20.780]
Unbelievable.

[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:21.700]
I'll get in Chummy.

[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:22.720]
Maybe they won't blow you up.

[01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:25.740]
The cut and the cut now now is so bad.

[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.020]
It's just mind blowing.

[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:28.160]
Mind blowing.

[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.900]
Sherry Blair, you know Tony Blaswai?

[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:33.520]
No.

[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:34.940]
Well, you do now.

[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:35.340]
Okay.

[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:38.780]
Has revealed that her husband and former Prime Minister decided to make public announcement

[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:42.380]
about her miscarriage to avoid public panic over the invasion of Iraq?

[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:43.880]
Oh my God.

[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:48.660]
Writing in her autobiography, speaking for myself, Blair describes how her husband and his

[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:52.360]
press chief, Alistair Campbell, decided to tell the press that she had lost the baby

[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.240]
and she was carrying almost immediately, immediately.

[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:00.340]
In 2002, the blurs would need to take a holiday to France and the Prime Minister feared that

[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:04.160]
any delay or cancellation without explanation could trigger false speculation that an invasion

[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:04.980]
of Iraq was imminent.

[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:09.640]
Shortly after she had told her husband and the miscarriage, Blair says her husband broke

[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:11.460]
the news to the rest of the family and then told Campbell.

[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.980]
The pair then called back to say that with speculation mounting that troops could be sent

[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:20.580]
to Iraq, you could send the wrong signal if they just canceled a holiday and decided to

[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:21.000]
tell the press.

[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:22.520]
I couldn't believe it.

[01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:26.120]
There I was bleeding and they were talking about what was going to be the line to the

[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:26.340]
press.

[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:31.580]
I put down a receiver and lay there staring at the ceiling as the pain began to grip

[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:32.020]
she wrote.

[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:37.160]
A lot of our people also revealed how the blurs conceived their fourth child, Leo, while

[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:38.100]
staying at Bel Moral.

[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.140]
Blair says she was too embarrassed to take her contraceptive equipment with her when they

[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:46.120]
went to stay with the rolls in 99 as her wash bag and its rage of unmentionedables had

[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.760]
been unpacked by a staff on previous visit.

[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:50.100]
They were sticking their nose into her wash bag.

[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:53.200]
It's a good thing they went sticking their nose into her bag.

[01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:54.200]
Yeah, okay.

[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:54.480]

[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:55.600]
We can't say that.

[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.040]
No, we can't.

[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:58.720]
We can't say the D-word anymore.

[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:03.520]
Dan, when she discovered she was pregnant, she initially thought she was going through

[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.360]
the menopause until she took her pregnancy test.

[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:09.060]
She conceived again two years later but suffered the miscarriage or has been decided to make

[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:09.380]
public.

[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:13.660]
Speaking for myself as being serialized in the times in the sun, it was originally due

[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:17.180]
to be published in October but now it will be published on Thursday by Little Brown.

[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.040]
Little Brown Cooper.

[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:22.600]
Little douche-douche-douche-douche-douche-douche.

[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:23.580]
Sorry, I can't say that.

[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:23.920]
Careful.

[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:24.880]
I know.

[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:27.580]
Back on that bag thing again.

[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:28.920]
You know, Joyce don't like bag.

[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:29.900]
Joyce don't like far.

[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.100]
It's Joyce don't like this.

[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:32.140]
And bap bap bap bap.

[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:34.420]
So that goes, honey.

[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:36.520]
655 vote on it.

[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.260]
The photo, please.

[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:37.880]
Let's have that.

[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:41.580]
Don't be playing a little douche-coup, okay?

[01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:47.860]
Most important person in the history of the Pronto business is and he'll have to win

[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:49.000]
Larry Flinn or do it again.

[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:52.500]
He's got 186 and the Larry's got 158.

[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:57.220]
Larry's not doing too bad for Gabba, they almost killed.

[01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:02.020]
Although he did win the first time by like 29 votes last time we did that poll sometime

[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:03.860]
ago, years ago, like 100 years ago.

[02:00:06.160 --> 02:00:07.080]
When it was going to help, it was.

[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:11.760]
Shall I reach over here and shut this phone thing off the monitor?

[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:12.620]
Right as well.

[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:14.380]
Why do you say that?

[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:17.200]
No, but you have no confidence that the line is going to come back to like normal.

[02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:17.600]
No.

[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:20.820]
Now you did that on your own.

[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:21.280]
What?

[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:22.820]
Whatever you just did.

[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:24.380]
What did I do?

[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:25.480]
Is he faking it?

[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:26.780]
What are you talking about?

[02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:29.340]
You chopped out of here, you're doing it on purpose.

[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:29.920]
No, I'm not.

[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:30.640]
Greg, you're not?

[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:31.040]
No.

[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.380]
No, he's talking normally.

[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:36.680]
Although I'm glad to know that my fake dropping out sounds that good.

[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:38.380]
Oh, he did, it was really, it was excellent.

[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.480]
I was like rolling around on a floor with one foot out the window and my other foot

[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:44.040]
up my ass.

[02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:44.920]
I'll do my ears good.

[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.460]
I'll do the next segment in the forl voice in some of them on such a roll.

[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:49.760]
Okay, well, that's what we need to do.

[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:51.420]
So let's go throughout back on air two to four.

[02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:51.880]
What do you say?

[02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:53.300]
I'm sorry, go ahead.

[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:54.840]
We got the jerk show today, two to four.

[02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.880]
That's a real, real winner.

[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:00.900]
You going to be tuned in?

[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:01.840]
Pete?

[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:02.520]
To what?

[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:05.940]
22 till one at five sixty WQF.

[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:06.580]
Rodgers guy.

[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:09.840]
Randall Simmons is a real Geico customer, not a paid celebrity.

[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:13.180]
So to help us tell his story, we hired a natural celebrity.

[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:15.980]
Barack Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright.

[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:19.600]
I was in my car headed out on a date when I had my accident.

[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.600]
Accident, it was no accident.

[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.040]
Not a terrible black man in this contract.

[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:28.660]
I called Geico and right from the start, I couldn't believe how helpful they were.

[02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:34.700]
Oh yes, they want you to believe, but I never believe the white man or no.

[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:39.100]
Geico got me a loner car and actually called ahead to the restaurant and explained why

[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:39.520]
I was late.

[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:44.840]
I'm still waiting on an explanation, an explanation of how color racism in this country is

[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:50.140]
a real victim, an explanation of how a black man has never been the president.

[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.660]
Cannot get an even.

[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:56.540]
Geico, real service, real savings, real insane celebrities.

[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:59.560]
1243 at five sixty WQAM on a Monday.

[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:03.480]
This is by El Myrahoff, an often-gun post.

[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:06.760]
McCain to be in 1999, Bush as dumb as a stump.

[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:12.000]
As the lawyer might say, he writes, okay, I am one of the points out.

[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.540]
I have no personal knowledge of whether John or Cindy McCain voted for George W. Bush

[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:16.820]
in the 2010 election.

[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:21.240]
However, now that it has been called into question by Ariana Huffington, this says no, and

[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:24.900]
Huffington's truthfulness has been termed in question by the McCain campaign, I can

[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:28.700]
offer the following anecdotes admissibly, here say, shedding a little light on the subject.

[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.320]
Over the fourth of July, 1998, I had the good fortune to accompany my avenge fiancee

[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:40.200]
and how happily my wife, to the McCain vacation home in Sedona, where she was interviewing

[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:41.760]
them for a home and garden TV show.

[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:46.620]
The interview itself was entirely apolitical, focusing on fabrics and furnishing in their

[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:50.560]
lovely oak creek abode, topics about which I do recall the senator was less than comfortable

[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:50.920]
discussing.

[02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:53.640]
Fabrics and furnishings.

[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.360]
Are you comfortable discussing fabrics and furnishings?

[02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:56.900]
All the thought.

[02:02:57.880 --> 02:02:58.440]
You're eating?

[02:02:58.740 --> 02:02:59.340]
Yes, I am.

[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:03.160]
That, but now it's like cutting out with the food in the mouth.

[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:03.520]
Right.

[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:04.180]
My favorite.

[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:08.040]
Always the good host and McCain's also invited us to spend the day with them including

[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:09.820]
a barbecue, a favorite of Johns.

[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.240]
And as McCain flipped for it, I couldn't help but ask his views about the candidate George

[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:15.000]
W. Bush.

[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:17.440]
He's dumb as a stump, McCain offered.

[02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:21.280]
We've him and I'm going to discuss other matters in front of you now, but that quote remains

[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:22.260]
seared in my memory.

[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:24.020]
He's dumb as a stump.

[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.380]
So how the McCain's actually voted then, November's between them and the voting booth, but if

[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:33.340]
John McCain did end up voting for Bush, then by his own admission, he voted for a stump.

[02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:35.300]
How do you like that?

[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:36.920]
Does that stump you a little bit?

[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:37.500]
No.

[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:38.620]

[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:40.840]
What's happening to you?

[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:41.160]
I'm back.

[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:42.320]
I was getting my water.

[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.220]
Why?

[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:47.720]
I mean, today doesn't count anyway, so I'm going to go get up and wander around doing

[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:48.000]
the show.

[02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:49.400]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:51.120]
I guess they didn't tell us about this.

[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:51.800]
Today is a holiday.

[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.080]
We weren't aware of it's the Monday after single demil.

[02:03:54.740 --> 02:03:55.800]
So Allison says.

[02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:57.440]
To stop.

[02:03:57.540 --> 02:03:57.880]
bizarre.

[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:00.800]
Allison says she called Chris and chewed him out.

[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:01.520]
Chew what?

[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:02.700]
Called Chris.

[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:03.540]
Wait, wait.

[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:04.580]
Yeah.

[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:05.460]
And chewed him out.

[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:06.680]
For what?

[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:09.360]
For bailing, for giving up on that, trying to get here.

[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:11.420]
Yeah, he didn't, I don't know.

[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:16.920]
I mean, wait, wait, wait, look, we've all been chewed horrendous traffic situations and

[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:18.120]
nightmare, especially down there.

[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.320]
So who knows just how bad it was.

[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.080]
So maybe he just didn't feel like coming into that.

[02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:23.420]
I don't know.

[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:26.960]
He does live in an outer Mongolia, Yenem's belt.

[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:27.960]
Yeah.

[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:33.580]
Philip Durali writes, where were the ran might be closer than you think?

[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:40.920]
He says there's conspiratorial, conspiratorial, speculation in Buzz and Washington today, suggesting

[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:44.440]
that the National Security Council's agreed in principle to proceed with plans to attack

[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:48.620]
an Iranian al-Quds long camp that has believed to be training Iraqi militants.

[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:54.000]
The camp that will be targeted is one of several located near Tehran, Secretary of Defense

[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.720]
Robert Gibbs was the only senior official urging delay in taking any offensive action.

[02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:02.000]
The decision to go ahead with plans to attack Iran is the direct result of concerns being

[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.580]
expressed over the deteriorating situation in Lebanon where Iranian ally Hezbollah

[02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:10.760]
appears to have gained the upper hand against government forces and might be able to dominate

[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:12.360]
the fractious political situation.

[02:05:13.580 --> 02:05:17.500]
The White House contacted the Iranian government directly yesterday through a channel provided

[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:21.380]
by the leadership of the Kurdish region in Iraq, which has traditionally had close ties

[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:21.980]
to Tehran.

[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:26.060]
The U.S. demanded that Iran admit that it's been interfering in Iraq and also committed

[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:29.160]
itself to taking steps to run the support of various militant groups.

[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:31.140]
It was also warning about interfering in Lebanon.

[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:35.680]
The Iranian government reportedly responded quickly with stating its position that it

[02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:39.040]
would not discuss the matter with Tuleo Assisi's own leveling and playing Iranian dissident

[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:39.420]
groups.

[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:44.560]
The perceived Iranian intransigence coupled with the lesbian-e situation convinced the White

[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.240]
House that some sort of unambiguous signal has to be sent to the Iranian leadership, presumably

[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.480]
in the form of cruise missiles.

[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:54.620]
It is to be presumed that the attack will be as pinpoint and limited as possible intended

[02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:57.180]
to target only the al-Quds and avoid civilian casualties.

[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:00.480]
The decision to proceed with transfer and attack is not final.

[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:04.520]
The President will still have to get the order to launch after all preparations are made.

[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.260]
You don't think this President would do something like that, do you?

[02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:08.820]
Huh?

[02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:13.060]
You don't think that this will do something irresponsible like that?

[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:17.700]
Now what does that have to do with the price of oil?

[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:20.040]
Love it?

[02:06:20.460 --> 02:06:21.260]
Are you eating or what?

[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:25.260]
Well, Jesus got Almighty, don't just abandon the whole show here.

[02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:26.380]
I want to abandon it, I've been talking.

[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:27.220]
Down here, man!

[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.140]
124 hours and 68 cents.

[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:29.500]
Look at that.

[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.100]
It's a down, down, down.

[02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:33.480]
124.72.73.

[02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:39.680]
124.74 and 3 quarter bucks a gallon for a barrel of oil.

[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:41.120]
Oh, well, I said, again, whatever.

[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:45.260]
Almost four bucks a gallon for regular unleaded.

[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.080]
Just, and almost five bucks here.

[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.400]
You might have been bringing no crovette here.

[02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:50.440]
Let me tell you that right now.

[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:54.580]
You don't want to be driving here.

[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:57.440]
Who the hell kind of afforded?

[02:06:58.340 --> 02:06:58.800]
Right.

[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:02.980]
And we're worrying about Reverend Jeremiah Wright and Reverend Hague.

[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:03.120]
Yeah.

[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:03.540]
Mm-hmm.

[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.320]
With their campaign falling ever deeper into debt.

[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:10.420]
Senator Swiller, we got him clenched, but our clenched,

[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:14.320]
spent a rainy, mother's day yesterday seeking votes ahead of Tuesday's primary here.

[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.440]
Turning a death here to cost for her to leave a Democratic President

[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.880]
so contest he has little hope of winning, says the Washington Post today.

[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:24.020]
Clinton needs continued to insist that she'll remain in the race

[02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:28.020]
even while confirming that she's $20 million in debt.

[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:32.740]
The voters are going to decide this e-neurodvisor how Wilson said on Fox News Sunday,

[02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:34.480]
acknowledging the $20 million figure.

[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:36.900]
There's no reason for her not to continue this process.

[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:40.620]
Wilson said he has seen no evidence of her interest in pursuing the second place spot.

[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.960]
I'm the Democratic ticket-contraded rumors that she's staying in the race for a leverage

[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.080]
for a bid for the vice presidential nomination.

[02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:49.460]
With the primary season during its close Barack Obama,

[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:52.160]
its advisors are beginning to consider the question of his running mate

[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:55.040]
with more urgency as they focus more openly on the general election.

[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:59.020]
Although Obama himself has been careful to insist that the Democratic race is no

[02:07:59.020 --> 02:08:02.220]
Arizona's Clinton stays in, his advisors have planted chip from his Zuri,

[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:06.940]
a state that held his primary on February 5 at a peer certain to be a keen November battleground this week.

[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:11.260]
While Maxis missing the state's entirely Obama's campaign is making it clear

[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.040]
he will not aggressively contest West Virginia or Kentucky

[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.580]
which holds its primary week from tomorrow.

[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.540]
Obama is elected to win the Oregon also in the May 20th primary state.

[02:08:18.940 --> 02:08:20.320]
Tenton has campaigned hard in West Virginia,

[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:24.360]
a said Sunday she'll hold a victory celebration at the Charleston Civic Senator Maronite.

[02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:25.100]
We'll be.

[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:29.780]
With nearly everyone including privately many on her own team contemplating

[02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:32.600]
when not if she'll quit the race, the question surrounding Clinton now

[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:33.900]
will largely be the remotivation.

[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:35.200]
When not if?

[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:39.920]
Publicly her campaign argues that victory's in West Virginia Kentucky could shift the growing

[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.920]
title momentum for Obama back to her by demonstrating that she has appeal on state

[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:46.180]
the Democrats must win to take back the White House in November.

[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:50.020]
What is unclear is whether she hopes strong performances will make Obama consider her

[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:53.100]
for the number two slot or at least help her retire her growing debt.

[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:54.000]
Retire!

[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:54.500]

[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:55.280]
You're growing debt.

[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:59.620]
He offered to help pay off her debt by the way.

[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:00.160]
Yeah.

[02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:04.920]
If you get down on everybody's face already just go take her pants suit and go back to the Senate.

[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:06.340]
Go back to Chateauquo honey.

[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:07.920]
Yeah, get out of her face.

[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:11.880]
Go back to your place in outer space and get out of her face.

[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:14.320]
I bet you said, right right right right.

[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:16.800]
I think it calls for a little mace.

[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:20.980]
Maybe a trace of mace under just a place.

[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.380]
676 on that pool.

[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:24.280]
I bet your drinks pretty excited about that not.

[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:27.600]
You excited about it?

[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:29.440]
I'm not very excited now.

[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:29.680]
No.

[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:30.520]
But why not?

[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:34.960]
WDQAM line nine. Hello.

[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:36.000]
Yeah.

[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:38.160]
How's it going buddy?

[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:38.840]
Okay.

[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:41.440]
I just got to find figure reports.

[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:45.180]
They're all over Sheridan Street just 75.

[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:46.600]
Okay.

[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.900]
There's no crime in Temporic finds deal.

[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:51.480]
Or even listen south forward if that matter of fact.

[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:52.860]
Okay, good luck, yes sir.

[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:54.680]
Yeah, there's a crime in Temporic finds out right.

[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:56.140]
It's the police knows figure reports.

[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:57.940]
I am those pigs.

[02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:59.120]
That's all they know.

[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.520]
That's all they know is sent up speed to have some Pembroke legs.

[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.000]
Pembroke finds and write a lot of business.

[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:05.960]
That's where it's at.

[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:06.800]
Always been that way.

[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:08.680]
Only one island there.

[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:09.840]
That's about 6-30 years ago.

[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:13.200]
Every time you turn around there's another bunch of porkers on

[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.580]
Tess Street on a high this road.

[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:16.180]
It's just that that's what they do.

[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:17.760]
That's the business.

[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:21.960]
I'm not really sure if the dropouts have ended or what the deal is here.

[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:23.040]
I don't know.

[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:25.360]
I don't think I'm not hearing it.

[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:26.840]
You didn't see too many words over there.

[02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:28.220]
Should I talk for a long time?

[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:29.220]
Should I recite some lines?

[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:29.880]
Nah, it's dropping out.

[02:10:29.940 --> 02:10:30.240]
No, it's okay.

[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.280]
But maybe it's making a little bit of a comeback.

[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:32.940]
Maybe it's on the...

[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:34.620]
Oops, I like one of those occasionally.

[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:35.060]
Who does?

[02:10:35.740 --> 02:10:36.360]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:37.360]
I have a coupon.

[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:37.820]
Yeah.

[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:39.020]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:41.880]
WDQAM.

[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:42.580]
WDQAM.

[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:42.580]

[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:42.660]
WDQAM.

[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:43.800]
WDQAM.

[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:44.400]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:45.840]
Hello, sir.

[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.100]
Why did you ask you if you thought that a black man could win?

[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:53.020]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:10:57.160 --> 02:10:58.020]
Oh, it's him.

[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:00.280]
The raspberry gum.

[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:00.920]
Where we having the raspberry?

[02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:01.720]
That's right.

[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:02.380]
What's it?

[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:02.840]
Wait, wow.

[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:04.760]
He used to be under all of that.

[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:07.600]
Now, wasn't he the guy with a book of Brian problem or something, or is that my computer?

[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:08.380]
No, it's a different guy.

[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:09.240]
Different guy?

[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:10.640]
There's more than one guy.

[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:12.000]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:15.780]
Dale, why don't you come out to the kickball game once, from the...

[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:17.180]
Yeah, kickball my ass, okay.

[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:18.540]
The kickball game.

[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:20.460]
Go kick somebody else's balls, schmuck.

[02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:22.140]
Nobody to QAM, hello.

[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:23.100]
Hi, ground.

[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:25.140]
QAM, hello.

[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:26.620]
Hello.

[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:27.000]

[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:27.780]
Hello.

[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:28.420]
Oh, alright.

[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:29.800]
There's the exactoer, man.

[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:30.780]
The exactoer.

[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:34.640]
I thought about that over the weekend that schmuck they called me on Friday.

[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:39.120]
Well, how come it is up there, and the only call to you exactly the exactoer and the

[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:40.520]
triactor that tried...

[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:41.280]
Well, whatever it was.

[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:43.740]
Oh, my God.

[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.760]
These are the kinds of things that people are worried about.

[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:48.620]
These are the times that try men's poles.

[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:54.420]
Must have a stress-free life to be worried about crap like that, wouldn't you think?

[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:55.780]
I imagine it is.

[02:11:56.140 --> 02:11:58.360]
Things must be going real peachy keen for a sh...

[02:11:58.360 --> 02:11:59.860]
That's like that, there's got so much spirit time.

[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:02.320]
He's worried about what they call the exactoer, the exactoer.

[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:03.500]
What about the perfectoer, huh?

[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:04.420]
How about that, schmuck?

[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:05.780]
What about the triple?

[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.340]
You make a cripple?

[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:11.420]
God, so many stupid people in so little time.

[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:15.620]
That makes me so excited about being a gulstery monster between three and five this coming weekend.

[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:16.400]
God.

[02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:17.620]
Yeah.

[02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:18.900]
Aren't you thrilled?

[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:19.820]
I am thrilled.

[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:20.560]
Well, you're used to it.

[02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:22.020]
I mean, you're like a regular out there now.

[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:22.520]
That's right.

[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:23.480]
Like part of the woodwork.

[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:25.380]
You know it first name basis of all the staff.

[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.240]
Now you're going to have to give me instructions on where to go.

[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:30.340]
I'm sure other people out there like tell me where to go.

[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:32.180]
But you'll have to give me the lowdown.

[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:33.020]
Right, you know the way.

[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:35.500]
What does that mean?

[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:37.220]
Oh.

[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.480]
To how I was talking about.

[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:48.300]
It's program, which ensures silence of young people right here in West Virginia.

[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:50.660]
Who would otherwise not get health care?

[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:52.440]
He just won't stop, man.

[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:53.320]
He just won't stop.

[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:54.580]
He won't take no for an answer.

[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:57.100]
1255 at 560 WDQ.

[02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:58.100]
I'm a tension man and woman.

[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.580]

Everybody is talking about this revolutionary breakthrough.

[02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:38.780]
That's one, triplet 586 growl.

[02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:40.520]
What's your name?

[02:13:40.900 --> 02:13:42.040]
The best tower here.

[02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:45.420]
This is a run by a sportly ill-fired 50 QAM.

[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.200]
And the sports leader.

[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:50.280]
It's so long to do our...

[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:23.120]
You're looking for guys who make you go by.

[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:24.280]
I hope so.

[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:28.120]
Larry Craig, thank you for tapping your shoe.

[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:32.980]
You still reach last a few days.

[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:35.880]
But you refuse to go away.

[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:40.140]
The public ends our drive already dead.

[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:41.880]
Hey, baby.

[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:42.780]
That's a movement.

[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:44.640]
They talk to Larry.

[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:47.780]
We treat the ball.

[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:54.220]
We all invite you to get a lot fun.

[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.060]
Gunny or Kona, I like you and turn it over.

[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:00.340]
Hey, I love you.

[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.000]
Larry, take a note.

[02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.720]
Clap when he's having issues.

[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:08.920]
K, K, K, I never have been yet.

[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:12.580]
K, K, K, I never have been yet.

[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:15.120]
They talk to Larry.

[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:17.840]
He wants to stay.

[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:23.660]
But his own party wants him to go away.

[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:26.860]
Everybody just relax.

[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:29.080]
He wants to stay.

[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:33.920]
Larry Craig, who's Craig, his legs are for you.

[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:34.940]
Clap them.

[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:37.220]
He wants a man to swim.

[02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:40.140]
And any guy will do.

[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:41.940]
It's one o'clock at 5'60 WQA.

[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:45.140]
I'm happy Monday to be in spite of all the hustle ride

[02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:46.040]
that's going on here today.

[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:46.880]
It's one of those things.

[02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:49.340]
Ain't it?

[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:50.080]
It is.

[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:50.960]
It's several of those things.

[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:52.860]
Well, let's see if it clear up.

[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:56.160]
See, I keep trying to catch on when you, you know,

[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:58.660]
but you've speaking very short sentences, you know, like choppy.

[02:15:59.440 --> 02:15:59.660]
Yeah.

[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:01.360]
Well, I don't want to step on you.

[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:02.880]
That sounded good.

[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:04.120]
I'll monologue if you want.

[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:06.100]
I'll recite some Shakespeare if you want.

[02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:07.740]
Oh, I think the dropouts are gone.

[02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:07.980]
Really?

[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:09.140]
Yeah.

[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:09.620]
What do you want?

[02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:11.640]
Shakespeare or Edgar Allen Poe?

[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:12.820]
See how long it can go.

[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:14.200]
I think no one will drop out.

[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:15.880]
It's a little exciting.

[02:16:16.060 --> 02:16:16.700]
Maybe it cleared up.

[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:19.060]
But it always happens that way.

[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:20.780]
And there's a lot of luck left for a couple of hours.

[02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:25.880]
And even the wax is coming in dropin' out.

[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:26.500]
All right.

[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:27.800]
All right.

[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:28.140]
All right.

[02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:29.020]
Okay.

[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:30.000]
All right.

[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:32.080]
Now there's something to be excited about.

[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:33.420]
5, 6, 7, 0 for one.

[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:34.780]
Now we can take calls just like that.

[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:36.560]
We've been so damn good today for a while.

[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:37.840]
We don't want to miss out anything good.

[02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:38.860]
I'm Rubin Mandiples.

[02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:41.720]
Rubin is hand-laced together, man, like a grassy hopper.

[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:47.040]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound-five, 60 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[02:16:47.380 --> 02:16:48.080]
Let me see QAM.

[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:48.320]
Hello.

[02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:49.420]
Hello?

[02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:50.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:51.320]
How come you don't like women?

[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:52.740]
I'm not important.

[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:56.100]
What do you say?

[02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:57.300]
How come you don't like women?

[02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:58.380]
Oh, how come I don't like women?

[02:16:58.520 --> 02:16:59.320]
Well, I like lots of women.

[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:00.500]
I just don't want to do them.

[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:00.760]
Okay.

[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:00.820]
Okay.

[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:01.300]
Smok.

[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:01.920]
Puts.

[02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:03.900]
Rubin and QAM, hello.

[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:05.340]
Hello, Niles.

[02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:06.060]
Yeah.

[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:09.440]
No, we're not going to be able to steal a styrofoam.

[02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:12.660]
But we're not going to steal a styrofoam.

[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:14.700]
No, I don't want to see you on Saturday or any other day.

[02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:14.960]
Okay.

[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:15.600]
God.

[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:18.300]
Five say there be enough other retards here.

[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:18.940]
Okay, don't worry.

[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:19.520]
Don't sweat it.

[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:23.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound-five, 60 in the Verizon and Singular wireless line.

[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:24.960]
You know what this reminds me of?

[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:27.080]
This whole appearance on Saturday.

[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:29.780]
It reminds me of when we did the appearance of the

[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:33.220]
Volkswagen Swap Shop once upon a time.

[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:33.600]
Yeah.

[02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:38.200]
And Preston Han had me up there on the stage where they had the elephants, you know, on the

[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:39.480]
the aroma of the elephant cramp.

[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:39.800]
Right.

[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:43.840]
The right lights to shine my head was just pouring sweat.

[02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:44.580]
Melting us.

[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:47.020]
Yeah, that was just an act of us in the cruise ship.

[02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:48.600]
Nick showed up there at the end of that whole evening.

[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:48.920]
That's right.

[02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:50.100]
He was looking in the wings.

[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:50.720]
Mm-hmm.

[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:52.980]
How many QAM, hello?

[02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:54.000]
Hi, Jeff.

[02:17:54.980 --> 02:17:55.880]
How many QAM, hello.

[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:57.020]
Yes.

[02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:59.320]
I told you I'm getting on the right.

[02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:00.780]
What are you up to today?

[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:02.680]
What?

[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:04.660]
I said, what are you up to today?

[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.240]
You're on it when you left it.

[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:08.320]
You know who that was?

[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:10.280]
Of course, Volkswagen.

[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:11.100]
The extra guy.

[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:12.240]
He here checks you down.

[02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:13.820]
Now he's going to get used to it.

[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:15.420]
He didn't even take my piece of the stone.

[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:18.180]
WDQYM, QAM, hello.

[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:19.080]
Hello.

[02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:19.540]
Hello.

[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:20.200]
Hello.

[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:22.040]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:22.980]
Hi, Jeff.

[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:24.560]
QAM, hello.

[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:27.420]
I'm the new.

[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:28.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:28.940 --> 02:18:29.740]
It's Gilbert, H.

[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:32.100]
Where are you going to be at?

[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:34.240]
Gilbert?

[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:34.620]

[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:36.700]
Oh, get out of here, Gil, from home.

[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:37.600]
Don't come out.

[02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:37.620]

[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:38.400]
Don't come out.

[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:38.800]
Don't come out.

[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:41.320]
I'll cancel if you're going to be there.

[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:42.540]
I'm going to be there.

[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:43.480]
I'm going to be there.

[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:44.180]
I'm canceling.

[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:47.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, Friday.

[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:49.900]
You'll see every retard in South Florida is going to wind up there.

[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:50.340]
Everyone.

[02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:51.700]
Mm-hmm.

[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:52.300]
Oh, yeah?

[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:53.020]
For what?

[02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:53.820]
For you.

[02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:55.000]
Just to be annoying.

[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.500]
Oh, that's right.

[02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:57.320]
Just to be annoying.

[02:18:57.400 --> 02:18:59.160]
Because not only we are bathing, but we're going to like it.

[02:18:59.220 --> 02:18:59.520]
That's right.

[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:00.760]
That's a stop.

[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:01.680]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:03.180]
Good afternoon, Neil.

[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:04.180]
Have you picked?

[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:05.540]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:09.080]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:13.420]
WDQYM, hello.

[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:14.280]
Hello.

[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:14.600]

[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:14.600]

[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:14.820]

[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:14.820]

[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:16.840]
Q-A-M, hello.

[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:17.120]

[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:17.120]

[02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:17.940]
Hello.

[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:17.940]

[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:18.360]
Anil.

[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:19.100]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:23.800]
What was the fact reading for a ticket on the big part of the city?

[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:26.120]
And they go up again to his iron gold, the old week.

[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:30.420]
And trying to make an attempt to rip you and ask.

[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:30.960]
Yeah.

[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:33.860]
And what was their ratings?

[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:36.080]
And they picked you.

[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:37.120]
Yeah, they beat us.

[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:39.000]
And every day, part of a sub-morning.

[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:41.060]
Was it a bad beat?

[02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:42.740]
This is like you think it was in one of those tips books.

[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:43.460]
You know, like that.

[02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:45.000]
Yeah, it was like a kiddie book, yeah.

[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:45.600]
Yeah.

[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.860]
Well, the gold is on the radio two hours a week.

[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.000]
And who the hell was he?

[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:54.060]
And when he was doing what he was doing two to four on this station at a one point,

[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:54.960]
oh, one share.

[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:56.800]
So he's a good one to be talking about ratings.

[02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:02.260]
Yeah, well, it's just really weird and they all say it's funny how they know everything that goes on on the show though, right?

[02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:02.460]
Yeah.

[02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:03.620]
That is correct.

[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:05.560]
So gold, the ticket up here.

[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:06.800]
Okay.

[02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:08.880]
Five, six, seven, like that.

[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:09.360]
That one bit.

[02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:10.620]
I don't even know how you have children.

[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:11.660]
That's one of the all time.

[02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:12.300]
That's a great one.

[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:13.540]
That's one of the great lines of all time.

[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:15.960]
I don't know how you have children when you sound.

[02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:18.100]
Like that.

[02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.700]
Family QAM, hello.

[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:22.140]
I'm just saying good morning.

[02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:22.580]
Yeah, sir.

[02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:23.380]
I'm sorry.

[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:23.680]
Good evening.

[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:27.640]
Hey, somebody tell me that the bridge tender is going to be with you Saturday.

[02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:29.960]
Yeah, the bridge tender has been dead for a hundred years.

[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:31.440]
Oh, he hasn't been dead that long.

[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:31.960]
Yeah.

[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.260]
Family QAM, hello.

[02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:35.180]
Okay.

[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.200]
QAM.

[02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:37.240]
Five, six, seven, like that.

[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:38.240]
And he'll come on to me.

[02:20:38.420 --> 02:20:38.940]
Somebody got that shoulder.

[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:39.620]
That's one of the best.

[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:40.180]
What is it?

[02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:41.660]
Family QAM.

[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:44.640]
What's his eye on this?

[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:45.460]
Your mother's trousers.

[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.020]
He's trying to take only fast because you.

[02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:50.920]
You're jumping and so garbled and so me like that.

[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:52.640]
But we have got rid of the dropout, so.

[02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:53.380]
All right.

[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:53.740]
Whoo.

[02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:57.140]
Family QAM, hello.

[02:20:57.780 --> 02:21:00.360]
Seven years could be a great day to network, right?

[02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:01.380]
Yeah.

[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:02.520]
I can't wait.

[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:03.940]
Network what?

[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:06.340]
Probably, uh, screw balls.

[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:07.300]
Mm-hmm.

[02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:08.560]
One location.

[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:09.660]
We're going to have a special site.

[02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:11.880]
I think you guys are planning something.

[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:14.920]
Yeah, I'm going to take them all out on the bus.

[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:15.700]
Yeah.

[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:17.860]
Just think about straight.

[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:19.060]
Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:19.680]
I'm thinking about it.

[02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:20.000]
I'm thinking about it.

[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:20.240]
How are they?

[02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:23.220]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:24.980]
QAM, Hola.

[02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:26.440]
Call it in.

[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:28.340]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:21:30.060 --> 02:21:30.700]
Neil God.

[02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:31.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:33.220]
How are you today, sir?

[02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:33.820]
Okay.

[02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:34.800]
Good.

[02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:36.680]
On horse racing, Neil.

[02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:39.320]
Man, how can you keep watching it?

[02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:40.700]
They break their legs all the time.

[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:42.040]
Yeah, all the time.

[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:44.240]
Dan.

[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:47.380]
I'm just saying, man, they bring them that way.

[02:21:47.540 --> 02:21:49.300]
How can you drive a car, man?

[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:50.420]
They're crashing them every day.

[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:53.100]
Well, I'm having difficulty.

[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:55.120]
Let me have a difficulty with what?

[02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:57.480]
Life?

[02:21:58.300 --> 02:21:58.740]
Yeah, me.

[02:21:59.080 --> 02:21:59.720]
Yeah, that's obvious.

[02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:01.980]
Yeah, let's ban horse racing.

[02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:04.440]
There's horses that break down and have to be put to sleep.

[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:07.340]
And there's people to drive cars and kill other people in them

[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:08.960]
and smash into poles and stuff like that.

[02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:11.800]
All of these things, right?

[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:12.860]
All of these things.

[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:15.360]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:16.760]
Hello.

[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:18.100]
Yeah.

[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.880]
We talked to Neil.

[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:20.720]
Speaking.

[02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.000]
Hey, Neil.

[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:22.660]
Yeah.

[02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:29.280]
Tell me when the inflation kicks in before or after the election

[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:32.140]
and everything gets way out of hand.

[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:33.620]
The inflation of what you're lacking.

[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:35.440]
No, no.

[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:36.400]
Wow.

[02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:39.900]
Listen, if you're not alive anymore, if you've already passed on to the other side,

[02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:40.760]
save your calls.

[02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:42.180]
Call up the footsy tomorrow.

[02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:43.820]
Okay, he can use them.

[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:45.920]
Do not call us if you're the walking dead.

[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:47.980]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:49.060]
Hello.

[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:50.440]
My bathroom is all trashed.

[02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:50.820]
My neck.

[02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:51.980]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:53.540]
Hey, Neil, what's up, buddy?

[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:54.280]
How you doing, sir?

[02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:56.840]
Hey, you know Jerry Tassel is coming in July.

[02:22:58.220 --> 02:22:58.580]
Ian?

[02:22:58.700 --> 02:22:59.940]
I got an extra ticket.

[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:01.060]
Maybe you want to go over what?

[02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:01.860]
No, thanks.

[02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:02.940]
Come on, man.

[02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:03.440]
Jerry's funny.

[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:05.640]
When did that start?

[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:07.940]
July 26th, 7 p.m.

[02:23:07.940 --> 02:23:08.400]
Oh, God.

[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:08.720]
Take it.

[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:09.560]
Take it when I see you.

[02:23:09.600 --> 02:23:09.840]
The good news.

[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:10.700]
No, thanks, Pally.

[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:11.200]
Get out.

[02:23:11.460 --> 02:23:11.800]
Get lost.

[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:13.900]
Jerry's time, Phil.

[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.240]
I would ever walk from here to the kitchen to see Jerry's time.

[02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:18.380]
I'll only open up the door.

[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:19.160]
Kick his ass down.

[02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:22.980]
Well, he's about as funny as a wild, oozing, bloody diarrhea.

[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:24.820]
That's what fact Eric Wally told me.

[02:23:25.180 --> 02:23:26.180]
Remember, he was having all those problems?

[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:27.180]
No.

[02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:28.320]
Sure you do.

[02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:29.660]
No.

[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:34.220]
Nine minutes after one at 5.60 WPM, we got the jerk show coming with 2 this afternoon.

[02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:37.500]
It just is one of the wonders of the world, I sure.

[02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:38.840]
You know, a lot of people wonder.

[02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:40.860]
Do they have a heart or a liver?

[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:41.220]
No.

[02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:42.040]
Hey y'all.

[02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:43.760]
If you're old like me.

[02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:48.400]
And there's an emergency, you can summon help by pressing this little button.

[02:23:48.940 --> 02:23:51.080]
Still, vesters to loan use this Rambo learned.

[02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:52.080]
And so can you.

[02:23:52.460 --> 02:23:53.900]
If you were your loved one, live alone.

[02:23:54.260 --> 02:23:57.460]
A Rambo learned system can mean the difference between life and death.

[02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:58.060]
Oh yeah.

[02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:04.780]
Because sometimes, if you know, you may like experience like chest pains or maybe fall

[02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:08.140]
and you can't get up, threatening to might draw a first blood.

[02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:10.960]
Rambo learned will come to the rescue.

[02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:14.620]
Kill the bad guys and take it to the hospital.

[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:15.340]
Heeeey.

[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:16.800]
Heeeey.

[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:22.900]
Peace of mind is there 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

[02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:24.640]
Order Rambo learned today.

[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:25.740]
Take it from me.

[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:26.940]
Slice the loan.

[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:28.500]
Heroes never die.

[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:30.340]
They use Rambo learned.

[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:32.600]
113 to 560 WQA.

[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:35.540]
And here's the appool most important person in history at Porto Industry is.

[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:37.940]
We got 706 on the pool, not too shabby, George.

[02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:38.940]
All right.

[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:40.140]
After a very lame start.

[02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:41.400]
Chris, they hear our pretend to care.

[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:41.860]
Wooo!

[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:42.280]
Come on, people.

[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:46.200]
We aren't cutting out anymore.

[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:46.620]
Hallelujah.

[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.240]
Oh, that's the most important thing.

[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:49.080]
Oh, how?

[02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:51.020]
I mean, that is not good for your mental health.

[02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:52.040]
Having a sit there.

[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.060]
We have that for a couple hours.

[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:58.900]
Although Jolly Joseph's quit belly, it can be because technical Rambo happens all the time.

[02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:00.140]
Yes, especially on QAM.

[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:03.760]
Especially when a bunch of overgrown children are in there all weekend long,

[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.020]
poaching around and pushing switches and pulling and yanking and twisting.

[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:10.880]
Most important person in history at Porto is only a two horse race.

[02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:13.740]
You have their 203, Larry Flut 167.

[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.060]
I don't watch Porto 72.

[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:16.160]
10% of this audience.

[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:17.860]
They ain't in the Porto.

[02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:18.540]
You believe that?

[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:19.180]
No.

[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:19.760]
You buy it?

[02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:20.360]
Yeah, I do.

[02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:21.280]
Really?

[02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:23.560]
Actually, I have only a limited interest.

[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:25.480]
I see.

[02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:28.340]
Well, see, it's the other thing.

[02:25:28.540 --> 02:25:29.980]
At least the first 50,000 of them.

[02:25:30.060 --> 02:25:32.700]
Everyone has a different definition of what Porto is.

[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:35.540]
So maybe by their definition, they're not into it.

[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:38.740]
Because the JC Penney catalog can count as Porto defend.

[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:40.520]
For the series catalog, that's the case to use.

[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:40.760]
Right.

[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:41.840]
You still write in the outskirts.

[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:45.760]
So it depends on what you're talking about when you mean Porto.

[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:47.360]
How many QAM, hello?

[02:25:48.020 --> 02:25:49.360]
New guys, this is your shot.

[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:50.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:51.740]
How are we doing?

[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:55.240]
All right.

[02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:58.380]
Listen, I'd like to ask your opinion on something.

[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:03.240]
And it is about the collection agencies.

[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:07.400]
But the agencies that will pay for you, your debts,

[02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:09.080]
and the only pay-aportion.

[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:11.840]
Don't they pay what?

[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:12.940]
They pay.

[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:15.580]
The person that owes X dollars.

[02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:18.040]
This company will pay for you.

[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:18.820]
You pay them.

[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.240]
And the...

[02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:21.700]
You can pay.

[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:22.000]
Okay.

[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:22.960]
Whatever you say.

[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:25.960]
567, like I said, my mental health used to be pretty good.

[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:27.300]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:30.620]
QAM.

[02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:32.060]
Hit it again.

[02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:33.100]
Hola.

[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:35.180]

[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:36.920]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:38.320]
Hello.

[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:43.300]
From Error Records, you know what?

[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:43.740]
You know what?

[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:46.160]
What do you think will happen with Error Records?

[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:47.040]
We're on!

[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:47.960]
We're on!

[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:49.400]
I don't think and I don't care.

[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:55.140]
567, 0560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:56.060]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:26:57.220 --> 02:26:57.820]
QAM, hello.

[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:00.280]
Okay, me, what are you doing?

[02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:00.940]
Okay.

[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:03.000]
Hey, Daniel, I was...

[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.660]
I wasn't really going to go to the...

[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:07.520]
Sorry to see you guys, but you know, I'm going to change my mind,

[02:27:07.620 --> 02:27:10.100]
because I really need to see who these crazy are.

[02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:11.200]
So I can identify them.

[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:13.700]
If I see them on the street, I walk the other way.

[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:16.600]
You guys will be able to help me on that?

[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:18.340]
Yeah, okay.

[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:25.440]
567, 0560, pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:27:25.660 --> 02:27:26.340]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:27.820]
Hello, it's one cup.com.

[02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:29.180]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:30.340]
I'm a year.

[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:31.000]
I'm a year.

[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:31.700]
Yeah.

[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:36.080]
Yeah, that's a pretty rural revolution, isn't it?

[02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:38.480]
Wow, my grandma started watching that video and she's been dead.

[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:42.580]
No spin zone, Fox Bliviator, Bio-Ablow Vieter.

[02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:46.500]
Bill O'Reilly has some video tape floating around from his inside edition days posted on

[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:47.660]
Fark.com.

[02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:51.980]
Apparently, his legendary Irish temper is real as he lifts the segment produces a word and

[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:55.140]
objection will exit script for O'Reilly to announce Stings Like a Single.

[02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:57.460]
The Furbians too, O'Reilly, do it Tizzy.

[02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:01.440]
O'Reilly at age 21 went to Miami and taught high school English and returned to Boston,

[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:04.900]
earned an MA in broadcast journalism from Boston University in 1976.

[02:28:05.300 --> 02:28:09.560]
During this time, O'Reilly cut his teeth without a tamer reporting for various Boston and Miami news outlets.

[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:14.360]
O'Reilly's early TV news career had a bouncing between Dallas Hartford, Connecticut and Boston Mass.

[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:19.100]
O'Reilly became part of ABC News as a cross-bottom for ABC World News tonight, 86.

[02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:23.040]
In 1989, O'Reilly joined the nationally syndicated program inside edition.

[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:29.420]
In 1995, O'Reilly was hired by Roger Ailes, Chairman and CEO of VIN Startup Fox News Channel to make

[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:33.200]
a O'Reilly report to show soon move to a new time slot and was being in the O'Reilly factor.

[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:34.760]
Why am I reading this?

[02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:35.760]
What is this supposed to prove?

[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:36.420]
I don't know.

[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:41.520]
In this inside edition, Krib Bil goes through several takes and finally loses his mind, explodes and screams,

[02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:43.620]
Effet, do it live, I'll write it and we'll do it.

[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:45.820]
Effing, the whole effing thing sucks, whatever.

[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.560]
Why are we supposed to be shocked by the...

[02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:48.860]
I don't know.

[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:48.960]

[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:49.540]
I'm supposed to be shocked.

[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:51.360]
I had to send it along.

[02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:54.720]
WNQA, I am Hello.

[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:55.480]
Any other I don't?

[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:58.180]
Another you're going to be around for the next five years.

[02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:00.000]
What is Krib Bil, don't you be doing?

[02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:00.940]
Playing the bathroom.

[02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:01.980]
So is Goya?

[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:07.580]
Yeah.

[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:10.960]
Krib Bil.

[02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:12.900]
Now Krib Bil is going to be taking my job.

[02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:15.100]
He's going to be doing the squat radio here on a day.

[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:16.860]
Effet, do you weigh him? Hello.

[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:19.520]
I'm Neil.

[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:20.320]
Yes sir.

[02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:22.380]
I took a seat.

[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:23.200]
Thanks.

[02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:24.900]
Effet, do you weigh him? Hello.

[02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:28.780]
I don't know. I want to take a picture of the WNQA.

[02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.460]
I don't think so.

[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:31.260]
Who?

[02:29:31.620 --> 02:29:31.780]
Who?

[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:31.980]
Who?

[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:32.080]

[02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:33.000]
Who is Neil?

[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:33.220]
Who?

[02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:37.240]
And who is it?

[02:29:38.140 --> 02:29:39.020]
Who is Neil? Hello.

[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:41.520]
Is this Neil Rajasasha?

[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:42.160]
Yes sir.

[02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:44.000]
Is that Oslo speaking ill?

[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:45.800]
Yes sir.

[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:46.540]
Oh Neil.

[02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:46.780]
Hey.

[02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:48.940]
I'm Kair Monk. I'm already on.

[02:29:49.380 --> 02:29:52.500]
I just curious enough you will wear that there is a real place called Slimey's and Marguay.

[02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:54.020]
Slimey's kosha bakery.

[02:29:54.220 --> 02:29:54.980]
Get out of here.

[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:55.860]
I'm not buying.

[02:29:57.380 --> 02:29:58.620]
Slimey's kosha bakery.

[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.060]
You speak of the old Roman bakery in Margate.

[02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:04.800]
It's in the 6500 block of West Atlantic Boulevard.

[02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:06.880]
I just can't ask that enough thinking about you.

[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:09.780]
And I know there was people's talks about smoomy's.

[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:10.540]
How you spell it?

[02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:13.500]
SCH-L-L-I-M-I-E-S.

[02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:16.840]
How else would you spell it, George?

[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:18.540]
Well, because it's not coming up.

[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:22.600]
It's at one block west of Margate Middle School.

[02:30:22.620 --> 02:30:23.860]
Okay, well I'll take your word for it.

[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:28.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, and the Verizon singular wireless line.

[02:30:28.120 --> 02:30:33.380]
These calls just keep getting better and better and more unintelligible.

[02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:33.920]
It's great.

[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:37.320]
But at least we're, let's see, are we streaming?

[02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:39.240]
We did have a whole bunch of dropouts on that again.

[02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:41.800]
Oh, just 15, but we're spaxed streaming again.

[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:42.360]
Thank God.

[02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:43.040]
Thank the Lord.

[02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:44.980]
Somebody QA M-Hero?

[02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:46.300]
Neil.

[02:30:46.940 --> 02:30:47.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:48.700]
Yeah, I'm feeling bad.

[02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:50.720]
Some of those calls you've been getting earlier to joke.

[02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:54.580]
I'm glad you're allowing the calls, but the shame they can't come up with better stuff.

[02:30:56.420 --> 02:30:57.380]
Hey, what's that?

[02:30:57.380 --> 02:30:58.340]
They won't.

[02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:00.500]
Yeah, after all these years.

[02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:07.200]
The thing we had earlier about Clinton, and I think you said she's like 10, 20 million

[02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:07.680]
dead.

[02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:08.480]
20.

[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:13.300]
And yeah, I mean, is that an example of what she's going to do as president?

[02:31:13.580 --> 02:31:15.660]
I mean, we've got how much debt she'd, what do you do?

[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:17.100]
Bar that from China or something?

[02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:17.620]
Right.

[02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:21.360]
Well, already borrowing all that money from China, someone had another fee billion.

[02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:23.820]
Yeah, she's setting a great example.

[02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:29.180]
But also the fact that I hope they really don't consider putting her as DPM.

[02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:30.900]
Okay, George, phone is ringing.

[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:31.380]
Grab it.

[02:31:31.600 --> 02:31:33.000]
Okay, go get it.

[02:31:34.640 --> 02:31:35.840]
Oh, he's going to go grab it.

[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:36.200]
Great.

[02:31:37.980 --> 02:31:39.060]
Wasn't ready for this crap.

[02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:41.020]
How's it going there, Greg?

[02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:42.260]
I don't even have anything to promote.

[02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:46.560]
You know, last week when he kept going out here, I had some events coming up for the

[02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:46.780]
weekend.

[02:31:47.660 --> 02:31:53.760]
Well, I mean, obviously, obviously, but I mean something that he wasn't normally going

[02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:55.260]
to be promoting because he wasn't going to be down here.

[02:31:55.380 --> 02:31:56.720]
You think he cares about the Americans?

[02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:57.920]
Like, was it like with literacy festival?

[02:31:58.220 --> 02:31:58.380]
No.

[02:31:58.780 --> 02:31:59.400]
No, I don't know.

[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:00.120]
Who was that?

[02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:03.460]
That was my financial guy who should know that I'm on the year right now.

[02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:04.980]
That's how much he knows about what I do for living.

[02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:09.100]
And I said, I'm on the year right now, Michael.

[02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:12.280]
And you, oh, okay, call me when you're off to here, like that.

[02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:14.400]
Oh, my God.

[02:32:14.480 --> 02:32:17.700]
This is a day I should have just been there just no question about it.

[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:21.400]
You know, well, you could have said, wait, you could have said, hey, I could have driven

[02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:24.740]
about a quarter of the way and turned around and called me up and say, hey, I'm stuck

[02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:25.060]
in traffic.

[02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:26.000]
I can't get to the right.

[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.380]
I had to just walk the quarter of the way from my bedroom in this room here and turn

[02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:30.000]
around on my back.

[02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:31.260]
There's a big car.

[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:32.940]
I could have moved my way back to the traffic.

[02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:34.920]
WDQ, way in.

[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:35.160]
Hello.

[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:36.240]
Hey, Neil.

[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:36.680]
How you doing?

[02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:37.500]
Okay, sir.

[02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:40.060]
I was wondering how to, what find there?

[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:45.360]
Did they switch to just like Vegas did where when you play the slots, you'll get cash

[02:32:45.360 --> 02:32:45.880]
out of the machine.

[02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:47.220]
They give you a little slip of paper.

[02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:48.000]
Oh, sir.

[02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:51.380]
That's been going on for a long, long time.

[02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:52.540]
That's not something new.

[02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:54.960]
You know, that kind of takes the fun away from you.

[02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:55.760]
No, no, it does not.

[02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:57.800]
It takes all the crap off your hands.

[02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:00.080]
All that black and schmutz and dirt off your hands.

[02:33:00.300 --> 02:33:02.380]
You have to go wash your hands 50 times while you're playing.

[02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:03.860]
Yeah, but I love that.

[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:06.700]
You have to wait for them to keep refilling the machine because it's out of coins.

[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:09.520]
You got any ice in the pitch you can play there?

[02:33:12.580 --> 02:33:13.180]
WDQ, way in.

[02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:13.440]
Hello.

[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:15.220]
Hey, Neil.

[02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:16.040]
Let's put up here.

[02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:17.940]
I took the jams.

[02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:19.420]
WDQ, way in.

[02:33:19.480 --> 02:33:19.660]
Hello.

[02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:23.500]
Hey, I just, uh, let me go to the show and pull out.

[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:24.280]
Get in the pool.

[02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:25.360]
I get in the pool.

[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:27.820]
If you gotta get better, Neil, get out later.

[02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:29.480]
What's the point of winning the calls?

[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:30.180]
You gotta get better.

[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:31.060]
Yeah, you get in.

[02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:33.140]
Yeah, let's get a pool of moon or whatever.

[02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:34.580]
We're not going to happen, sir.

[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:37.460]
This is these are the callers of South Florida every day.

[02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:41.360]
Today, last week, a week from circus every day, it's never going to change.

[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.220]
It's going to take you the day off before, guy.

[02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:44.300]
Yeah, I should have.

[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:45.040]
I know.

[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:45.460]
All right.

[02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:46.140]
Sam.

[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:47.400]
I'm hanging.

[02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:48.580]
I'm going to QAM.

[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:49.200]

[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:50.680]
Hello.

[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:51.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:54.820]
Yeah, I called you a couple months ago, sir.

[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:55.680]
Mm-hmm.

[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:00.180]
And I told you about all that reading and how the ratings are going to drop.

[02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:00.860]
Yeah.

[02:34:00.980 --> 02:34:03.700]
And now the book has come out and your ratings did exactly the way.

[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:07.380]
And now all these great calls like you are going to let us write back up there again.

[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:08.620]
Now you're really going to be supportive.

[02:34:08.620 --> 02:34:11.360]
I was telling the call earlier about 790s a second.

[02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:12.960]
I'll leave these two in the ratings.

[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:16.660]
Well, if you keep taking these calls, you're really going to fool through the roof.

[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:17.340]
Yeah.

[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:21.440]
And I wish you that's left on your outings, that resource.

[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:22.260]
I'm dying.

[02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:23.220]
Okay.

[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:24.460]
What is it?

[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:26.800]
I hope you do good.

[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:27.460]
I should.

[02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:28.740]
You're outing at the goal.

[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:29.360]
My outing.

[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:30.920]
I'm going to be outing at my appearance.

[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:31.180]
Yeah.

[02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:31.920]
My outing.

[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:32.820]
Coming up.

[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:34.960]
QAM.

[02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:35.180]
Hello.

[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:36.020]
Related.

[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:37.300]
Yes.

[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:38.380]
I'm in here.

[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:39.260]
I'm in here.

[02:34:39.260 --> 02:34:39.500]
Hmm.

[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:40.400]
QAM.

[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:40.620]
Hello.

[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:43.620]
QAM.

[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:48.240]
Going once.

[02:34:48.860 --> 02:34:49.380]
Hello.

[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:50.120]
Yes.

[02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:53.280]
Is your cleaning lady in taco coming?

[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:54.440]
Come on, QAM.

[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:54.620]
Hello.

[02:34:58.980 --> 02:34:59.500]
QAM.

[02:34:59.720 --> 02:34:59.720]

[02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:00.820]
Come on, QAM.

[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:00.820]

[02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:01.780]
Come on, QAM.

[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:02.200]
Hello.

[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:02.540]
QAM.

[02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:02.740]
Hello.

[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:03.760]
Come on, QAM.

[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:03.760]

[02:35:03.780 --> 02:35:06.560]
Are you going to give any tips today on the spot cheese?

[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:07.720]
On what?

[02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:08.980]
Play it a spot.

[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:10.680]
Any tips?

[02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:11.840]
Yeah.

[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:12.640]
My best tips?

[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:13.180]
Don't.

[02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:13.980]
That's my tip.

[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.040]
Any tips on the spot?

[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:16.800]
And it...

[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:18.920]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:23.100]
So when you want to pick up your tape, if you get some of that money you get a little bit

[02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:24.880]
ahead and take it and run out, run to the door.

[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:27.800]
Run past security, run as fast as you can.

[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:30.560]
Run out to the door, go get your car and drive away.

[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:32.020]
That's my suggestion.

[02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:39.980]
The most important person in the history of PORNO is 7-18, both you have to 2-04, Laurie

[02:35:39.980 --> 02:35:47.060]
171, those two. Everybody else, small taters. Randy West got three votes so aren't you impressed?

[02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:49.900]
No. WQA and Hello.

[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:52.600]
QA and Hello.

[02:35:55.580 --> 02:35:56.460]
WQA and Hello.

[02:35:58.240 --> 02:35:59.840]
Yes. How you doing?

[02:36:00.380 --> 02:36:00.600]
Okay.

[02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:04.180]
You've been doing all these talks from these warrants and areas.

[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:07.520]
It's been 25 years. How long are you going to keep up with it?

[02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:09.220]
Another six.

[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:12.540]
I don't have better solution for you.

[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:12.920]
Yeah.

[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:16.020]
Why don't you do that young man and settle down?

[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:20.960]
Great idea.

[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:23.800]
Oh yeah. Go get you one. Maybe two.

[02:36:24.020 --> 02:36:24.020]

[02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:27.380]
Uh-oh. I'm learning to break him when I sit here waiting for knocking on the door.

[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:34.360]
Get named the best out of this new largest 40-560 QAM.

[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:36.220]
They're fourth leader.

[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:52.340]
This is I with this new.

[02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:55.180]
Let me put an obama turning up the heat in their TV ads.

[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:57.680]
We put them back to back. Let's run this weekend right now.

[02:36:58.020 --> 02:37:00.020]
I'm Barack Obama and I proved this message.

[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:02.940]
We use papers called Hillary Clinton's negative attacks.

[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:04.220]
The old politics.

[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:05.600]
She just she smells.

[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:08.200]
Oh god. She flooded it with down my throat.

[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:10.700]
She screamed grunted and pooped on the table.

[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:14.680]
Well, Ruma has it that she wears a sausage in her pants.

[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:15.260]
Oh, dear.

[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:17.000]
I said she's a total degenerate.

[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:20.100]
She's obviously too unstable and too mentally incompetent.

[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:21.900]
She does make it jumpy jack.

[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:23.900]
She does have a mean case in man face.

[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:25.280]
I have it on Kodothoar.

[02:37:25.380 --> 02:37:26.820]
He said she said too.

[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:28.240]
Did she's Kuko pants?

[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:30.960]
I'm Hillary Clinton and I proved this message.

[02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:33.180]
He couldn't answer tough questions in the debate.

[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:34.580]
He's very dirty.

[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:37.140]
He's covered with germs and he could make you very sick.

[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:39.920]
He's all less than smells like an obese man's to see.

[02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:41.040]
He's your bitch, isn't he?

[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:41.580]
He's your bitch, isn't he?

[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:41.820]
He's in.

[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:45.620]
Georgia's currently out of the room.

[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:48.200]
Oh, don't tell me Georgia's doing another doose.

[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:49.880]
I believe that's what it is.

[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:51.000]
Oh my god.

[02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:51.980]
This is just unbelievable.

[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:55.860]
Anyway, a Roman Catholic priest was indicted Wednesday morning.

[02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:57.740]
On one misdemeanor kind of sexual imposition,

[02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.320]
an incident that led to his resignation

[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:03.140]
as the pastor of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Mami, Ohio.

[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:04.280]
Mami.

[02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:07.820]
The charge was handed down against the Reverend Frank Murd

[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:10.560]
by Lucas Categranguri and Stems from the Lodgeson

[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:13.840]
that occurred March 18 in a hot tub at the Toledo YMCA.

[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:18.660]
So Vainia Township Police investigate the accusation against Father Murd 65

[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:21.380]
would have been pastor St. Joseph since July 2003

[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:23.360]
before his resignation earlier this month.

[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:26.020]
Bishop Leonard Blader may have led into April 10

[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:28.500]
to St. Joseph parishioners stating that Father Murd had

[02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:30.040]
informed his office earlier this week

[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:32.820]
that he was under investigation for an accusation involving an incident

[02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:35.480]
of improper sexual contact with a teenage male

[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:37.760]
in the men's locker room at the YMCA.

[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:40.160]
The victim had just finished playing handball

[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.300]
at the handball courts while in the men's locker room

[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:44.920]
he was removing his clothing as well as an athletic supporter.

[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.040]
When Murd approached the male asking the teenager

[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:48.060]
if he might have the garment,

[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:50.160]
the victim asked him if he needed it to work out.

[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:51.840]
Witnesses claim Murd responded,

[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:53.820]
they just wanted to sleep with it under his pillow

[02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:56.860]
and then he attempted to grab at the genitain of the teenager

[02:38:56.860 --> 02:38:59.660]
as YMCA start members arrived in some dude Murd

[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:00.800]
and called the police.

[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:03.260]
They said, dude, the father.

[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:05.300]
How do you like that?

[02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:05.680]
All right.

[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:06.860]
Oh, you're back.

[02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:07.320]
Oh yeah.

[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:08.880]
Don't tell me another uh, Joyce?

[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:09.880]
Yeah.

[02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:10.320]
Yeah.

[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:11.620]
Oh my god.

[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:12.420]
Oh my god.

[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:13.700]
There was a log jam on the river.

[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:15.880]
Serious pilot.

[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:22.120]
It's a good thing you didn't get lost on the way back.

[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:23.820]
You blocked in traffic.

[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:25.100]
Well, that took the same route.

[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:26.720]
Somebody at QAM.

[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:27.040]
Hello.

[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:28.080]
On the table.

[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:29.280]
QAM.

[02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:29.580]
Hello.

[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:30.960]
Hello.

[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:31.940]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:34.020]
Yeah, me and Mark Bailer.

[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:34.560]
Oh man.

[02:39:34.860 --> 02:39:36.360]
I was just stock over my mouth.

[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:36.580]
Yeah.

[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:36.960]
Okay.

[02:39:37.240 --> 02:39:37.700]
Reven puts.

[02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:39.640]
Somebody QAM.

[02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:39.920]
Hello.

[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:42.620]
Uh, yeah.

[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:44.740]
Common uh, change request.

[02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:46.740]
Uh, you know, comment.

[02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:48.300]
Randy Rose last week on your show.

[02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:50.980]
Comrade, was that on my show last week?

[02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:53.040]
Last week, Randy Rose on first show.

[02:39:53.460 --> 02:39:53.700]
Mm-hmm.

[02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:54.760]
I'm in it that uh,

[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:57.600]
shows a whole entire career to you.

[02:39:57.960 --> 02:39:59.080]
We're promoting her.

[02:39:59.500 --> 02:39:59.700]
Yeah.

[02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:00.260]
Thank you.

[02:40:00.580 --> 02:40:00.840]
Yeah.

[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:02.860]
And um, change request.

[02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:05.220]
That bit the one if you can't play it on, uh,

[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:09.840]
where Norma Kent uh, is uh, promoting careers and only what

[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:11.180]
what is buying silky hands.

[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:14.520]
Well, you got to think for no less at it.

[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:16.640]
Uh, uh, I just like that bit.

[02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:21.660]
Uh, is your one man abused in the workplace?

[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:23.600]
Yeah, that's well, that's enough of it.

[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:24.540]
It's uh, pretty weak.

[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:26.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6.

[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:28.600]
I like the other one where he's ordering the 85 uh,

[02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:30.600]
burger or combos and whatever.

[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:30.840]

[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:33.320]
That was more true to life, I think.

[02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:34.820]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:36.060]
Neil.

[02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:36.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:39.220]
I'd beat the door to one giving them a for uh,

[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:39.580]
slimy.

[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:42.600]
Say it on the air, man.

[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:43.300]
Email.

[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:44.140]
Something like that.

[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:45.180]
Yeah, slimy.

[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:46.540]
Uh, 95th floor.

[02:40:47.620 --> 02:40:48.180]
95th floor.

[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:49.440]
Well, wait a minute.

[02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:51.320]
This guy can't have any kind of a number of people.

[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:53.180]
I've been you going to put it on the air and then dump it.

[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:54.640]
I didn't dump it.

[02:40:54.700 --> 02:40:55.480]
I just chopped it off.

[02:40:55.640 --> 02:40:55.880]
Okay.

[02:40:56.840 --> 02:40:58.520]
I searched every spelling I could.

[02:40:58.680 --> 02:40:59.140]
They didn't come up.

[02:40:59.180 --> 02:40:59.840]
And there's no slimy.

[02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:00.580]
It's pretty easy.

[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:02.480]
And even if they were, what difference is it made?

[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:02.700]
Right.

[02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:04.300]
What difference does it make?

[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:04.700]
Okay.

[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:05.600]
So we could go there.

[02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:07.240]
This guy's trying to tell us.

[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:08.120]
I have no luck that.

[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:09.120]
Oh, I got somebody other.

[02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:11.380]
We got that roaster's and toaster's place to check out in

[02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:13.920]
Myrins and Poppano Park and that famous deli in

[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:14.340]
Vancouver.

[02:41:14.340 --> 02:41:15.200]
I'm going to have one.

[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:16.140]
I'm going to be there four days.

[02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:17.320]
I'm going to have like 600 meals.

[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:18.040]
There you go.

[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:18.860]
Like the old days.

[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:20.020]
Yeah, that's right.

[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:21.620]
Like a good old days.

[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:23.420]
W-2-A-M. Hello.

[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:25.160]
I'm miss my friend.

[02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:26.480]
W-2-A-M. Hello.

[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:27.860]
Hi, Rob.

[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:29.460]
Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:33.640]
Q-A-M. Yes.

[02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:37.740]
Hey, these uh, county commissioners on here, bunch of crooks.

[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:40.080]
They're uh, they're letting uh,

[02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:42.680]
they're letting those uh, building a wetlands.

[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:44.640]
Yeah.

[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:46.240]
They're extending the uh, the boundary.

[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:47.520]
The uh, development.

[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:48.580]
How unusual.

[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:51.880]
Yeah, I know it's not a newsflash, but maybe uh,

[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:53.260]
you could help us out down here.

[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:55.120]
How, how do you want me by doing what?

[02:41:55.560 --> 02:41:56.300]
Publicize it.

[02:41:57.120 --> 02:41:57.900]
And then what?

[02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:00.700]
Yeah.

[02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:02.420]
Get out of here.

[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:03.680]
Get a life you putz.

[02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:06.380]
Nobody Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:07.020]
I can't see.

[02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:07.580]
I can't see.

[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:09.120]
Q-A-M. Hello.

[02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:11.020]
Hey Neil, how are you?

[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:11.920]
Okay.

[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:13.860]
I did the poor bus.

[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:15.240]
I don't see you at the end last night.

[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:16.120]
The Hockey Nightingale.

[02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:18.820]
Dan Kelly's only been dead for 20 years.

[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:20.840]
You're an idiot.

[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:27.080]
Yeah, that's the uh, the hockey, the hockey announcer guy.

[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:33.740]
Nice again, but actually the penguins look like they missed the ting bus to the uh, igloo.

[02:42:34.740 --> 02:42:37.400]
They didn't show up early too, but they did a lot of ballet dancing.

[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:40.660]
A lot of uh, ace of teacon and kind of uh, dancing in circles.

[02:42:40.660 --> 02:42:42.400]
We'll see how figure skating figure rates.

[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:42.720]
Oh.

[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:44.860]
I've got this mission.

[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:50.020]
Here in this labor-intensive blue collar state, Hillary Clinton's message plays well.

[02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:58.460]
We're going to get rid of any provision in the tax code that gives a penny to anybody who exports a job out of West Virginia.

[02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:02.020]
And at the American Region Lodge in Huntington.

[02:43:02.500 --> 02:43:03.080]
Choose a fighter.

[02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:04.600]
You'll find a fighter.

[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:05.060]
All of it.

[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:08.360]
Now there, there was a swillery supporter of Fever Solon.

[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:08.540]
Yeah.

[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:12.940]
He was his red neck he's a command that musters and that red cap on me.

[02:43:13.020 --> 02:43:14.100]
She's a fighter.

[02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:15.960]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:17.520]
Yes, Sui.

[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:19.580]
What is it?

[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:21.100]
Like he said, Sui.

[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:22.620]
Oh, QAM, hello.

[02:43:22.860 --> 02:43:23.240]
Wrong show.

[02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:24.580]
Wrong show, Schmuck.

[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:26.100]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:29.020]
Yeah, can I have some tickets for the morning?

[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:30.900]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:43:34.460 --> 02:43:34.980]
Hola.

[02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:37.320]
Hello?

[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:38.160]
Yes.

[02:43:38.680 --> 02:43:39.080]
Daniel.

[02:43:39.380 --> 02:43:39.640]
Daniel.

[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:42.260]
So I'm supposed to pee in a golf bag?

[02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:44.760]
No, I'm a golf bag in a golf club.

[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:46.640]
They have the spots coming up listen carefully, okay?

[02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:48.060]
In your case you won't be able to.

[02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:50.940]
You have to have a f*** in order to do that.

[02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:51.620]
Let's have an Audi.

[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:53.820]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:43:54.900 --> 02:43:56.600]
Shouldn't it be a crossby guy?

[02:43:57.360 --> 02:43:57.620]
Yeah.

[02:43:58.040 --> 02:43:59.000]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:02.240]
QAM, hello.

[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:08.340]
Yes, hi.

[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:09.120]
Hi, Neil.

[02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:11.800]
This is Bruce Kelly and I owe my entire career to you.

[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:13.400]
Yeah.

[02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:15.780]
And.

[02:44:18.820 --> 02:44:20.460]
Is that the guy that got candid magic?

[02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:21.380]
Is that supposed to be a...

[02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:22.260]
I don't know what.

[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:22.880]
I don't know.

[02:44:23.020 --> 02:44:23.720]
Like I'm going to say what's one of those.

[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:24.760]
He's in the position to the stuff.

[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:25.620]
Nobody QAM, hello.

[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:28.760]
QAM.

[02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:30.160]
So.

[02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:31.840]
They're so slow to them.

[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:32.220]
And I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:33.440]
Tell us other things.

[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:33.680]
Yes.

[02:44:36.940 --> 02:44:37.500]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:41.320]
Hey, Neil, show up for buying your ass.

[02:44:43.100 --> 02:44:43.660]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:47.340]
Yeah, what is the exact one I have against you that was running negative things

[02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:47.860]
about you?

[02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:49.720]
He didn't write any negative things.

[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:51.160]
He said the waiting sucked and they did.

[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:52.040]
So what's wrong with that?

[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:55.000]
Yeah, and about the new contract you have and all that.

[02:44:55.280 --> 02:44:57.080]
Those are some of the files because he...

[02:44:57.080 --> 02:44:58.660]
No, that was Tom Jikker that wrote that.

[02:44:59.080 --> 02:44:59.620]
Oh, okay.

[02:45:00.380 --> 02:45:01.960]
Get your goofball straight.

[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:04.940]
WDQAM, hello.

[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:07.740]
QAM, hello.

[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:11.880]
Neil, why are you lowering yourself putting these collars on?

[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:13.740]
What would you like me to do?

[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:15.320]
Well, do your best.

[02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:16.980]
Come on, put the collars on.

[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:18.240]
You know, you're waiting to drop.

[02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:20.580]
I don't think this is not going to drop.

[02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:22.220]
What?

[02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:24.360]
You're waiting to drop.

[02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:26.840]
I think it's because you started to think of phone calls.

[02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:29.940]
No, we're taking in phone calls during their waiting.

[02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:31.900]
During the winter book, we were taking any phone calls.

[02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:32.500]
Not none.

[02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:32.940]
Zero.

[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:35.360]
Well, do you actually think it's going to help do something?

[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:35.680]
None.

[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:36.800]
Zero.

[02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:38.640]
Well, what do you think this is going to do?

[02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:40.420]
I beg your pardon?

[02:45:40.900 --> 02:45:41.960]
What do you think this is going to do?

[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:44.200]
You're going to put it on the bottom of the spectrum.

[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:44.960]
And?

[02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:48.920]
Well, is that going to affect my paycheck?

[02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:51.300]
No, you'll put your paycheck the same.

[02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:53.180]
But come on, there's a big difference between us,

[02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:53.960]
hopping bottom.

[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:55.440]
Yeah, I know that.

[02:45:55.980 --> 02:45:56.840]
That's what I've heard.

[02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:57.620]
I've heard tell.

[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:02.220]
I'm a EQA-M, hello.

[02:46:02.380 --> 02:46:04.480]
I know that you're a cop, but I'm a deal.

[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:05.120]
Yes.

[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:08.580]
Would you please, please, read a bedtime story?

[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:09.400]
No chance.

[02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:11.840]
I've read a couple in there when we were having all of our

[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:12.540]
technical difficulties.

[02:46:12.820 --> 02:46:13.160]
I've read a couple.

[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:14.460]
A couple of good ones.

[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:16.780]
I'm a EQA-M, hello.

[02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:18.780]
The police are standing in my...

[02:46:18.780 --> 02:46:20.960]
In fact, then, the audio is interesting because the audience

[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:22.540]
wanted the collars back.

[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:24.580]
You know what you people remind me of?

[02:46:24.580 --> 02:46:26.540]
You're like, a little kid who doesn't know what he wants.

[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:27.300]
That's my father.

[02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:30.140]
His whole life, till the day they stuck him in the ground.

[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:31.100]
He never knew what he wanted.

[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:32.780]
He slept into Israel.

[02:46:32.980 --> 02:46:34.000]
He's coming to Florida.

[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:35.000]
He's slept it over here.

[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:35.940]
He's slept in back there.

[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:37.120]
He never knew what thought he wanted.

[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:40.040]
And that's what the audience is like in South Florida,

[02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:40.940]
besides crazy.

[02:46:42.340 --> 02:46:44.180]
If you read bedtime stories,

[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:45.640]
oh, we want the phone calls.

[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:46.680]
That's where the entertainment

[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:48.300]
and then he put these bozos on here.

[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:50.600]
Oh, my God, please, read us a story.

[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:51.500]
Do anything.

[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:57.320]
And then we get emails from Jolly Jovell

[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:00.180]
or text messages about telling you a liquid bitch in your IO.

[02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:01.980]
Equipment malfunctions.

[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:05.620]
I mean, the more you really think about that,

[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:07.460]
the more outrageous, not acceptable it is.

[02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:08.900]
I know what you think I don't.

[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:09.120]
What?

[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:10.200]
Good thing I don't think about it.

[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:10.660]
Are you out too?

[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:10.980]
You're not dead?

[02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:12.060]
No, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:12.920]
It's just stereoty ceiling.

[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:14.280]
I mean, it's like I'm a little wild.

[02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:16.080]
No, stop thinking about that a long time ago.

[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:16.920]
Really?

[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:17.380]
Yeah.

[02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:18.200]
Why is that?

[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:19.280]
Because I work here.

[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:21.180]
Oh, that's right.

[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:22.540]
You've got your big meeting with Jolly Jove.

[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:23.000]
Come it up.

[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:23.760]
You want to mess?

[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:23.940]
Yeah.

[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:25.380]
You need to get me answered.

[02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:26.320]
Chorged dialogue here.

[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:29.480]
Fourth leader.

[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:45.880]
Unfortunately, he has adopted his children

[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:47.600]
worse football team.

[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:52.020]
The way they played the season made everybody scream.

[02:47:52.020 --> 02:47:56.460]
It seems to be that losing has always been their goal

[02:47:56.460 --> 02:48:00.940]
And every game they play should be called the Super Bowl

[02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:08.340]
And they're the Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins numbers

[02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:10.620]
How many teams in the league 32?

[02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:15.160]
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins

[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:18.300]
If you're their fandulous single blues

[02:48:20.980 --> 02:48:25.620]
The Dolphins had jammed Camperon and one thing that I learned

[02:48:25.620 --> 02:48:29.960]
He had the fans all wishing that Nick Saven would return

[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:34.520]
If you'd be fused a winner then you have lost your mind

[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:38.520]
The next thing he'll be coaching is beyond employment

[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:41.900]
Why then there's Miami Dolphins

[02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:46.380]
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins numbers

[02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:48.820]
How many teams in the league 32?

[02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:53.280]
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins

[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:56.160]
There's something you spray off your shoes

[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:03.360]
The Dolphins have jammed back a rookie quarterback

[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:08.020]
If you think he's the answer you must be smoking crack

[02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:12.520]
You know they could have gotten someone good like Brady Quinn

[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:16.920]
The way they waste their drafts is nothing but a sin

[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:22.340]
They're the Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins

[02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:26.580]
Miami Dolphins numbers, how many teams in the league 32?

[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:31.260]
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins

[02:49:31.260 --> 02:49:34.120]
Their talents don't have a clue

[02:49:37.620 --> 02:49:41.500]
The Dolphins games are boring when they're on the radio

[02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:45.960]
And everyone was put to sleep by Jimmy Sapporo

[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:50.760]
When he's calling play by play it's the same old juice

[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:55.580]
And just so manage had a job on Sunday afternoons and there

[02:49:56.100 --> 02:50:00.500]
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins

[02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:04.980]
Miami Dolphins numbers, how many teams in the league 32?

[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:09.280]
Miami Dolphins, Miami Dolphins

[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:12.660]
I hear the fans begin to snooze

[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.700]
I sing the ointes of Dolphins

[02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:19.860]
He's hired to help ourselves

[02:50:19.860 --> 02:50:24.160]
And I don't have to tell you the way the tune of smells

[02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:26.540]
They say he'll solve the problems

[02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:28.540]
I wish him lots of luck

[02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:31.340]
No matter what he tries to do

[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:33.580]
The team will always smoke in there

[02:50:33.580 --> 02:50:36.060]
The Miami Dolphins

[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:38.380]
Miami Dolphins

[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:40.420]
Miami Dolphins numbers

[02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:42.420]
What the hell, 32?

[02:50:43.880 --> 02:50:45.120]
Miami Dolphins

[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.800]
Miami Dolphins

[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:50.520]
Miami Dolphins

[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:52.500]
Now they're through

[02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:02.840]
148 at 5.60 WQAM

[02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:05.180]
12 minutes till 1, we got the drill till 2

[02:51:05.180 --> 02:51:06.540]
Did I say 12 minutes till 1?

[02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:07.740]
I don't know you said

[02:51:07.740 --> 02:51:09.800]
Oh my god, no I don't need her, I'm in coherent

[02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:12.120]
But at least we got the audio back

[02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:13.700]
Oh my god

[02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:16.020]
Now have you ever had that happen to you?

[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:17.760]
I don't know how that would happen

[02:51:18.220 --> 02:51:18.720]
What's that?

[02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:21.000]
We're like I dropped out, I'm dropping out

[02:51:21.920 --> 02:51:24.120]
I'm sure it has happened before

[02:51:25.700 --> 02:51:26.500]
It's maddening

[02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:27.300]
It's like that

[02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:31.260]
There are days when it's just ever so intermittent

[02:51:31.260 --> 02:51:33.820]
You know like maybe once per segment will be a dropout

[02:51:33.820 --> 02:51:35.840]
And you know your heart will skip a beat

[02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:38.280]
Like oh my god, yeah, that's how I feel right now

[02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:41.500]
5.670560.560 and they've arisen

[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:43.280]
And singular wireless lines

[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:45.320]
WQAM, hello

[02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:46.340]
Nail

[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:47.220]
Yes

[02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:49.500]
You still shot that came out in plantation?

[02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:50.720]
No

[02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:53.300]
There is no more cameart in plantation

[02:51:54.340 --> 02:51:55.520]
What about in Toronto?

[02:51:56.340 --> 02:51:57.320]
What about what?

[02:51:58.020 --> 02:51:58.620]
What about what?

[02:51:58.980 --> 02:52:00.500]
Oh this is the wardrobe guy

[02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:03.680]
You don't stop at cameart?

[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:05.420]
WQAM, hello

[02:52:08.520 --> 02:52:08.920]
QAM

[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:10.560]
Yes, this is Neil

[02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:11.320]
Yes

[02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:14.040]
I'm Neil Godman, I haven't spoke to you for a long time

[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:15.380]
Here you go, here's your chance

[02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:18.560]
Here's your chance to be our one wheel color today

[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:19.220]
I doubt it

[02:52:19.220 --> 02:52:24.500]
I was actually at your 13th anniversary party at 610 WIOD

[02:52:24.500 --> 02:52:28.440]
With Joey and Paul Harvey Jr. at the Orange States guy

[02:52:28.960 --> 02:52:30.820]
Oh but it was great, I just want to let you know

[02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:32.400]
When you come down here Saturday

[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:35.300]
You're going to realize why you moved the heck out of this place

[02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:36.140]
I know that

[02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:38.100]
I mean it's just like good God

[02:52:38.100 --> 02:52:41.460]
If it wasn't for the weather like you said I'd be long gone

[02:52:41.460 --> 02:52:45.600]
If it wasn't for the weather there wouldn't be anybody there except those people you're talking about

[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:50.980]
Yeah, yeah and it's just because I used to listen to you with Zeta, the bird captain, I mean a chem-days

[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:51.860]
Oh God

[02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:55.120]
And you just play KJ, I worked with that guy

[02:52:55.120 --> 02:52:56.220]
He's a great guy

[02:52:56.220 --> 02:52:56.920]
He is

[02:52:56.920 --> 02:53:00.920]
I've also got a picture of you when we were in the studio and I

[02:53:01.880 --> 02:53:05.880]
I'm going to avoid seeing you Saturday because you probably kicked me out of there anyway

[02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:06.860]
What is that?

[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:11.180]
Well I don't know, that day I was down there, you know who was in the studio

[02:53:12.220 --> 02:53:14.260]
The guy that laughed so I got a gilper

[02:53:14.260 --> 02:53:15.420]
I mean it was like this

[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:15.600]
Yeah

[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:18.940]
But yeah, I mean I don't want to be related to him

[02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:20.540]
Okay

[02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:22.080]
I've been listening, I love you man

[02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:26.280]
You're the best and the town's not going to be the same when you retire

[02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:27.980]
Yeah, when I retire in 20 years right

[02:53:28.480 --> 02:53:32.080]
20 years, you're right, but listen to me, I love you, I just might cheat Saturday, I might not have you

[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:33.180]
Ha ha ha ha

[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:38.940]
Okay, okay hold your hand up and say I'm the guy to call him threatened not to show up

[02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:43.740]
Whose idea was this stupid thing, this appearance whose idea was it?

[02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:45.760]
I don't know probably it started with sales, don't they always?

[02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:48.560]
I think it was Jolly Jovel

[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:50.500]
Oh we're going to make a big production out of a deal

[02:53:50.500 --> 02:53:51.240]
Ha ha ha ha

[02:53:54.680 --> 02:53:57.240]
Until this morning until he sent you that text message

[02:53:57.240 --> 02:54:01.660]
I never realized when an impediment to my enjoyment of life that man is I mean I knew it

[02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:06.640]
But I never fully realized I'm gonna say you were the one that was telling me way back when my way

[02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:10.880]
Yeah, but I was arguing such terms. I mean not as in total impediment to your enjoyment of life

[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:16.800]
I mean what kind of a message is that tell Neil to quit bitching

[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:18.420]
Technical crap happens

[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:24.140]
Like this is my first job in a business or my first week being on the year or crap like that

[02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:26.960]
Maybe it's just funny. Yeah, no, he was not

[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:31.160]
Oh, if that was an attempted humor man, what's all the time you say show start maybe two to four?

[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:35.580]
Let me go that's what that the fat ass Jolly Joar. I would not only listen to what I would call in

[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:37.000]
It's the Joe show

[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:41.260]
I would call in every day is me or what what would you say?

[02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:45.200]
Hey, yeah, hey, Joe. Yeah, say Joe

[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:48.220]
That's what I would do. Yeah

[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:53.860]
In fact, I think we ought to force him to do it. I

[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:54.980]
Think it's an excellent idea

[02:54:56.480 --> 02:54:58.000]
WDQ AM not well

[02:54:59.460 --> 02:55:00.640]
WDQ AM hello

[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:09.040]
Yeah, yeah, look for me. I'll be the one bear and I'll go find you

[02:55:13.420 --> 02:55:14.280]
WDQ AM hello

[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:18.380]
In the Jolly Joe show. Oh my god

[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:20.260]
WDQ AM hello

[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:22.800]
Yeah, uh, Gary Fox and JJ

[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:25.100]
